Johnson led police on a car chase that ended in a nearly catastrophic accident. Mr. Johnson was arrested and taken to the hospital. As medical personnel removed his clothing, police discovered a large quantity of heroin in his underwear. He was charged and ultimately convicted in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County of possession of heroin, volume possession of heroin, and attempting to elude a police officer. The court sentenced him to fourteen years' imprisonment, the first five without the possibility of parole under Maryland Code (2002, 2012 Repl. Vol. 2018 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7 5-612 of the Criminal Law Article (\"CR\"), which mandates a minimum sentence of five years without the possibility of parole for a volume heroin conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Mr. Johnson appeals on two grounds.\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , he argues that his sentence was illegal, and\n   <em>\n    second\n   </em>\n   , that the heroin found in his clothing was admitted improperly at trial because the State failed to establish the chain of custody sufficiently. We find the trial court properly exercised its discretion on both issues and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Officers Vicarini\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Brian Trussell were conducting a routine patrol when they noticed a silver Acura that had unusually darkly tinted windows. The officers stopped the Acura with lights and sirens, but as they began to exit their patrol car to approach, it sped off. The officers pursued the vehicle until they determined they could no longer do so safely, then abandoned the chase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When they saw the Acura again some time later, the officers followed the vehicle, this time without activating their lights or sirens. As they followed, though, the Acura crashed into another vehicle at an intersection. Both vehicles were crushed badly; the Acura was torn literally in half. The officers approached the scene of the crash and found Mr. Johnson, the Acura's sole occupant, trapped inside and injured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Emergency responders extracted Mr. Johnson from the vehicle and transported him to a local hospital. Officer Sean Daley, who had responded to the crash site, accompanied Mr. Johnson to the hospital and was in the room as medical personnel removed Mr. Johnson's clothing, and searched the clothes\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   as they were removed. In Mr. Johnson's undergarments, Officer Daley found a \"large plastic bag containing an off while [sic] powder substance.\" Officer Daley held onto the bag, packaged it according to police evidence procedures, and returned to the precinct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mr. Johnson was charged with volume possession of heroin, possession of heroin with intent to distribute, simple possession of heroin, attempting to elude a police officer; failure to give insurance information to another driver after an accident,\n   and failure to exhibit his license to a police officer after an accident. At the close of the bench trial, the court granted a motion for judgment of acquittal as to the possession with intent to distribute, failure to give his insurance information,\n   and failure to exhibit his license charges. The court convicted Mr. Johnson of simple possession of heroin, volume possession of heroin, and attempting to elude an officer, merged his conviction for simple possession into the volume possession conviction, and sentenced him to fourteen years' imprisonment, the first five without the possibility of parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mr. Johnson argues\n   <em>\n    first\n   </em>\n   on appeal that his fourteen-year sentence is illegal because although CR \u00a7 5-612 provides for a mandatory minimum sentence, it does not state a maximum sentence and, therefore, failed to give him notice of a potential sentence beyond five years.

Mr. Johnson's Sentence Is Legal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Mr. Johnson's argument that his sentence is illegal hinges on a threshold finding that the statute under which he was convicted, CR \u00a7 5-612, is ambiguous. If statutory language is \"clear and unambiguous when construed in accordance with its ordinary and everyday meaning, then this Court will give effect to the statute as it is written.\"\n   <em>\n    Alston v.

Although it establishes a mandatory minimum sentence (and removes the court's discretion to suspend any portion of it), \u00a7 5-612 does not establish a maximum sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Mr. Johnson contends that absence of a maximum sentence renders \u00a7 5-612 ambiguous and, from there, that its legislative history suggests that the sole intended penalty for a violation is five years' imprisonment without the possibility of parole. In other words, he argues that the minimum and maximum sentences for violating CR \u00a7 5-612 are one and the same. To find otherwise, he claims, would violate Mr. Johnson's Fourteenth Amendment Due Process rights and the rule of lenity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   At the time Mr. Johnson filed his opening brief, we had not yet decided\n   <em>\n    Carter v.

As\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   explained, section 5-612 first appeared not as a stand-alone offense, but rather as a sentence enhancement designed to \"punish more severely persons who engage in the manufacture or distribution of a high volume of drugs.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Wheeler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1187821\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/118/142/#p148\">\n    118 Md.

At that time, a defendant who was convicted of possession with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance (\"CDS\") would be sentenced in accordance with the enhancement provision if he possessed the specified threshold quantity or more. This threshold distinguished kingpins from smaller scale drug dealers by both creating a mandatory minimum sentence for high-volume possessors and eliminating the possibility of parole for the first five years of his total term of imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In its original 1989 form, the statute, then codified at Maryland Code Article 27, \u00a7 286, provided that if a person possessed CDS in \"sufficient quantity to reasonably indicate under all circumstances an intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense,\" it was \"mandatory upon the court to impose no less than 5 years' imprisonment, and neither that term of imprisonment nor any part of it could be suspended.\" In the 2002 codification of the Criminal Law Article, the text remained substantively the same and was re-codified at CR \u00a7 5-612.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2005, \"to avoid running afoul\" of the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Blakely v.

And, moreover, the historical language of the statute\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   include mere possession of a threshold quantity of CDS as a trigger to the mandatory minimum sentence: \"it is unlawful for any person ...

Had that been the General Assembly's intention, it could have eliminated the word 'minimum' from the statute, which implies a variety of options beginning\n   at a given, minimum, point. Mr. Johnson's reading of 'minimum' would strip trial judges of their very broad sentencing discretion in this context and provide no leeway to account for the factual differences between cases.\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

He was also on notice that the violation of the statute would result in an automatic\n   <em>\n    minimum\n   </em>\n   penalty of five years' imprisonment, and from a due process perspective, it doesn't matter that the statute didn't cap the potential punishment.

The sentence complied with the mandatory minimum in CR \u00a7 5-612, and in the absence of a specific maximum, was consistent with the recommendations of the State based on the sentencing guidelines, the severity of Mr. Johnson's offense and the circumstances surrounding it, and Mr. Johnson's extensive\n   criminal record of drug-related convictions and violations of probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

At trial, the State called Officer Daley, who testified about how he searched Mr. Johnson's clothes as the medical team removed them:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Once we arrived, he was taken into the, the trauma section of the hospital at Sinai .... [Doctors and nurses are] evaluating his condition and all those other things and as part of that they\n   removed clothing while I was there .... As they removed those pieces of clothing, I searched them because he was in custody, he was under arrest, search incident to arrest, I searched his belongings as they came off of him. When it got to his undergarments, it was removed, as I searched it, a large plastic bag containing an\n   off while [sic] powder substance was found in the crotch area of his undergarments.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The State then sought to admit the bag of powder into evidence and defense counsel objected:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Chain of custody. There's been some testimony that the nursing staff was, had some connection to this bag and nobody from the hospital's nursing staff has been called yet.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The court initially reserved the question to allow Mr. Johnson the opportunity to cross-examine and develop his argument. On cross-examination, Officer Daley reiterated that the nurse removed Mr. Johnson's clothing in the hospital and that as each item was removed, he searched it, and that he ultimately found the plastic bag of heroin hidden in Mr. Johnson's underwear. After Officer Daley's testimony, the State renewed its request to admit the bag of powder into evidence and Mr. Johnson, again, objected. The trial court admitted the bag into evidence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   [B]ased on the testimony I've heard so far, I am satisfied that the chain of custody has not been breached. There has been no testimony that anyone other than Officer Daley touched the suspected [CDS] at the time of recovery so there has been no evidence of any interruption in the chain of custody, that he recovered and that he submitted it for submission to the Evidence Control Unit so I'm going to overrule your objection\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Mr. Johnson points to Maryland Code (1974, 2013 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 10-1003 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\"CJP\"), which requires the State to produce any person in the chain of custody as a prosecution witness upon the defendant's written demand. But Mr. Johnson does not indicate that he made any such written request, nor does the record reveal one. And the State offered testimony from each of the individuals in the \"chain of custody\" defined in CJP \u00a7 10-1002,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"(i) [t]he seizing officer; (ii) [t]he packaging officer, if the\n   packaging officer is not also the seizing officer; and (iii) [t]he chemist or other person who actually touched the substance ... before or during the analysis of the substance.\" Officer Daley was both the seizing and packaging officer in this case. The forensic chemist who tested the contents of the bag and found that it contained heroin testified as well. And from those witnesses, the trial judge determined, appropriately, that no one other than Officer Daley had handled the bag of powder before it was packaged and submitted to the crime lab for analysis. The evidence permitted the trial court to find that that there was no gap in the chain of custody, and we see no error in the court's denial of Mr. Johnson's requests to exclude the evidence recovered at the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY AFFIRMED.
