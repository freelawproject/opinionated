The defendant Cooperative Educational Services\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   appeals from the\n   trial court's denial of its motion to dismiss on sovereign immunity grounds that portion of the operative complaint filed against it by the plaintiffs, Ashley Norris, a minor child acting through her mother and next friend, Bonita Wiggins, and Bonita Wiggins individually.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant claims that the court\n   improperly determined that the defendant's role in supervising students committed to its care and custody is a municipal function that is not shielded by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. We disagree and conclude that the court properly denied the defendant's motion to dismiss. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts, as alleged in or necessarily implied from the plaintiffs' complaint, and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the defendant's claim. On April 25, 2013, the minor plaintiff was enrolled at a school for children with special needs located in Trumbull and operated by the defendant, a regional educational service center established pursuant to \u00a7 10-66a. The school's staff was aware that, for her safety, the minor plaintiff needed to wear a gait belt at all times.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   That day, however, the minor plaintiff, who was participating in an activity being run and monitored by\n   the school, was walking with a staff member in the school's parking lot without her gait belt on when she suffered a seizure and fell to the ground, striking her face.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 20, 2015, the plaintiffs commenced the underlying action. The operative revised complaint was filed on August 17, 2015. Count three was the sole count directed against the defendant and sounded in negligence. According to the plaintiffs, the minor plaintiff fell due to the carelessness and negligence of the defendant, which allegedly had failed to take necessary precautions to properly supervise and ensure the safety of students in its care.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs alleged that, as a result of the defendant's negligence, the minor plaintiff suffered physical and emotional injuries, and that Wiggins was required to expend personal funds for her child's medical care. The defendant filed an answer denying all of the allegations of negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 13, 2016, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss count\n   three of the complaint on the ground that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the claims against it. Specifically, the defendant argued that, as a regional educational service center created pursuant to \u00a7 10-66a, it is a state agent and, therefore, has sovereign immunity in an action for money damages absent a proper waiver of sovereign immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Attached to the motion to dismiss was an affidavit from the defendant's executive director averring that the defendant was one of six regional education service centers established in this state in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 10-66a. Also attached were copies of the defendant's constitution and governing bylaws.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The plaintiffs filed an objection to the motion to dismiss on November 10, 2016, arguing that sovereign immunity did not apply to the defendant under the circumstances alleged. According to the plaintiffs, a review of the statutory scheme governing regional education service centers shows that those entities are not state agencies and do not act as agents for the state when overseeing children entrusted to their care. They instead, according to the plaintiffs, are separate and independent corporations formed by municipalities. Furthermore, the plaintiffs noted that amongst the enumerated powers given to the regional educational service centers by \u00a7 10-66c is the power \"to sue and be sued,\" which evinces a legislative intent that they are not state agencies shielded by sovereign immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The court,\n   <em>\n    Radcliffe, J.\n   </em>\n   , issued a memorandum of decision on January 30, 2017, denying the defendant's motion to dismiss. The court reasoned that after a regional education service center is formed by its constituent municipal or regional boards of education, it exists pursuant to \u00a7 10-66c (a) as a \" 'body corporate and politic,' rather than as an agency of state government.\" More particularly, the court explained that \"[b]ecause [the defendant] is governed by a board of directors chosen by the member boards of education, and accepts students from the boards of education, its actions regarding enrolled students are in lieu of the municipality in which the affected student resides. [The defendant] performs functions, and assumes responsibilities as to a given student, which would otherwise be those of the local or regional board of education.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The court acknowledged that sovereign immunity protections have been extended to entities that act on behalf of the state, and that the furnishing of public education is a state function. It noted, however, that municipal boards of education, despite being entrusted to perform a state function with respect to education, nevertheless act as an agent of its municipality, not the state, when performing that function and, thus, are not protected by sovereign immunity. Because the court concluded that a regional educational service center's role in the care and supervision of students entrusted to it is directly analogous to the role performed by local or regional boards\n   of education, the court concluded that regional educational service centers similarly cannot invoke sovereign immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the court\n   acknowledged that at least one other Superior Court considering the same issue had reached a contrary conclusion, it nonetheless held that \"[i]n the absence of any appellate authority, sovereign immunity will not be permitted to bar an action against a 'body corporate and politic,' charged with the care and custody of students by local boards of education, under circumstances in which the General Assembly has explicitly provided for the ability of the regional educational center to 'sue and be sued.' \" This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendant claims on appeal that the trial court improperly determined that the defendant was not entitled to invoke sovereign immunity. According to the defendant, express language exists in \u00a7 10-66c that demonstrates that the defendant operates as an agent of the state in fulfilling a state-mandated duty to provided special education services to the minor plaintiff and, therefore, sovereign immunity applies. We disagree. Like the trial court, we conclude that, for the purposes of this type of negligence action, the defendant was not acting as a state agent and, therefore, is not entitled to the protections of sovereign immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We begin with our standard of review and other applicable principles of law.

To establish that an entity is an arm of the state, an entity need not satisfy every criteria. Rather, [a]ll relevant factors are to be considered cumulatively, with no single factor being essential or conclusive.... We recognize that these criteria are somewhat interrelated and overlapping. For example, a determination that an entity is completely financially dependent on the state could lead to an inference that the entity is controlled by the state.

This criterion essentially has two subparts, namely, (1) whether the defendant was created by legislation and (2) whether such legislation included language indicating that the defendant be treated as a state agency. Our\n   review of the relevant statutes leads us to answer both questions in the negative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The formation of a regional educational service center unquestionably is authorized by state statute. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 10-66a through 10-66t. Section 10-66a provides in relevant part: \"A regional educational service center\n   <em>\n    may be established\n   </em>\n   in any regional state planning area designated in accordance with section 16a-4a upon approval by the State Board of Education of a plan of organization and operation submitted by four or more boards of education for the purpose of cooperative action to furnish programs and services....\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A careful reading of this enabling legislation, thus, reveals that the defendant was not \"created\" by statute. To \"create\" generally means to \"bring into existence.\" Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (11th Ed. 2003).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, the legislature, through its enactment, did not bring into existence the defendant or any other regional educational service centers. It merely authorized boards of educations in interested municipalities to join together to create such entities, albeit with approval by the State Board of Education. If no\n   municipalities exercise this statutory grant of authority, however, no regional educational service center would be created. Thus, it is patently incongruent with the plain language of the statute to conclude that the state \"created\" the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Furthermore, we can find no statutory language from which to conclude that the legislature intended entities like the defendant to be treated like a state agent for\n   all purposes, and we reject the defendant's argument to the contrary. Section 10-66c (a) provides in relevant part: \"A regional educational service center shall be a body corporate and politic. The board of a regional educational service center shall be a public educational authority acting on behalf of the state of Connecticut and shall have the power to sue and be sued, to receive and disburse private funds and such prepaid and reimbursed federal, state and local funds as each member board of education may authorize on its own behalf, to employ personnel, to enter into contracts, to purchase, receive, hold and convey real and personal property and otherwise to provide the programs, services and activities agreed upon by the member boards of education....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The defendant argues that \"the express language of ... \u00a7 10-66c demonstrates that [it] is an agent of the state ....\" The defendant focuses the thrust of its argument on the language in subsection (a) of \u00a7 10-66c that states that \"[t]he board of a regional educational service center shall be a public educational authority\n   <em>\n    acting on behalf of the state of Connecticut\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) The defendant asserts that \"acting on behalf of the state\" can only mean acting as an agent of the state and, thus, entitling it to assert the state's sovereign immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The defendant, however, places far more weight on this language than it will bear. Rather, as our Supreme Court has made clear, an entity might act on behalf of the state for some purpose and not others, and, thus, the existence of this language does little to advance the argument that the language could only have been intended to convey a blanket grant of sovereign immunity. Here, a plain reading of the language reveals only that a regional educational service center acts on behalf of the state when it exercises its duties as a \"public educational authority.\" This undefined language simply\n   begs the question because local boards of education also \"are agents of the state responsible for education in the towns ....\"\n   <em>\n    Palosz\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Greenwich\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12501974\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/194/885/#p207\">\n    184 Conn.

Nevertheless, local boards of education are not acting as agents of the state when they supervise children.

The fact that the legislation authorizes the defendant's board to act on behalf of the state, therefore, is not itself dispositive of whether the legislature also intended to treat the defendant as a state agency, entitled to all the rights and privileges of the state, including sovereign immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The plaintiff offers a reasonable justification as to why the legislature included the \"acting on behalf of the state of Connecticut\" language in the statute that has nothing to do with cloaking entities like the defendant in sovereign immunity. The \"acting on behalf of the state\" language was not in the statute when it initially was enacted in 1972. Rather, that language was added to subsection (a) as a technical change to the statute in 1987, at the same time the legislature added subsections (b) through (d), granting the regional educational service centers the power to issue bonds, notes or other obligations. Public Acts 1987, No. 87-460, \u00a7 1. The language \"acting on behalf of the state\" is best construed in light of those contemporaneous additions. Because the Internal Revenue Code excludes from gross income interest made on any state issued bonds; see\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20103\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (2012) ; it is reasonable to assume that the legislature intended to designate regional educational service centers as \"acting on behalf of the state\" in order to allow them to reap the benefit of selling tax-free bonds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The defendant's argument also fails to account for the language in the statute that immediately precedes the language authorizing a regional educational service center to act \"on behalf of the state,\" namely, the language designating such entities as a \"body corporate\n   and politic.\" We do not read statutory language in isolation, but rather must consider it within the context of the statute as a whole and in harmony with surrounding text. Rather than creating either a state or municipal agency, we construe the legislature's use of the language describing a regional educational service center as a \"body corporate and politic\" as intending to create an independent corporate entity that is separate and distinct from state government. See\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bridgeport Housing Authority\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"518953\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/208/161/#p173\">\n    208 Conn. 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 173,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=544%20A.2d%201185\">\n    544 A.2d 1185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988) (construing statute describing municipal housing authorities as \"body corporate and politic\"; General Statutes \u00a7 8-40 ; as creating independent corporate entity that is not agent of municipality in which it resides).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We turn next to the language that follows the \"acting on behalf of the state\" language, namely, that regional educational service centers have the \"power to sue and be sued.\" We agree with the trial court that this language supports a conclusion that the legislature intended that a regional educational service center would not enjoy sovereign immunity but, instead, would be subject to suit in the same manner as other entities that do not enjoy sovereign immunity. The language is not the type that the legislature typically would use if it intended that an entity be protected by sovereign immunity, which protects the state not only from liability but from being sued in the first instance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Arguably, the defendant, like a local board of education, is authorized to act for the state in its role as a provider of educational services to the citizens of the state. \"[T]he\n   <em>\n    furnishing of education\n   </em>\n   for the general public, required by article eighth, \u00a7 1, of the Connecticut constitution, is by its very nature a state function and duty....

Nevertheless, when it comes to overseeing the day to day care of students enrolled in one of its schools or other facilities, nothing in the enabling legislation expressly states or of necessity implies that regional educational service centers like the defendant stand in any different position than the municipalities that formed them and entrusted their students to them.

Subsection (i) of \u00a7 10-66c provides: \"A regional educational service center shall be considered\n   an agency of the state for purposes of subdivision (14) of subsection (d) of section 42a-9-109.\" The defendant ignores this language, however, likely because its existence undermines rather than bolsters the defendant's position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In subsection (i), the legislature expressly states that the defendant should be \"considered an agency of the state\" for purposes of applying an exclusion in the Uniform Commercial Code with respect to secured transactions, further details of which are not relevant to this discussion. \"[I]t is a basic tenet of statutory construction that [w]e construe a statute as a whole and read its subsections concurrently in order to reach a reasonable overall interpretation.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Planning &amp; Zoning Commission\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Freedom of Information Commission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=316%20Conn.%201\">\n    316 Conn. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 12-13,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20A.3d%20419\">\n    110 A.3d 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). Moreover, as we have already indicated, \"the legislature [does] not intend to enact meaningless provisions....

Construing the enabling legislation as a whole, we conclude with respect to the first of the\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   criteria\n   that the defendant has not demonstrated that it was created by the state or that the legislature intended that it be treated as a state agency with respect to its supervision of children attending its schools or programs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We turn next to the second criterion which asks whether the defendant \"was created for a public purpose or to carry out a function integral to state government ....\"\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    H.N.S.

To answer this question, we look to our statutes, the defendant's constitution and bylaws, and the factual admissions of the defendant at the hearing on the motion to dismiss. Article III of the defendant's constitution provides that the defendant consists of the member boards of education that pay dues to the defendant in accordance with Article IX. Article IX, titled \"Dues and Administration Expenses,\" provides\n   that the amount of dues are set every year by the defendant's representative council and that \"[a]ny necessary administrative and overhead expenditures as determined by the [r]epresentative council shall be shared jointly by the participating [b]oards of [e]ducation.\" At the hearing on the motion to dismiss, the court asked the defendant's counsel about the manner in which the defendant was funded, and counsel agreed with the court that the regional educational service centers are funded by the municipalities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   There is no dispute that, as a result of block grants, each municipality receives funds from the state for the purpose of discharging the educational requirements of its residents and that some of this money flows to the regional educational service centers. See General Statutes \u00a7 10-262h and General Statutes \u00a7 10-66j (b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   We do not view such indirect state funding, however, as making regional educational service centers \"financially dependent\" on the state. The defendant made no effort to demonstrate to what extent it relies on state funding and the record before us is silent as to what percentage, if any, of the regional educational service centers funding comes directly through block grants as opposed to funding through dues and tuition payments\n   by municipalities. Nevertheless, on the basis of the record presented and the defendant's own admissions, it is clear that the local board, and not the state, is directly responsible for much of the funding provided to the defendant for its services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   On balance, the third criterion weighs in favor of the plaintiffs.\n   We address together the fourth and fifth factors, namely, whether the defendant's \"officers, directors, or trustees are state functionaries\" and whether the defendant \"is operated by state employees ....\"\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    H.N.S.

The board of the regional educational service center may designate from its membership an executive board which shall have such powers as the board of the regional educational service center may delegate and which are consistent with this part.... The director of the regional educational service center shall serve as the executive agent of the board of the regional educational service center.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The defendant's constitution and bylaws, articles II and III, make clear that it is governed by a representative council that is made up of members from its constituent\n   local boards of education. Under article VI of the defendant's constitution, officers are chosen annually from among the members of the representative council. These requirements are statutorily mandated. See \u00a7 10-66b (\"[t]he operation and management of any regional educational service center shall be the responsibility of the board of such center to be composed of at least one member from each participating board of education, selected by such board of education\"). No one from the state Board of Education or any other \"state functionaries\" or state employees are \"officers, directors, or trustees\" of the defendant or are involved in the operation of the defendant's programs or services. The fourth and fifth criteria accordingly weigh against a finding that the defendant is an agent of the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Pursuant to the sixth and seventh\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   factors, we consider whether \"the state has the right to control the [defendant]\" or whether the defendant's \"budget, expenditures, and appropriations are closely monitored by the state ....\"\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    H.N.S.

As we already have indicated, the defendant is under the managerial control of the participating municipal boards of education that formed it. There is nothing in the record before us suggesting that the state has any direct oversight or control over the defendant, its property or its operations other than to conduct an annual audit of finances and evaluation of programs and services. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 10-66g and 10-66h. There is no requirement in the defendant's bylaws requiring that budgets, expenditures, or appropriations be reported to the state Board of Education for approval or that the state \"closely\" monitor its day-to-day operations at regional educational service centers. The lack of state involvement in the regular management of the regional education service centers leads us to conclude that the sixth and seventh criteria also weigh strongly against the defendant's position that it\n   is entitled to sovereign immunity because litigation could not seriously be expected to interfere with the performance of any important state function or its control over state instrumentalities, funds or property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Finally, we must consider whether \"a judgment against the [defendant] would have the same effect as a judgment against\n   the state.\"\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    H.N.S.

A finding of liability against the defendant in favor of the plaintiffs likely would result in an award of monetary damages. Such damages would be assessed against the defendant and would become an operating expense of the defendant that ultimately would be paid by the municipalities in accordance with article IX of the defendant's constitution. A judgment against the defendant would not have a direct adverse effect on the state. In contrast, a judgment against the state would mean that the state itself would be responsible for paying damages, presumably out of the state's coffers. This eighth criterion thus seems to weigh against concluding that the defendant is an agent of the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In sum, the majority of the\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   criteria weigh against a finding that the defendant is an entity entitled to the protections of sovereign immunity. Having considered and weighed the various\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   criteria, and considering them in light of the circumstances presented in this case, we conclude that the defendant acts as an agent of its constituent municipal boards of education, not the state, when overseeing the care and safety of children enrolled in its schools and programs. It truly would be a bizarre result to construe the relevant statutes as conferring sovereign immunity to the defendant, if, under identical facts, a municipality would not be so entitled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The present litigation simply cannot reasonably be viewed as representing the type of serious interference\n   with a state's function or control that justifies the \"strong medicine\" of sovereign immunity.
