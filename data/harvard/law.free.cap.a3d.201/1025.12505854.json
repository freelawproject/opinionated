The plaintiff, Lauren Wood, appeals from the trial court's dismissal of her August 25, 2015 amended complaint, which alleged one count of battery and one count of negligent infliction of emotional distress against the defendant, Thomas J. Rutherford, M.D.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff claims that the court improperly concluded that those counts sounded in medical malpractice and, thus, required compliance with\n   General Statutes \u00a7 52-190a. The plaintiff also challenges the propriety of the summary judgment rendered by the court on her February 8, 2016 revised complaint, which alleged that the defendant failed to obtain her informed consent before embarking on a course of treatment for a complication discovered during a postoperative examination. We agree with the\n   plaintiff that the court improperly dismissed the battery and negligent infliction of emotional distress counts of her August 25, 2015 amended complaint, as those counts were predicated on an alleged lack of informed consent. We further conclude that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether a substantial change in circumstances occurred during the course of medical treatment that necessitated a further informed consent discussion between the parties, rendering summary judgment inappropriate. We, therefore, reverse the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The operative complaints, the plaintiff's August 25, 2015 amended complaint and her February 8, 2016 revised complaint, contain similar factual allegations. In both, the plaintiff alleged that, at all relevant times, she was a patient of the defendant, a licensed gynecological oncologist. She further alleged that \"[o]n April 25, 2014, the plaintiff underwent a surgical procedure known as a CO\n   <sup>\n    2\n   </sup>\n   laser ablation\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the vulva [to remove precancerous growths] that was performed by [the defendant] at Yale University Gynecologic Center .... On May 14, 2014, upon the advice of [the defendant], the plaintiff returned to Yale University Gynecologic Center for a postoperative examination. During the postoperative examination ... [the defendant] discovered that the plaintiff's labia [were] agglutinated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   During the postoperative examination ... [the defendant],\n   <em>\n    without any warning or notice to or consent from the plaintiff\n   </em>\n   ... forcefully inserted his fingers through the plaintiff's agglutinated labia and into her vagina.\" (Emphasis added; footnotes added.) The plaintiff further alleged that she sustained injuries as a result thereof, including \"scarring and impairment to her vulva and vagina ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The plaintiff commenced this action in 2015. Her August 25, 2015 amended complaint contained two counts against the defendant that alleged that his conduct during the postoperative examination constituted battery and negligent infliction of emotional distress. In response, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss, in which he argued that \"regardless of the caption applied to them by the plaintiff, both of the claims ... are for medical malpractice. As such, the plaintiff is required by [\u00a7] 52-190a\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   to attach to the complaint a\n   good\n   faith certificate and written opinion letter. The plaintiff's failure to attach these documents is fatal to her claim and mandates that it be dismissed.\" (Footnote added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The court heard argument from the parties on that motion on October 19, 2015, at which the plaintiff's counsel acknowledged that the plaintiff had consented to the postoperative examination on May 14, 2014, but not to the defendant forcefully separating her agglutinated labia without warning or notice to her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff's counsel emphasized that, in her complaint, the plaintiff did not \"allege that there was a deviation of the standard of care.... We don't allege negligence in this case.\" Counsel then stated that count one of the complaint \"is not a negligence case. Count one is a battery case, and the theory of battery as a basis for recovery\" against the defendant was his failure to obtain informed consent. Counsel continued: \"We don't claim negligence at all. Our claim here is that [the plaintiff] had no knowledge ... and was not informed ... and didn't consent to [the defendant] sticking his fingers into her vagina the way he did ....\" In response, the court stated in relevant part: \"[Y]ou certainly have every right to plead that this was a surgical procedure, that there was a lack of informed consent and, as a result of a lack of informed consent, the plaintiff sustained damages .... That you can do. You can't transform\n   ... what amounts to a medical negligence or malpractice claim into a tortious action for purposes of circumventing \u00a7 52-190a....\" The court then made an express finding that the three factors determinative of whether a negligence claim sounds in medical malpractice\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   all were satisfied. The court thus granted the motion to dismiss \"without prejudice to the plaintiff filing a separate action claiming a lack of informed consent ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nine days later, the plaintiff requested leave to amend her complaint pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 10-60, which the court granted. The plaintiff thereafter filed an amended complaint claiming that the defendant had failed to obtain her informed consent before embarking on a course of treatment for a complication that he discovered during the postoperative examination. More specifically, the plaintiff alleged in her February 8, 2016\n   revised complaint that the defendant's actions during the postoperative examination \"violated his duty to provide the plaintiff with information that a reasonable patient would have found material for making a decision to embark upon the course of treatment performed by [the defendant] in that: (a) [the defendant] failed to inform the plaintiff as to the nature of the procedure he performed because he did not give her any warning or explanation of said procedure; (b) [the defendant] failed to disclose any risks and hazards of the procedure; (c) [the defendant] failed to discuss any alternatives to the procedure he performed where, upon information and belief, other procedures were available; and (d) [the defendant] failed to disclose any anticipated benefits of the procedure he performed.\" In his answer, the defendant admitted that, while conducting the postoperative examination, he discovered that the plaintiff's labia were agglutinated. He further admitted that \"during the postoperative examination, [he] separated the skin of the labia by inserting a finger through the agglutination.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant otherwise denied the\n   substance of the plaintiff's lack of informed consent claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 3, 2016, the plaintiff filed a certificate of closed pleadings with the trial court, in which she claimed a jury trial. The defendant filed a motion for summary judgment on November 15, 2016, arguing that \"[t]here is no triable issue of fact ... because the incident in question-the separation of agglutinated labia during a postoperative examination of the plaintiff's\n   vagina-was not a 'procedure' requiring consent. Even if it [was], the plaintiff consented to [the defendant] performing the vaginal exam, which necessarily included separating her labia to observe the surgical site.\" That motion was accompanied by three exhibits, including the defendant's November 4, 2016 affidavit and his August 17, 2016 responses to the interrogatories of the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 23, 2017, the plaintiff filed an objection to the motion for summary judgment, arguing that the defendant, after discovering the complication during the postoperative examination, \"performed an invasive procedure, which constitutes a course of treatment triggering a physician's duty to inform.\" The plaintiff noted that the \"cases that find a course of treatment that triggers a physician's duty to provide informed consent share the fact that they involve the physician providing, or attempting to provide, a therapeutic remedy to the plaintiff. The mechanism of the treatment itself is not important, but rather, the key element is that a medical treatment was provided.\" Because the defendant provided a medical treatment to remedy her labial agglutination, the plaintiff argued that he was obligated to\n   apprise her of \"any material risks or alternatives\" prior to embarking on that course of treatment. In support of her assertion that the defendant provided a medical treatment, the plaintiff appended to her objection (1) a copy of her answers to certain interrogatories, (2) affidavits of the plaintiff and her mother, Janice Andersen, and (3) copies of five Superior Court decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendant filed a reply to the plaintiff's objection on February 1, 2017, in which he maintained that the plaintiff's consent to the laser ablation procedure included her consent to the postoperative examination, as that examination was \"not a separate course of therapy from the operation.\" The defendant further submitted that \"[t]he uncontroverted evidence shows that [he] had to separate the plaintiff's labia, which were agglutinated, in order to examine the surgical site.\" A copy of the plaintiff's signed consent to the laser ablation procedure was included as an exhibit to that reply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The court held a hearing on the motion for summary judgment on February 6, 2017, at which the defendant's counsel contended that the May 14, 2014 postoperative examination did not involve a procedure of any kind. The court then inquired as to whether the plaintiff's counsel had \"any authority that says that this type of thing is a procedure\"; counsel responded that there was \"nothing in Connecticut that says that this ... is or is not a course of treatment under the standard [set forth] in\n   <em>\n    Logan\n   </em>\n   [v.\n   <em>\n    Greenwich Hospital Assn.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"682782\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/191/282/#p292\">\n    191 Conn. 282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 292,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=465%20A.2d%20294\">\n    465 A.2d 294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983) ].\" The plaintiff's counsel nevertheless argued that, after discovering the labial agglutination, the defendant failed to disclose to the\n   plaintiff the nature of the course of treatment he ultimately undertook to resolve that medical complication. Counsel reminded the court that the affidavits submitted by the plaintiff and Andersen in opposition to the motion for summary judgment both indicated that the defendant told them that he performed the digital separation of the agglutination \"to avoid having to go into the operating room\" to resolve that complication.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Counsel\n   then rhetorically asked what the difference was between a course of treatment in an operating room and a course of treatment in an examination room, before stating: \"[T]he take home message is that the form of treatment is not what's important. It's that the doctor ... and the patient embark on a course of treatment, and the patient has to go into it with open eyes, and that just didn't happen here.\" The plaintiff's counsel concluded his remarks by noting that the defendant \"provided a treatment. [The plaintiff's] labia [were] fused together, and he separated [them]. There certainly is some evidence that [separation] could have been done in an operating room, and maybe it should have. [The plaintiff] deserves to be able to explore that. And certainly if [the defendant] can refute that, that's fine, but it's an issue of fact to be decided in this case by the trier of fact ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   When those arguments concluded, the court stated that it \"makes a finding that the activities of [the defendant], in examining the surgical site following a surgical procedure which took place three weeks earlier, is not a procedure which would give rise to the duty to inform the plaintiff that a certain portion of the examination of the surgical site might induce pain and [to conclude otherwise] would extend the definition of a surgery\n   far afield. Under\n   <em>\n    Logan\n   </em>\n   [v.\n   <em>\n    Greenwich Hospital Assn.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"682782\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/191/282/#p292\">\n    191 Conn. at 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=465%20A.2d%20294\">\n    465 A.2d 294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ], informed consent deals with a procedure, an operation or surgery. This was not an operation. It was not surgery. It was not a procedure in and of itself. It was, rather, part of another examination for which the [defendant] received the written consent of the plaintiff. So, the motion for summary judgment is granted.\" Accordingly, the court rendered judgment in favor of the defendant, and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We first consider the plaintiff's challenge to the dismissal of her August 25, 2015 amended complaint against the defendant. Although that complaint contained counts labeled battery and negligent infliction of emotional distress, the trial court determined that, despite the nomenclature employed by the plaintiff, those counts both sounded in medical malpractice. As a result, the court held that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the strictures of \u00a7 52-190a required dismissal of those counts due to lack of personal jurisdiction. That determination warrants closer scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"When a ... court decides a ... question raised by a pretrial motion to dismiss, it must consider the allegations of the complaint in their most favorable light.... In this regard, a court must take the facts to be those alleged in the complaint, including those facts necessarily implied from the allegations, construing them in a manner most favorable to the pleader.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    CitiMortgage, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gaudiano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12416094\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/142/440/#p441\">\n    142 Conn.

It alleges in relevant part that, during the postoperative examination, the defendant \"without any warning or notice or consent from the plaintiff, intentionally, wantonly and/or forcefully inserted his fingers through the plaintiff's agglutinated labia and into her vagina.\" Count one further alleges that the defendant's conduct \"constituted a battery in that his actions were harmful and/or offensive to the plaintiff\" and concludes by alleging a variety of injuries that the plaintiff sustained as the \"result of the harmful and/or offensive conduct\" of the defendant. In dismissing that count, the court concluded that those allegations constituted a claim of medical negligence on the part of the defendant, which necessitated compliance with \u00a7 52-190a. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As the plaintiff emphasized at the hearing on the defendant's motion to dismiss, and as the complaint plainly indicates, her battery claim was predicated on the lack of informed consent.

Rather, it more properly is construed as one derivative of the plaintiff's battery claim, for it concerns her general theory\n   that the defendant lacked informed consent to digitally separate her agglutinated labia. For that reason, the court improperly granted the defendant's motion to dismiss due to noncompliance with \u00a7 52-190a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Normally, our determination that a motion to dismiss was improperly granted would conclude our inquiry. In the present case, however, the court granted the motion to dismiss without prejudice to the plaintiff's pursuit of an action against the defendant for lack of informed consent. After filing a notice of intent to appeal from that dismissal; see footnote 7 of this opinion; the plaintiff then obtained permission from the court to file an amended pleading, on which the court ultimately rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendant. The plaintiff now challenges the propriety of that determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly concluded, as a matter of law, that she could not prevail in an informed consent action because the defendant's conduct in separating her agglutinated labia was not a separate procedure or course of treatment giving rise to a duty to obtain informed consent. She contends that a substantial change in circumstances occurred when the defendant discovered a complication during the postoperative examination that required medical intervention, which in turn obligated the defendant to obtain her informed consent before proceeding further. The parties agree that this issue is one of first impression in Connecticut.

The court continued: \"A physician is under a duty to treat his patient skillfully but proficiency in diagnosis and therapy is not the full measure of his\n   responsibility.... [T]he physician is under an obligation to communicate specific information to the patient when the exigencies of reasonable care call for it.... The context in which the duty of risk-disclosure arises is invariably the occasion for decision as to whether a particular treatment procedure is to be undertaken. To the physician, whose training enables a self-satisfying evaluation, the answer may seem clear, but it is the prerogative of the patient, not the physician, to determine for himself the direction in which his interests seem to lie.

When consent is provided by a patient in a given case, its scope necessarily is limited to the course of treatment outlined by the medical practitioner, and encompasses only those risks, hazards, alternatives, and anticipated benefits then disclosed. For that reason, when a truly substantial change arises during the course of treatment that meets the standard of materiality under our law,\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   we agree that the medical practitioner generally is obligated to obtain consent from the patient before proceeding further.

For that reason, a physician's duty to secure informed consent is not an absolute one, but rather is contingent on\n   the particular context in which it arises. To accommodate the exigencies inherent in the practice of medicine, courts have crafted exceptions to the physician's general duty that excuse the failure to obtain such consent in certain circumstances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   See generally\n   A.

The rationale for that exception is that the patient who is aware of the risks that accompany a particular procedure or course of treatment already is an informed patient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Application of the doctrine of informed consent, therefore, involves more than simply an examination of the communications, or lack thereof, between physician and patient. It also requires consideration of the context in which the physician's duty arose. That context is crucial to the determination of whether an exception to that duty is implicated. Moreover, in an action predicated on an alleged lack of informed consent, \"[t]he burden of proving an exception to [the] duty\" rests with the physician.\n   <em>\n    Scott\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bradford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10447770\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/606/554/#p558\">\n    606 P.2d 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 558 (Okla. 1979) ; see also\n   <em>\n    Canterbury\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Spence\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"709527\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/464/772/#p783\">\n    464 F.2d at 791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[t]he burden of going forward with evidence pertaining to a privilege not to disclose ... rests properly upon the physician\" [footnote omitted] );\n   <em>\n    Cobbs\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Grant\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2321912\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-3d/8/229/#p245\">\n    8 Cal. 3d at 245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=104%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20505\">\n    104 Cal.Rptr. 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=502%20P.2d%201\">\n    502 P.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (physician bears \"the burden of [proving] justification for failure to disclose\");\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <em>\n    Shine\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Vega\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"142787\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/429/456/#p464\">\n    429 Mass. at 462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=709%20N.E.2d%2058\">\n    709 N.E.2d 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the [defendant physician and hospital] had the burden of proving that an exception relieved them of tort liability\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   3\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Accordingly, we conclude that, when a substantial and material alteration of the risks, anticipated benefits, or alternatives previously disclosed to the patient occurs during a course of medical treatment, the doctrine of informed consent generally requires an additional informed consent discussion between physician and patient.

We begin by noting what is not in dispute. Years prior to the medical treatment at issue in this appeal, the defendant performed a laser ablation of the plaintiff's vulva to remove precancerous growths. Prior to performing that procedure on August 25, 2011, the defendant discussed the procedure with the plaintiff and she signed a consent form so indicating. After the procedure concluded, the plaintiff was provided lidocaine gel as a preventative measure to avoid labial agglutination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant\n   at that time cautioned the plaintiff that \"she should quit smoking or else she would end up needing the procedure again.\" Weeks later, the defendant conducted a postoperative examination of the surgical site to ensure that it was healing properly. No complications were discovered during that examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   When precancerous growths later returned, the plaintiff again consulted with the defendant. The defendant discussed the laser ablation treatment with the plaintiff, who then signed a standardized consent form. That form stated in relevant part that the defendant \"has explained to me in a way that I understand: (a) the nature and purpose of the procedure(s); (b) the potential benefits and risks of the procedure(s) including bleeding, infection, accidental injury of other body parts, failure to permanently improve my condition or, death, as well as the potential risks and benefits of the medications that may be administered to me as part of\n   the procedure; and (c) the alternative(s) to the procedure(s) and their potential risks and benefits, including the option of not having the procedure.\" The consent form also authorized the defendant \"to do whatever may be necessary if there is a complication or unforeseen condition during my procedure.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The defendant performed a second laser ablation to remove precancerous growths on the plaintiff's vulva on April 25, 2014. When that procedure concluded, the plaintiff again was provided with lidocaine gel and was advised to schedule a postoperative examination \"so that [the defendant] could examine the surgical site and make sure that it was healing properly.\" The defendant conducted that examination approximately three weeks later, on May 14, 2014. Four individuals were present at that examination: the plaintiff, the defendant, Andersen, and an unidentified nurse. It is undisputed that the plaintiff consented to the postoperative examination. See footnote 17 of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   After arriving at the Yale University Gynecologic Center, the plaintiff undressed and placed her legs in stirrups. The defendant began his examination with a visual inspection of the plaintiff and then informed her that \"everything looked fine.\" The parties disagree as to precisely what happened next.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In her operative complaint, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant discovered the labial agglutination \"during\" the postoperative examination; the defendant admitted the truth of that allegation in his answer. The plaintiff further alleged that the defendant at that time embarked on a course of treatment for that complication without first obtaining her informed consent. More specifically, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant \"forcefully inserted his fingers through [her] agglutinated labia\" without informing her of \"the nature of the procedure,\" its \"risks and hazards,\" its \"anticipated\n   benefits,\" and \"any alternatives [when] other procedures were available ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In his November 4, 2016 affidavit, the defendant described what transpired during the postoperative examination as follows: \"I informed [the plaintiff] that I was going to examine her vagina.... In order to observe the surgical site, I had to separate [her] labia. As I did so, she yelped in pain. At that moment, I realized that her labia had become agglutinated. I apologized for causing her pain, and I continued with the examination.... Agglutination, which is the partial fusing of skin, can occur after laser ablation surgery. It occurs at the surgical site, which in [the\n   plaintiff's] case, was on the interior of her labia. Because of that location, there was no way for me to know if [her] labia were agglutinated before trying to separate them to examine the surgical site.\" He continued: \"If labia are agglutinated two weeks after laser surgery, they must be separated. Generally, the agglutination at that point is mild, and it can be done in a split-second using a finger. This is the least intrusive and most effective way of separating agglutinated labia.\" In his August 17, 2016 response to the plaintiff's first set of interrogatories, the defendant stated that although \"[m]ore severely agglutinated labia may require a surgical procedure,\" the plaintiff's labia were not agglutinated \"to the degree that ... require[d] treatment or procedure.\" The defendant also acknowledged that, \"[a]fter discovering that [the plaintiff's] labia were agglutinated during the examination, I discussed with her that her labia had agglutinated as a result of her laser ablation surgery.... I informed her that she had agglutinated labia that required separation. I told her I was sorry that I hurt her by separating her agglutinated labia.\" As he did in his affidavit, the defendant stated in his response to interrogatories that he \"did not know that [the plaintiff's] labia were agglutinated until [he] separated them to perform [the] postoperative examination.\"\n   In opposing the motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff provided a different account of those events. In her sworn affidavit, she stated: \"[W]hen the defendant entered the room, he said that he was going to take a look at me, and further stated that everything looked fine.... Then, without warning, [he] forcefully inserted his fingers into my vagina, separating an agglutination ... of my labia, which caused me severe pain.... I cried out in pain as a result of the defendant inserting his fingers through the agglutination, and [he] expressed his concern that I may pass out as a result.... The defendant stated that he performed this procedure so that I would not have to go to the operating room for surgery.\" The plaintiff further stated that the defendant provided \"no warning or notice to [her] ... at any time before\" he remedied the labial agglutination. In her affidavit, Andersen likewise averred that the defendant \"expressed concern that the plaintiff may pass out as a result of the separation of her agglutinated labia\" and then \"stated that he performed [the] procedure so that the plaintiff would not have to go to the operating room for surgery.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Although the defendant claims that he \"did not know that [the plaintiff's] labia were agglutinated until [he] separated them,\" the affidavits of the plaintiff and Andersen, read in the light most favorable to the plaintiff as the nonmoving party; see\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Powers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12492340\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/178/366/#p259\">\n    328 Conn. 256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 259,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12492340\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/178/366/#p259\">\n    178 A.3d 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018) ; suggest otherwise. Those affidavits allege that the defendant, after separating her agglutinated labia, informed them that he \"performed [the] procedure\n   <em>\n    so that the plaintiff would not have to go to the operating room for surgery\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis added.) Viewed in a manner most favorable to the plaintiff, the finder of fact could construe that purported\n   statement, in light of the defendant's admission that \"severely agglutinated labia may require a surgical procedure\" and the significant pain experienced by the plaintiff,\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   as an admission that the defendant\n   was aware of two viable alternative treatments at the time that he discovered the medical complication. See\n   <em>\n    Logan\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Greenwich Hospital Assn.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"682782\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/191/282/#p292\">\n    191 Conn. at 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=465%20A.2d%20294\">\n    465 A.2d 294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"all viable alternatives [must] be disclosed even though some involve more hazard than others\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the finder of fact were to credit those affirmations, it reasonably could conclude that the defendant discovered the complication during his initial examination of the plaintiff and then, without her informed consent, made a unilateral decision to pursue a particular course of treatment-digital separation-when another viable alternative existed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   In light of the foregoing, we conclude that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the discovery of the medical complication during the postoperative examination constituted a substantial and material change in circumstances, such that the defendant was obligated to disclose the risks, anticipated benefits, and viable alternatives to the plaintiff before embarking on a course of treatment therefor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   That determination does not end our inquiry, as a physician's failure to obtain informed consent may be excused in certain circumstances, such as when the patient has authorized the physician to remedy complications that arise during a course of medical treatment. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Hageny\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bodensteiner\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3768275\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/316/240/#p250\">\n    316 Wis. 2d at 250-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3768275\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/316/240/#p250\">\n    762 N.W.2d 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In rendering summary judgment, the court concluded that the materials submitted in connection with the motion for summary judgment demonstrated that the defendant's conduct in remedying the labial agglutination was treatment \"for which [the defendant] received the written consent of the plaintiff.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   It is undisputed that, in the spring of 2014, the plaintiff, in consultation with the defendant, embarked on a course of treatment for precancerous growths on her vulva. That course of treatment included both the laser ablation procedure that the defendant performed on April 25, 2014, and the postoperative examination on May 14, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The plaintiff's informed consent is memorialized on the consent form, a copy of which was submitted as an exhibit to the defendant's reply to the plaintiff's objection\n   to the motion for summary judgment. That written consent came on a standardized form titled \"Yale-New Haven Hospital Consent for Operation or Special Procedure.\" The form provides in relevant part: \"After discussing other options, including no treatment,\n   with [the defendant], I give [the defendant] permission to perform the following surgery, procedure(s) or treatment ... CO\n   <sup>\n    2\n   </sup>\n   Laser Ablation of Vulva.\" The consent form further stated: \"I give permission to [the defendant] to do whatever may be necessary if there is a complication or unforeseen condition\n   <em>\n    during my procedure\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Undoubtedly, that signed consent vested the defendant with discretion to deal with any complications or unforeseen conditions that arose during the laser ablation procedure performed on April 25, 2014. That consent form nevertheless is silent as to postoperative care. It confirms only that the plaintiff had discussed the CO\n   <sup>\n    2\n   </sup>\n   laser ablation procedure and \"other options\" with the defendant. The consent form contains no indication that the parties discussed the possibility of labial agglutination or various medical treatments for that complication. Indeed, in his November 4, 2016 affidavit, the defendant attested that, as a matter of practice, he does \"not warn patients that their labia might be agglutinated because most do not have agglutinated labia.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Furthermore, paragraph 3 of the standardized consent form begins by stating: \"My responsible practitioner has explained to me in a way that I understand: (a) the nature and purpose of the procedure(s); (b) the potential benefits and risks of the procedure(s) including bleeding, infection, accidental injury of other body parts, failure to permanently improve my condition or, death, as well as the potential risks and benefits of the medications that may be administered to me as part of the procedure; and (c) the alternative(s) to the procedure(s) and their potential risks and benefits, including the option of not having the procedure.\" It then states: \"I understand that some possible complications of the procedure(s) include\" followed by several\n   blank lines. That part of the consent form was left blank, with no possible complications identified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Read literally, and in the light most favorable to the plaintiff as the nonmoving party, the consent form authorized the defendant \"to do whatever may be necessary\" only with respect to unforeseen complications that arose during the April 25, 2014 laser ablation procedure. The defendant has provided no evidence, such as affidavit testimony indicating otherwise.
