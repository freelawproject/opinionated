On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly concluded that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant because the plaintiff failed to establish that the defendant had signed electronically an agreement in which the parties expressly agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of state and federal courts in Connecticut. We agree with the plaintiff and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the plaintiff's claim. On September 27, 2016, the plaintiff filed this breach of contract action against the defendant. In the one count complaint, the plaintiff alleged the following relevant facts. The plaintiff, a Florida corporation with offices in Connecticut, \"is in the business of producing and selling a professional line of nutraceutical and natural health products ... to consumers for sale through health care providers ....\" The defendant, a podiatrist, maintains a primary place of business in California and is a resident of California. On or about June 10, 2016, the plaintiff and the defendant entered into an agreement pursuant to which the defendant agreed to sell products provided by the plaintiff. Between August 17 and September 8, 2016, the defendant violated the agreement when he sold products that he had purchased from the plaintiff on a website that had not been authorized by the plaintiff. As a result of this violation, the defendant is required, pursuant to a liquidated damages clause in the agreement, to pay the plaintiff at least $53,000. The agreement, which was attached to the complaint, contains a forum selection clause that requires litigation arising from the agreement to be resolved by Connecticut courts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On November 3, 2016, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss in which he argued that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over him because the plaintiff could not meet its burden to prove that he had signed the agreement. The defendant attached to his motion, among other things, an affidavit in which he averred that he never had any contact with the state of Connecticut and never signed, or authorized anyone to sign, any document that \"might constitute doing business of any kind in Connecticut.\" On December 2, 2016, the plaintiff filed a motion for an\n   extension of time to respond to the defendant's motion so that it could depose the defendant regarding the factual statements made in his affidavit. On January 23, 2017, the court entered a scheduling order that permitted the plaintiff to conduct the defendant's deposition. On February 22, 2017, the plaintiff took the deposition of the defendant in California.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 24, 2017, the plaintiff filed a memorandum of law in opposition to the defendant's motion to dismiss in which it contended that the court had personal jurisdiction over the defendant because he had signed electronically the agreement that contained the forum selection clause. The plaintiff submitted a number of attachments in support of its opposition that cumulatively asserted that the defendant had signed electronically the agreement, including certain excerpts of the deposition of the defendant, a copy of the agreement, an affidavit of its general counsel, Stephen M. Carruthers, a \"DocuSign\" certificate of completion, a screenshot of a \"GeoMapLookup\" search, notice sent by Carruthers to the defendant informing him of his alleged breach of the agreement, documents evincing the service of the defendant, an affidavit of the plaintiff's independent sales representative, Toni Lyn Davis, as well as a redacted record of her telephone calls, and a series\n   of e-mails that purportedly were exchanged between Carruthers and the defendant. On April 7, 2017, the defendant filed a reply that contended that the plaintiff failed to meet its burden to establish personal jurisdiction, and he attached a supplemental affidavit in which he specifically rebutted the contentions made by the plaintiff in support of its opposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 22, 2017, the court conducted a hearing on the motion to dismiss at which it heard the parties' oral arguments. On May 31, 2017, the court issued a memorandum of decision in which it granted the defendant's motion. Therein, the court noted that, although \"due process requires that a trial-like hearing be held\" when \"issues of fact are necessary to the determination of a court's jurisdiction,\" the \"parties did not request that an evidentiary hearing be held but rel[ied] on evidence they ha[d] submitted by affidavit.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Accordingly, the court compared the evidence submitted by both parties\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and concluded that \"the plaintiff has failed to meet its burden to establish that this court has jurisdiction over the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   It has not established that the defendant ... transacted any business in this state, that is, entered into the agreement which is the subject of this lawsuit, such that the court has jurisdiction over the defendant pursuant to the long\n   arm statute\" applicable to nonresident individuals, General Statutes \u00a7 52-59b (a) (1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On June 20, 2017, the plaintiff filed a motion to reargue, which was denied summarily by the trial court. This appeal followed.

It may determine the motion on the basis of affidavits alone; or it may permit discovery in aid of the motion; or it may conduct an evidentiary hearing on the merits of the motion.... Significantly, however, the showing a plaintiff must make to defeat a defendant's claim that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over it varies depending on the procedural posture of the litigation.... [W]e [have] explained this sliding scale as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"Prior to discovery, a plaintiff challenged by a jurisdiction testing motion may defeat the motion by pleading in good faith, legally sufficient allegations of\n   jurisdiction. At that preliminary stage, the plaintiff's prima facie showing may be established solely by allegations. After discovery, the plaintiff's prima facie showing, necessary to defeat a jurisdiction testing motion, must include an averment of facts that, if credited by the trier, would suffice to establish jurisdiction over the defendant. At that point, the prima facie showing must be factually supported.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"Where the jurisdictional issue is in dispute, the plaintiff's averment of jurisdictional facts will normally be met in one of three ways .... If the defendant is content to challenge only the sufficiency of the plaintiff's factual allegation ... the plaintiff need persuade the court only that its factual allegations constitute a prima facie showing of jurisdiction. If the defendant asserts ... that undisputed facts show the absence of jurisdiction, the court proceeds ... to determine if undisputed facts exist that warrant the relief sought. If the defendant contests the plaintiff's factual allegations, then a hearing is required, at which the plaintiff must prove the existence of jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4061959\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/722/81/\">\n    Id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   84-85 ; see\n   <em>\n    Marine Midland Bank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1167132\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/664/899/#p904\">\n    664 F.2d 899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 904 (2d Cir. 1981) (\"If the court chooses not to conduct a full-blown evidentiary hearing on the motion, the plaintiff need make only a prima facie showing of jurisdiction through its own affidavits and supporting materials. Eventually, of course, the plaintiff must establish jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence, either at a pretrial evidentiary hearing or at trial. But until such a hearing is held, a prima facie showing suffices, notwithstanding any controverting presentation by the moving party, to defeat the motion.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We are persuaded that the sliding scale standard outlined by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Dorchester Financial Securities, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , should be applied to jurisdictional disputes arising before Connecticut courts because it is entirely consistent with Connecticut's existing framework for the resolution of jurisdictional issues. For instance, when a Connecticut trial court decides a jurisdictional issue on the basis of only the complaint, it accepts the plaintiff's jurisdictional allegations as true, essentially determining whether the plaintiff has made a prima facie case for the exercise of jurisdiction. By contrast, when there is a critical factual dispute relating to jurisdiction, or when the question\n   of jurisdiction is intertwined with the resolution of the merits of the case, the trial court, when requested by a party, must defer resolution of the jurisdictional issue until an evidentiary hearing or a trial on the merits has occurred. Because the proof of a fact at the trial on the merits typically must be by a preponderance of the evidence, that necessarily would be the plaintiff's burden to prove the same fact for jurisdictional purposes. Furthermore, it would be futile to hold a trial-like hearing if the burden of proof was less than by a preponderance of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Given the consistency of Connecticut practice with Second Circuit jurisprudence in cases with no evidentiary record and those with a full evidentiary record, we also conclude that the Second Circuit's use of the prima facie standard makes sense for cases, such as this, where the evidentiary record is only partially developed and the parties have not requested a full evidentiary hearing. Our Supreme Court repeatedly has cautioned trial courts not to make jurisdictional findings where there are disputed issues of fact until the court has held a full evidentiary hearing \"because a court cannot make a critical factual [jurisdictional] finding [on the basis of] memoranda and documents submitted by the parties.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Angersola\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Radiologic Associates of Middletown, P.C.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12501119\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/193/520/#p274\">\n    330 Conn. at 275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12501119\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/193/520/#p274\">\n    193 A.3d 520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Consequently, where, as in\n   the present case, neither party requests an evidentiary hearing, the court cannot resolve the parties' factual dispute. Instead, the court must determine whether the plaintiff's submissions establish a prima facie case. The prima facie standard ensures that the critical factual dispute remains unresolved until after an evidentiary hearing or trial is held, at which the plaintiff would have the elevated burden of proving the court's personal jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. Accordingly, having concluded that the prima facie standard applies to the present case, we now consider whether the plaintiff met its burden to make a prima facie showing that the court had personal jurisdiction over the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"[T]o establish a prima facie case, the proponent must submit evidence which, if credited, is sufficient to establish the fact or facts which it is adduced to prove....

The agreement provides that it was entered into on June 10, 2016, by the plaintiff and \"Mark Miller ... having an address of 2640B El Camino Real, Carlsbad, CA 92008.\" The plaintiff's general counsel, Carruthers, attested in his affidavit that the agreement was executed electronically \"through a secure portal provided by a third-party known as 'DocuSign' ....\" The plaintiff submitted a copy of a DocuSign certificate of completion that purportedly established that the defendant electronically signed the agreement on June 10, 2016, using the e-mail address drmillerorders@gmail.com.

Further, the defendant stated that he was familiar with DocuSign and that he previously had used it to sign documents. The defendant also testified that his only personal telephone number is the same telephone number identified by Davis and that he had received a telephone call \"in late summer [or] early fall\" from Davis \"about signing up as a distributor.\" He further testified that he previously had heard of the plaintiff\n   because it was recommended by one of his patients \"last summer,\" but he could not recall whether he ever ordered or received products from the plaintiff.\n   The circumstances of the present case are strikingly similar to those at issue in\n   <em>\n    Dorchester Financial Securities, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Banco BRJ, S.A.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4061959\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/722/81/\">\n    722 F.3d 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In the present case, the\n   plaintiff submitted an abundance of corroborating evidence to establish that the defendant signed the agreement. Carruthers' affidavit evinced that the agreement was executed electronically through DocuSign by \"Mark Miller,\" who has an address of \"2640B El Camino Real, Carlsbad, CA 92008.\" In his deposition, the defendant testified that he received service stemming from the present case at his corporate address,\n   which is sufficiently similar to the address designated on the agreement. The defendant also testified that he was familiar with DocuSign and had used it in the past. The DocuSign certificate of completion evinces that the agreement was signed on June 10, 2016, using the e-mail address drmillerorders@gmail.com. That e-mail address is corroborated by the statements in Carruthers' affidavit and the attached series of e-mails, which purportedly demonstrated correspondences regarding the breach of the alleged agreement between Carruthers and drmillerorders@gmail.com. Additionally, the defendant agreed at his deposition that he engaged in a telephone conversation with Davis regarding the sale of the plaintiff's products around the time that the agreement allegedly was executed. This admission is substantiated by Davis' affidavit and the printout of her telephone bill that displays the particular details of those telephone calls, which occurred two weeks after the agreement allegedly was executed. Indeed, the defendant conceded that his telephone number was identified accurately by Davis. Finally, the defendant acknowledged his familiarity with the plaintiff and did not affirmatively deny that he ordered or received products from the plaintiff, but, rather, he responded that he\n   <em>\n    could not recall\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Applying the foregoing principles to the present case, we conclude that the plaintiff met its burden to make a prima facie showing that the court had personal jurisdiction over the defendant because the plaintiff submitted evidence, which, if credited by the trier of fact, was sufficient to establish that the defendant had signed the agreement containing the forum selection clause. Nevertheless, we recognize, as the court did in\n   <em>\n    Dorchester Financial Securities, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , that the evidence submitted by the defendant in support of his motion to dismiss plainly calls into question whether the defendant actually signed the alleged agreement. Although a trial court\n   properly can consider such documentary evidence in determining whether a critical factual dispute exists, it cannot consider such evidence when determining whether a plaintiff has made a prima facie showing, and, absent a full evidentiary hearing, it cannot utilize this evidence to resolve a critical factual dispute. Thus, because the plaintiff met its threshold burden of making a prima facie showing, and the parties did not request and the court did not hold a full evidentiary hearing, the court was required to deny the defendant's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    The forum selection clause of the agreement provides: \"This [a]greement shall be governed in all respects by the substantive laws of the [s]tate of Connecticut without regard to such state's conflict of law principles.
