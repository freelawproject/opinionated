The district court sentenced Med-lock to 188 months of imprisonment, to run consecutively to a 10-year state sentence, and four years of supervised release. Medlock contends that the district court\u2019s imposition of a consecutive sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to achieve the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">The consecutive nature of Medlock\u2019s sentence is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Candia, </em>454 F.3d 468, 473 (5th Cir.2006). The district court was aware of the mitigating circumstances offered by Medlock and explicitly took some of them into account in selecting the sentence. However, in imposing a consecutive sentence, the district court gave more weight to Medlock\u2019s personal and criminal history and characteristics. Medlo'ck\u2019s \u201cbelief that the mitigating factors presented for the court\u2019s consideration should have been balanced differently is insufficient to disturb this presumption.\u201d <em>United States v. Alvarado, </em>691 F.3d 592, 597 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-14\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b413-11\"> Pursuant, to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except-under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
