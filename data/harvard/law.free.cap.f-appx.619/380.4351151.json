By moving to proceed IFP, Byers is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">Byers contends that the district court erred in determining that he was not eligible for the sentencing reduction. However, as he simultaneously concedes, the district court found him eligible for the reduction but declined to exercise its discretion to reduce his sentence, .determining that relief was unwarranted based on the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 827, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Alternatively, Byers argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying a sentencing reduction without a sufficient explanation and based on factors which were known at the time of original sentencing. He complains that the district court failed to- consider new factors, in-eluding his participation in a residential drug treatment program.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-16\">The record reflects that the district court considered Byers\u2019s motion as a whole, gave specific reasons for its denial, and referenced the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Byers thus cannot show an abuse of discretion on the district court\u2019s part. <em>See United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 673 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-17\">Byers has failed to show that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his IFP motion is DENIED. Additionally, because this appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cik. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b407-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
