Campbell argues that his sentence was improperly enhanced because the judge, not the jury, determined the specific quantity of drugs to be attributed to him, which violated his constitutional rights. In sup- \u2022 port, Campbell relies on <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>570 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), which he argues is a new rule of constitutional law to be applied retroactively on collateral review. However, because we conclude that <em>Alleyne </em>does not apply retroactively on collateral review, Campbell is foreclosed from proceeding pursuant to \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s saving clause. Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Campbell\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-10\">The following factual synopsis is undisputed. Over twenty years ago, Campbell was indicted by a federal grand jury and charged with conspiring to possess cocaine and cocaine base with the intent to distribute. After a jury found Campbell guilty of the charged offense, Campbell received a sentence of 420-months\u2019 imprisonment. Subsequently, Campbell appealed his sentence. On direct appeal, Campbell raised a number of issues, none of which challenged the enhancements he received for the quantity of drugs attributed to him. We affirmed Campbell\u2019s conviction and sentence. <em>See United States v. Butler, </em>102 F.3d 1191 (11th Cir.1997). Thereafter, Campbell filed a motion to vacate and correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 alleging that his trial counsel was ineffective in several ways, including that his trial counsel failed to object to the quantity of drugs attributed to Campbell. Campbell\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion and his Certificate of Appealability (COA) were denied by the district court. Treating Campbell\u2019s COA as a timely, notice of appeal, this Court denied Campbell\u2019s COA as well. Several years later, however, Campbell filed a motion for reconsideration of his \u00a7 2255 motion, but the district court concluded that his motion for reconsideration was the equivalent of a successive \u00a7 2255 motion that required prior permission from this court, which Campbell never obtained. Concluding also that the cases Campbell relied on were not retroactively applicable, the district court denied his motion for reconsideration. Campbell again appealed that decision to this court, but we refused to grant him a COA. Campbell has since then filed the instant petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to \u00a7 2241, which was subsequently dismissed by the district court for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-13\">We review de novo whether a prisoner may bring a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e). <em>Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>738 F.3d 1253, 1262 (11th Cir.2013). \u201cThe applicability of the savings clause is a threshold jurisdictional issue, and we cannot reach questions that the district court never had jurisdiction to entertain.\u201d <em>Williams v. Warden, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>713 F.3d 1332, 1337 (11th Cir.2013) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Williams v. Hastings, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 52, 190 L.Ed.2d 29 (2014). If the savings clause permits Campbell\u2019s \u00a7 2241 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>petition, then we may decide the substantive issue of whether his sentence was improperly enhanced pursuant to the trial judge\u2019s determination of the specific quantity of di'ugs to be attributed to him. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">Generally, a collateral attack on the validity of a federal sentence must be brought under \u00a7 2255. <em>See Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). Under circumstances such as this, where a prisoner has previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion, he must apply for and receive permission from the appropriate court of appeals before filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), 2255(h). A successive motion must contain \u201ca new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral'review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2255(h)(2). However, \u201c[u]nder the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 [ (e) ], a prisoner may file a \u00a7 2241 petition if an otherwise available remedy under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1365. Section 2255(e) applies by its own terms irrespective of whether a prisoner failed to seek \u00a7 2255 relief or whether the trial court has previously denied him such relief; what is significant is whether \u00a7 2255 relief would not have adequately or effectively tested the legality of his imprisonment. <em>See Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1263. The burden is on the petitioner to demonstrate that \u00a7 2255 relief was \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention for purposes of \u00a7 2255(e).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1262 (internal quotation marks omitted). We have held that in order for a petitioner to establish that a \u00a7 2255 motion was inadequate or ineffective to test whether his detention was lawful, he must demonstrate that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-6\">(1) throughout the petitioner\u2019s sentencing, direct appeal, and first \u00a7 2255 proceeding, this Court\u2019s precedent had specifically and squarely foreclosed the claim raised in the \u00a7 2241 petition; (2) after the petitioner\u2019s first \u00a7 2255 proceeding, the Supreme Court overturned that binding precedent; (3) that Supreme Court decision applies retroactively on collateral review; (4) as a result of that Supreme Court decision applying retroactively, the petitioner\u2019s current sentence exceeds the statutory maximum; and (5) the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) reaches his claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b880-7\"><em>Jeanty v. Warden, FCI-Miami, </em>757 F.3d 1283, 1285 (11th Cir.2014) (per curiam); <em>see also Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1274 (synthesizing circuit precedent for purposes of interpreting \u00a7 2255(e) in a manner that \u201cdoes not eviscerate or undermine \u00a7 .2255(h)\u2019s restrictions on second or successive \u00a7 2255 motions\u201d). It is unnecessary for the court to address all five requirements if the petitioner fails to satisfy any one requirement. See <em>Jeanty, </em>757 F.3d at 1285.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">Here, Campbell could not bring his <em>Al-leyns </em>claim under \u00a7 2255, as he previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion and did not obtain this court\u2019s permission to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), 2255(h). Thus, in order for the district court to have had jurisdiction over Campbell\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition, he was required to establish, through the lense of \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause, that his prior \u00a7 2255 motion was \u201cinadequate or ineffective.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-9\">Campbell fails to fulfill his burden of demonstrating one of the necessary requirements to show that \u00a7 2255 relief would have been in adequate or ineffective, and, consequently, there is no need for this court to address the remaining four. <em>See Jeanty, </em>757 F.3d at 1285. Particularly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>Campbell fails to establish that the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Alleyne </em>applies retroactively. <em>See id. </em>We acknowledge that in <em>Alleyne, </em>the Supreme Court held that any fact that aggravates the legally prescribed range of allowable sentences, including a fact that increases the statutory minimum, is an element of the offense that must be submitted to the jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt. 570 U.S. at -, 133 S.Ct. at 2162-63. However, we have held that the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Alleyne </em>does not apply retroactively on collateral review for the following reasons: 1) the Supreme Court has not held that <em>Alleyne\u2019s </em>application is retroactive; 2) the Supreme Court explained that <em>Alleyne </em>is an application of the rule established in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), which is not retroactively applicable; and 3) our sister circuits (that have had the opportunity to consider whether <em>Alleyne </em>applies retroactively on collateral review in a published decision) have concluded that it did not. <em>See Jeanty, </em>757 F.3d at 1285. Because we have held that <em>Alleyne </em>does not apply retroactively on collateral review, Campbell is foreclosed from proceeding pursuant to \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s saving clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">Therefore, we conclude that district court did not err in dismissing Campbell\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition. Campbell\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition fails to recapture the jurisdiction of the district court pursuant to \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause because Campbell\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition relies on the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Alleyne, </em>which is not retroactively applicable. To the extent that Campbell seeks to rely on <em>Alleyne </em>for the proposition that the facts of his prior convictions should have been submitted to a jury before his sentence could be enhanced, his reliance here is also misguided. <em>See Ap-prendi, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (holding that any fact, other than the fact of a prior conviction, is required to be submitted to the jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt); <em>see also United States v. Harris, </em>741 F.3d 1245, 1249-50 (11th Cir.2014). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Campbell\u2019s \u00a7 2241 habeas petition is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
