She contends that her sentence was both procedurally and substantively unreasonable. Many of her arguments are centered on the district court\u2019s denial of the Government\u2019s U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">Under the discretionary sentencing system established by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), district courts should consider both the Sentencing Guidelines and the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) when choosing a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir.2005). Preserved claims of sentencing error are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586,169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">First, Moreno argues that the district court improperly calculated her guidelines range, made erroneous factual findings concerning an agreement she had with the Government, and made several errors in connection with its disposition of the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. Because these specific arguments were not presented to the district court, they are reviewed for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009). To establish plain error, a defendant must show an error that is clear or obvious and that affects her substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If she makes such a showing, we have discretion to correct the error but will do so only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-14\">Moreno has not met this standard. The record shows that the district court adopted the PSR, which correctly calculated Moreno\u2019s guidelines range. The record also refutes Moreno\u2019s assertion that the district court found she perfected an agreement with the Government that resulted in her being charged with a firearms offense instead of a drug-related crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-15\">Insofar as Moreno argues that the district court\u2019s denial of the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion was flawed because the court did not explicitly consider certain factors and did not give enough weight to the Government\u2019s evaluation of her helpfulness, these arguments are unavailing. District courts have \u201calmost complete discretion to deny\u201d a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>274 F.3d 230, 248 (5th Cir.2001). We lack discretion to review the denial of a motion for downward departure unless the denial was due to the district court\u2019s mistaken belief that it could not grant the motion. <em>Cooper, </em>274 F.3d at 248; <em>see also United States v. Tuma, </em>738 F.3d 681, 691 (5th Cir.2013), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 2875, 189 L.Ed.2d 835 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>The record does not indicate that the district court mistakenly believed that it could not grant the Government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. Rather, the record reflects that the district court knew of its authority to grant the motion but concluded that a downward departure was not warranted under the facts and circumstances of the case. Consequently, we will not consider the district court\u2019s denial of the motion. <em>See Cooper, </em>274 F.3d at 248. Moreno has not shown that the district court committed procedural error, plain or otherwise, at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Next, Moreno argues that her sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court gave too much weight to the prosecutor\u2019s decision to indict her on the firearms offense and because the district court should not have relied upon this factor to deny the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. \u201cAppellate review for substantive reasonableness is highly deferential because the sentencing court is in a better position to find facts and judge their import under the \u00a7 3553(a) factors with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>654 F.3d 552, 555 (5th Cir.2011). Sentences, whether inside or outside the advisory guidelines range, are reviewed for reasonableness in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">When, as is the case here, the district court imposes a sentence within the applicable guidelines range, that sentence is presumptively reasonable, and \u201c[t]he presumption is rebutted only upon a showing that the sentence does not account for a factor that should receive significant weight, it gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or it represents a clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). \u201cA defendant\u2019s disagreement with the propriety of the sentence imposed does not suffice to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to a within-guidelines sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Moreno\u2019s arguments concerning the district court\u2019s reasons for denying the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion are but a thinly-disguised challenge to that denial. As explained earlier, we will not review this denial because it was not grounded in the mistaken belief that the court could not grant the motion. <em>See Cooper, </em>274 F.3d at 248. This argument does not suffice to show that Moreno\u2019s sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">Finally, insofar as Moreno complains that her sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court should not have considered her uncharged conduct and the effect of the prosecutor\u2019s charging decision on her sentence, this argument is unavailing because these factors are relevant to the nature and circumstances of Moreno\u2019s offense as well as her history and characteristics. Thus, under \u00a7 3553(a)(1), the district court acted properly by considering these factors. Because Moreno has shown only a disagreement with the appropriateness of the within-guidelines sentence chosen by the district court, she has not shown that her sentence is\u2019 substantively unreasonable. <em>See Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d at 398.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b402-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
