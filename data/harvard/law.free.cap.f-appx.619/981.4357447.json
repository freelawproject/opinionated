No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its authority under section 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-10\">A district court may not reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment unless (1) the defendant\u2019s sentence was based upon a guideline range that the Sentencing Commission later lowered and (2) a reduction is consistent with the Sentencing Commission\u2019s applicable policy statements. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A reduction is inconsistent with the guidelines\u2019 policy statements if the guidelines amendment does not lower the defendant\u2019s \u201capplicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). The defendant bears the burden of establishing that a retroactive amendment actually lowers his guideline range. <em>United States v. Hamilton, </em>715 F.3d 328, 337 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-13\">When determining whether a reduction is warranted, a court should determine the guidelines range that would have applied had the pertinent amendment been in effect at the time of defendant\u2019s sentencing. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l). In doing so, a court must substitute only the pertinent amendment into the district court\u2019s original guidelines calculations and leave all other sentencing decisions unaffected. <em>Id.; United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-14\">In this case, the sentencing court first calculated Buteau\u2019s base offense level as 32 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l), based on the quantity of drugs involved in his offense. The court then determined that Buteau qualified as a minor participant in the conspiracy and, thus, was eligible for a reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). Buteau\u2019s minor-role-reduction also entitled him to a two-level reduction in his base offense level under section 2Dl.l(a)(5). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(5) (a defendant is entitled to a two-level reduction in his base offense level if (a) he receives a minor role reduction under section 3B1.2 <em>and </em>(b) if his base offense level under section 2Dl.l(e) is 32).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-15\">Applying section 2Dl.l(a)(5), the sentencing court recalculated Buteau\u2019s base offense level as 30. The court then applied the two-level minor-role-reduction under section 3B1.2(b) and a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under section 3E1.1, resulting in a total offense level- of 25. Based on a total offense level of 25 and a criminal history category of IV, Buteau\u2019s guideline range was calculated as 84 to 105 months\u2019 imprisonment. The sentencing court imposed a sentence of 84 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-16\">The district court committed no error in denying Buteau a sentence reduction based on Amendment 782. Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>782 reduced \u2014 by two \u2014 the base offense levels for most drug sentences calculated pursuant to the Drug Quantity Table, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 201.1(c). U.S.S.G.App. C., amend. 782. Applying retroactively Amendment 782 to Buteau\u2019s case reduces the base offense level specified in section n2D1.1(c) from 82 to 30. Doing so, however, renders Buteau ineligible for the additional two-level reduction under section 2Dl.l(a)(5), which applies <em>only </em>if the offense level specified in section 2Dl.l(c) is 32 or above. Thus, Buteau\u2019s base offense level remains 30 after application of Amendment 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">Leaving the other sentencing decisions unaffected, including application of the two-level minor role reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 and the three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, Buteau\u2019s total offense level is 25. Together with his criminal history category of IV, Buteau\u2019s resulting guideline range remains 84 to 105 months. Because the retroactive application of Amendment 782 results in no change to Buteau\u2019s sentencing range, no sentence reduction is authorized under section 3582(c)(2). <em>See Hamilton, </em>715 F.3d at 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
