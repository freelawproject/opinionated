Hall sought a ' sentence reduction- based on Amendments 706 and 750 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced the base offense levels for crack-cocaine offenses. The district court found Hall ineligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because he was sentenced as a career offender, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, so the amendments did not have the effect of lowering his amended guideline range. On appeal, Hall contends that he was not, in fact, sentenced as a career offender and that his sentence was instead based on the drug-quantity tables in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. Hall also argues that applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, as amended by Amendment 759, violates the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause, U.S. Const, art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 3. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s conclusions regarding the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Tellis, </em>748 F.3d 1305, 1308 (11th Cir.2014). The factual findings underlying the district court\u2019s legal conclusions are reviewed for clear error. <em>Id. </em>A defendant bears the burden of establishing his eligibility for a sentence reduction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b845-15\">Section 3582(c) grants district courts limited authority to modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed. <em>See id. </em>Pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the court may reduce a defendant\u2019s prison term if the defendant was \u201csentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\" Only certain amendments made retroactively applicable are eligible bases for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l), (d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-16\">Amendment 706 (effective Nov. 1, 2007) and Amendment 750 (effective Nov. 1, 2011) both amended the drug-quantity table in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) to lower the base offense levels for crack-cocaine offenses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> U.S.S.GApp. C, Amends. 706 &amp; 750. Both amendments have been made retroactively applicable. <em>See id., </em>Amends. 713 &amp; 759; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(d). Each amendment provided a two-level reduction in base offense levels for crack-cocaine offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-17\">A district court generally must follow a two-step process in ruling on a \u00a7 3582(c) motion. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). At the first step, the court determines eligibility \u2014 whether the amendment lowered the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>applicable guideline range. <em>See id. </em>To do so, the court must identify the amended guideline range that would have applied if the eligible amendment had been in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l). In making this determination, the court \u201cshall substitute only\u201d the retroactive amendment for the corresponding guideline provisions originally applied, leaving \u201call other guideline application decisions unaffected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, the court must ask whether the amendment, keeping all else constant, would have lowered the defendant\u2019s guideline range. If the amendment would have lowered the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range, at the second step, the court evaluates whether, in the court\u2019s discretion, to resentence the defendant under the amended guideline range or to retain the original sentence. <em>Bravo, 203 F.3d </em>at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">Here, the pre-sentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d) for Hall\u2019s original sentencing stated that, based on 680.86 grams of crack cocaine, Hall\u2019s base offense level was 36. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 (2001). With a two-level increase for obstruction of justice, Hall\u2019s adjusted offense level was 38. However, the PSR also classified Hall as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1. Under the career-offender guidelines, if the offense level for a career offender from the table in \u00a7 4B1.1 \u201cis greater than the offense level otherwise applicable,\u201d the offense level from the table shall apply. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). Under the \u00a7 4B1.1 table, Hall\u2019s offense level was 37. <em>Id, </em>Consequently, the PSR set Hall\u2019s total offense level at 38 \u201c[b]ecause the offense level calculated pursuant to Chapters Two and Three (38) is greater than the offense level calculated pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.1 (37).\u201d (PSR. \u00b6 38). The district court adopted the PSR at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Hall argues that the PSR\u2019s and district court\u2019s use of the offense level of 38 shows that he was not sentenced as a career offender, even if he was eligible to be sentenced as such. We respectfully disagree. <em>See, e.g., Tellis, </em>748 F.3d at 1306-08 (rejecting similar arguments). As explained above, \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) provides that the offense level for a career offender being sentenced for a drug crime is the higher value calculated using U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2D1.1 and 4B1.1. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). If Hall\u2019s offense 'level under \u00a7 2D1.1 had been lower than 37, the career offender offense level of 37 would have applied. <em>See id. </em>Because it was not, the offense level of 38 applied. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">Moreover, both the PSR and the transcript from the sentencing hearing unambiguously show that Hall was sentenced as a career offender at his sentencing in 2002. For example, the PSR states that \u201c[a]c-cording to \u00a7 4B1.1, the defendant is considered a career offender,\u201d and it reflects that Hall\u2019s criminal history category was changed from IV to VI because \u201cthe defendant is a career offender.\u201d (PSR \u00b6\u00b6 38, 48); <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) (\u201cA career offender\u2019s criminal history category in every case under this subsection' shall be Category VI.\u201d). And at sentencing, the court stated that Hall \u201cqualifies as a career offender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">Because Hall was sentenced as a career offender, Amendments 706 and 750 do not alter the sentencing range upon which his sentence was based. Had Amendments 706 and 750 been in effect at the time of Hall\u2019s sentencing in 2002, his base offense level would have been 32 instead of 36. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l)(4) (2013). Factoring in the original two-level increase for obstruction of justice, his total offense level would have been 34. Because Hall\u2019s career offender offense level of 37 under \u00a7 4B1.1 would have been greater than his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>offense level based on \u00a7 2D1.1, he would have been assigned a total offense level of 37. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). Based on a total offense level of 37 and a criminal history category of VI, Hall\u2019s advisory guideline range would have remained at 360 months to life imprisonment. U.S.S.G. Sentencing Table (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">\u201cWhere a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B) (providing that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction is not authorized if the amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range\u201d). <em>Moore </em>remains good law. <em>See Tellis, </em>748 F.3d at 1309-10; <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.2012). Although Amendments 706 and 750 reduced Hall\u2019s base offense level, no sentence reduction is authorized because the sentencing range would remain the same. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). Hall\u2019s attempts to distinguish his case from <em>Moore </em>and <em>Tellis </em>are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">Consequently, the district court properly found that it lacked authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to grant Hall\u2019s requested sentence reduction. <em>See Tellis, </em>748 F.3d at 1309; <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">Hall also contends that the district court committed an <em>ex post facto </em>violation in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion by \u201cinjecting\u201d the career-offender enhancement into his original sentence and by applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, as amended by Amendment 759 in November 2011. Hall argues that Amendment 759 effectively eliminated the district court\u2019s discretion to reduce his sentence and that the court instead should have applied the Sentencing Guidelines in effect at the time of his original sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-11\">\u201cThe Ex Post Facto Clause bars laws that retroactively alter the definition of crime or increase the punishment for criminal acts.\u201d <em>United States v. Lozano, </em>138 F.3d 915, 916 (11th Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks omitted). Generally, to prevail on an <em>ex post facto </em>claim, the defendant 'must show that (1) the law he challenges operates retroactively, in that it applies to conduct occurring before its enactment, and (2) it disadvantaged him. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b847-12\">As discussed above, Hall initially was sentenced in 2002 as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1. It was not retroactively applied. Therefore, there was no <em>ex post facto </em>violation based on Hall\u2019s career-offender status. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b847-13\">Section 1B1.10 is a binding policy statement governing motions for sentence reductions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 826-28, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-92, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Amendment 759 made several changes to \u00a7 1B1.10 and its commentary. First, the amendment made parts of Amendment 750 retroactive. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 759. Second, it made changes to the district court\u2019s discretion to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence below the amended guideline range. \u201cBefore Amendment 759, a district court had discretion to lower a defendant\u2019s sentence below'the amended guidelines range subject to some restrictions.\u201d <em>United States v. Colon, </em>707 F.3d 1255, 1258 (11th Cir.2013). After Amendment 759, a court cannot reduce a sentence below the amended guideline range except in cases where the \u201coriginal sentence imposed had been below <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>the applicable guidelines range because of a reduction based upon the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance to authorities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Amendment 759 also clarified how a court is to determine the \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d in cases where a departure or variance is applied, and it added an application note providing that the district court is required to apply the version of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 that is in effect on the date on which it decides a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 759; <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. nn. 1(A) <em>&amp; </em>8.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">Hall\u2019s <em>ex post facto </em>challenge is foreclosed by prior precedent. In <em>Colon, </em>we held that Amendment 759 did not violate the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause because its \u201crestriction on the district court\u2019s discretion to reduce [the defendant\u2019s] sentence based on [a retroactive amendment] did not increase the punishment assigned by law when the act to be punished occurred.\u201d 707 F.3d at 1258 (concerning Amendment 750) (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted). Here, as in <em>Colon, </em>the net effect of Amendments 706, 750, and 759 \u201cwas not to increase [Hall\u2019s] range of punishment above what it was at the time [he] committed [his] crimes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1258-59. Hall\u2019s guideline range after the amendments was the same as it would have been without them. We are bound by our decision in <em>Colon </em>unless and until it is overruled by this Court sitting <em>en banc </em>or by the Supreme Court. <em>United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Hall relies on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Peugh v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2072, 186 L.Ed.2d 84 (2013), which was decided after <em>Colon. </em>In <em>Peugh, </em>the Court held that \u201cthere is an <em>ex post facto </em>violation when a defendant is sentenced under Guidelines promulgated after he committed his criminal acts and the new version provides a higher applicable Guidelines sentencing range than the version in place at the time of the offense.\u201d 133 S.Ct. at 2078; <em>id. </em>at 2084 (\u201cA retrospective increase in the Guidelines range applicable to a defendant creates a sufficient risk of a higher sentence to constitute an <em>ex post facto </em>violation.\u201d). Hall also relies on a district court case from Illinois, which found that \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A) \u201cviolates the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause because it alters the formula used to arrive at the applicable reduced Guidelines sentencing range pursuant to a Section 3582(c)(2) motion.\u201d <em>United States v. King, </em>No. 99-CR-952-1, 2013 WL 4008629, at *21 (N.D.Ill. Aug. 5, 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\"><em>Peugh </em>did not overrule and does not conflict with Colon. Neither Colon nor this case involves, as in Peugh, a higher sentencing range than the version in place at the time of the offense. Rather, the ex post facto challenge in Colon, as it is here, was based on the district court\u2019s application of the post-Amendment 759 version of \u00a7 1B1.10 and its restrictions on the court\u2019s discretion to reduce a sentence. See <em>Colon, </em>707 F.3d at 1258. King is not binding and, of course, cannot overrule a prior decision of this Court. Consequently, under Colon, there is no ex post facto violation. See <em>id. </em>at 1258-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-11\">Accordingly, for the reasons stated above, we affirm the denial of Hall\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b845-12\">.
