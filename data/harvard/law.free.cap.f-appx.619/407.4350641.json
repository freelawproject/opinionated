The BIA determined that the motion to reopen was un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>timely filed and that Sugiharto and Arifin had failed to show that the untimely filing should be excused because of changed country conditions. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-16\">Sugiharto and Arifin, who are Christian, assert that they presented evidence of increased violence against Christians and of the Indonesian government\u2019s active participation in \u201cdenying Christians the ability to worship freely\u201d by \u201cforcibly closing churches\u201d and by failing to act when Islamic extremist groups attacked Christian worshipers. They argue that the BIA failed to give adequate consideration to evidence they presented of changed country conditions, that the BIA erred in relying on the State Department\u2019s 2013 International Religious Freedom Report, and that their claims, if true, would establish eligibility for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-17\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion by taking administrative notice of the State Department\u2019s 2013 International Religious Freedom Report because that report is an official document that was incorporated by reference in an exhibit attached. to the motion to reopen. <em>See Enriquez-Gutierrez v. Holder, </em>612 F.3d 400, 409-11 (5th Cir.2010); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). The conditions and incidents of religious oppression described in that report were not materially different in kind, numerosity, and severity from those reported in the 2007 International Religious Freedom Report. Both documents reported that the Indonesian government generally upheld the rights of followers of recognized religions, including Catholics and Protestants, but that discrimination and sectarian violence continued to occur and authorities sometimes failed to respond sufficiently to suppression of religious minorities. Furthermore, the October 2013 letter written by Sugiharto\u2019s sister \u2014 upon which he relies as evidence of worsening circumstances \u2014 states that Indonesia \u201cis still the same now and before, discrimination still exist[s], they still don\u2019t like Chinese and people with other religions, especially Christians.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-13\">The two reports and the other materials in the administrative record describe similar, rather than worsening, conditions. <em>See Gotora v. Holder, </em>567 Fed.Appx. 219, 222 (5th Cir.2014); <em>In re S-Y-G-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 247, 253 (BIA 2007). Sugiharto and Arifin have not shown that the BIA acted outside of its broad discretion in denying their motion to reopen because their evidence did not show that conditions in Indonesia had materially worsened. <em>See Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 303 (5th Cir.2005). Because Sugiharto and Ar-ifin have not shown that the BIA abused its discretion, we need not consider whether prima facie eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, or relief under the CAT has been established. <em>See Haider v. Holder, </em>471 Fed.Appx. 283, 283-84 (5th Cir.2012). The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b433-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
