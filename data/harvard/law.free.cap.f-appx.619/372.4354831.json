Martinez argues that the 40-month term of imprisonment is substantively unreasonable because the district court imposed a variance that was almost twice the top of the guidelines range. Because Martinez failed to raise this objection in the district court, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Segura, </em>747 F.3d 323, 327 (5th Cir.2014). The district court considered all the relevant 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and gave specific reasons for the upward variance. Martinez has not demonstrated that the district court considered any improper factors in imposing a non-Guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708 (5th Cir.2006). Further, , the court has upheld much greater upward variances. <em>See United States v. Key, </em>599 F.3d 469, 475-76 (5th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 348-50 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-21\">Martinez also argues that the district court procedurally erred in imposing a three-year term of supervised release based on its improper consideration of the factors in \u00a7 3553(a)(2) and in imposing the term contrary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Dl.l(c). Because Martinez did not raise these arguments in the district court, these claims are subject to plain error review. <em>See United States v. Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d 324, 328 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-22\">The district court expressly stated that in imposing the term of supervised release, it was providing \u201can added measure of deterrence and protection based on the facts and circumstances of the case,\u201d an appropriate factor to be considered. Because the district court primarily relied on permissible \u00a7 3553(a) \u2022 factors in imposing the term of supervised release, no clear or obvious error occurred. <em>See Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d at 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-23\">The three-year term of supervised release was within the permissible statutory and guidelines range. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(a), (b)(2), \u00a7 3559(a)(3); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.2(a)(2). Martinez has failed to point out any factors that rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>guideline term of supervised release. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). Thus, he has faded to show that the district court abused its discretion in imposing the term of supervised release. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b398-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
