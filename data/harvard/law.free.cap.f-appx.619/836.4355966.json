(\u201cULC HQ\u201d) and Michael Cauley (collectively, \u201cCauley\u201d) appeal from the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the Universal Life Church Monastery Storehouse, Inc. (\u201cULC Monastery\u201d) and George Freeman (collectively, \u201cAppellees\u201d) on their claim that Cauley violated a mediated settlement agreement between the parties concerning prior and ongoing defamation (the \u201cSettlement Agreement\u201d). On appeal, Cauley argues that: (1) the district court failed to provide him with notice that he could file affidavits or other responsive materials and the potential consequences if he failed to do so; and (2) even if the district court provided notice, summary judgment was improper because material facts were in dispute. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">We review a district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard as the district court. <em>Nat\u2019l Parks Conservation Ass\u2019n v. Norton, </em>324 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2003). We view the material presented and draw all factual inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Brooks v. Cnty. Comm\u2019n of Jefferson Cnty., Ala., </em>446 F.3d 1160, 1161-62 (11th Cir.2006). Summary judgment is proper where \u201cthe mov-ant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 66(a). \u201cA mere scintilla of evidence supporting the nonmoving party\u2019s position will not suffice.\u201d &gt; <em>Allen v. Tyson Foods, Inc., </em>121 F.3d 642, 646 (11th Cir.1997) (alteration adopted) (quotations omitted). Summary judgment is also proper if the evidence \u201cis so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 </em>U.S. 242, 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-13\">A party moving for summary judgment bears \u201cthe initial responsibility\u201d of pointing to the pleadings and other record evidence to \u201cdemonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\u201d <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 </em>U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). The burden then shifts to the nonmovant. <em>Fitzpatrick v. City of Atlanta, </em>2 F.3d 1112, 1116 (11th Cir.1993). Where, as here, the movant bears the burden of proof at trial, the nonmovant \u201cmust come forward with evidence sufficient to call into question the inference created by the movant\u2019s evidence on the particular material fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because of this burden on the nonmovant, \u201c[a] motion for summary judgment should only be granted against a litigant without counsel if the court gives clear notice [at least ten days prior to ruling] of the need to file affidavits or other responsive materials and of the consequences of default.\u201d <em>United States v. One Colt Python .857 Ca. Revolver, </em>845 F.2d 287, 289 (11th Cir.1988). <em>See also id. </em>(\u201cWhen a litigant moves pursuant to [R]ule 56 for summary judgment or when the district court converts a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment, the \u2018bright-line\u2019 ten-day notice requirement is stringently enforced.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>First, we reject Cauley\u2019s argument that the district court failed to provide him, a <em>pro se </em>litigant, with adequate notice that he could submit affidavits or other responsive materials and of the potential consequences of his failure to do so. \u201c[W]hen a <em>pro se </em>litigant is involved, we have interpreted Rule 56[ ] to require that the district court specifically inform the litigant (1) of the need to file affidavits or other responsive materials, and (2) of the consequences of default.\u201d <em>McBride v. Sharpe, </em>25 F.3d 962, 968 (11th Cir.1994) (en banc). The district court fulfilled its obligation here. As the record shows, Cauley moved for summary judgment on June 5, 2014, and Appellees moved for summary judgment on June 11, 2014. On July 14, 2014, the district court entered an \u2022 order providing <em>\u201c[p]ro se </em>Defendant Cau-ley\u201d with \u201cthe notice requirements mandated by Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c),\u201d including his \u201cright to file affidavits or other material, and the consequences of default.\u201d In fact, the district court specifically warned Cau-ley \u201cthat final judgment may be entered without a trial and that the moving party\u2019s evidence may be accepted as true if not contradicted by sworn affidavits.\u201d Accordingly, the district ordered that \u201c[t]he parties should file affidavits or other material in opposition to the opposing party\u2019s summary judgment motion on or before <em>August 12, 201k </em>[when the court took the motions for summary judgment under advisement].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">The district court\u2019s order clearly and' plainly warned Cauley that he would have to submit affidavits or responsive eviden-tiary material to prevent the district court from accepting the Appellees\u2019 evidence as true and granting summary judgment in their favor without a trial. Our precedent does not require a district court to provide that notice at an oral hearing. <em>See Griffith v. Wainwright, </em>772 F.2d 822, 825 (11th Cir.1985) (per curiam) (\u201c[I]t is well settled in this Circuit that [the Rule 56 notice] requirement does not of necessity require that such notice be given at an oral hearing. ...\u201d). Since the district court provided Cauley with the required notice, it could then \u201cproperly take [Appellees\u2019] motion under advisement ... [and] rule on the motion consistent with the dictates of procedural fairness required by Rule 56,\u201d even though Cauley was proceeding without the assistance of counsel. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the district court committed no error when it provided Cauley with notice before it ruled on the motions for summary judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">As for Cauley\u2019s alternative claim that there are disputed, material facts that rendered improper the grant of summary judgment, Cauley did not raise this issue in his opening brief before this Court. Rather, he argued it for the first time in his reply brief. \u201cIt is well settled in this [C]ireuit that an argument not included in the appellant\u2019s opening brief is deemed abandoned. And presenting the argument in the appellant\u2019s reply does not somehow resurrect it.\u201d <em>Davis v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consol., </em>516 F.3d 955, 972 (11th Cir.2008) (citation omitted). Thus, Cauley has abandoned this argument and we need not consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">However, even if we were to consider the argument, it would still fail on the merits. Cauley claims that the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>court erroneously found as a matter of law that he violated the terms of the Settlement Agreement \u2014 since, he says, the Settlement Agreement declared only that the parties had to remove \u201canything about one another or their respective churches from all websites <em>under their control,\u201d </em>but that the specific violations the district court found involved content that was not within his control to remove. He claims that the offending statements were posted on accounts that he could no longer access because they had been disabled by the host. But drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of Cauley, the record evidence still demonstrates that he retained control over the offending statements after the Settlement Agreement mandated their removal. The district court detailed undisputed evidence provided by Appellees showing that Cauley himself originally posted the statements on ULC HQ\u2019s web sites and on \u201cRationalWiki.\u201d Further, Appellees\u2019 evidence clearly demonstrates that Cauley posted and made revisions to offending statements as late as September 12, 2013 \u2014 nearly eight months after the removal date dictated by the Settlement Agreement. And all of the challenged statements were either posted or remained in existence beyond the January 15, 2018, date dictated by the Settlement Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">In the face of this evidence, and to claim that he did not have control over the offending statements, Cauley relies solely on a printout of a Google support page that he attached to his motion for summary judgment. The support page provides guidance in the event that a user\u2019s account has been disabled. However, the support page printout does not state the date that any particular account may have been disabled. Nor is it linked in any way to Cauley\u2019s own account. Moreover, the printout expressly says that \u201c[y]our account has not been deleted[;] your data is still intact and it might be possible to regain access to your account.\u201d Appellees provided sworn affidavits from persons \u201cfamiliar with internet and website postings\u201d who averred that even if Cauley could not immediately access his account, he could \u201cregain access ... by following the [host\u2019s] requirements,\u201d or, alternatively, he could \u201crequest that the post[s] be removed by the host.\u201d Stated simply, the undated, generic support page provided by Cauley does not create a genuine issue of material fact, and the district court committed no error when it granted summary judgment in Appellees\u2019 favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b864-5\">. Because we find that the district court committed no error, we need not address the Appellees\u2019 argument regarding harmless error. \u25a0 <em>See Trustmark Ins. Co. v. ESLU, Inc., </em>299 F.3d 1265, 1268 (11th Cir.2002) (noting that insufficient Rule 56 notice is harmless where notwithstanding any error, \"the nonmoving party [has had] an opportunity to marshal its resources and rebut the motion for summary judgment with every factual and legal argument available\u201d (alterations adopted) (quotation omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
