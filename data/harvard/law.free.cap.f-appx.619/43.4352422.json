The Government moves to summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. For the following reasons, we will grant the Government\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-25\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-26\">In November 2004, a federal jury found Patton guilty of more than twenty-five counts of drug-related felonies, including: one count each of conspiring to distribute one kilogram or more of heroin, five kilograms or more of cocaine, and fifty grams or more of cocaine base; and one count of possession with intent to distribute 100 grams or more of heroin. At sentencing, the District Court found that Patton was responsible for at least six hundred grams of cocaine base and ten kilograms of heroin, which put his base offense level at 36 under the United States Sentencing Guidelines in effect at that time. <em>See </em>former U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(2). The District Court further found that Patton\u2019s offense level should be increased by two based on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>conviction for possession of a firearm, for a total offense level of 38. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). An offense level of 38, combined with Patton\u2019s criminal history category of IV, resulted in an advisory sentencing range of 324 to 405 months of imprisonment. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 5, Part A, table.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">The District Court sentenced Patton to an aggregate term of 360 months. We affirmed the convictions and sentences on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Patton, </em>292 Fed.Appx. 159 (3d Cir.2008) (not prec-edential).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">In 2010, Patton filed a motion to vacate his convictions and sentences pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, alleging a violation of his Sixth Amendment rights to both a fair and public trial, and to the effective assistance of counsel. The District Court denied relief, and, after granting a partial certificate of appealability, we affirmed the District Court\u2019s judgment. <em>United States v. Patton, </em>502 Fed.Appx. 139 (3d Cir.2012) (not precedential).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">In December 2012', Patton filed a motion to reduce his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on Amendment 750, which reduced the crack-related offense levels in \u00a7 2D1.1 of the Guidelines, and Amendment 759, which made Amendment 750 retroactive. The District Court denied relief, explaining that Amendment 750 did not lower the applicable Guidelines range. The District Court also noted that, to the extent that Patton was attempting to challenge its determination that he was responsible for ten kilograms of heroin, he could not do so in \u00e1 motion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">In August 2014, Patton filed a second motion pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the motion at issue in this appeal, contending that he was now eligible for a reduction in sentence under Amendment 750 because the Government had recently admitted that the District Court\u2019s drug quantity determination was not supported by any evidence. Patton explained that, in April 2013, he had submitted a request under the Freedom of Information Act to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office seeking documentation relating to the heroin quantity determination, and that, in response, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office had informed him that it had nothing responsive to his request other than trial transcripts. Patton interpreted the U.S. Attorney\u2019s response as a \u201cconcession\u201d that the District Court\u2019s quantity finding was baseless, and asked the District Court to resentence him on this ground. Patton also requested an eviden-tiary hearing and in camera inspection in connection with his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">Upon review, the District Court denied Patton\u2019s second \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, referring to the reasons it provided in its order denying his first. The District Court also denied Patton\u2019s requests for a hearing and in camera inspection. Patton now appeals from the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">We have jurisdiction over the appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review of the District Court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines and review the denial of Patton\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Mateo, </em>560 F.3d 152, 154 (3d Cir.2009). \u25a0 We may summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s decision if an appeal presents no substantial question. 3d Cir. LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-12\">Pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce the sentence of a defendant \u201cwho has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d A district court may not reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if the change to the Sentenc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>ing Guidelines \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2); <em>see also United States v. Ware, </em>694 F.3d 527, 531 (3d Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The District Court acted within its discretion in denying Patton \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. Patton sought a reduction in his sentence based on his contention that the District Court\u2019s drug quantity determination was unsupported. As the court noted, however, the scope of its resentencing authority was limited to any changes that would result from application of the retroactive amendment \u2014 here, Amendment 750. Section 3582(c)(2) \u201cdoes not authorize a resentencing,\u201d but only \u201cpermits a sentence reduction within the narrow bounds established by the [United States Sentencing] Commission.\u201d <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 831, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>see also United States v. McBride, </em>283 F.3d 612, 615 (3d Cir.2002) (explaining that a \u201cfull resentenc-ing\u201d is not permitted upon a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion). Thus, the District Court lacked the authority to address Patton\u2019s challenge to its drug quantity determination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Furthermore, we have reviewed the record and agree with the District Court that Patton\u2019s Guidelines range would not have been different if Amendment 750 had been in effect at the time of his sentencing. The Guideline for drug conspiracy and distribution violations is found at U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. According to Application Note 8 in the Commentary to \u00a7 2D1.1, the Drug Equivalency Tables are to be used for conversion of different controlled substances to obtain a single offense level; each type of drug is converted to its marijuana equivalent, and the marijuana equivalencies are added to determine the combined marijuana equivalency. Amendment 750 reduced the equivalency factor for one gram of cocaine base from twenty kilograms to 3.571 kilograms of marijuana. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, Application Note 10; <em>id. </em>App. C, Arndt. 750. The equivalency for heroin did not change; it remained one kilogram of marijuana to one gram of heroin. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2D1.1, Application Note 10. Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1 (c)(2), a defendant responsible for at least 10,000 kilograms but less than 30,000 kilograms of marijuana is assigned a base offense level of 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">The District Court found that Patton was responsible for at least six hundred grams of crack cocaine and ten kilograms of heroin. Ten kilograms of heroin is the equivalent of 10,000 kilograms of marijuana. Thus, the heroin quantity alone meets the threshold of at least 10,000 kilograms of marijuana equivalency, which results in a base offense level of 36. In any event, with respect to the cocaine base attributed to Patton, even though Amendment 750 would reduce the marijuana equivalency from 12,000 to 2,142.6 kilograms, such amount, when combined with 10,000 kilo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>grams of marijuana equivalency for the heroin, still places him within the 10,000-to-30,000-kilogram range that produces a base offense level of 36. For these reasons, Amendment 750 does not lower Patton\u2019s sentencing range. <em>Cf. Ware, </em>694 F.3d at 532 (explaining that Amendment 750 did not affect the guideline range where defendants were career offenders).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Finally, because we perceive no abuse of discretion in the District Court\u2019s decision to deny Patton \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief, we likewise perceive no error in the court\u2019s decision to deny his motions for a hearing and in camera inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that this appeal presents no substantial question. Accordingly, we will grant the Government\u2019s motion and summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>3d Cm. LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6. Patton\u2019s motions for appointment of counsel and motion to remand for evidentiary hearing or in camera inspection are denied as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b69-17\"> This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b71-7\">. To the extent that Patton was essentially . asking the District Court to revisit its drug quantity determination, the District Court could have construed his purported \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion as an unauthorized \u00a7 2255 motion, <em>see United States v. Carter, </em>500 F.3d 486, 490 (6th Cir.2007) (explaining that, when a motion styled as a \u00a7 3582 motion does not in fact seek a sentence reduction based on an amendment to the Guidelines, but instead attacks the underlying conviction or sentence, the motion should be construed as a \u00a7 2255 motion), and, because it would have been second or successive, either dismissed it for lack of jurisdiction or transferred it to this Court for consideration under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h), <em>see Robinson v. Johnson, </em>313 F.3d 128, 139 (3d Cir.2002) (stating that if a habeas petitioner erroneously files a second or successive habeas petition \"in a district court without the permission of a court of appeals, the district court's only option[s are] to dismiss the petition or transfer it to the court of appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
