O\u2019Dell argues on appeal that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to Pacific Indemnity because: (1) the.court failed to consider covered claims for physical damage; (2) diminution in value resulting from misrepresentation amounts to covered property damage; and (3) even if no coverage existed, Pacific Indemnity breached its duty to defend the Mahoneys. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-21\">We review an order granting summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing all of the facts in the light most favorable to the non-movant. <em>Brooks v. Cnty. Comm\u2019n of Jefferson Cnty., Ala., </em>446 F.3d 1160, 1161-62 (11th Cir.2006). Summary judgment is appropriate where \u201cthe movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(a). After the party moving for summary judgment shows the absence of a genuine issue of material fact, the burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>shifts to the non-movant, who must present affirmative evidence to show that a genuine issue of material fact exists. <em>Porter v. Ray, </em>461 F.3d 1315, 1320 (11th Cir.2006). We may affirm the district court\u2019s judgment based on \u201cany ground supported by the record, regardless of whether' that ground was relied upon ox-even considered by the district court.\u201d <em>Kernel Records Oy v. Mosley, </em>694 F.3d 1294, 1309 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">\u201cUnder Georgia law [which the parties agree applies], contracts of insurance are interpreted by ordinary rules of contract construction.\u201d <em>Boardman Petroleum, Inc. v. Federated Mut. Ins. Co., </em>269 Ga. 326, 498 S.E.2d 492, 494 (1998). Where the terms are unambiguous, we \u201clook to the contract alone to ascertain the parties\u2019 intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although ambiguities ai-e construed against the insurer, we consider the contract as a whole and give each provision its intended effect. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">The facts viewed in the light most favorable to O\u2019Dell are these. The Mahoneys owned a home in Savannah, Georgia (the \u201cProperty\u201d) that was damaged by flooding. The Mahoneys insured the Property with a \u201cMastex-piece\u201d Policy issued by Pacific Indemnity (the \u201cPolicy\u201d). The Policy included \u201cPersonal Liability Coverage,\u201d covering \u201cdamages a covered person is legally obligated to pay for personal injury or property damage which take[s] place anytime during the policy period and are caused by an occurrence.\u201d Thus, Pacific Indemnity was obliged to defend the Ma-honeys from \u201cany suit seeking covered damages for personal injury or property damage.\u201d \u201cProperty damage\u201d was defined as \u201cphysical injury to or destruction of tangible property, including the loss of its use.\u201d \u201cOccurrence\u201d was defined as \u201can accident or offense to which this insurance applies and which begins within the policy pei-iod. Continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same genei-al conditions unless excluded is considei-ed to be one occurrence.\u201d <em>However, </em>\u201c[d]amage to covered person\u2019s property\u201d was excluded from the Personal Liability Coverage\u2014 meaning there was no personal liability coverage \u201cfor property damage to property owned by any covered person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">Philip O\u2019Dell contracted to purchase the Property. As part of the agreement, O\u2019Dell received a disclosure statement that omitted the prior flooding experienced by the Mahoneys. The sale of the Property closed on February 14, 2005, and the Ma-honeys cancelled the Masterpiece policy effective February 15,2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">Sometime later, O\u2019Dell experienced flooding and septic problems at the Property. He subsequently learned that the Property had sustained flood damage while the Mahoneys owned it. O\u2019Dell filed suit against the Mahoneys in the State Court of Georgia on March 17, 2008. Through a series of amended complaints, O\u2019Dell alleged claims against the Maho-neys for negligent failure to disclose prior flooding and septic issues, misrepresentation, and breach of contract relating to the sale of the Property. Specifically, O\u2019Dell ai-gued that his damages included the cost to \u201crepair [flood and septic] damage\u201d and \u201cdiminution of the property\u2019s value.\u201d The Mahoneys requested a defense under the Masterpiece Policy. Pacific Indemnity refused to defend or indemnify the Maho-neys because O\u2019Dell\u2019s complaint did not seek covered damages and, alternatively, because any otherwise covered damages were excluded by the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">Prior to trial in the underlying suit, O\u2019Dell settled with the Mahoneys for the maximum amount of coverage under the Policy ($500,000), but agreed not to enforce the settlement against the Maho-neys. Rather, the Mahoneys assigned to O\u2019Dell their rights and interests in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>claims they had against Pacific Indemnity. O\u2019Dell filed the instant action against Pacific Indemnity in the State Court of Georgia seeking damages, as assignee, for Pacific Indemnity\u2019s \u201cbad faith\u201d refusal to defend and indemnify the Mahoneys in the underlying litigation. Pacific Indemnity removed this suit to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia. The district court granted Pacific Indemnity\u2019s motion for summary judgment, finding that O\u2019Dell\u2019s complaint did not allege covered \u201cproperty damage\u201d because it alleged only economic losses, which were not covered by the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">? first argument on appeal is that the damages he alleged in the underlying suit were not purely economic. Rather, he also sought the \u201ccost of repairs\u201d for physical damage due to flooding and septic problems. This argument ignores the undisputed facts and the plain language of the Policy. The \u201ccost of repairs\u201d sought by O\u2019Dell could mean one of only two things: (1) the repair of damage that occurred after O\u2019Dell purchased the Property; or (2) the repair of damage that occurred while the Mahoneys still owned the Property. Neither alternative alleges covered, non-excluded damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">To the extent we construe the underlying complaint to seek repair costs for damage that occurred after the closing, the Policy plainly provides no coverage. The Policy\u2019s Personal Liability Coverage unambiguously states that it covers only \u201cproperty damage which takes place anytime during the policy period and [is] caused by an occurrence.\u201d Because the Mahoneys cancelled the Policy on February 15, 2005, any post-closing flood damage did not \u201ctake[] place anytime during the policy period.\u201d Thus, no coverage exists under the unambiguous terms of the Policy. <em>See Planters &amp; Citizens Bank v. Home Ins. Co., </em>786 F.Supp. 977, 985-87 (S.D.Ga.1992) (noting that, under Georgia law, physical damage sustained outside the effective date of an insurance policy is not covered).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">To the extent we construe O\u2019Dell\u2019s underlying complaint to seek repair costs for damage that occurred while the Maho-neys still owned the Property, his argument likewise fails. \u201cDamage to covered person\u2019s property\u201d is expressly excluded from the Personal Liability Coverage. Thus, any liability for flood damage that occurred while the Mahoneys owned the property would be excluded as personal liability \u201cfor property damage to property owned by any covered person [here, the Mahoneys].\u201d <em>See, e.g., Claussen v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>754 F.Supp. 1576, 1578-79 (S.D.Ga.1990) (noting that owned property exclusions bar coverage for liability arising from damage to property owned by the insured person). Regardless of how we construe O\u2019Dell\u2019s underlying complaint, it did not allege a covered, non-excluded claim for the cost of repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">O\u2019Dell\u2019s second argument is that the Policy provides coverage for the diminution in the Property\u2019s value resulting from the Mahoneys\u2019 misrepresentation that no prior flooding had occurred. But the district court did not err by finding that O\u2019Dell\u2019s claim for diminution in value (a purely economic loss) was not covered \u201cproperty damage.\u201d \u201cProperty damage\u201d is defined by the Policy as \u201cphysical injury to or destruction of tangible property, including the loss of its use.\u201d Assuming that the diminution in value occurred during the Policy period, it still did not involve any <em>-physical </em>injury to or destruction of tangible property and, thus, the Policy does not provide coverage. <em>See Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Bader &amp; Assocs., Inc., </em>No. 2:13-CV-00032-RWS, 2014 WL 231980, at *4 (N.D.Ga. Jan. 22, 2014) (\u201cThe damages claimed [loss of the rental value of more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>than 20 homes caused by a misrepresentation regarding the number of functional bedrooms in light of limited septic capacity] ... are purely economic losses- which do not constitute \u2018property damage\u2019 under the- definition in the Policies at issue.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-15\">Indeed, courts have noted that \u201ccases are virtually unanimous in their holdings that damages flowing from misrepresentation and/or fraud have no basis in property damage.\u201d <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Brewer, </em>914 F.Supp. 140, 142 (S.D.Miss. 1996); <em>see id. </em>(\u201c[T]he only cognizable damages from such torts are economic and contractual in nature and as such do not fall within the scope of coverage afforded by policies like [the one at hand].\u201d); <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of Am. v. Andrews, </em>915 F.2d 500, 502 (9th Cir.1990) (noting that a misrepresentation that materially impacts the value of a property does not constitute \u201cdamage to tangible property,\u201d but. only \u201ceconomic loss,\u201d which is \u201coutside the scope of the [insurance] policy\u201d). Because O\u2019Dell\u2019s claim for diminution in value was purely economic in nature, the district court did not err by finding that it did not constitute covered \u201cproperty damage\u201d under the Policy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-16\">Finally, O\u2019Dell argues that even if the Policy does not provide coverage for the underlying claims, Pacific Indemnity breached its obligation to defend the Ma-honeys. It is true that \u201can insurer\u2019s duty to defend is broader than its duty to indemnify.\u201d <em>Shafe v. Am. States Ins. Co., </em>288 Ga.App. 315, 653 S.E.2d 870, 873 (2007). The Policy itself contemplates an obligation to provide coverage \u201ceven if the suit is groundless, false, or fraudulent.\u201d However, both meritorious and non-meritorious suits may allege facts that do not implicate coverage \u2014 yielding no duty for the insured to defend. <em>See Great Am. Ins. Co. v. McKemie, </em>244 Ga. 84, 259 S.E.2d 39, 40 (1979) (\u201c[A] distinction must be drawn between groundless suits and actions which, even if suecessful[,] .would not be within the policy coverage.\u201d (quotation omitted)). As demonstrated above, even taking all of the facts alleged by O\u2019Dell as true, he simply did not allege a claim that would be covered by the Policy. Thus, the district court did not err by finding <em>no </em>duty for Pacific Indemnity to defend the Mahoneys in the underlying suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b858-17\">. O'Dell relies primarily on a Supreme Court of Colorado case to argue that economic damages resulting from a misrepresentation in the sale of property can constitute covered \"property damage.\" <em>See Cyprus Amax Minerals Co. v. Lexington Ins. Co., </em>74 P.3d 294 (Colo.2003). However, <em>Cyprus </em>involved an alleged misrepresentation in the sale of a mine that was insured by a policy with a \u201ccompleted operations\u201d clause \u2014 extending coverage beyond the date of the sale \u2014 which expressly contemplated that \" \u2018property damage\u2019 can arise from 'reliance on a representation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 307. Thus, <em>Cyprus </em>does not support a different result in this case. In any event, we\u2019re bound by Georgia law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
