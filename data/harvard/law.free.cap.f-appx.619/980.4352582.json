Over the course of four years, Graziotti documented in photographs and videos his sexual abuse of 29 children, all younger than 12 years old and some as young as 6 years old. The scope of his vile conduct was revealed in July 2014, when law enforcement agents executed a search warrant at his home and discovered that he had saved those photographs and videos, in addition to thousands of other images of child pornography, on his computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-19\">In July 2014, Graziotti was indicted on seven counts of sexually exploiting a minor .(producing child pornography), in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a); one count of distributing child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(2)(A); and one count of possessing child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C, \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B). He pled guilty to all charges without a plea agreement, and the District Court sentenced him to consecutive prison terms of 30 years on each of the seven \u00a7 2251(a) counts,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and concurrent prison terms of 20 years op the two remaining counts <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for a total imprisonment of 210 years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-20\">Graziotti appeals this . 210-years\u2019 sentence of imprisonment. He argues that the sentence \u2014 though technically a downward variance from the Guidelines prescribed sentence \u2014 is substantively unreasonable because it is \u201cdefinitionally excessive as a means of general deterrence or incapacitation.\u201d He contends that the statutory goals of deterrence and protecting the public from further crimes of the defendant could be adequately served by a lesser sentence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>would still keep him in prison for the remainder of his life. And because a sentence of 210 years is several times greater than his remaining life expectancy, it is by definition \u201cgreater than necessary\u201d to serve the purposes of sentencing prescribed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">We review the'reasonableness of a district court\u2019s sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard of review. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The district court is required to impose a sentence that is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the purposes\u201d of sentencing listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to reflect\u2019 the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). In imposing a particular sentence, the court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable Guideline sentence range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">Graziotti has not shown that the 210-years prison term is substantively unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The term meets the purposes of sentencing set out in \u00a7 3553(a). That Graziotti\u2019s sentence is physically impossible to serve during his lifetime does not render it unreasonable. \u201cChild sex crimes are among the most egregious and despicable of societal and criminal offenses, and courts have upheld lengthy sentences in these cases as substantively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Sarras, </em>575 F.3d 1191, 1220-21 (11th Cir.2009) (upholding a 100-year sentence for producing child pornography). A sentence that is clearly longer than the defendant\u2019s remaining life expectancy is not <em>per se </em>unreasonable. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Johnson, </em>451 F.3d 1239, 1243-44 (11th Cir.2006) (finding a 140-year sentence for offenses of producing and distributing child pornography reasonable); <em>United States v. Betcher, </em>534 F.3d 820, 828 (8th Cir.2008) (persuasive authority holding \u201cThe absurdity of a 750 year sentence, or even a 10,000 year sentence, should not detract from the gravity of [a child pornography producer\u2019s] crimes.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-8\">The 210-years\u2019 prison term Graziotti received is not substantively unreasonable. The district court\u2019s judgment is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1006-16\">.
