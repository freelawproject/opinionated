The case arises out of a car accident in which Cuong Nguyen, driving a vehicle insured by State Farm, improperly struck a vehicle driven by Erica McKeel, who was seven-months\u2019 pregnant. As a result of the accident, Ms. McKeel\u2019s baby was bom prematurely and, sadly, died from injuries sustained in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-12\">In a subsequent state court case involving the McKeels, Limelight and Cuong Nguyen, the McKeels obtained a jury verdict against Cuong Nguyen in excess of $3,000,000. Following entry of judgment in that case, Cuong Nguyen and Minh Nguyen assigned\u2019 their interest in any claim they might have had against State Farm- to the McKeels. Based on that assignment, the McKeels filed this suit, alleging that State Farm acted in bad faith before and during the state court case by refusing to settle on Cuong Nguyen\u2019s behalf within the policy limits. The district court granted summary judgment to State Farm, concluding that the McKeels had failed to identify any issue of material fact concerning their bad-faith claim. On appeal, the McKeels argue that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on their bad faith claim because\u2019 State Farm: (1) negligently created a conflict of interest that injured Cuong Nguyen; (2) negligently failed to provide all material facts of the underlying situation to Cuong Nguyen; and (3) violated its own policies in the adjustment of the case. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, applying the same legal standard as the trial court. <em>Watkins v. Ford Motor Co., </em>190 F.3d 1218, 1216 (11th Cir.1999). Summary judgment is proper if \u201cthe movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-14\">Under Georgia law, \u201cwhere a person injured by an insured offers to settle for a sum within the policy limits, and the insurer refuses the offer of settlement, the insurer may be liable to the insured to pay the verdict rendered against the insured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>even though the verdict exceeds the policy limit of liability.\u201d <em>McCall v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>251 Ga. 869, 810 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1984). We\u2019ve said that, \u201c[a]t a minimum, ... Georgia law mandates that the insured show that settlement was possible \u2014 the case could have been settled within the policy limits \u2014 and that the insurer knew, or reasonably should have known, of this fact.\u201d <em>Delancy v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>947 F.2d 1586, 1550 (11th Cir.1991). The elements of a negligence claim in Georgia are \u201cduty, breach, proximate cause, and damages.\u201d <em>Cotton States Mut. Ins. Co. v. Brightman, </em>256 Ga.App. 451, 568 S.E.2d 498, 500 (2002). An assignee under Georgia law \u201cstands in the shoes\u201d of the assignor and has no greater rights than the assignor possessed at the time of the assignment. <em>See S. Telecom, Inc. v. TW Telecom of Ga. L.P., </em>321 Ga.App. 110, 741 S.E.2d 234, 238 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">First, we are unpersuaded by the McKeels\u2019 claim that State Farm acted in bad faith by negligently creating a conflict of interest that injured Cuong Nguyen. The undisputed record in this case reveals that before and during the state court proceedings, State Farm repeatedly offered the McKeels the policy limits ($50,-000.00 for Ms. McKeel\u2019s personal injury claim and a separate $50,000.00 for the claim of her minor child) in exchange for limited releases of liability \u2014 releases concerning Cuong Nguyen, Minh Nguyen, and Limelight, as insureds under the policy. The record also reveals that the McKeels rejected all offers that included Limelight as a releasee, and fails to show that State Farm knew, or reasonably should have known, that settlement was possible. Indeed, the McKeels offer no case law supporting the idea that State Farm should have abandoned one of its insureds (Limelight) by not including it as a releasee in the limited liability releases. Instead, Georgia courts have said that \u201cin this state <em>each </em>insured under the policy, whether a named insured or others, is entitled to be defended by the insurer and judgments against such insured paid, within the limits of the policy.\u201d <em>Strain Poultry Farms, Inc. v. Am. S. Ins. Co., </em>128 Ga.App. 600, 197 S.E.2d 498, 501 (1973) (emphasis added). Without any Georgia law to the contrary, we are hard-pressed to conclude that State Farm could have acted in bad faith or negligently by equally representing its insureds. <em>See e.g., Shipes v. Hanover Ins. Co., </em>884 F.2d 1357, 1361 (11th Cir.1989) (\u201c[B]ad faith means a frivolous and unfounded denial of liability.... Where questions of law ... have not been decided by the courts of Georgia and are not of easy solution, then a finding of ... bad faith ... [is] not authorized.\u201d) (quoting <em>State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co. v. Harper, </em>125 Ga.App. 696, 188 S.E.2d 813, 817 (1972)). Nor is there any basis for the McKeels\u2019 reliance on attorney-client conflict-of-interest cases. The district court did not err in granting summary judgment on the McKeels\u2019 conflict-of-interest claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">We also are unpersuaded by the McKeels\u2019 argument that State Farm negligently failed to provide all material facts of the underlying situation to Cuong Nguyen \u2014 that is, that the McKeels were \u201cwilling to release him individually.\u201d The McKeels\u2019 claim is merely another way of arguing that State Farm should have abandoned Limelight by removing it from the release document. As we\u2019ve explained above, this argument has no merit. In addition, as the undisputed record shows, counsel retained- by State Farm to defend its insureds met with the purported owners of Limelight on several occasions to see if they would consent for Limelight to be removed from the release and they would not. There is nothing in the record to indicate that Cuong Nguyen\u2019s knowledge of any additional material facts would have led to a different result, especially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>given the Limelight owners\u2019 refusal to consent as well as Limelight\u2019s alleged ownership issues. The district court did not err in granting summary judgment on this negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">Finally, we reject the McKeels\u2019 argument that State Farm violated its own policies in adjusting the claim. In Georgia, a corporation\u2019s failure to abide by its own written guidelines is evidence of negligence. <em>Luckie v. Piggly-Wiggly So., Inc., </em>173 Ga.App. 177, 325 S.E.2d 844, 845 (1984). The McKeels rely on language in State Farm\u2019s policy that gave it a duty to \u201cdiligently investigate the facts to determine if a claim is valid.\u201d' However, as we\u2019ve detailed, the record reveals that State Farm began offering its entire policy limits before it received any demand from anyone for any amount. There is nothing in the record to indicate that State Farm was not diligent in investigating whether the insurance claim was valid, and the district court did not err in granting summary judgment on this negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
