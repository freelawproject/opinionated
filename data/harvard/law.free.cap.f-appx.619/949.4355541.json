The presen-tence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) held him accountable for 483 total kilograms of cocaine, based in part on a 450-kilogram shipment. Prior to sentencing, Vives proposed an amendment to the PSI\u2019s factual descriptions of his offense conduct, in which he also acknowledged the 450-kilo-gram amount. At sentencing, the district court did not make any explicit cocaine-quantity finding, but consistently referenced the 300-kilogram amount in explaining to Vives that he could not contest the facts to which he had agreed to plead guilty. In its later \u00a7 3582(c)(2) order, the district court stated that Vives was ineligible for relief under Amendment 782, as his \u201c[l]arge quantity of drugs\u201d kept his base offense level at 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-10\">On appeal, Vives asserts that the district court at sentencing \u201coverruled\u201d the PSI\u2019s higher drug-quantity findings by adopting the lesser 300-kilogram cocaine amount from the factual proffer. Thus, Vives contends he was eligible for a two-level reduction in his offense level under Amendment 782 and that the court failed to properly consider whether such a reduction was warranted in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district\u2019s court\u2019s legal conclusions as to the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-12\">Once pronounced, a district court\u2019s authority to modify a sentence of imprisonment is narrowly limited by statute. <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>597 <em>F.3d </em>1190, 1194-95 (11th Cir.2010). Nevertheless, a district court may modify a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment where the defendant was sentenced \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Where an amendment does not have the effect of lowering a defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief is unauthorized. <em>Id.; </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-13\">A district court must engage in a two-step analysis when considering a motion for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). First, the court must determine the sentence it would have imposed given the defendant\u2019s amended guideline range and holding all other guideline findings made at the original sentencing hearing constant. <em>Id. </em>Second, the court must consider the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and then determine, in its discretion, whether to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 781; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(B)(i)). If a court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>decides that a defendant is eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief, it must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and public safety in determining whether such a reduction is warranted, and, if so, , to what extent. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256 (11th Cir.2009); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(B)(i), (ii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">Under the 2005 Sentencing Guidelines, the amount of cocaine necessary to qualify a defendant for a base offense level of 38 is 150 kilograms or more. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(3), (c)(1) (2005). Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines amended \u00a7 2D1.1 by revising the Drug Quantity Table in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 782. In pertinent part, Amendment 782 increased the amount of cocaine necessary to qualify for a base offense level of 38 from 150 kilograms or more to 450 kilograms or more. <em>Compare </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 201.1(a)(3), (c)(1) (2005), <em>with </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(5), (c)(1) (2014); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 782. The Amendment likewise increased the amount of cocaine necessary to qualify for a base offense level of 36 from at least 50 kilograms, but less than 150 kilograms, to at least 150 kilograms, but less than 450 kilograms. <em>Compare </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(3), (c)(2) (2005), <em>with </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(5), (c)(2) (2014); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 782. Amendment 782 became effective on November 1, 2014, and was made retroactive by Amendment 788 as of the same date. U.S.S.GApp. C, Amends. 782 &amp; 788; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">Upon review of the entire record and after consideration of the parties\u2019 appellate briefs, we affirm. Here, by concluding in its order denying Vives\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion that he was ineligible for relief because the quantity of cocaine attributable to him kept his base offense level at 38, the district court implicitly clarified that its prior drug-quantity finding at the original sentencing hearing was 483 kilograms of cocaine, as reflected in the PSI, rather than the 300-kilogram amount reflected in the government\u2019s factual proffer. Because a 483-kilogram quantity qualifies Vives for the same base offense level of 38 under \u00a7 2D1.1, even as revised by Amendment 782, that he was assigned at his original sentencing, the Amendment does not have the effect of lowering his applicable guideline range. Thus, the court did not err by concluding he was ineligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief, and denying his motion for a sentence reduction on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
