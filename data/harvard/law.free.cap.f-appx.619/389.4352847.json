Law enforcement agents arrested Ortega after making a controlled delivery of guitars containing heroin, which had been shipped from Mexico by a private company, to Ortega\u2019s father at a vacant house down the street from where Ortega and his father lived. Evidence showed that Ortega had previously induced others to try to smuggle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>methamphetamine into the United States by carrying it across the border.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Ortega first contends that there was insufficient evidence to show that he knowingly agreed with his father to smuggle the heroin. Relevant evidence sufficient to prove this element included testimony that Ortega suspected a law-enforcement set-up and warned his father, testimony that Ortega fled when he saw his father being arrested, telephone conversations with an undercover agent in which Ortega revealed his knowledge of the drug-smuggling scheme, and extrinsic evidence that Ortega had previously conspired with others to smuggle drugs. After viewing the evidence, the reasonable inferences therefrom, and all credibility determinations in favor of the verdict, we conclude that any rational jury could have found that the government proved the elements of the crime. <em>See Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Concerning the extrinsic evidence of methamphetamine-smuggling, Ortega claims that it was inadmissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b). We review that ruling \u201cunder a heightened abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Alarcon, </em>261 F.3d 416, 424 (5th Cir.2001). Nonetheless, the district court had \u201cconsiderable discretion\u201d in admitting the evidence, and our review is \u201chighly deferential.\u201d <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>976 F.2d 927, 929 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Rule 404(b)(1) precludes the admission of \u201c[evidence of a crime, wrong, or act ... to prove a person\u2019s character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 404(b)(1). Such evidence may, however, \u201cbe admissible for another purpose, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 404(b)(2). The extrinsic evidence must first be \u201crelevant to an issue other than the defendant\u2019s character.\u201d <em>United States v. Beechum, </em>582 F.2d 898, 911 (5th Cir.1978) (en banc). \u201c[T]he relevancy of the extrinsic offense derives from the defendant\u2019s indulging himself in the same state of mind in the perpetration of both the extrinsic and charged offenses.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">Although Ortega\u2019s prior offense involved a different drug and a different method of smuggling, evidence of drug-trafficking is typically probative of a defendant\u2019s knowledge and intent to commit a charged drug offense. <em>United States v. Duffaut, </em>314 F.3d 203, 209 (5th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Broussard, </em>80 F.3d 1025, 1030, 1039-40 (5th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Bermea, </em>30 F.3d 1539, 1549, 1560-62 (5th Cir.1994); <em>cf. United States v. Saucedo-Munoz, </em>307 F.3d 344, 349-50 (5th Cir.2002) (stating that drug-smuggling conviction was admissible to show that defendant knew drugs were concealed in connection with the charged offense); <em>United States v. Elwood, </em>999 F.2d 814, 815-16 <em>&amp; </em>n. 3 (5th Cir.1993) (noting that prior possession of drug-trafficking paraphernalia \u201ctends to negate [the defendant\u2019s] assertion that he knew nothing\u201d of illicit drugs in the charged case).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">The district court aptly concluded that the crimes were sufficiently similar to make the evidence relevant to Ortega\u2019s knowledge, his intent to plan, and an absence of mistake or lack of accident in the sense that the heroin did not merely show up fortuitously where Ortega happened to be. In addition, some of the testimony about the prior smuggling v\u00e9nture was probative of an existing connection between Ortega, Alfonso, and Mexican drug traffickers.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">The evidence must also \u201cpossess probative value that is not substantially outweighed by its undue prejudice and must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>meet the other requirements of [Federal Rule of Evidence] 408.\u201d <em>Beechwn, </em>582 F.2d at 911. Even relevant evidence may be excluded \u201cif its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or more of the following: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.\u201d Fed. R.Evid. 403. The test is not for \u201cany\u201d prejudice, but only for \u201cundue prejudice\u201d that \u201csubstantially\u201d outweighs the probative value of the evidence. <em>Beechum, </em>582 F.2d at 911. \u201cA bald assertion that the probative value of extrinsic offense evidence was substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect does not show an abuse of discretion by the district court.\u201d <em>Bermea, </em>30 F.3d at 1562.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The extrinsic evidence tended to prove that Ortega was not an innocent bystander, unaware that his father was involved in drug-trafficking. Further, as the district court noted, the extrinsic evidence was not inflammatory, cumulative, provocative, heinous, or likely to incite the jury to make an irrational decision. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 403; <em>United States v. McMahon, </em>592 F.2d 871, 876 (5th Cir.1979). Finally, the risk of unfair prejudice was minimized by the court\u2019s instructions to the jury that testimony about other acts could be considered only for the specific limited purposes set forth in Rule 404(b)(2). <em>McMahon, </em>592 F.2d at 876. \u2018 Ortega fails to show that the court abused its discretion by admitting evidence about his proper smuggling efforts. <em>See Alarcon, </em>261 F.3d at 424; <em>Anderson, </em>976 F.2d at 929.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b415-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
