Madiedo moved for a reduction based on Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-22\">In 2012, Madiedo pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute at least 500 grams of methamphetamine. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. Ma-diedo admitted that he was responsible for 1.066 kilograms of methamphetamine and .623 kilograms of a substance containing a detectable amount of methamphetamine, which was equivalent to 22,567 kilograms of marijuana. Madiedo had a base offense of 36, United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(5), (c)(2) (Nov. 2011), and received a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.1. With an adjusted offense level of 33 and a criminal history of III, Madiedo had an advisory guideline range between 168 and 210 months of imprisonment. The district court varied downward from the advisory range and sentenced Madiedo to 140 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-23\">In 2014, Madiedo moved to reduce his sentence under Amendment 782. Madiedo requested a two-level reduction of his offense level and a downward variance from his amended guideline range. The government agreed that Madiedo was entitled to a reduction of his sentence, \u201cbut only to the bottom of the newly revised guidelines, here 135 months.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-24\">The district court granted Madiedo's motion and reduced his sentence from 140 to 135 months of imprisonment. The district court entered an order stating that the motion was \u201cbased on a guideline sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered and made retroactive by the United States Sentencing Commission.\u201d The sentence reduction, the district court stated, took \u201cinto account the policy statement set forth at USSG \u00a7 1B1.10 and the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), to the extent that they are applicable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority\u201d to reduce a sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines, <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1866, 1368 (11th Cir.2008), and we review its decision whether to grant or deny the motion for abuse of discretion, <em>id. </em>at 1368 n. 1. A district court may reduce a term of imprisonment when the defendant\u2019s guideline range is lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). After the district court recalculates the sentence under the amended guidelines, it must decide, in the light of the statutory sentencing factors, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a), \u201cwhether, in its discretion, it will elect to impose the newly calculated sentence under the amended guidelines or retain the original sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780-81 (11th Cir.2000). Any reduction must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), which preclude a \u201cfull resentencing of the defendant,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 IB 1.10(a)(3); <em>see Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 831, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2694, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">The district court did not err in reducing Madiedo\u2019s sentence to 135 months of imprisonment. Madiedo argues that he is entitled to a base offense level of 30 based on a lesser quantity of drugs than were attributed to him at sentencing, but when considering a reduction of sentence \u201call original sentencing determinations remain unchanged,\u201d <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781. Based on the amended drug table, the district court correctly assigned Madiedo an offense level of 34, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(3), which, with a three-level reduction for his acceptance of responsibility and a criminal history of III, resulted in an amended sentencing range between 135 and 168 months of imprisonment, <em>id. </em>Ch. 5, Pt. A. Madiedo argues that he was entitled to a downward variance from the low end of his amended range, but the Sentencing Guidelines prohibit the district court from reducing a sentence \u201cto a term ... less than the minimum of the amended guideline range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A). That limitation applies even though \u201cthe term of imprisonment imposed was outside the guideline range applicable to [Madie-do] at the time of sentencing.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">We AFFIRM Madiedo\u2019s amended sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
