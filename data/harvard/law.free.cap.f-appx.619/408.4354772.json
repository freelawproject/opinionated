By seeking leave to proceed IFP, Ervin is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. R. App. P. 24(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">Ervin argues that he was eligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 782. He asserts that his original base offense level should have been 12 and should be reduced to 10 after the application of Amendment 782 because no drug quantity was alleged in the indictment, admitted by him, or proven beyond a reasonable doubt. However, because he is not challenging his original sentence, he asserts that'his total offense level must have been either 33 or 34, because those are the only two offense levels that include his sentence of 240 months of imprisonment within the guidelines range at his criminal history category of V. He contends that Amendment 782 then reduced his total offense level by two and reduced his guidelines sentence range. He maintains that the district court judge in his case initially refused to apply the Guidelines when they became effective in 1987 and still refuses to follow the law. He asserts that his appeal is not frivolous because the district court refused to make findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-15\">Ervin\u2019s initial base offense level was 36, based upon the finding that he was responsible for the equivalent of 26,935.2 kilograms of marijuana. His total offense level was 39. His guidelines sentence range and the sentence imposed were 240 months of imprisonment not because his total offense level was 33 or 34 or because the district court refused to follow the law, but because of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(a), which provides that when a guidelines sentence range would otherwise exceed the statutory maximum sentence, the guidelines sentence range, becomes the statutory maximum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-16\">The application of Amendment 782 to Ervin\u2019s case reduces his base offense level to 34 and his total offense level to 37. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(3). With a total offense level of 37 and criminal history category of V, his initial guidelines sentence range would be reduced to 324-405 months of imprisonment from 360 months of imprisonment to life imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G., Ch. 5, Pt. A (sentencing table). Again, the application of \u00a7 5Gl.l(a) would reduce the guidelines sentence range to the statutory maximum sentence of 240 months of imprisonment. As Amendment 782 did \u201cnot have the effect of lowering [Ervin\u2019s] applicable guideline range,\u201d Er-vin was not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>see United States v. Bowman, </em>632 F.3d 906, 910-11 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>As Ervin was ineligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), his appeal does not present a nonfrivolous issue. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b435-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
