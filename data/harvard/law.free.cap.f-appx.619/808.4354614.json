We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">I. Course of Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b835-10\">Isufi is an Albanian citizen who resettled in Greece in 1991. He moved his family there for economic reasons. His wife and two daughters still live in Greece. During his years in Greece, he has returned to Albania for a brief stay once every eighteen months to two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-11\">Isufi arrived in the United States with a fake passport in early April 2014. He was referred immediately to an Immigration Judge for \u201cAsylum Only\u201d proceedings. Isufi sought asylum under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158 and withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). He also sought CAT protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-12\">Despite inconsistent testimony and documents, the Immigration Judge found that Isufi testified \u201cconsistently and credibly.\u201d (AR 69-70). The Immigration Judge concluded that Isufi had proven only that he was the victim of a family dispute. <em>(Id. </em>70). The Immigration Judge also concluded that Isufi had resettled in Greece over twenty years earlier, or that, at least, he had a safe haven there. <em>(Id. </em>71). And, despite Isufi\u2019s testimony that ethnic Albanians suffered prejudice in Greece, the Immigration Judge concluded that Isufi was not seeking asylum from Greece. The Immigration Judge further found that Isu-fi could relocate within Albania and avoid the actual or feared harm upon which he based his refugee status. <em>(Id. </em>72). As to the application for CAT protection, the Immigration Judge reasoned that no evidence supported Isufi\u2019s claim. <em>(Id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b835-14\">The Immigration Judge denied Isufi\u2019s petition. Isufi appealed to the Board, which reviews an Immigration Judge\u2019s findings of fact for clear error, but reviews all other matters de novo. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(i-ii). The Board, without expressly adopting the Immigration Judge\u2019s opinion, agreed with it in all respects and dismissed Isufi\u2019s appeal. (AR 4-6). In particular, and citing <em>Mazariegos v. United States Attorney General, </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1327 (11th Cir.2001), the Board agreed that Isufi could avoid future harm by relocating within Albania, which negated any need for asylum. (AR 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-15\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b835-16\">Where, as here, the Board relied upon the Immigration Judge\u2019s decision and reasoning without expressly adopting it, we review the Immigration Judge\u2019s opinion and any portion of the Board\u2019s opinion on matters that the Immigration Judge did not cover. <em>Seek v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>663 F.3d 1356, 1364 (11th Cir.2011). We will not disturb the agency\u2019s decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole,\u201d and we will reverse the agency \u201conly when the record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Tan v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1374 (11th Cir.2006) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">The Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General may grant asylum to an alien satisfying the definition of \u201crefugee\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). For our purposes, the determinative factor as to whether Isufi is a refugee as to whom asylum and withholding of removal may be granted is whether he will suffer political persecution if he is returned to Albania. <em>Id.; </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B). But, the Attorney General is prohibited from granting asylum to an alien who \u201cwas firmly resettled in another country prior to arriving in the United States.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 1158(b)(2)(vi).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">On this appeal, Isufi presents three basic contentions. First, he contends that the Board faded to address evidence demonstrating that Isufi and his family were targeted due to his political opinions. But, Isufi has not directed our attention to evidence that compels reversal. Isufi admitted that, for economic reasons, he resettled in Greece years ago. And, substantial evidence supports the Immigration Judge\u2019s conclusion that Isufi\u2019s threat of future harm in Albania emanates from a family dispute in one city in Albania \u2014 not from political persecution. Isufi also has not challenged the Immigration Judge\u2019s conclusion or the Board\u2019s conclusion that he could avoid any harm he fears by relocating within Albania. He has, therefore, waived any challenge to these conclusions. <em>Ruiz v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1256 n. 6 (11th Cir.2006); <em>see Mazariegos, </em>241 F.3d at 1324-25 n. 2 (a withholding of removal claim cannot survive if asylum is denied).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">Isufi\u2019s second and third contentions involve Greece. He contends that the Board failed to adequately address evidence demonstrating that he was not safe in Greece and, therefore, could not resettle there and find \u201csafe haven\u201d in Greece. These two contentions are meritless. To qualify for withholding of removal, the applicant must show that if returned to his home country, his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened in the country because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). The petitioner must demonstrate that it is more likely than not that he will be persecuted or tortured upon removal to his country. <em>Tan, </em>446 F.3d at 1375. Isufi proffered no evidence to support a finding that he had been tortured by persons acting on behalf of the Albanian government, and no evidence that such torture is more likely than not to occur upon his return to Albania.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">We have considered the record, and the opinions of both the Immigration Judge and the Board of Immigration Appeals. We find no errors of law, and the Immigration Judge\u2019s findings of fact, with which' the Board of Immigration Appeals agreed, are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-10\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
