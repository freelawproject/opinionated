BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b873-10\">Plaintiff-appellant Linda Selensky (\u201cSel-ensky\u201d) believes that the State of Alabama (\u201cAlabama\u201d) wrongfully arrested and held her for criminally trespassing on property she claims she purchased from a man named Robert E. Duke (\u201cDuke\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While in jail, some of her pets died and Duke allegedly set her house on fire. As a result of her arrest, she also has a \u201ccriminal record which is all bogus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b873-11\">She previously filed an action against Duke in Alabama state court, which was unsuccessful. She also filed a misconduct complaint with the Mobile County Sheriffs Office relating to a deputy\u2019s response to her complaints about Duke. The Sheriffs Office determined that there was no improper conduct on the deputy\u2019s part. Sel-ensky then turned to the federal courts for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-12\">Selensky filed a <em>pro se </em>complaint in the Southern District of Alabama on February 14, 2014 against Alabama, alleging \u201cfalse imprisonment, civil rights violation [sic], fraud and corruption.\u201d Selensky\u2019s complaint quotes, without explanation, portions of the Eighth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, portions of the Alabama Constitution relating to the rights of criminal defendants, and the Alabama statute of limitations, Alabama Code \u00a7 6-2-34. In what manner her rights were violated, and what Alabama\u2019s role in the violations was, is not made clear beyond her allegation that she was not guilty of the criminal trespass' charge because the property was hers. Selensky does not present any specific plea for relief in her complaint, beyond her request for her \u201cjust reward.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b873-15\">Because Selensky also filed a motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>her case was automatically referred to a magistrate judge for screening pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), which mandates dismissal of any case that \u201c(i) is frivolous or malicious; (ii) fails to state a .claim on which relief may be granted; or (iii) seeks monetary relief against a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d The magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d) on April 7, 2014, recommending that the action be dismissed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The magistrate judge noted that Selensky \u201cdoes not identify a single individual in connection with her claims or declare the basis on which she contends this Court has subject matter jurisdiction over her action.\u201d The sole defendant named in the action is Alabama, and Selensky identified no grounds upon which Alabama\u2019s Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity had been waived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>or abrogated. The magistrate judge next noted that Selensky \u201cfailed to specify a jurisdictional basis for her action, or plead facts that would reflect a federal cause of action.\u201d Thus, the R &amp; R recommended that Selensky\u2019s suit is \u201cdue to be dismissed with prejudice both for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) because the sole defendant is immune from suit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">Selensky filed objections to the R &amp; R. Other than stating that her \u201ccase isn\u2019t frivolous are [sic] malicious,\u201d however, Sel-ensky provided no actual rebuttal to the R &amp; R\u2019s conclusions. On June 3, 2014, the district court adopted the R &amp; R and dismissed Selensky\u2019s case with prejudice. It subsequently denied Selensky\u2019s \u201cmotion for hearing,\u201d which the district court construed as a motion for reconsideration. The district court also denied Selensky\u2019s subsequent \u201cmotion to challenge court order.\u201d Selensky appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">A district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal for frivolity under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Miller v. Donald, </em>541 F.3d 1091, 1100 (11th Cir.2008). Dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is reviewed <em>de novo. Barbour v. Haley, </em>471 F.3d 1222, 1225 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">As with her complaint, Selensky filed an appellate brief that consists largely of copies of briefs she filed in Alabama state courts in her action against Duke, with whom Selensky alleges she entered into an agreement to purchase real property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She alleges that Duke gave her false information about the property. He also harassed her by piling dirt in the driveway, cutting down trees, having the power company turn off her lights, getting animal cruelty charges filed against her, having her mail delivery stopped, and ultimately burning her home. But Duke is not named as a defendant in this case, nor alleged to be a state official. The only link between Duke and Alabama is Selensky\u2019s allegation that her mistreatment by Duke is part of \u201ca conspiracy brought on by [her] [previous] lawsuits against the State of Alabama.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b874-12\">In proceedings <em>in forma pauperis, </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) empowers a district court to dismiss suits that are frivolous. <em>Napier v. Preslicka, </em>314 F.3d 528, 531 (11th Cir.2002). A suit is frivolous if it is without any merit in fact or law. <em>Denton v. Hernandez, </em>504 U.S. 25, 32-33, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 118 L.Ed.2d 340 (1992). The district court determined that Selensky\u2019s complaint was frivolous because it was clear that the Eleventh Amendment prevented her from proceeding against Alabama as a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-13\">,\u201c[T]he Eleventh .Amendment prohibits federal courts from entertaining suits by private parties against States and their agencies.\u201d <em>Alabama v. Pugh, </em>438 U.S. 781, 781, 98 S.Ct. 3057, 57 L.Ed.2d 1114 (1978). There are two exceptions <em>to </em>this prohibition: where the state has waived its immunity or where Congress has abrogated that immunity. <em>Virginia Office for Prot. &amp; Advocacy v. Stewart, </em>563 U.S. 247, 131 S.Ct. 1632, 1637-38, 179 L.Ed.2d 675 (2011). \u201cA State\u2019s consent to suit must be \u2018unequivocally expressed\u2019 in the text of [a] relevant statute.\u201d <em>Sossamon v. Texas, </em>563 U.S. 277, 131 S.Ct. 1651, 1658, 179 L.Ed.2d 700 (2011) (quoting <em>Pennhurst State Sch. &amp; Hosp. v. Halderman, </em>465 U.S. 89, 98, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984)). \u201cWaiver may not be implied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Likewise, \u201cCongress\u2019 intent to abrogate the States\u2019 immunity from suit must be obvious from \u2018a clear legislative statement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, </em>517 U.S. 44, 55, 116 S.Ct. 1114, 134 L.Ed.2d 252 (1996) (quoting <em>Blatchford v. Native Vill. of Noatak, </em>501 U.S. 775, 786, 111 S.Ct. 2578,115 L.Ed.2d 686 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Neither waiver nor abrogation applies here. The Alabama Constitution states that \u201cthe State of Alabama shall never be made a defendant in any court of law or equity.\u201d Ala. Const, art. I, \u00a7 14. The Supreme Court has recognized that this prohibits Alabama from waiving its immunity from suit. <em>Pugh, </em>438 U.S. at 782, 98 S.Ct. 3057 (citing Ala. Const, art. I, \u00a7 14.) Although Selensky cites no applicable federal statute that would indicate Congress\u2019 intent to abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity, insofar as she is alleging a violation of her civil rights, she would be proceeding under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983; however, \u201cCongress has not abrogated eleventh amendment immunity in section 1983 cases.\u201d Carr <em>v. City of Florence, Ala., </em>916 F.2d 1521, 1525 (11th Cir.1990) (citing <em>Quern v. Jordan, </em>440 U.S. 332, 345, 99 S.Ct. 1139, 59 L.Ed.2d 358 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">The district court was therefore correct in determining that Selenskjfs case must be dismissed as frivolous, because there was no meritorious argument for why the court could entertain a suit against Alabama.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b873-13\">. The basis of Selensky\u2019s complaint has to be pieced together from various documents she attached to the complaint, including documents relating to previous litigation against Duke in Alabama state court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b873-16\">. The magistrate judge also noted that Selen-sky had filed four previous actions in that court, all of which had been dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b874-9\">. Alabama filed no brief <em>on </em>this appeal; nor did it file any responsive pleading in the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b875-9\">. Selensky also filed a motion for leave to supplement the record. The supplementary materials relate to prior lawsuits Selensky has filed in Alabama state courts, and have no bearing on our determination that Alabama\u2019s Eleventh Amendment immunity has not been waived or abrogated. We therefore deny as moot Selensky\u2019s motion for leave to supplement the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
