On appeal, Antunez-Cornelio argues that the district court erred by applying a 16-level enhancement under United States Sentencing \u2022 Guidelines \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). Specifically, he argues that his prior conviction under Florida\u2019s drug trafficking statute, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.135, is not a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under USSG \u00a7 2L1.2. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Madera-Madera, </em>333 F.3d 1228, 1231 n. 2 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-14\">A defendant convicted ,of unlawfully reentering the United States receives a 16-level enhancement if he or she was previously deported following a conviction for a felony drug trafficking offense that carried more than a 13-month sentence. USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). A drug trafficking offense is \u201can offense under federal, state, or local law that prohibits,\u201d among other things, the \u201cdistribution, or dispensing of, or offer to sell a controlled substance ... or the possession of a controlled substance ... with intent to ... distribute[ ] or dispense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. l(B)(iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-15\">The district court did not err in determining that Antunez-Cornelio\u2019s prior conviction was a drug trafficking offense qualifying him for an enhancement under USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). Under Florida\u2019s drug trafficking statute,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>[a]ny person who knowingly sells, purchases, manufactures, delivers, or brings into [Florida], or who is knowingly in actual or constructive possession of, 14 grams or more of amphetamine ... or methamphetamine ... commits a felony of the first degree, which felony shall be known as \u201ctrafficking in amphetamine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIK\">\u00a7 893.135(l)(f). Florida\u2019s trafficking statute is divisible because it sets out one of its elements in the alternative. <em>See Descamps v. United States, </em>570 U.S. -, -, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 2281, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013). Because some convictions under Florida\u2019s trafficking statute are drug trafficking offenses and others are not,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we apply the modified categorical approach and look to a limited class of documents to determine which of the alternative elements formed the basis of Antunez-Corne-lio\u2019s conviction. <em>See id. </em>The defendant\u2019s assent to a factual proffer during a plea colloquy may be used to establish which alternative formed the statutory basis of conviction. <em>See United States v. Diaz-Calderone, </em>716 F.3d 1345, 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2013) (holding that defendant\u2019s assent to factual basis after pleading guilty was enough to show which crime he committed for purposes of a crime-of-violence enhancement). Though it is uncertain whether a factual proffer following a \u201cbest interests\u201d plea can be used for the .same purpose absent the defendant\u2019s assent, <em>id. </em>at 1351, here the district court did not err by relying on Anunez-Cornelio\u2019s factual basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">At the plea colloquy, the State agreed to reduce the charge against Antunez-Come-lio to Trafficking in Amphetamine (14 to 28 grams). Antunez-Corneho\u2019s attorney stated that he would \u201cplead[ ] guilty in his best interest,\u201d and then pleaded guilty. When the court asked for the factual basis for the charge, the State said that Antunez-Cornelio \u201cdelivered 29.2 grams of methamphetamine to law enforcement in exchange for $1,500.\u201d When asked by the court whether he would like to make any changes to the factual proffer, Antunez-Cornelio\u2019s attorney replied, \u201cfurther testimony would reveal that the weight was 27.9. That\u2019s the only addition.\u201d The court \u201cf[ound] the factual basis for his plea as reflected in the criminal report affidavit\u201d and accepted his guilty plea. Antunez-Cornelio did not object to the state court\u2019s finding regarding the factual basis, nor did he assert his factual innocence during the plea colloquy.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">While Antunez-Cornelio did not admit to delivering drugs \u2014 indeed, his \u201cbest interest\u201d plea suggests the opposite \u2014 this does not affect our analysis of which alternative element formed the basis of his conviction. Antunez-Cornelio assented to the proffer because he made a specific objection, disputing the quantity of drugs involved, but did not challenge the fact that he delivered, rather than possessed, the drugs. This establishes that delivery of methamphetamine was the statutory basis for his conviction. As Antunez-Corne-lio conceded before the district court, a conviction for delivering methamphetamine is a drug trafficking offense and qualifies him for an enhancement under USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no error in Antunez-Cornelio\u2019s total sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b843-7\">. For example, mere purchase is not a drug trafficking offense under USSG \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See United States v. Shannon, </em>631 F.3d 1187, 1189 (11th Cir.2011) (purchase of cocaine is not a \"controlled substance offense\u201d under USSG \u00a7 4B 1.2(b), which is substantially similar to the definition of a \"drug trafficking offense\u201d in USSG \u00a7 2L1.2, <em>see United States v. Orihuela, </em>320 F.3d 1302, 1304 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam)). However, even Antunez-Cornelio recognizes that delivery under \u00a7 893.135(l)(f) falls within the drug trafficking definition in USSG \u00a7 2L1.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
