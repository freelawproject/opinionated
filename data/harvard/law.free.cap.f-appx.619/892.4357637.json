Hearn argues that the Appeals Council inadequately reviewed the new evidence that he submitted and should have remanded the case to the administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d); that the district court erred by not remanding the case based on that same evidence; that the ALJ failed to consider his impairments in combination and failed to consider all of his severe impairments; that the ALJ improperly substituted his own opinion for that of Hearn\u2019s examining doctor; and that the ALJ did not include all of Hearn\u2019s impairments in the hypothetical question to the vocational expert. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-15\">We review the Commissioner\u2019s decision with deference to the factual findings and close scrutiny of the legal conclusions. <em>Ingram v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>496 F.3d 1253, 1260 (11th Cir.2007). The Commissioner\u2019s factual findings are conclusive if supported by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d which is relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion. <em>Id. </em>Even if the evidence preponderates against the Commissioner\u2019s factual findings, we must affirm if the decision is supported by substantial evidence.' <em>Id. </em>Because the Appeals Council\u2019s refusal to consider a submission of new evidence before denying review amounts to an error of law, that decision is subject to judicial review, <em>Keeton v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Sews., </em>21 F.3d 1064, 1066 (11th Cir.1994), which we review <em>de novo, Ingram, </em>496 F.3d at 1260. When a claimant' properly presents new evidence to the Appeals Council and it denies review, we essentially consider the claimant\u2019s evidence anew to determine whether \u201cthat new evidence renders the denial of bene: fits erroneous.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1262. A district court\u2019s determination of whether a remand is necessary is reviewed <em>de novo. Vega v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>265 F.3d 1214, 1218 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-16\">I. New evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b919-17\">With a few exceptions, a claimant is allowed to present new evidence at each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>stage of the administrative process. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1470(b). If new and material evidence is submitted, the Appeals Council must consider the additional evidence that relates to the period on or before the date of the ALJ\u2019s hearing decision. <em>Id. </em>The Appeals Council must then evaluate the entire record, including any new and material evidence submitted, and must then review the case if it finds that the ALJ\u2019s action, findings, or conclusion is contrary to the weight of the evidence currently of record. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1470(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">Hearn\u2019s reliance on <em>Epps v. Harris, </em>624 F.2d 1267 (5th Cir.1980), to argue that the Appeals Council must show in its written denial that it has adequately evaluated the new evidence is misplaced in light of the recent decision in <em>Parks ex rel D.P. v. Comm\u2019r, Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>783 F.3d 847, 853 (11th Cir.2015). The Appeals Council denied the request for review here, as it had done in <em>Parks, </em>as opposed to affirming the decision of the ALJ, as had occurred in <em>Epps. \u201cEpps </em>has little bearing on a denial of a request for review.\u201d <em>Parks, </em>783 F.3d at 853. <em>Bowen v. Heckler, </em>748 F.2d 629, 634 (11th Cir.1984), also cited by Hearn, \u201cis inapposite too.\u201d <em>Parks, </em>783 F.3d at 853. The Appeals <em>Council did not </em>err in its action notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">Where a claimant seeks review of the Commissioner\u2019s final decision, the district court has two methods \u2014 each addressing a different problem \u2014 for remanding a case back to the Commissioner under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). <em>Ingram, </em>496 F.3d at 1261. These are known as \u201csentence four remands\u201d and \u201csentence six remands.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">The fourth sentence of \u00a7 405(g) provides a federal court the \u201cpower to enter, upon the pleadings and transcript of the record, a judgment affirming, modifying, or reversing the decision of the Commissioner of Social Security, with or without remanding the cause for a rehearing.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). A sentence four remand is \u201cbased upon a determination that the Commissioner erred in some respect in reaching the decision to deny benefits,\u201d <em>Jackson v. Chater, </em>99 F.3d 1086, 1095 (11th Cir.1996), and is applicable when evidence was properly before the Commissioner, but \u201cthe Appeals Council did not adequately consider the additional evidence,\u201d <em>Ingram, </em>496 F.3d at 1268. To obtain a sentence four remand, the claimant must show that, in light of the new evidence submitted to the Appeals Council, the ALJ\u2019s decision to deny benefits is not supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole. <em>See id. </em>at 1266-67. Hearn\u2019s brief falls far short of accomplishing this; the brief only suggests that the new submissions \u201ccould bear\u201d on his condition during the relevant time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-8\">The sixth sentence of \u00a7 405(g) provides a federal court the power to remand the application for benefits to the Commissioner for the taking of additional evidence upon a showing \u201cthat there is new evidence which is material and that there is good cause for the failure to incorporate such evidence into the record in a prior proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1261. Evidence is material if it is relevant and probative so that there is a reasonable possibility that it would change the administrative result. <em>See Hyde v. Bowen, </em>823 F.2d 456, 459 (11th Cir.1987). Hearn\u2019s brief contains only conclusory statements about the materiality of any new evidence. Thus, Hearn has failed to justify remand under the sixth sentence of \u00a7 405(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-9\">II. Impairments</p>\n<p id=\"b920-10\">The Commissioner uses the following five-step, sequential evaluation process to determine whether a claimant is disabled: (1) whether the claimant is currently engaged in substantial gainful activity; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>(2) whether the claimant has a severe impairment or combination of impairments; (3) whether the impairment meets or equals the severity of the specified impairments in the regulations; (4) based on the Residual Functional Capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) assessment, whether the claimant can perform any of his past relevant work despite the impairment; and (5) whether there are significant numbers of jobs in the national economy that the claimant can perform given the claimant\u2019s RFC, age, education, and work experience. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">If the ALJ determines at step two that there is no severe impairment, then the claimant is not disabled. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.920(c). Thus, the finding of any severe impairment, whether or not it results from a single severe impairment or a combination of impairments that together qualify as \u201csevere,\u201d is enough to satisfy step two. <em>Jamison v. Bowen, </em>814 F.2d 585, 588 (11th Cir.1987). Where a claimant has alleged several impairments, the Commissioner must consider the impairments in combination and determine whether the combined impairments render the claimant disabled. <em>Jones v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>941 F.2d 1529, 1533 (11th Cir.1991). An ALJ\u2019s statement that it has considered a combination of impairments is adequate to meet this standard. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">Any error at step two was harmless because the ALJ found in Hearn\u2019s favor as to impairment, <em>Jamison, </em>814 F.2d at 588, and the ALJ properly noted that he considered Hearn\u2019s impairments in the later steps, <em>Jones, </em>941 F.2d at 1533. We affirm that the ALJ committed no error in considering Hearn\u2019s severe impairments or combination of impairments.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-8\">III. Doctor\u2019s Report</p>\n<p id=\"b921-9\">An ALJ must determine the weight accorded to various medical opinions. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927(c). The ALJ should consider the following factors: the examining and treatment relationship between the claimant and doctor, the length of the treatment and the frequency of the examination, the nature and extent of the treatment relationship, the supportability and consistency of the evidence, the specialization of the doctor, and other factors that tend to support or contradict the opinion. <em>Id. </em>The more relevant evidence a medical source presents to support an opinion, particularly medical signs and laboratory findings, the more weight will be assigned that opinion. \u00a7 416.927(c)(3). Generally, the more consistent an opinion is with the record as a whole, the more weight will be assigned that opinion. \u00a7 416.927(c)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-11\">The ALJ \u201cmay reject the opinion of any physician when the evidence supports a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>Bloodsworth v. Heckler, </em>703 F.2d 1233, 1240 (11th Cir.1983). The opinion of a treating physician need not be given substantial weight when there is \u201cgood cause\u201d to the contrary, meaning that the opinion was not bolstered by the evidence, the evidence supported a contrary finding, or the treating physician\u2019s opinion was conclusory or inconsistent with the doctor\u2019s own medical records. <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1240-41 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-12\">Hearn suggests that the ALJ substituted his opinion for that of Dr. Wilson, but Hearn\u2019s own brief shows that the ALJ actually afforded little weight to Dr. Wilson\u2019s evaluation in light of distinct contrasts with other evidence in the record. The ALJ complied with Eleventh Circuit precedent and did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-13\">IV. Hypothetical question</p>\n<p id=\"b921-14\">? order for a vocational expert\u2019s testimony to constitute substantial evidence, the ALJ must pose a hypothetical question that includes all of the claimant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>impairments. <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1227 (11th Cir.2002). The hypothetical need only include the claimant\u2019s impairments, not each and every symptom. <em>Ingram, </em>496 F.3d at 1270. Hearn makes only a conclusory statement about his paranoia and inability to work, which provides the Court no basis for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b922-24\">.
