After careful review, and for the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-11\">The district court\u2019s August 14, 2014 order granting summary judgment in favor of Virginia' College contains a thorough recitation of the facts in this case. We recount here only those facts necessary to the disposition of Ms. Blow\u2019s appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Virginia College, a private higher education institution with a campus in Huntsville, Alabama, hired Ms. Blow, a black woman,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as a receptionist in 2008. Later that year, she was promoted to Admissions Associate and was responsible for recruiting applicants for Virginia College. As an Admissions Associate, Ms. Blow was tasked with answering telephone and walk-in \u201cleads,\u201d or potential applicants, and converting these leads ultimately into enrollments.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-14\">Virginia College evaluated its Admissions Associates\u2019 performance weekly through a quantitative (how many leads) and qualitative (effectiveness in communicating with leads) analysis. Associates who underperformed for the week earned a \u201cstrike,\u201d and those who earned three strikes in consecutive weeks were placed automatically on a Performance Improvement Plan (\u201cPIP\u201d). An associate on a PIP was expected to show steady improvement on both qualitative and quantitative measures or else risked termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-15\">In June 2010, a white woman named Angela Beck became Admissions Manager and Ms. Blow\u2019s direct supervisor. The following month, Ms. Beck rated Ms. Blow\u2019s performance well. But, in the fall, Ms. Blow\u2019s performance began to lag. She received three consecutive strikes for the weeks of October 24, October 31, and November 2, 1010, which resulted in her placement on a PIP. While on the PIP, Ms. Blow received strikes for the weeks of November 22, 2010, as well as February 27, March 13, April 10, and April 24, 2011. Because these strikes did not occur on three consecutive weeks, Ms. Blow was not placed immediately on a second PIP, but she did receive a substandard annual performance evaluation in May 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>Although Virginia College\u2019s employment Compensation Plan permitted the college to terminate Ms. Blow\u2019s employment when she received a substandard evaluation while on a PIP, the college instead placed her on a second PIP and warned that, if her performance did not improve, she would be terminated. Ms. Blow then received strikes for the consecutive weeks of May 8, May 15, and May 22, 2011. The following month, Ms. Blow was terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">Ms. Blow filed this suit to challenge her termination. She alleged that Ms. Beck and her other supervisors at Virginia College discriminated against her because of her race and retaliated against her for complaining about the way the admissions office was supervised. According to Ms. Blow, several white Admissions Associates who received a number of strikes were not disciplined in the same way, which she alleged evinced the college\u2019s discrimination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After limited discovery, the district court granted summary judgment on all of Ms. Blow\u2019s claims in favor of Virginia College. Ms. Blow now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">We review the district court\u2019s summary adjudication <em>de novo, </em>drawing all inferences and reviewing all evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Moton v. Cowart, </em>631 F.3d 1337, 1341 (11th Cir.2011). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(a). \u201cThe moving party may meet its burden to show that there are no genuine issues of material fact by demonstrating that there is a lack of evidence to support the essential elements that the non-moving party must prove at trial.\u201d <em>Moton, </em>631 F.3d at 1341 (citing <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-13\">We first address Ms. Blow\u2019s discrimination claim. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes it unlawful for an employer \u201cto discriminate against any individual with respect to [her] compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s race.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l). Similarly, \u201c[s]ection 1981 prohibits intentional race discrimination in the making and enforcement of public and private contracts, including employment contracts.\u201d <em>Ferrill v. Parker Grp., Inc., </em>168 F.3d 468, 472 (11th Cir.1999); <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. Discrimination claims brought under Title VII and \u00a7 1981 \u201care subject to the same standards of proof and employ the same analytical framework.\u201d <em>Bryant v. Jones, </em>575 F.3d 1281, 1296 n. 20 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-14\">This analytical framework, the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting framework, places the burden of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination on the employee. <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number><em>Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973); <em>Vessels v. Atlanta Indep. Sch. Sys., </em>408 F.3d 763, 767-68 (11th Cir.2005) (describing elements of \u201cthe familiar <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework\u201d). An aggrieved employee may establish a <em>prima fade </em>case by showing that (1) she belongs to a protected class, (2) she was subjected to an adverse employment action, (3) her employer treated similarly situated employees outside her protected class more favorably, and (4) she was qualified to do the job. <em>Holifield v. Reno, 115 </em>F.3d 1556, 1562 (11th Cir.1997). If the employee successfully makes this showing, the burden shifts to the employer \u201cto articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason\u201d for the adverse action. <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817. If an employer comes forward with such a reason, the employee may nonetheless prevail if she shows that the employer\u2019s stated reason was a pretext for discriminatory animus. <em>See id. </em>at 804, 93 S.Ct. 1817.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">Virginia College does not dispute that Ms. Blow belongs to a protected class or that by her termination she was subjected to an adverse employment action. The college does, however, challenge the adequacy of the individuals Ms. Blow proffered as similarly situated. \u201cTo make a comparison of the plaintiffs treatment to that of non-minority employees, the plaintiff must show that [s]he and the employees are similarly situated in all relevant respects.\u201d <em>Holifield, </em>115 F.3d at 1562. \u201cIn determining whether employees are similarly situated for purposes of establishing a prima facie case, it is necessary to consider whether the employees are involved in or accused of the same or similar conduct and are disciplined in different ways.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">We take the second of these questions first because, critically, the relevant discipline in this case is Ms. Blow\u2019s termination. Although on appeal she attempts to argue that her placement on a PIP and Ms. Beck\u2019s purportedly discrimin\u00e1tory supervisory practices are particularly relevant, her counsel confirmed to the district court that the only employment action she was challenging was her termination. Accordingly, the comparator employees are those who were \u201cinvolved in or accused of the same or similar conduct\u201d but were not terminated. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">Thus, the second question is whether any comparators were involved in or accused of the same or similar conduct as Ms. Blow. That is, whether any comparators were eligible for immediate termination because of their substandard annual evaluations while on a PIP and then received three consecutive strikes but were not terminated. Ms. Blow has proffered no such comparators. Indeed, as the district court found, Ms. Blow proffered no comparators who received three consecutive strikes while already on a PIP regardless of their eligibility for termination due to a substandard evaluation. Ms. Blow asserts that Stacy Hall, Charles Garrett, and James Young, all of whom are white, received three consecutive strikes but were not placed on a PIP. Ms. Hall, according to Ms. Blow, received three consecutive strikes on at least four occasions but was not placed on a PIP. As an initial matter, as the district court noted, Ms. Blow proffered no evidence that these employees were not placed on PIPs. In any event, because Ms. Blow challenges only her termination, she cannot point to any alleged comparator\u2019s failure to be disciplined with a PIP as a comparable circumstance. <em>See Holifield, </em>115 F.3d at 1562; <em>see also Maniccia v. Brown, </em>171 F.3d 1364, 1368-69 (11th Cir.1999) (\u201cWe require that the quantity and quality of the comparator\u2019s misconduct be <em>nearly identical </em>to prevent courts from second-guessing employers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>reasonable decisions and confusing applies with oranges.\u201d (emphasis added)). Ms. Blow\u2019s contention that Ms. Hall and Mr. Garrett were afforded the opportunity to be reassigned while she was not is similarly immaterial. Because Ms. Blow proffered no evidence that the reassigned employees were eligible for termination, she cannot establish that they were proper comparators under <em>Holifield. </em>115 F.3d at 1562.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">Ms. Blow\u2019s failure to identify comparators, and thus to make out a <em>prima, facie </em>case, is fatal to her discrimination claim in this case. Although we have held that a plaintiff may establish a <em>prima fade </em>case even in the absence of a similarly situated comparator, <em>see Smith v. Lockheed-Martin Corp., </em>644 F.3d 1321, 1328 (11th Cir.2011), Ms. Blow failed to argue in the district court that other sufficient circumstantial evidence suggested racial discrimination.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And, in any event, the record does not contain sufficient circumstantial evidence- to make a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. As a result, the district court was correct to grant summary judgment in favor of Virginia College.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">The district court was also correct to grant summary judgment on Ms. Blow\u2019s retaliation claim. Title VII makes it un-' lawful for an employer to retaliate against an employee for engaging in protected conduct. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> An aggrieved employee must first establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation by showing that (1) she engaged in statutorily protected expression, (2) she suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) there is a causal connection between the two events. <em>See Shannon v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., </em>292 F.3d 712, 715 (11th Cir.2002). Virginia College challenges the first and third of these elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-13\">To show protected expression, Ms. Blow points to four instances in which she communicated with supervisors. But in none of these instances did she even mention race, much less contend she was being treated differently because of her race. In a July 16, 2010 email to Corporate Vice President of Admissions Dean Mahaffey, Ms. Blow expressed concern about her performance rating but made no mention of race. In an October 8, 2010 email to Region Vice President of Human Resources Mitch Srail, Ms. Blow complained about the company\u2019s overtime policies and expressed concern over Ms. Beck\u2019s supervision as it pertained to the policy, but again she made no mention of race. When asked whether the overtime policy was a \u201cwhite and black\u201d issue, Ms. Blow testified that to her it was a \u201cgreen issue\u201d because she wanted the money for working overtime. Doc. 24-2 at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-14\">Ms. Blow emailed Mr. Srail again on March 23, 2011, a third communication that she proffered as protected activity. In that email, Ms. Blow expressed a \u201cgeneral concern ... about being singled out/treated different\u201d in her job and said she felt \u201cas though the rules of the company are only directed to certain people.\u201d Doc. 24-4 at 31. But again Ms. Blow made no mention of race. We cannot require an employer to discern meaning from such vague references to different treatment. The final instance Ms. Blow points to, a May 12, 2011 email to Ms. Beck, similarly contains no statement or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>even suggestion that she attributed the problems she was experiencing at work to racial animus.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">Because a close look at these emails makes clear that Ms. Blow did not tell her supervisors that she felt she was the victim of discrimination on the basis of her race, she cannot demonstrate that she engaged in statutorily protected expression. Ms. Blow\u2019s contention that her belief that she was the victim of racial discrimination was reasonable and in good faith is of no moment because she produced no evidence that her employer knew of her beliefs. Without that evidence, Ms. Blow cannot demonstrate that she engaged in statutorily protected <em>expression, </em>and she cannot make out a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Accordingly, the district court was correct to grant summary judgment in favor of Virginia College on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of Virginia College.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b886-12\">. Moreover, because we are reviewing the district court's grant of summary judgm\u00e9nt, we recount the facts, in the light most favorable to Ms. Blow. <em>See infra </em>section II.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b886-16\">. Although the terms \"African-American'' and \"Caucasian\u201d might be preferred, we use the terminology Ms. Blow uses in her briefs to describe her race and that of her former coworkers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b887-8\">. Ms. Blow also alleged that Ms. Beck distributed leads in a discriminatory fashion and that she permitted only white employees to work overtime. Her counsel clarified in the district court, however, that she challenged only her termination. <em>See infra </em>section III.A. Thus, we do not detail here allegations unrelated to Ms. Blow\u2019s termination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b887-15\">. We reject Ms. Blow's conclusory argument that the district court failed to apply the appropriate standard in deciding Virginia College\u2019s motion for summary judgment. She failed to point to any portion of the district court\u2019s order where she believes the district court misapplied the standard, and upon our review of the record we see no indication that the district court did so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b889-8\">. Ms. Blow advanced this argument for the first time on appeal, but because this issue was not fairly presented to the district court, we will not address it. <em>See Access Now, Inc. </em>v. <em>Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1335 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b889-17\">. Ms. Blow did not allege retaliation in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
