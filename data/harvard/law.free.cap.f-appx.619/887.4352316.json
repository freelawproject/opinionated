Terry argues the district court erred by (1) denying his motion to withdraw his guilty pleas; (2) denying his motion to dismiss counts 1-5. and 7-9 as untimely filed; (3) applying a sentencing enhancement for obstruction of justice, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1; and (4) denying a reduction for acceptance. of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). As the parties are familiar with the facts of this case, we will not recount them in detail. We include only those facts necessary to the discussion of each issue. Upon review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">I. DISCUSSION .</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">\n<em>A. Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b914-9\"><em>. </em>The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Terry\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. After the district court accepts a guilty plea and before sentencing, the defendant may withdraw his guilty plea if she can show a \u201cfair and just reason for requesting the withdrawal.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(d)(2)(B). In determining whether a defendant has met this burden, a district court may consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding the plea, including whether: (1) close assistance of counsel was available; (2) the plea was knowing and voluntary; (3) judicial resources would be conserved; and (4) the government would be prejudiced by withdrawal of the plea. <em>United States v. Buckles, </em>843 F.2d 469, 471-72 (11th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-12\">Terry argues his guilty pleas were not knowing and voluntary because, at the time of his change-of-plea hearing, he was taking anti-depression medications, drinking alcohol, and taking prescriptions for migraines and high blood pressure. The district court\u2019s finding that Terry had made his pleas knowingly and voluntarily was not clearly erroneous. The district court noted that, during the change-of-plea hearing, Terry did not slur his speech, seemed attentive of his circumstances/ and sought clarification about certain counts in the indictment. Additionally, Terry\u2019s attorney confirmed Terry was, both before and after the change-of-plea hearing, engaged and able to converse about his case. The district court\u2019s decision to credit its own and the attorney\u2019s first-hand impressions of Terry\u2019s competence, rather than Terry\u2019s self-serving testimony and the testimony of his medical experts who lacked any first-hand knowledge of his mental state, was not clearly erroneous. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number><em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, N.C., </em>470 U.S. 564, 574, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985) (\u201cWhere there are two permissible view of the evidence, the fact-finder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d). Considering the totality of the circumstances, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Terry\u2019s motion to withdraw his pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\"><em>B. Motion to Dismiss Counts 1-5 and </em>7-<em>9 as Untimely</em></p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">Terry\u2019s unconditional guilty pleas waived his right to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to dismiss Counts 1-5 and 7-9 as time barred. A defendant\u2019s knowing, voluntary, and unconditional plea of guilty waives all non-jurisdictional defects in the proceedings until the entry of the plea. <em>See United States v. Yunis, </em>723 F.2d 795, 796 (11th Cir.1984). \u201c[P]ursuant to binding precedent, [a] statute of limitations is a matter of defense that must be asserted at trial by the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Najjar, </em>283 F.3d 1306, 1308 (11th Cir.2002) (citing <em>Capone v. Aderhold, </em>65 F.2d 130, 131 (5th Cir.1933)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>). Accordingly, \u201cthe expiration of the statute of limitations does not divest a district court of subject matter jurisdiction, but rather constitutes an affirmative defense, which the defendant can waive.\u201d <em>Najjar, </em>283 F.3d at 1309. Terry\u2019s guilty pleas waived his right to appeal the denial of his claim that the statute of limitations barred prosecution on Counts 1-5 and 7-9. <em>See id. </em>at 1308-09; <em>Yunis, </em>723 F.2d at 796.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">\n<em>C. Sentencing Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">Terry\u2019s knowing and voluntary appeal waiver bars his attempt to challenge the district court\u2019s application of an obstruction of justice sentencing enhancement, as well as the district court\u2019s refusal to apply a downward sentencing adjustment, for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See United States v. Bushert, </em>997 F.2d 1343, 1350 (11th Cir.1993) (holding knowing and voluntary appeal waivers are enforceable). In his plea agreement, Terry knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal his convictions and sentences, and none of the waiver\u2019s exceptions are applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-13\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b915-14\">In light of the foregoing reasons, we affirm Terry\u2019s convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b914-10\">. We review the denial of a defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Izquierdo, </em>448 F.3d 1269, 1276 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cWe review the district court's denial of a motion to dismiss an indictment for abuse of discretion, but the interpretation and application of a . statute of limitations is a legal question that we review de novo.\u201d <em>United States v. Rojas, 718 </em>F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2013). We review the validity of an appeal waiver de novo. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>541 F.3d 1064, 1066 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b915-9\">. In <em>Bonner v.
