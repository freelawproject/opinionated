Because the district court had jurisdiction to issue the order in question and because Ballew has forfeited his other arguments on appeal, we affirm the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-20\">Ballew pleaded guilty to three counts involving the possession and distribution of methamphetamine. A presentence investigation report (PSR) calculated Ballew\u2019s base offense level under the sentencing guidelines to be 32, applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. Because he qualified as a career offender, however, the PSR ultimately disregarded Ballew\u2019s base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1, and instead calculated his total offense level using the applicable career offender enhancement of U.S.S.G \u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(A). Applying that enhancement yielded an offense level of 37, which the PSR reduced by three levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 because Ballew had accepted responsibility for the offenses. The PSR recommended that the district court fix Ballew\u2019s total guidelines offense level at 34, based exclusively on application of \u00a7\u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(A) and 3E1.1. Pairing Ballew\u2019s total guidelines offense level with his criminal history category of VI yielded a guidelines range of 262-327 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-21\">The district court adopted the PSR\u2019s calculations, but varied downward and sentenced Ballew to three 144-month terms, all to run concurrently. The court explained that it had varied downward because, after his arrest, Ballew had provided substantial assistance to the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-22\">In December 2014, Ballew filed a motion to reduce his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). His motion was based on Guidelines Amendment 782, which lowered the sentencing range for some offenders sentenced according to \u00a7 2D1.1. The district court denied Ballew\u2019s motion on procedural grounds, explaining that \u201c[t]he retroactive application of [Amendment 782] will not be effective until November 2015. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>All sentences affected will be reviewed by the Court without a motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">Ballew appealed the district court\u2019s order denying his motion. While that appeal \u2014 which we later dismissed because it concerned a non-appealable order \u2014 was pending, the district court entered an order explaining that it had reviewed Bal-lew\u2019s motion and \u201cdetermined that [his] sentence is not impacted by Amendment 782\u201d because his \u201cguideline range was determined pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.1,\u201d not \u00a7 2D1.1. Ballew promptly appealed that order, as well, arguing in his opening brief that his then-pending appeal of the district court\u2019s first order denying his motion under \u00a7 3582(c) deprived the district court of jurisdiction to issue the second order. After the government filed its response brief in Ballew\u2019s second appeal, he filed a reply brief that asserted, for the first time, that he was eligible for a reduced sentence under Amendment 782 because, in varying downward from the guidelines based on Ballew\u2019s substantial assistance, the district court had departed from the career offender guideline.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">Ballew\u2019s arguments are meritless. Although the filing of a notice, of appeal normally divests a district court of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the appeal, that rule does not apply to notices of appeal from non-appealable orders. <em>United States v. Vicaria, </em>963 F.2d 1412, 1415 <em>&amp; </em>n. 2 (11th Cir.1992). In dismissing Bal-lew\u2019s first appeal in this case, we determined that the order challenged in that appeal was a non-appealable order. As a result, Ballew\u2019s appeal in the first case did not divest the district court of jurisdiction to issue its later order denying his motion on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">Ballew has forfeited his other argument \u2014 that the district court\u2019s downward variance at sentencing meant he was eligible for a reduced sentence under Amendment 782 \u2014 because he did not raise it in his opening brief. <em>See United States v. Levy, </em>379 F.3d 1241, 1244 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-8\">Even if Ballew had properly raised his argument about the applicability of Amendment 782, we would reject it. By its terms, Amendment 782 applies only to defendants whose guidelines ranges were based on \u00a7 2D1.1. The district court calculated Ballew\u2019s guidelines range using \u00a7 4B1.1 instead of \u00a7 2D1.1, and its decision to vary downward had nothing to do with \u00a7 2D1.1. For those reasons, Amendment 782 does not authorize a reduced sentence in Ballew\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
