After review, we affirm Darling\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AJy\">A. Offense Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">On February 11, 2014, the owner of Darling\u2019s apartment complex saw Darling holding a gun and arguing with another man. The owner called 911, identified himself, and told the dispatcher that a black male wearing a brown shirt and jeans was chasing people with a gun in the area of the apartment complex. The owner reported that the man had pulled out onto Levy Avenue in a brown Buick, heading east toward Lake Bradford Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">Tallahassee Police Department Officer Trent Sexton responded to the 911 call. Within two minutes, Officer Sexton observed a brown Buick stopped at a red light at the intersection of Levy Avenue and Lake Bradford Road, 0.29 miles from Darling\u2019s apartment complex. The Buick, though not in the left turn lane, had its left turn signal on and its tires turned to the left. The black male sitting in the front passenger seat of the Buick, later identified as Darling, was wearing a brown shirt. Darling appeared extremely nervous, refused to make eye contact with Officer Sexton, and was sweating heavily.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">The Buick deactivated its left turn signal and, after approximately 30 seconds, turned right onto Lake Bradford Road and pulled into a gas station. Officer Sexton followed and conducted a traffic stop. After Officers Murphree and Johnson arrived as backup, Darling and the female driver were handcuffed and secured. While doing a pat-down, Officer Murphree asked Darling if he had any weapons on him, to which Darling replied \u201c[n]ot on me, no.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">Officers Murphree and Johnson conducted a protective sweep of the Buick to make sure that there were no other people inside of the car. Officer Murphree then reported to Officer Sexton that Darling had said \u201cthere was somebody chasing him with a gun.\u201d Believing he had probable cause based on the \u201cnature of the call [and] the gun that was involved,\u201d Officer Sexton searched the Buick. The search revealed a loaded gun in the center console between the front seats.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-11\">B. Darling\u2019s Motion to Suppress</p>\n<p id=\"b904-12\">Darling moved to suppress the gun as seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment, because the officers did not have a reasonable suspicion to stop the car or probable cause to search the car. On July 14, 2014, following a suppression hearing, the district court denied Darling\u2019s motion to suppress as to the stop and search of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-13\">At the hearing, the district court specifically found Officer Sexton\u2019s testimony to be credible. The district court stated that Officer Sexton had a reasonable suspicion to stop the car based on the \u201ctotality of the circumstances \u2014 the vehicle, the location, the timing, the identity of the individual, the clothing he was wearing, combined with the other suspicious circumstances, the way they were executing the turn, their reaction to the officer when they first spotted him and he first spotted them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b904-14\">In addition to these factors, the district court pointed to Darling\u2019s statement that he was being chased by someone with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>gun as supporting a finding of probable cause. Darling\u2019s statement corroborated the information given on the 911 call and linked him \u201cback to the very episode for which the vehicle was being stopped.\u201d Thus, the district court found that the officers had probable cause to search the car and look for the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">C. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) concluded that Darling qualified for an ACCA sentencing enhancement because he had at least three prior convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses. Darling was convicted of the following ACCA-qualifying Florida offenses: two convictions for sale of cocaine in 1988; robbery in 1989; sale of cocaine within 1000 feet of a school in 1990; two convictions for sale of cocaine in 1992;. sale of cocaine in 2002; and resisting a police officer with violence and battery of an officer in 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">As an armed career criminal, Darling received a total offense level of 31 (after a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility) and a criminal history category of VI, which yielded an advisory guidelines range' of 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">Relevant to this appeal, Darling objected to the PSI\u2019s classification of his 2002 conviction for sale of cocaine as an ACCA predicate offense because Florida Statutes \u00a7 893.13 does not require an element of <em>mens rea </em>regarding the illicit nature of the controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court overruled Darling\u2019s objections and found his advisory guidelines range was 188 to 235 months as set forth in the PSI. After considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court sentenced Darling to 200 months\u2019 imprisonment. Darling timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-14\">II. DISCUSSION A. Motion to Suppress</p>\n<p id=\"b905-15\">On appeal, Darling argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the gun because the officers did not have either a reasonable suspicion to stop the car or probable cause to search the car. We must disagree.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b905-16\">The traffic stop was based on a non-anonymous 911 report of an armed man, corroborated by the timing, location, direction of travel, and description of the car and its occupants. These circumstances, combined with Darling\u2019s visible nervousness and refusal to make eye contact, gave Officer Sexton reason to suspect that Darling had been involved in criminal activity. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>619 F.3d 1269, 1271 (11th Cir.2010) (requiring an officer to have, based on the totality of the circumstances, a \u201cparticularized and objective basis for suspecting wrongdoing\u201d to justify a stop).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-17\">Furthermore, under the totality of the circumstances, there was more than a fair probability that a gun would be found inside of the car. <em>See United States v. Lopez, </em>649 F.3d 1222, 1245 (11th Cir.2011) (explaining that probable cause for a search exists when there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in the place to be searched). The facts surrounding the traffic stop, along with the absence of a gun on Darling\u2019s person, would lead a reasonably prudent person to believe that the gun was in the car. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b905-18\">We reject Darling\u2019s argument that the district court erroneously relied on his purportedly involuntary statement about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>being chased <em>by </em>someone with a gun to find the existence of probable cause.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We need not reach that issue because, even absent Darling\u2019s statement, ample evidence in the record supports concluding that the officers had probable cause to search the car. <em>See United States v. Caraballo, </em>595 F.3d 1214, 1222 (11th Cir.2010) (\u201c[W]e may affirm the denial of a motion to suppress on any ground supported by the record.\u201d). Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Darling\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">B. ACCA</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">Darling\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s application of an enhanced sentence under the ACCA is likewise without merit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">The ACCA imposes a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years\u2019 imprisonment for a \u00a7 922(g) conviction if the defendant has three prior convictions for serious drug offenses or violent felonies that were committed on different occasions. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Here, the district court\u2019s ACCA enhancement was proper because Darling\u2019s six prior Florida convictions for sale of cocaine qualify as \u201cserious drug offenses\u201d under the ACCA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>775 F.3d 1262, 1267-68 (11th Cir.2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2827, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2015). ' As Darling concedes in his brief, his arguments are foreclosed by the law of this circuit. '</p>\n<p id=\"b906-12\">For these reasons, we affirm Darling\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b904-8\">. Pursuant to a written plea agreement, Darling entered a conditional guilty plea, reserving his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b905-10\">. In reviewing the district court's denial of a motion to suppress, we review the court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its application of law to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Yeary, </em>740 F.3d 569, 579 n. 25 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b906-7\">.The parties dispute whether this statement was suppressed. Darling did move to suppress the statements he made in response to questioning by the officers as obtained in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The motion stated that after Officer Sexton searched the car, Officer Murphree questioned Darling about the gun found in the console. Darling responded that he was forced to disarm another man who had charged toward him with a gun. The government agreed not to offer these post-search statements, but contended that Darling\u2019s prior statement (before the search) about being chased was voluntary and not made in response to questioning. In granting the unopposed motion, the district court excluded from evidence \"the statements made by Mr. Darling when he was questioned without the benefit of <em>Miranda,\u201d </em>but did not elaborate. On appeal, the government argues that this statement before the search was not excluded because it was voluntaiy, but Darling disputes that position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b906-24\">. We review the district court\u2019s application of the ACCA enhancement <em>de novo. See United States v. Gandy, </em>710 F.3d 1234, 1236 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b906-25\">. The Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>576 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015), which-struck down the ACCA\u2019s residual clause as unconstitutionally vague, has no bearing on Darling\u2019s sentence because he had more than three predicate convictions for \"serious drug offenses\" as defined' in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii). His predicate convictions were not based on qualifying under the residual clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
