Therefore, he waives any challenge to the relevant issues on appeal. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-17\">In the alternative, Johnson \u25a0 bases his claims on the denial of post-conviction relief from his state second-degree murder conviction and life sentence. Thus, a judgment in his favor \u201cwould necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence\u201d. <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). In order to recover damages under \u00a7 1983 for \u201charm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid\u201d, Johnson must first \u201cprove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364. Because Johnson has not shown his conviction has been invalidated, his claims are not cognizable under \u00a7 1983. <em>See id. </em>at 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-22\">Johnson\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS. The court\u2019s dismissal of the action, and the dismissal of the instant appeal as frivolous, count as strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Johnson is WARNED that, if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will be barred from proceeding <em>in for-ma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal, filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility, unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-23\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b427-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. K. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published, and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
