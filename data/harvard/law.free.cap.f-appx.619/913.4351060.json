The district court imposed a four-level increase to Mr. Elvidge\u2019s offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(19)(A) because he was a registered broker and his offense conduct violated securities law. Because this enhancement was imposed in error, we vacate the sentence and remand for resen-tencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b940-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-14\">Mr. Elvidge was a registered stock broker who managed and operated a brokerage and investment firm in Port St. Lucie, Florida. From 2010 to 2012, he fraudulently authorized wire transfers from client bank accounts to his own bank account, stealing more than $1 million. A grand jury indicted him for 36 counts of wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 and six counts of aggravated identity theft in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A. Mr. El-vidge pled guilty to eight counts of wire fraud and one count of identity theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-15\">The probation office prepared a presen-tence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) in advance of Mr. Elvidge\u2019s sentencing hearing. The PSR grouped the wire fraud counts and applied a base offense level of seven pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(a)(l). The PSR then increased the offense level: by 16 levels because the loss was between $1 million and $2.5 million, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(I); by two levels because the offense involved between 10 and 50 victims, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(A)(i); and by four levels because the offense involved a violation of securities law and Mr. Elvidge was a regis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>tered broker. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(19)(A). This brought the adjusted offense level to 29. After a three-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a), Mr. Elvidge\u2019s total offense level was 26. Mr. Elvidge had a criminal history of category I. According to the PSR, the advisory guideline range was 63 to 78 months\u2019 imprisonment as to the wire fraud counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">In his sentencing memorandum, Mr. El-vidge objected to the enhancement under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(19)(A), arguing that his conduct had not violated securities law. The probation officer responded to Mr. Elvidge\u2019s objection by stating that the offense \u201cinvolved stealing money from his clients\u2019 brokerage accounts, which is [a] securities violation.\u201d Third Addendum to PSR. The officer also noted that the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d) had taken action against the defendant because of the offense conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">At the sentencing hearing, Mr. Elvidge reiterated his objection to the four-level sentencing enhancement. The government argued that he qualified for the enhancement because Mr. Elvidge \u201cobviously was accessing his clients\u2019 money that he had as a broker and embezzling from those accounts and divesting that money for himself.\u201d Sentencing Tr., Doc. 113 at 7. The district court agreed with the government and approved the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-8\">We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and the application of the Sentencing Guidelines to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Lozano, </em>490 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-10\">Under the Guidelines, a four-level increase of the base offense level is applied when the offense involves \u201ca violation of securities law and, at the time of the offense, the defendant was ... a registered broker or dealer, or a person associated with a broker or dealer.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(19)(A). The Guidelines define \u201csecurities law\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-12\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1348, 1350, and the provisions of law referred to in section 3(a)(47) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ... including] the rules, regulations, and orders issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the provisions of law referred to in such section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b941-13\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.l5(A)). A defendant need not be convicted under securities law in order for the enhancement to apply. Rather, it is sufficient for a defendant to be convicted under a general fraud statute if the underlying conduct violated securities law, as defined by the guidelines. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.l5(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-14\">Because Mr. Elvidge objected to the four-level increase, the government had the burden of establishing that the guideline applied by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Lawrence, </em>47 F.3d 1559, 1566 (11th Cir.1995). On appeal, the government has conceded that it failed to carry this burden. While the concession is not dispositive, <em>United States v. Lee, </em>586 F.3d 859, 866 (11th Cir.2009), we agree with both Mr. Elvidge and the government that the district court erred in applying \u00a7 2B1.1(19)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-15\">Mr. Elvidge\u2019s conduct amounted to a basic fraud, in which he forged client signatures to authorize a transfer of money from their accounts to his. The government has not shown how this conduct violated any of the specific securities laws enumerated in the Guidelines. Instead, the government merely argued at the sentencing hearing that the enhancement applied because Mr. Elvidge was embezzling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>from client brokerage accounts. But the Supreme Court has stated that not every breach of fiduciary duty by a broker is a federal securities law violation, and in so doing, it specifically used embezzlement from a client account as an example of fraudulent conduct that would not violate securities law. <em>SEC v. Zandford, </em>535 U.S. 813, 825 n. 4, 122 S.Ct. 1899, 153 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002) (\u201cIf, for example, a broker embezzles cash from a client\u2019s account or takes advantage of the fiduciary relationship to induce his client into a fraudulent real estate transaction, then the fraud would not include the requisite connection to a purchase or sale of securities.\u201d). Because the government failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that Mr. El-vidge\u2019s conduct violated any securities law, the four-level enhancement was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">In light of the foregoing, we vacate the sentence in its entirety and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b940-10\">. We therefore need not address Mr. Elvidge's arguments that his sentence was both procedurally and substantively unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Gupta, </em>572 F.3d 878, 882 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
