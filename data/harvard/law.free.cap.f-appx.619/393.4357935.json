The district court determined that Shipp could not pursue relief under \u00a7 2241 because he failed to show that relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 would be inadequate or ineffective, as is required by the savings clause of \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-18\">We review the dismissal of a \u00a7 2241 petition de novo. <em>Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 212 (5th Cir.2000). A federal prisoner may attack the validity of his conviction in a \u00a7 2241 petition if he can meet the requirements of the savings clause of \u00a7 2255. <em>Id. </em>The prisoner must make the showing that the remedy under \u00a7 2255 would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d \u00a7 2255(e); <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901 (5th Cir.2001). A petitioner\u2019s inability to meet the procedural requirements of \u00a7 2255 is insufficient to make the required showing. <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2000). Rather, a prisoner who wishes to proceed under the savings clause must establish that his claim \u201cis based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d and that the claim \u201cwas foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-23\">Shipp argues that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense because <em>Williams v. Texas, </em>505 S.W.2d 838 (Tex.Crim.App.1974) and <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013), invalidated one of the convictions supporting his Armed Career Criminal Act enhancement. He also states that his claim is based on <em>Chambers v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 122, 129 S.Ct. 687, 172 L.Ed.2d 484 (2009), which he argues is a retroactively applicable Supreme Court case. As <em>Descamps </em>and <em>Chambers </em>.address sentencing issues and have no effect on whether the facts of Shipp\u2019s case would support his conviction for the substantive offense, they are not retroactively applicable Supreme Court decisions indicating that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense. <em>See Wesson v. U.S. Penitentiary Beaumont, TX, </em>305 F.3d 343, 348 (5th Cir.2002); <em>In re Bradford, </em>660 F.3d 226, 230 (5th Cir.2011). Additionally, Shipp\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>reliance on <em>Williams </em>is misplaced as it is not a Supreme Court decision. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Shipp\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel and motion for remand are DENIED, and Shipp\u2019s motion for leave to file a supplemental brief is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b419-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
