After the Appeals Council for the Social Security Administration denied Mr. McCormick\u2019s request for review, the district court affirmed the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-18\">Mr. McCormick argues that the ALJ failed to consider the combination of his impairments as required by 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(ii), and that this alleged error is not harmless. Mr. McCormick also asserts that the ALJ\u2019s determination \u2014 that he could perform his past work duties\u2014 was not supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-19\">Upon careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-20\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b882-21\">We review the decision of an ALJ as the Commissioner\u2019s final decision where, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>here, the ALJ denies benefits and the Appeals Council denies review. <em>See Doughty v. Apfel </em>245 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cThe Commissioner\u2019s factual findings are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Ingram v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>496 F.3d 1253, 1260 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \u201c \u2018Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1439 (11th Cir.1997)). \u201cEven if the evidence preponderates against the [Commissioner\u2019s] factual findings, we must affirm if the decision.reached is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Martin v. Sullivan, </em>894 F.2d 1520, 1529 (11th Cir.1990). The Commissioner\u2019s conclusions of law are reviewed <em>de novo. See Ingram, </em>496 F.3d at 1260.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">An ALJ must perform a five-step evaluation to determine whether a claimant has proven that he is disabled. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4). <em>See also McDaniel v. Bowen, </em>800 F.2d 1026, 1030 (11th Cir.1986). The claimant must prove that (1) he has not engaged in \u201csubstantial gainful activity\u201d; (2) he has a \u201csevere impairment or combination of impairments\u201d; and (3) the impairment(s) \u201cmeets or equals\u201d a listed impairment qualifying for automatic disability. <em>Jones v. Apfel </em>190 F.3d 1224, 1228 (11th Cir.1999). If the claimant does not meet the listed standards, he must prove that (4) he \u201cis unable to perform past relevant work\u201d in light of his residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d). <em>Id. </em>If the claimant proves he cannot return to past relevant work, the ALJ must (5) \u201cdetermine if there is other work available in significant numbers in the national economy that the claimant is able to perform.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">Step two is a \u201cthreshold inquiry\u201d where only the most trivial impairments are to be rejected. <em>McDaniel, </em>800 F.2d at 1031. The claimant\u2019s burden at this stage is mild. <em>See id. </em>We have explained that step two serves as a filter, and if any severe impairment is found, the requirements of step two are satisfied. <em>See Jamison v. Bowen, </em>814 F.2d 585, 588 (11th Cir.1987). A single impairment or a combination of impairments that together qualify as severe may meet the requirements for step two. <em>See id. See also Bowen v. Heckler, </em>748 F.2d 629, 635 (11th Cir.1984) (explaining that where a claimant alleges multiple impairments, \u201ca claim for social security, benefits based on disability may he even though none of the impairments, considered individually, is disabling\u201d). The ALJ \u201cmust mak\u00e9 specific and well-articulated findings as to the effect of the combination of impairments and [ ] decide whether the combined impairments cause the claimant to be disabled.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">At the third step, the ALJ must consider the claimant\u2019s medical condition as a whole and determine whether one severe impairment or the combination of impairments constitute a disability. <em>See Jamison, </em>814 F.2d at 588. The claimant must meet the criteria from the categories in the Appendix 1 Listings to be considered disabled. <em>See </em>\u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(iii), (d). As relevant here, Listing 12.04 outlines mood disorders, including depression and bipolar disorder, and Listing 12.06 describes anxiety disorders. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404, Sub-part P, Appendix 1, Listings 12.04 and 12.06.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-10\">Step four requires the ALJ to assess the claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity and ability to undertake past relevant work. <em>See </em>\u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(iv). The claimant must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>prove he can no longer engage in past relevant work. <em>See Jones v. Bowen, </em>810 F.2d 1001, 1005 (11th Cir.1986). The ALJ must evaluate the claimant\u2019s ability to perform all the duties required by past relevant work \u2014 considering the claimant\u2019s impairment(s). <em>See Lucas v. Sullivan, </em>918 F.2d 1567, 1574 (11th Cir.1990). If the ALJ finds that the claimant can perform past relevant work, he is not disabled, and there is no need to proceed to the fifth step. <em>Cf. Jackson v. Bowen, </em>801 F.2d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.1986) (\u201cIf a Social Security claimant can still do the kind of work he has done in the past, he will be found not disabled.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">The ALJ did not fail to consider the combined effects of Mr. McCormick\u2019s impairments. To satisfy the requirements of step two, the ALJ had to recognize the existence of a severe impairment or combination of impairments. <em>See Jamison, </em>814 F.2d at 588. The ALJ considered Mr. McCormick\u2019s mood disability and history of special education, and that was sufficient to proceed to step three. <em>See </em>D.E. 5-3 at 29. And, as explained above, step two is merely a filter, and any error in considering an additional impairment is harmless since it does not factor into the determination of disability. <em>See Jamison, </em>814 F.2d at 588. <em>See also Diorio v. Heckler, </em>721 F.2d 726, 728 (11th Cir.1983) (holding that an error by ALJ in one step with no bearing on final determination was harmless).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">At step three, the ALJ compared medical evidence to the required Listings, and found that Mr. McCormick\u2019s impairments, even in combination, did not meet the level of severity contemplated in Listings 12.04 (bipolar and depressive disorders) and 12.06 (anxiety disorders). <em>See </em>D.E. 5-3 at 30. The ALJ determined that Mr. McCormick\u2019s impairments amounted to a \u201cmoderate\u201d restriction, and did not reach the \u201cmarked\u201d restriction required for a finding of disability. <em>Id. </em>We conclude that the ALJ\u2019s determination \u201cconstitutes evidence that he considered the combined effects of [Mr. McCormick\u2019s] impairments.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1224 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">The ALJ also considered the impairments individually and in combination when he evaluated Mr. McCormick\u2019s RFC under step four. The ALJ found that Mr. McCormick could meet the mental and physical demands of his past work as a shipping and receiving weigher despite his impairments. The ALJ reviewed medical records and determined that any claimed conditions, such as bipolar disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder, did not prevent Mr. McCormick from performing recent past work. <em>See </em>D.E. 5-3 at 33-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">In sum, we conclude that the ALJ did not fail to consider the combined effects of impairments in determining that Mr. McCormick is not disabled under \u00a7 416.920.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b884-11\">The claimant bears the burden of proving he is unable to perform past relevant work. <em>See Lucas, </em>918 F.2d at 1571. The ALJ must take all the duties of a claimant\u2019s past work into consideration and evaluate whether the claimant can still perform them in spite of the severe impairment or combination of impairments. <em>See id. </em>at 1574.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-12\">Mr. McCormick testified that he had previously worked in a warehouse doing shipping and receiving. A vocational expert testified that a hypothetical person with Mr. McCormick\u2019s RFC could perform as a shipper and receiver, according to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>Dictionary of Occupational Titles\u2019 (\u201cDOT\u201d) job description. <em>See </em>D.E. 5-8 at 34, 50. Based this testimony \u2014 and taking Mr. McCormick\u2019s impairments and limitations into account \u2014 the ALJ determined that Mr. McCormick could perform relevant past work in spite of his limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">On this record, we conclude that the ALJ\u2019s determination is supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, we must affirm. <em>See Ingram, </em>496 F.3d at 1260.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the Commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b882-12\">. Although Mr. McCormick argues in his initial brief that the Appeals Council failed to sufficiently articulate its rationale for denying review and failed to show that it adequately evaluated new evidence, Mr. McCormick withdrew this \u25a0 claim in his reply brief. Mr. McCormick also argues in his initial brief that the district court erred in failing to remand under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), but he withdrew this claim in his reply brief as well. Accordingly, we will not address either issue. <em>See United States v. Daniels, </em>685 F.3d 1237, 1251 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
