He argues that he is entitled to a sentence reduction because Amendment 782 to the sentencing guidelines lowered the advisory guideline range for one of his convictions, and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>570 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), resulted in a lower mandatory consecutive sentence for his other conviction, thereby reducing his total guidelines range for the combined convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-22\">In 2008 Jackson pleaded guilty under a plea agreement to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute in excess of five kilograms of cocaine hydrochloride, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and brandishing a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii). The presentence investigation report set a base offense level of 32 for his drug conviction based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(a)(3), (c)(4) (2008), and after the application of several adjustments, it assigned him a total offense level of 35. With his criminal history category of III, his advisory guidelines range was 210 to 262 months imprisonment, In addition, his conviction for brandishing a firearm carried a mandatory minimum 84-month sentence, which was required to run <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>consecutively to the sentence for the drug offense. Based on the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a) factors, the district court varied downward and sentenced Jackson to 156 months for the drug conviction, followed by the mandatory consecutive 84-month sentence for the firearm conviction, yielding a total sentence of 240 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">In 2014 Jackson filed a <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce his sentence, contending that Amendment 782, which retroactively amended \u00a7 2D1.1, lowered his offense level. The district court determined that, although Amendment 782 lowered the offense level for Jackson\u2019s drug conviction, the downward variance he had received rendered his current sentence lower than the amended guidelines range. Because that variance was not for substantial assistance, the guidelines prohibited a comparable reduction to the amended range. The district court concluded that it lacked the authority to reduce Jackson\u2019s sentence and denied his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions about its authority to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Douglas, </em>576 F.3d 1216, 1218 n. 1 (11th Cir.2009). Jackson is correct that Amendment 782 reduced his offense level for his drug conviction to 33, yielding an amended guidelines range of 168 to 210 months. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(d); U.S.S.G., App. C, Amend. 782 (2014). But his sentence for the drug offense \u2014 156 months \u2014 is below the amended guidelines range, and the variance he received was not based on substantial assistance to authorities. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A)-(B) (providing that \u201cthe court shall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) ... to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range\u201d unless the original sentence was reduced pursuant to a government motion for a downward variance based on substantial assistance). The district court was not authorized by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce Jackson\u2019s sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">Jackson also contends that the district court should have reduced the sentence for his firearm conviction from 84 months to 60 months because, in violation of the rule announced in <em>Alleyne, </em>the government did not prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that he brandished a firearm. <em>See Alleyne, </em>570 U.S. at -, 133 S.Ct. at 2155. Because he raised this argument for the first time on appeal, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>741 F.3d 1245, 1248 (11th Cir.2014). Under that standard, the defendant must show \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. If those conditions are met, we may exercise our discretion to correct the error only if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-11\">The district court did not err, plainly or otherwise, in failing to reduce Jackson\u2019s sentence for the firearm conviction because <em>Alleyne </em>is not an amendment to the guidelines that would authorize a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>cf. United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) \u201cis a Supreme Court decision, not a retroactively applicable guideline amendment by the Sentencing Commission. Therefore, <em>Booker </em>is inapplicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions\u201d). For these reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Jackson\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
