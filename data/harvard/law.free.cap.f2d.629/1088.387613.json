General Finance Corp., </em>535 F.2d 295 (5th Cir. 1976), <em>modified, </em>552 F.2d 1142 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 891, 98 S.Ct. 265, 54 L.Ed.2d 176 (1977), it is clear and unambiguous in relation to an automobile, the transfer of which is precisely regulated by Florida law. <em>See </em>Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 319.22-.24 (1975 &amp; Supp.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
