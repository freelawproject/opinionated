We answer in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">Evid. R. 103 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-11\">\u201c(A) <em>Effect of erroneous ruling. </em>Error may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the party is affected, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-13\">\u201c(2) <em>Offer of proof. </em>In case the ruling is one excluding evidence, the substance of the evidence was made known to the court by offer <em>or was apparent from the context within which questions were asked. </em>Offer of proof is not necessary if evidence is excluded during cross-examination.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-14\">Pursuant to the explicit provisions of this rule, a party may not predicate error on the exclusion of evidence during the examination in chief unless <em>two </em>conditions are met: (1) the exclusion of such evidence must affect a substantial right of the party <em>and </em>(2) the substance of the excluded evidence was made known to the court by proffer <em>or </em>was apparent from the context within which questions were asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-15\">In accordance with this interpretation of Evid. R. 103, we modify our ruling in <em>State </em>v. <em>Hipkins </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St. 2d 80 [23 O.O.3d 123]. In <em>Hipkins, </em>at 82, this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-16\">\u201cFurthermore, it is well settled that when a court has sustained objections to an inquiry during the examination in chief, a statement must be made as to what the expected answer would be in order that the reviewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>court can determine whether or not the [ruling of the] trial court is prejudicial. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Rhodes </em>(1903), 68 Ohio St. 500, 505.* * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">While the better practice, in every instance, may be to proffer excluded evidence, under Evid. R. 103 a party is not <em>required </em>to proffer excluded evidence in order to preserve any alleged error for review if the substance of the excluded evidence is apparent to the court from the context within which questions were asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Appellant argues that appellee\u2019s failure to <em>proffer </em>the statements allegedly made to him by Smith rendered the record insufficient for the court of appeals to find that prejudicial error had occurred. To base error on evidence not expressly proffered, appellant argues, would require a reviewing court to speculate as to the merits of the alleged error. Under the specific facts presented in this case, we do not agree with appellant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Upon review of the record, we note the following testimony from appellee\u2019s direct examination during his case in chief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-8\">\u201cQ. All right, now, at the time of this first meeting, did Kelly make any request of you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-9\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-10\">\u201cQ.

Why was it you agreed to make that sale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-23\">\u201cMs. Howland: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-24\">\u201cThe Court: He made \u2014 that\u2019s opened. He may answer subject to a motion to strike.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-26\">\u201cQ. Why was it that you agreed to make that sale?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-27\">\u201cA. Because I was badgered for the past three weeks to make the sale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-28\">\u201cMs. Howland: Motion to strike.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-29\">\u201cThe Court: Sustained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-30\">The questions presented throughout appellee\u2019s above-noted testimony reveal that appellee was trying to establish that he, appellee, had been induced to sell cocaine. From the context of the questions asked, we find, in accordance with Evid. R. 103(A)(2), that the intended testimony was obvious: appellee would have stated that Smith repeatedly urged him to sell cocaine. Thus, the court of appeals did have a sufficient record upon which to base its finding that appellee\u2019s testimony had been improperly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-31\">Having so decided, the foregoing determination does not, however, dictate that appellee be granted a new trial. As noted, a party may not predicate error on the exclusion of evidence unless <em>two </em>conditions are met. While appellee in this case has fulfilled one of those conditions, he did not demonstrate that the exclusion of Smith\u2019s statements affected any substantial right of appellee. Moreover, we are convinced that even if the excluded testimony had been admitted, such evidence would not negate the overwhelming proof of defendant\u2019s guilt. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St. 3d 281, paragraph six of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed and the judgment of the trial court is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b224-6\">Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, C.

I certainly agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the subject matter of the improperly excluded testimony <em>(i.e., </em>entrapment defense) was apparent from the context and nature of the questions posited by defense counsel during appellee\u2019s direct examination. Cf. <em>Price </em>v. <em>Daugherty </em>(1982), 5 Ohio App. 3d 157; <em>Bilikam </em>v. <em>Bilikam </em>(1982), 2 Ohio App. 3d 300, 304<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Callahan </em>(C.A. 6, 1977), 551 F. 2d 733.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See, also, 1 Weissenberger, Ohio Evidence (1985), Section 103.2, However, I part company with this court\u2019s conclusion that under Evid. R. 103(A) the exclusion of this crucial evidence did not affect a \u201csubstantial right\u201d of appellee. See, also, Crim. R. 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">It is beyond debate that \u201c[entrapment is an affirmative defense under R.C. 2901.05(C)(2).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Doran </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St. 3d 187, paragraph two of the syllabus. In this case appellee admitted that he sold cocaine to the undercover police officer but offered as his <em>sole </em>defense the factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>assertion that he had been entrapped by the state. In paragraph one of the syllabus in <em>Doran, supra, </em>we recognized the parameters of this defense by holding that \u201c[t]he defense of entrapment is established where the criminal design originates with the officials of the government, and they implant in the mind of an innocent person the disposition to commit the alleged offense and induce its commission in order to prosecute.\u201d (Followed in <em>State </em>v. <em>Italiano </em>[1985], 18 Ohio St. 3d 38, 42.)</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">As such, the essence of the entrapment defense is the accused\u2019s lack of predisposition to commit the crime. Furthermore, to ensure fairness in the guilt-determination process we admonished in <em>Doran </em>at 192 that \u201c* * * evidence relevant to predisposition should be freely admitted * *</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">In <em>Doran </em>we set forth the following non-exhaustive list of factual matters which are certainly \u201c* * * relevant on the issue of predisposition: (1) the accused\u2019s previous involvement in criminal activity of the nature charged, (2) the accused\u2019s ready acquiescence to the inducements offered by the police, (3) the accused\u2019s expert knowledge in the area of the criminal activity charged, (4) the accused\u2019s ready access to contraband, and (5) the accused\u2019s willingness to involve himself in criminal activity. Under this approach, the evidence on the issue of an accused\u2019s predisposition is more reliable than the evidence of the nature of inducement by police agents under the objective test.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">In this case, defense counsel stated that since the police informant (Kelly Smith) could not be located for examination at trial, Gilmore was going to recount their conversations during which he was entrapped by the state. As the appellate court opinion points out, the trial court was certainly aware of Gilmore\u2019s alleged affirmative defense. Additionally, the entire trial transcript is but some one hundred thirty pages and indicates that the defense only called two witnesses, other than appellee, and the thrust of the questioning during the defense\u2019s case in chief was to show, <em>inter alia, </em>that the informant had a past relationship with the police, that she induced Gilmore to sell drugs, and that Gilmore did not usually sell drugs. Lastly, defense counsel admitted in his brief opening remarks that the transaction took place but asserted, as appellee\u2019s defense, that he was \u201cinduced to commit the crime, that the activity of the State permeates this entire incident, that the incident was planned by the State, conceived by the State, that they persuaded, encouraged, induced the defendant to carry this act out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Defense counsel then outlined for the court what appellee would seek to demonstrate at trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">\u201cI believe the evidence will show that there was enticement here, big money, friendship, little risk, and that had that not been provided, this defendant would not have engaged in that activity. I believe also there was fraud and trickery, false statements that were made by the State of Ohio and that that is the kind of conduct which is not proper and, therefore, if, in fact, this incident occurred or a crime occurred, the defendant should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>excused from that. The activity of the State permeates this entire event. We have the State conceiving the event, encouraging it, trying to persuade the defendant and this involved in the discussion of it and for that reason I believe the defendant should be found, we would submit, not guilty after the evidence is presented.\u201d See, also, the questions asked during appellee\u2019s direct examination set forth in the majority opinion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Since Kelly was not present at trial, it was hardly speculative of the appellate court to find that the defense sought to prove these things through the only relevant defense evidence advanced at trial, Gilmore\u2019s own testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The majority\u2019s unfortunate conclusion that the improper exclusion of appellee\u2019s evidence offered in support of his defense against the charges was harmless, because the error did not affect a \u201csubstantial right,\u201d is clearly in error.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The concept of disregarding errors which do not \u201caffect the substantial rights of the adverse party\u201d has long been followed by the courts of this state. <em>E.g., Elser </em>v. <em>Parke </em>(1943), 142 Ohio St. 261, 273 [27 O.O. 204]. In this regard, it has been observed in one leading treatise that Fed. R. Evid. 103 is but \u201c* * * a codification of the basic rules of offering evidence and objecting to admission of evidence. In order to preserve an objection for appeal, ordinarily a party must make a specific, as opposed to a general, objection. If, however, a specific ground is apparent, no absolute requirement of specification will be imposed. Once an objection is made, if the Trial Judge excludes evidence, the party offering the evidence must make an offer of proof. This is usually nothing more than a relation of the substance of the evidence in order that the Appellate Court may know what evidence would have been offered but for the objection. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Rule sensibly states that Trial Judges should attempt to conduct proceedings relating to the determination of the admissibility of evidence outside of the presence of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">\u201cThe Rule attempts to incorporate both the concepts of harmless and plain error. If an error has not resulted in damage to the complaining party, it may be deemed harmless and a new trial need not be had. On the other hand, even <em>if </em>a timely objection or <em>an offer of proof is not made, if a grave injustice might result from a serious trial error, the Appellate Court may still order a new trial.\u201d </em>Saltzburg &amp; Redden, Federal Rules of Evidence Manual (4 Ed. 1986) 15-17. (Emphasis added, footnotes omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Also of guidance are the remarks of one noted commentator whose examination of Ohio\u2019s Rules of Evidence and interpretation of case law led to a conclusion that \u201c[e]rror may be divided into four classes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\">\u201c1. HARMLESS ERRORS. These are errors which are brought to the court\u2019s attention, but which do not provide grounds for reversal because they do not affect substantial rights and are not prejudicial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-8\">\u201c2. PRESERVED ERRORS. These are mistakes which are brought to the trial court\u2019s attention, and which affect substantial rights; being prejudicial, they provide grounds for reversal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-9\">\u201c3. WAIVABLE ERRORS. These are prejudicial errors which may or may not have been brought to the court\u2019s attention, but which were in fact or in contemplation of law, waived prior to appeal, and which, because of waiver, do not provide grounds for appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-10\">\u201c4. PLAIN ERRORS. These involve errors which are not brought to the trial court\u2019s attention but which affect substantial rights, are deemed too fundamental to be waived in contemplation of law, and may be noticed on appeal. * * *\u201d Palmer, Ohio Rules of Evidence Rules Manual (1984), at 12.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">As applied to this case, today\u2019s majority essentially decrees that the complete deprivation of an accused\u2019s only affirmative defense by a trial court, although preserved as error, falls into the \u201charmless\u201d category of errors. To the contrary, considerations of reason, logic and justice command a holding that the trial court\u2019s errant evidentiary ruling was in fact a \u201cpreserved error\u201d justifying reversal and remand to the common pleas court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">In this regard, the instant appellate court\u2019s persuasive analysis accurately observed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-13\">\u201cCritical to that [entrapment] defense were the statements made to him by Kelly Smith. The <em>question for the factfinder </em>was not whether these statements were true but what effect, if any, they had upon the state of mind of Gilmore. As such, they were not hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-16\">\u201cWe fully appreciate the fact that the trial court understood the gist of Gilmore\u2019s defense. <em>It is very possible that had the trial court, who was the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number><em>factfinder, heard the specific statements attributed by Gilmore to Kelly Smith, the outcome would not have been different. </em>It is entirely possible that the trial court may have chosen to disbelieve Gilmore\u2019s testimony as to what Smith said to him, with or without rebuttal evidence by the State. It is also possible that the trial court could have concluded that regardless of what Kelly Smith said to him, Owen Gilmore nevertheless failed to prove his lack of predisposition to sell cocaine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-5\">\u201cHowever, because it was encumbent <em>[sic\\ </em>upon Gilmore to prove lack of predisposition by the greater weight of the evidence, we believe that the trial court, in excluding the statements allegedly made by Kelly Smith, improperly handicapped Gilmore in presenting evidence of entrapment. <em>We cannot say the error was harmless. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added in part.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">This application is consistent with our ruling in <em>Italiano, supra, </em>at 43 which states there must be \u201c* * * sufficient probative evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that defendant was predisposed to commit the offense * * * and that the criminal design was not planted in his mind by the state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Until today this court has exhibited a staunch \u201c* * * unwillingness to hide behind the doctrine of harmless error when the determination that error has been committed is inescapable.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferguson </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St. 3d 160, 166 at fn. 5. While I may assent to the majority\u2019s cavalier observation that the record before this court contains \u201coverwhelming proof of defendant\u2019s guilt,\u201d I fear that the majority has asked and answered the wrong question. In this instance, our query is not whether the state has shown that appellee sold drugs to the police. Appellee does not dispute that the state\u2019s case is strong relative to this issue. Rather, the question remaining for the fact-finder is whether appellee\u2019s evidence demonstrates by a preponderance that the police implanted in the mind of an innocent person the disposition to commit the offense. See R.C. 2901.05(A). Accordingly, appellee\u2019s affirmative defense hinged on his ability to convince a trier of fact of his innocence by reason of entrapment. His testimony in this regard was improperly excluded at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">In <em>Doran, supra, </em>we held at 194 that the mere failure of the trial court to properly allocate \u201cthe burden of proof on entrapment\u201d in its jury instruction constituted \u201cprejudicial error\u201d justifying a new trial. Surely, it is inconsistent as well as senseless for this court to perfunctorily state today that a far more substantial trial error, resulting in the complete exclusion of an accused\u2019s evidence, where he has the burden, bearing on an entrapment defense, is mystically \u201charmless.\u201d I emphatically dissent and would order the cause to be remanded to the trial court for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b224-10\"> In <em>Bilikam, supra, </em>the reviewing appellate court, in an opinion authored by Judge Moyer, found that the nature of what would have been testified was apparent and that both the parties and the trial court \u201cwere aware that defendant would have testified to an agreement\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 305) that was the subject of the action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b224-11\"> The federal rule, unlike Ohio\u2019s, applies equally to cross-examination. The following analysis from the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Callahan, supra, </em>at 737-738, is nevertheless both pertinent and instructive: \u201cThere was no offer of proof in the record to show what appellant\u2019s counsel would have elicited from Kimble through his inquiry into K &amp; B\u2019s past contacts with other unions. * * * We do not condone the perfunctory way in which appellant\u2019s counsel stated the purpose of his question and then simply let the matter drop once an adverse ruling had been made. Such treatment of the issue at trial tends to belie appellant\u2019s fervent contentions before this court that the past dealings of K <em>&amp; </em>B with other unions constituted the essence of his defense.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-12\">\u201cNevertheless, we are persuaded to find that appellant\u2019s <em>counsel did provide an explanation of the purpose </em>of his question sufficient to preserve the issue. Appellant\u2019s counsel did state to the court that he was attempting to determine if Kimble \u201chad been approached in this situation many times before,\u201d and that such evidence \u201cwould bear upon his <em>mental state.\u201d </em>In view of the fact that appellant\u2019s counsel <em>was seeking facts peculiarly within the knowledge of the witness </em>he was cross-examining, and in view of the fact that <em>inquiry into this area was cut off at the threshold, </em>we believe that counsel\u2019s failure to more adequately apprise the trial court of the testimony he hoped to elicit from Kimble was not fatal to this, appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-13\">\u201cThe judgment of the District Court is reversed, <em>and the cause is remanded for a new trial.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b226-7\"> As such, defense counsel set forth his intention to present relevant evidence bearing on the issues concerning predisposition set forth in <em>Doran, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b226-8\"> I suspect that the majority may have fallen prey to the trap presented by the seemingly inconsistent interworkings of Evid. R. 103(A), effect of erroneous ruling, and Evid. R. 103(D), plain error. Saltzburg &amp; Redden\u2019s Evidence Manual, <em>infra, </em>explains the dichotomy as follows, at 17-18:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-9\">\u201cIt is interesting that the term \u2018substantial right\u2019 is used with respect to both harmless and plain error. The Rule may thus be contradictory. On the one hand it suggests that there is a penalty for failing either to object or to make an offer of proof, i.e., an Appellate Court will not consider any error on appeal unless substantial rights are affected. But, if any error is harmless unless substantial rights are affected, it is not clear what is gained by making a timely objection at trial. Of course, if no offer of proof is made, it may be difficult to ever demonstrate a potential abuse of substantial rights, since the Appellate Court may never know what evidence might have been offered. Aside from this, the contradiction remains. The answer may lie in the fact that the draftsmen of the Rule never attempted to set forth precise tests for harmless and plain error. For example, the rule adopted by the Supreme Court is that any constitutional error must be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in a criminal case. This is recognized in the Advisory Committee Note but not in the text of the Rule, even though some of the responses to the Congress with respect to the Rules requested that a specific standard be set forth. To the extent that Courts will lay down standards for harmless and plain error on a case-by-case basis, there may prove to be no inconsistency.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
