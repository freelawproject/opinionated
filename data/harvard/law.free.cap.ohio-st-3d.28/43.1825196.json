Although the nation\u2019s highest court has not entertained this exact issue, that court\u2019s pronouncements concerning related settings are germane to the instant cause. We find that \u201cmuch of the reasoning in these cases is instructive and provides guidance regarding the scope of constitutional restrictions, the competing interests involved, and the attendant public policy con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>cerns.\u201d <em>Gutter </em>v. <em>Dow Jones, Inc. </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St. 3d 286, 288. In light of the constitutional implications and competing societal interests advanced, we believe that Mr. Justice Cardozo\u2019s apt observation that \u201c[a] Judge must be a historian and prophet all in one\u201d is descriptive of our task in this unique case.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Clearly, the genesis for a resolution of the instant cause is the decision of <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Georgia </em>(1969), 394 U.S. 557. In <em>Stanley, </em>Georgia police entered the defendant\u2019s home to search for evidence of illegal bookmaking activity. While there, the police found two films in the defendant\u2019s desk which depicted obscene matter involving adults. Stanley was arrested, indicted and convicted for knowingly having possession of obscene matter in violation of Georgia law. On appeal, the Supreme Court first recognized that, under its previous interpretations, material which had been determined to be obscene was not protected by the First Amendment. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court reversed the state court judgment by holding that the state could not constitutionally criminalize the mere private possession of obscene material. In striking the state statute, the court\u2019s opinion focused on that aspect of the First Amendment which protects individual freedom of thought or ideas:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-6\">\u201cIt is now well established that th\u00e9 Constitution protects the right to receive information and ideas, \u2018This freedom [of speech and press] * * * necessarily protects the right to receive ***.\u2019*** <em>This right to receive information </em>and ideas, regardless of their social worth, see <em>Winters </em>v. <em>New York, </em>333 U.S. 507, 510 (1948), <em>is fundamental to our free society. </em>Moreover, in the context of this case \u2014 a prosecution for mere possession of printed or filmed matter jin the privacy of a person\u2019s own home \u2014 that right takes on an added dimension. For also fundamental is the right to be free, <em>except in very limited circumstances, </em>from unwanted governmental intrus-tions into one\u2019s privacy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-7\">\u201cThese are the rights that appellant is asserting in the case before us. He is asserting the right to read or observe what he pleases \u2014 the right to satisfy his intellectual and emotional needs in the privacy of his own home. He is asserting the right to be free from state inquiry into the contents of his library. Georgia coiftends that appellant does not have these rights, that there are certain types of materials that the individual may not read or even possess. Georgia justifies this assertion by arguing that the films in the present case are Obscene. But we think that mere categorization of these films as \u2018obscene\u2019 is insufficient justification for such a drastic invasion of personal liberties guaranteed by the First and Fourth Amendments. Whatever may be the justifications for other statutes regulating obscenity, we do not think they reach into the privacy of one\u2019s own home. If the First Amendment means anything, it means that a State has no business telling a man, sitting alone in his own house, what books he may read or what films he may watch. Our whole constitutional heritage rebels <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>at the thought of giving government the power to control men\u2019s minds.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Stanley, supra, </em>at 564-565.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">After <em>Stanley, </em>various cases raised the issue of whether this right to receive information (even of an obscene nature) necessarily created a right to distribute or deliver obscene matter to another for purposes of his private possession of such matter. The Supreme Court has consistently rejected this notion and limited <em>Stanley </em>to its facts. See, <em>e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Reidel </em>(1971), 402 U.S. 351; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Orito </em>(1973), 413 U.S. 139; <em>Paris Adult Theatre I </em>v. <em>Slaton </em>(1973), 413 U.S. 49. For example, in <em>Reidel, supra, </em>where the appellant was convicted of using the mail to <em>deliver </em>obscene matter, the court upheld the conviction but noted at 356 that <em>Stanley </em>focused on freedom of mind and thought and the privacy of one\u2019s home:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-5\">\u201cThe personal constitutional rights of those like Stanley to possess and read obscenity in their homes and their freedom of mind and thought do not depend on * * * whether obscenity is constitutionally protected. Their rights to have and view that material in private are independently saved by the Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Thus, <em>Stanley </em>has always stood for \u2014 and still stands for \u2014 the proposition that -the state may not, consistent with the First Amendment, regulate the mere private possession of material in one\u2019s own home merely because it is obscene. However, it is also significant to our inquiry that Justice Marshall cautioned at fn. 11 of his majority opinion in <em>Stanley </em>that the court <em>did not </em>\u201c* * * <em>mean to express any opinion on statutes making criminal possession of other types of printed, </em>filmed, or recorded <em>materials.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 568. Rather, it was recognized in the <em>Stanley </em>opinion that <em>there could be cases involving other subjects where </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>\u201c* * * <em>compelling reasons may exist for overriding the right of the individual to possess those materials.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>Appellant herein argues that the state\u2019s interests in this instance constitute the \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d or \u201climited circumstances\u201d envisioned by the <em>Stanley </em>court as justifying government intrusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">It is notable that in <em>Stanley </em>the state of Georgia unsuccessfully asserted, <em>inter alia, </em>its rights to protect the individual possessor\u2019s mind from the effects of obscenity and to prevent future deviant sexual behavior linked to exposure to obscene materials. <em>Id. </em>at 565-566. If appellant herein was raising the same interests, our query would be over because we could simply apply the solid notions of individual liberty set forth in the <em>Stanley </em>decision to this set of circumstances.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">However, in the instant case the state argues that Ohio\u2019s Legislature is justified in barring possession of materials which visually depict minors engaging in sexual activity because society\u2019s interest in safeguarding the privacy and physical and psychological well-being of its children is paramount.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Because of the great respect historically accorded to free speech, it is essential that we ascertain the precise nature of the state\u2019s interest in protecting its children. Our task, then, is to ascertain if these interests are compelling and, if so, whether they also outweigh the fundamental right to be left alone in one\u2019s home which was so clearly articulated in <em>Stanley </em>et al.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">To aid in our understanding of the state\u2019s impetus for the eradication of child pornography through the banning of its possession, as well as the competing interests involved, we turn to the more recent Supreme Court pronouncement in <em>New York </em>v. <em>Ferber </em>(1982), 458 U.S. 747.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Against a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>backdrop of public indignation over the proliferation of child pornography, the <em>Ferber </em>court <em>defined a new category of unprotected speech. </em>In contrast to <em>Stanley, Ferber </em>dealt specifically with child pornography, not obscenity involving only adults, and upheld the constitutionality of a criminal statute outlawing the <em>promotion </em>of sexual performances by minors through the distribution of material depicting such performances. As such, \u201cthe Court unanimously upheld a New York criminal statute that bans the distribution of nonobscene material depicting sexual conduct by children.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The decision essentially holds that states <em>can </em>constitutionally define the visual depiction of sexual conduct by children as obscenity without having to satisfy the threshold constitutional test for determining whether the material is obscene. The court ruled that the state\u2019s \u201ccompelling\u201d interest in eliminating child pornography was sufficiently great to allow the states to bypass the test for adult obscenity stated in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>California </em>(1973), 413 U.S. 15. Henceforth, states may automatically declare such visual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>depictions of sexual conduct by minors to be obscene and, as such, unprotected by the First Amendment. The <em>Ferber </em>court did not consider the propriety of state criminal sanctions concerning the final stage of the child pornography cycle, <em>i.e., </em>private possession. Nevertheless, the decision does touch on the competing interests involved in this case; the court\u2019s discussion of the state\u2019s goals is instructive. In recognizing New York\u2019s \u201ccompelling\u201d interest of safeguarding the physical and mental well-being of its children, the court explained that \u201c[t]he prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse of children constitutes a government objective of surpassing importance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 757.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">In this vein, the <em>Ferber </em>court set forth a number of important and legitimate state objectives accomplished by the eradication of child pornography. For instance, the court observed that \u201c[t]he legislative judgment, as well as the judgment found in the relevant literature, is that the use of children as subjects of pornographic materials is harmful to the physiological, emotional and mental health of the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 758.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The <em>Ferber </em>court found that the existence of photographs \u201cdepicting sexual activity by juveniles is intrinsically related to the sexual abuse of children in at least two ways. First, the materials produced are a permanent record of the children\u2019s participation and the harm to the child is exacerbated by their circulation. Second, the distribution network for child pornography must be closed if the production of material which requires the sexual exploitation of children is to be effectively controlled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">The court also discerned that state efforts directed at the banning of production would not adequately solve the dilemma. The hidden reality of the child pornography industry makes it \u201cdifficult, if not impossible, to halt the exploitation of children by pursuing only those who produce * * <em>Id. </em>at 759-760. In this regard, we note that the possessor\u2019s desire to maintain depictions of child abuse also \u201cprovide[s] an economic motive for and * * * [is] thus an integral part of the production of such materials, an activity illegal throughout the Nation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 761. A flourishing home market for such abusive materials will help guarantee that there will be additional victimization of children. Cf. <em>id. </em>at 761-762, fn. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">Against these substantial overriding interests we believe that, like the promotion stage of the child pornography cycle addressed in <em>Ferber, </em>the value of permitting possession of \u201cphotographic reproductions of children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>engaged in lewd sexual conduct is exceedingly modest, if not <em>de minimis.\u201d Id. </em>at 762.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>\u201c* * * It has been found that sexually exploited children are unable to develop healthy affectionate relationships in later life, have sexual dysfunctions, and have a tendency to become sexual abusers as adults. [Citations omitted.] * * * [S]exually exploited children [are] predisposed to self-destructive behavior such as drug and alcohol abuse or prostitution * * *. [Citations omitted.] Sexual molestation by adults is often involved in the production of child sexual performances. [Citation omitted.] When such performances are recorded and distributed, the child\u2019s privacy interests are also invaded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>Unlike the obscene materials considered in <em>Stanley, Miller, </em>et al., child pornography involves, by its nature, the physical, mental and sexual abuse, seduction and harmful exploitation of children. The depictions sought to be banned by the state are but memorializations of cruel mistreatment and unlawful conduct. Additionally, such material would continue to exploit and victimize the children shown by haunting them in the future. <em>Ferber </em>at 759, fn. 10.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We believe the interests of the state in protecting the privacy, health, emotional welfare and well-rounded growth of its young citizens, together with its undeniable interest of safeguarding the future of society as a whole, comprise exactly the type of \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d justifying a \u201cvery limited\u201d First Amendment intrusion envisioned by the <em>Stanley </em>court. At the same time, the cost to the individual possessor\u2019s right of free speech, privacy and thought, caused by the state\u2019s banning of visual mementos from an episode of sexual abuse of a child, is slight. Moreover, the content value of such material is trifling and alterr native means of simulation exist.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>Ohio\u2019s General Assembly has determined that it is necessary to prohibit possession of such materials in order to halt sexual exploitation and abuse of children.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It is not our role to pass judgment on whether the legislature has chosen the best course to effect its admittedly admirable goal of combating child pornography. As the <em>Ferber </em>court stated, \u201c[w]e shall not second-guess this legislative judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 758. Rather, our sacred mandate is to ascertain whether the state\u2019s chosen method runs afoul of, or unnecessarily intrudes on, constitutionally protected First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">\u201cIt must be presumed that the legislature, in the enactment of this law, had in mind * * *\u201d the constitutional provision and restrictions involved and only intended to enact legislation which is in accordance with its power. <em>State, ex rel. Bailey, </em>v. <em>George </em>(1915), 92 Ohio St. 344, 346. \u201c* * * When an enactment of the General Assembly is challenged, the challenger must overcome a strong presumption of constitutionality.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Jackman, </em>v. <em>Ct. of Common Pleas </em>(1967), 9 Ohio St. 2d 159, 161 [38 O.O.2d 404]. As Justice Locher replied in <em>State </em>v. <em>Dorso </em>(1983), 4 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>Ohio St. 3d 60, 61, \u201ccourts must apply all presumptions * * * so as to uphold, if at all possible, a statute or ordinance assailed as unconstitutional.\u201d (Followed in <em>Kettering </em>v. <em>State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>[1986], 26 Ohio St. 3d 50, 52.)</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">In recognition of our discussion above, the presumption of constitutionality which blankets legislative enactments, and in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition in <em>Ferber </em>at 756 that the \u201cStates are entitled to greater leeway in the regulation of pornographic depictions of children,\u201d we conclude that the competing public policy and constitutional concerns tilt decidedly in favor of sustaining this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Consistent with our understanding of the Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncements in <em>Stanley </em>and <em>Ferber, </em>and based on the foregoing opinion, we hold that R.C. 2907.322(A)(5), which prohibits the knowing possession or control of material which shows a minor participating or engaging in sexual activity, masturbation, or bestiality, does not violate the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, as made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment. Ohio\u2019s compelling state interests of preserving its children\u2019s privacy and protecting them from the cruel physiological, mental, and emotional abuse caused by sexual seduction, exploitation, and mistreatment occasioned by child pornography, outweigh appellee\u2019s interest in possessing such visual depictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b82-9\">Sweeney, Locher and C. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b82-10\">Holmes, Douglas and Wright, JJ., separately concur in the syllabus and judgment.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b82-11\">C. Brown, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n<author id=\"b82-12\">Holmes, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AmF\">concurring. I fully agree with the result as well as with the reasoning in the majority opinion. However, I write separately to make several observations regarding the applicable legal standard. I would also add several reasons why the act of privately possessing photographic child pornography is inimical to society\u2019s legitimate and recognized interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-13\">It should be emphasized that <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Georgia </em>(1969), 394 U.S. 557 recognized in the facts of that case that a combination of constitutional rights were infringed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Consequently, the <em>Stanley </em>court was required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>fashion a compound resolution which was partly First Amendment analysis and partly the \u201cadded dimension\u201d of Fourth Amendment privacy principles. <em>Id. </em>at 564. The court\u2019s First Amendment inquiry was plainly along the lines of the clear and present danger test,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and was a significant departure from the standard set forth in <em>Roth </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1957), 354 U.S. 476, 486-487 [14 O.O.2d 331]. The state\u2019s interest in controlling obscenity, which seemed sufficient in <em>Roth, </em>was, in <em>Stanley, </em>insufficient without any greater countervailing state interest. The later reaffirmation of <em>Roth, </em>see, <em>e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Thirty-seven Photographs </em>(1971), 402 U.S. 363, demonstrated that the <em>Stanley </em>decision flowed not so much from the content of the material as the fear of consequences which might flow from the privacy intrusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">There was no justifiable state interest where there was no provable connection between the act of possession and crimes of sexual violence. Nor was there any demonstrable victimization to the participants in production, dissemination, or consumption of obscenity. Although \u201c* * * the circumstances that would make the clear and present danger test applicable were not present,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Stanley </em>reserved power to regulate private use and private possession where the state demonstrates a substantial and subordinating state interest.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See, <em>e.g., Ginsberg </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1968), 390 U.S. 629 [44 O.O.2d 339].</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">In <em>New York </em>v. <em>Ferber </em>(1982), 458 U.S. 747, child pornography was described as \u201cnot entitled to First Amendment protection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 765. More significantly, <em>Ferber </em>allowed the state to regulate production and distribution of child pornography without proof of obscenity.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The material need only visually depict a child, below a certain age, engaged in sexual conduct, which conduct, as in the Ohio statute, was specifically defined. <em>Id. </em>at 761.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">While not bearing upon the issue of possession, <em>Ferber </em>stated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>unanimous belief of the court that child pornography is nothing less than the evil sexual exploitation of children with demonstrable harm to their later lives and which justifies fully the state\u2019s interest in regulating child pornography. <em>Id. </em>at 757-759. Moreover, the <em>Ferber </em>court specifically concluded that: prevention of sexual exploitation of children is a governmental objective of surpassing importance; banning production only does not adequately address the problems posed by a permanent record of the child\u2019s participation and the incentive to produce posed by circulation of the material; selling and advertising child pornography \u201cprovide an economic motive for and are thus an integral part of the production of such materials\u201d; the cost to free speech resulting from a ban of child pornography is slight; and content-based classification is permissible when the evil to be restricted \u201cso overwhelmingly outweighs the expressive interests, if any, at stake, that no process of case-by-case adjudication is required.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Ferber, supra, </em>at 756-764.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">The act of privately possessing photographic child pornography is so inimical to society\u2019s legitimate and recognized interests that a state may constitutionally intrude on those First Amendment and privacy interests set forth in <em>Stanley. </em>Initially, child pornography has several noticeable similarities to contraband drugs, for which possession is also an offense. When drugs are illegally possessed and used, the primary victim is the consumer. Yet the state correctly punishes everyone in the chain for the crime of possession, including the distributor, manufacturer and victim-possessor. There is no logical difference whether the admitted victimization occurs during the production or consumption phase of the process. So also should the state have power to regulate photographic child pornography. Since it is so unlike literature as to possess mere <em>de minimis </em>literary value, its entire chain of possession ought reasonably to be subject to sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">The purchaser of child pornography who gives money in exchange for this procured misery is a vital part of the production-distribution system. Such knowing actions give him equal guilt with the procurer, the producer and the distributor. Those who purchase or seek out such materials are at the very core of the problem by knowingly creating a demand for the abuse. It is his ultimate enjoyment of the perverse and harmful acts recorded that fuels the entire industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">There is nothing in the mere existence of contraband under one\u2019s private control which creates a need for governmental regulation. Instead, it is the subsequent use to which these items are put after possession and the potential for grave harm flowing from such use which justify the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">One of the primary uses of child pornography is for the systematic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>desensitization, as part of an insidious process, to induce children to engage in the acts depicted.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Apparently the largest amount of child molestation is committed in local communities to feed the \u201cinformal cottage industry\u201d which is only partly operated for profit.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Once a youngster is selected, child pornography is utilized to systematically reduce his inhibitions through calculated exposure to varying degrees of the material. \u201c* * * After the child\u2019s anxiety to the material has been reduced, the pedophile can convince him to participate and be photographed. The child, after having seen \u2018all the other kids do it\u2019 and being reassured by a trusted adult friend, will participate in sexual conduct with the pedophile. The pedophile needs the child pornography * * * to facilitate the seduction of other children.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Child pornography, with the same techniques, is also used to induce children into child prostitution.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Consequently, child pornography is a gravely harmful instrumentality.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Laws banning production and distribution are insufficient to halt this abuse of children. \u201c \u2018The act of selling these materials is guaranteeing that there will be additional abuse of children.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ferber, supra, </em>at 761, fn. 13. It is not enough to pursue the producers and distributors since most of their activities have been forced underground. See <em>id. </em>at 760, fn. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Most readily apparent is that the Ohio statute is not at all concerned with the effect of child pornography, as visual stimulus, on the possessor. Furthermore, it is irrelevant whether society is offended by the idea so transmitted, for the written word is not the subject of this law. By comparison, the privacy interests set forth in <em>Stanley, </em>and acted upon in <em>Ferber, </em>are not nearly so weighty as the clear and present danger posed by the increased activity in child pornography production with its accompanying child molestation and rape.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> These are direct and perceivable harms which directly result from the ability to possess the depictions of such acts. This, I believe, is a significant and subordinating state interest sufficient to justify and uphold the constitutionality of the statute at issue under the standards announced in <em>Stanley, supra, </em>and <em>Ferber, supra.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b85-8\">Locher, J., concurs in the foregoing concurring opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b76-7\"> A consistent view was set forth by Judge Herbert of this court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Mapp </em>(1960), 170 Ohio St. 427 [11 O.O.2d 169], reversed in <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1961), 367 U.S. 643 [16 O.O.2d 384], Nine years before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision <em>in Stanley, </em>Judge Herbert prophetically dissented as follows in <em>Mapp:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-8\">- \u201cIt is a basic principle that laws restraining the fundamental liberties of the individual must have as their foundation a broad basic public need which overshadows the rights of the individual.

The right of the individual to read, to believe or disbelieve, and to think without governmental supervision is one of our basic liberties, but to dictate to the mature adult what books he may have in his own private library seems to the writer to be a clear infringement of his constitutional rights as an individual. Does the state have the power to prohibit the possession of chemistry books because from such books one might learn how to make a bomb or poisonous gas?

The question of whether this criminal statute is unconstitutional does not depend simply on the categorization of this material as child pornography as opposed to obscene material involving adults. The nature of the <em>material </em>was <em>not </em>the point in <em>Stanley. </em>The point was the nature of the First Amendment <em>right </em>to freedom of thought in the privacy of one\u2019s home which outweighed Georgia\u2019s interest in protecting the viewer. As Justice Harlan stated in his concurrence in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Reidel, supra, </em>at 360, <em>Stanley </em>preserves the fundamental \u201cright to a protective zone ensuring the freedom of a man\u2019s inner life, be it rich or sordid.\u201d Our task today is to balance this important First Amendment freedom with the state\u2019s admitted interest of protecting its children from the shocking injuries caused by the sexual abuse of children which the state insists will occur if possession of child pornography is countenanced by the law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b77-10\"> A number of other lower court decisions are of guidance but do not involve the mere private possession of child pornography in the home. For example, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Spargo </em>(1982), 103 Ill. App. 3d 280, 431 N.E. 2d 27, the defendant was convicted of <em>exhibiting </em>child pornography to another. Spargo had showed pictures of nude boys to an undercover policeman while they were seated in Spargo\u2019s car. Spargo contended that, pursuant to <em>Stanley, </em>the state could not punish private non-commercial dissemination or exhibition of child pornography. The court rejected this contention in stating at 285 that \u201cwhatever constitutional protections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number><em>Stanley </em>confers were relinquished by * * * [Spargo] when he removed the child pornography from the confines of his own home and exhibited it to another.\u201d The court also noted at 284 that the Supreme Court cases were \u201cconsistent in their interpretation of <em>Stanley </em>as protective <em>only of the right to possess obscene </em>material in one\u2019s own home.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"ALl\">Similarly, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Godek </em>(1982), 113 Misc. 2d 599, 449 N.Y. Supp. 2d 428, defendant was charged with <em>promoting </em>an obscene sexual performance by a child. In this case the defendant brought with him to a hotel room some of the items in his own collection of child pornography material in order to give it to another, who turned out to be a customs inspector. The court found <em>Stanley </em>inapplicable to protect the defendant, who was promoting this material outside his home. The court stated that such private <em>exchanges </em>of child pornography outside the home were not shielded by <em>Stanley. </em>See, also, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hale </em>(C.A. 9, 1986), 784 F. 2d 1465.</p>\n<p id=\"Ag_\">A somewhat closer scenario was presented by the recent case of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(C.A. 11, 1985), 776 F. 2d 978, certiorari denied (1986), _ U.S. _, 90 L. Ed. 2d 201. In <em>Miller </em>the defendant ordered a booklet from Europe which depicted children engaged in sexual conduct. He picked it up at his post office box and then took it home. He was thereafter arrested and convicted under a federal statute which outlaws the knowing receipt of child pornography through the mail. Miller contended that, under <em>Stanley, </em>he had a right to receive such pornography for his own use. Again, this contention was rejected on grounds that <em>Stanley </em>was strictly limited to the mere private possession of such material in the defendant\u2019s own home. Since Miller was outside his home when he received the pornography, the court distinguished <em>Stanley </em>and upheld his conviction, noting at 981 that the crime was complete before the material ever reached the defendant\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"AEE\">Consistent with the foregoing, it can be safely said that the state may permissibly criminalize the promotion, production, preparation, distribution, sale, exchange, delivery, dissemination or exhibition to others (for commercial or non-commercial purposes) of child pornography. The government may further punish the knowing receipt of such material through the mail. <em>Stanley </em>draws a line, at the front door of the home, and holds that the state may not constitutionally cross that line to outlaw the mere private possession of <em>obscene matter </em>without showing an intent to distribute it to others unless other compelling state interests, not advanced in <em>Stanley, </em>justify the intrusion. The unanswered question squarely presented by the instant cause is whether the state may cross the threshold when possession of <em>child pornography </em>is criminalized.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b78-10\"> Chayes, The Supreme Court, 1981 Term (1982), 96 Harv.

Appellee argues that obscenity and child pornography should be accorded the same treatment and, as such, mere private possession of child pornography may not be constitutionally proscribed. I do not agree. It is my judgment that child pornography is a separate category of unprotected speech and that banning private possession of depictions of children engaged in sexual acts does not require, as a condition precedent, a finding that such material is obscene. This conclusion is supported by the fact that although R.C. 2907.321(A)(5) prohibits the possession of material involving a minor if the material is obscene, R.C. 2907.322(A)(5), the statutory violation charged herein, prohibits the possession of material depicting minors involved in specified acts, with no mention of the word obscenity.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The apparent rationale for this distinction is that in addition to those recognized state interests which support the regulation of obscenity, even stronger independent state interests exist which justify state regulation in the area of child pornography. That is, the state certainly has an overriding interest in protecting its children from debauchery, exploitation and sexual abuse, for solely economic purposes and perverse sexual gratification. These additional and different interests require this court to perform a separate balancing test. This test is different from that used by courts deciding the constitutionality of state laws prohibiting possession of adult pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The very act of <em>creating </em>child pornography, in and of itself, is an abuse of children. Governmental authority to prevent child abuse certainly implies the authority to destroy the purely economic incentive to film the abuse itself, that incentive being the desire of the deviant to possess films of the sexual exploitation of children. As constitutional law expert and scholar Professor Laurence H. Tribe stated when addressing this issue<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-6\">\u201cGiven the great difficulty of directly enforcing laws against the crimes being filmed (especially if faces are concealed), and given the lack of any economic incentive to commit such crimes <em>apart </em>from the market for films of their commission (contrast films of bank robberies, say), it seems insufficient to reply that government must pursue the less restric<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>tive alternative of prosecuting the underlying crimes rather than prosecuting the filmmaker <em>or indeed confiscating the film. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added in part.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">While I agree with the judgment of the majority in this case, I arrive at my conclusion for different reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The facts in this case are clear: the appellee was in his hotel room, his lawful residence, and in his room were magazines and a picture which depicted children engaged in sexual activity. The children depicted were \u201cminors\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 2907.322, and the magazines were in the private possession and control of the appellee as proscribed by the statute. There is no evidence, direct or indirect, that appellee sold, produced or disseminated the subject magazines, or that he participated in any activity that would provide grounds to broaden the allegations set forth in the complaint.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">In his motion to dismiss, appellee limited his constitutional attack upon the statute to the language in R.C. 2907.322(A)(5), which prohibits mere possession of sexually oriented material involving a minor. Appellee <em>stipulated </em>that the publications were unlawful in nature, <em>viz., </em>that they portray minors engaged in sexual activity. Accordingly, no question is raised as to whether the materials are in fact obscene.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Appellee contends that the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Georgia </em>(1969), 394 U.S. 557, is determinative of the outcome of this case. In <em>Stanley, </em>the state of Georgia sought to impose criminal sanctions in a case involving mere possession of obscene materials depicting adults engaged in sexual activities. The court in that case held at 568:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-8\">\u201cWe hold that the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit making mere private possession of obscene material a crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">Appellant herein challenges the relevance of the <em>Stanley </em>court\u2019s holding, however, because in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the subject materials involved minor children. Appellant contends that <em>child </em>obscenity or pornography was not addressed by the Supreme Court until some thirteen years later in the case of <em>New York </em>v. <em>Ferber </em>(1982), 458 U.S. 747. Appellant urges that <em>Ferber </em>provides the law applicable to this case. In <em>Ferber, </em>the state\u2019s petition for certiorari was granted to decide the single question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-10\">\u201cTo prevent the abuse of children who are made to engage in sexual conduct for commercial purposes, could the New York State Legislature, consistent with the First Amendment, prohibit <em>the dissemination </em>of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>material which shows children engaged in sexual conduct, <em>regardless of whether such material is obscene?\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">The Supreme Court answered this question affirmatively. But appellee challenges the applicability of the pronouncements of the <em>Ferber </em>court, because the case does not address the constitutionality of a statute banning <em>private possession </em>of child pornography. I conclude that both cases provide guidance in deciding the question now before us, to wit: Whether R.C. 2907.322(A)(5), insofar as it makes criminal mere private possession of material that shows a minor participating in sexual activity, is violative of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Although our \u201cright to receive information and ideas, regardless of their social worth * * * is fundamental to our free society,\u201d <em>Stanley, supra, </em>at 564; <em>Winters </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1948), 333 U.S. 507, 510, not all speech is protected. See, <em>e.g., Schenck </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1919), 249 U.S. 47, establishing the \u201cclear and present danger\u201d doctrine which renders unprotected, advocacy which incites to violence or illegal conduct; <em>Chaplinsky </em>v. <em>New Hampshire </em>(1942), 315 U.S. 568, 572, holding as unprotected speech \u201c \u2018fighting\u2019 words,\u201d \u201cwhich by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace\u201d; <em>Beauharnais </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1952), 343 U.S. 250, 266, holding that libel is not in the area of constitutionally protected speech. It is also true that relative to legislation in the area of sexually explicit material, obscenity is not within the contemplation of our First Amendment freedoms. <em>Roth </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1957), 354 U.S. 476, 485 [14 O.O.2d 331].</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">What is or is not obscenity is determined by application of the three-part test enunciated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>California </em>(1973), 413 U.S. 15, 24:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-7\">\u201c * * * (a) whether \u2018the average person, applying contemporary community standards\u2019 would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest * * * ; (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">It is well-established that the states retain broad power to regulate obscenity. <em>Stanley, supra, </em>at 568. The Supreme Court has recognized the states\u2019 interest in avoiding the danger that obscene materials will fall into the hands of children, <em>Ginsberg </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1968), 390 U.S. 629 [44 O.O.2d 339], and the states\u2019 interest in making sure that obscene materials do not intrude upon the sensibilities or privacy of the general public, <em>Redrup </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1967), 386 U.S. 767. The Supreme Court has held that these interests outweigh the First Amendment rights of promoters and distributors of such material. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>at 18-19; <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Georgia, supra, </em>at 567; <em>Jacobellis </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1964), 378 U.S. 184, 195 [28 O.O.2d 101].</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">In explaining why society should be allowed to suppress obscene <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>material, in contrast to merely protecting the right of a person to avoid it if they wished,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> the Supreme Court has offered three reasons: (1) \u201cthere is at least an arguable correlation between obscene material and crime,\u201d <em>Paris Adult Theatre I </em>v. <em>Slaton </em>(1973), 413 U.S. 49, 58; (2) states \u201chave the power to make a morally neutral judgment\u201d that public exhibition or commerce in obscene material tends to \u201cinjure the community as a whole\u201d by polluting the \u201cpublic environment,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 68-69; and (3) \u201c \u2018what is commonly read and seen and heard and done intrudes upon us all, want it or not.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 59. However, the United States Supreme Court has also said that because a work is obscene does not mean that a state can impose absolute prohibitions. Notwithstanding the reasons cited above, the <em>Stanley </em>court stated at 564-565:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-5\">\u201c * * * [Fundamental is the right to be free, except in very limited circumstances, from unwanted governmental intrusions into one\u2019s privacy. * * * [M]ere categorization of * * * [materials] as \u2018obscene\u2019 is insufficient justification for such a drastic invasion of personal liberties guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. <em>Whatever may be the justifications for other statutes regulating obscenity, </em>we do not think they reach into the privacy of one\u2019s own home.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Clearly, the result of <em>Stanley </em>is that, although the states may have interests which outweigh the individuals\u2019 right to express, <em>i.e., </em>to disseminate or promote obscenity in public, <em>these reasons alone </em>are insufficient to outweigh the individuals\u2019 right to receive, <em>i.e., </em>observe or possess in private, obscenity involving adults. The <em>Stanley </em>court <em>did </em>recognize, however, that where reasons exist, sufficiently compelling in nature, even mere possession of some \u201ctypes of printed, filmed, or recorded materials\u201d may be proscribed consistent with individuals\u2019 First Amendment rights. <em>Stanley, supra, </em>at 568, fn. 11. When considering this verbiage from <em>Stanley, </em>the holding and explanatory language of the <em>Ferber </em>court is significant. It is my belief that <em>Ferber </em>sets forth additional, independent state interests which, when balanced against the individual\u2019s right to receive, observe, or possess child pornography, tip the scale in the states\u2019 favor and provide constitutional authority for the enforcement of R.C. 2907.322(A)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">In <em>Ferber, </em>the court held at 756-757 that \u201c * * * the States are entitled to greater leeway in the regulation of pornographic depictions of children\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> because \u201c[i]t is evident beyond the need for elaboration that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>State\u2019s interest in \u2018safeguarding the physical and psychological well-being of a minor\u2019 is \u2018compelling\u2019 * * *,\u201d and, \u201c[t]he prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse of children constitutes a government objective of surpassing importance.\u201d (Citations deleted.) Accordingly, legislation aimed at protecting the physical and emotional well-being of children can be sustained even when laws operate in sensitive areas of constitutionally protected rights.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In addition, the <em>Ferber </em>court recognized that greater regulatory leeway is justified in light of the intrinsic relationship between child pornography and child abuse. First, because \u201cthe materials produced are a permanent record of the children\u2019s participation and [thus] the harm to the child is exacerbated by their circulation <em>[id. </em>at 759],\u201d and second, because \u201cthe distribution network for child pornography must be closed if the production of material which requires the sexual exploitation of children is to be effectively controlled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Since consumers of child pornography provide the economic incentive for production and distribution of this material, they are an essential <em>part of </em>the \u201cdistribution network\u201d and should be subject to regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Finally, the <em>Ferber </em>court noted, at 761-762, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-6\">\u201c \u2018It rarely has been suggested that the constitutional freedom for speech and press extends its immunity to speech or writing used as an integral part of conduct in violation of a valid criminal statute.\u2019 * * * \u201d (Citation deleted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Surely, First Amendment guarantees do not extend to speech, which relies for its expression upon the criminal exploitation of children. It is possible that one might question the validity of banning possession of adult obscene materials based upon the link purported to exist between the viewing of adult pornography and the subsequent commission of sex crimes. However, in my judgment, the link to crime and viewing which exists <em>by virtue of the subjects being filmed, </em>provides an absolutely convincing rationale for banning child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">The <em>Ferber </em>court effectively classified child pornography as a category of speech like obscenity, libel or fighting words which lies outside the protection of the First Amendment.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> However, that classification, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>more, does not accord states the right to prohibit the private possession of this material. As with adult obscenity materials, the First Amendment right to possess and view child pornography must be weighed against the interest of the state in regulating it. It is my judgment that, despite the significant infringement on a fundamental individual right to subject one\u2019s self to whatever ideas or expressions one chooses, the interest of this state in protecting the emotional and physical well-being of its children far surpasses the First Amendment rights involved herein. It is the prerogative of this court to send a clear and unequivocal message to everyone involved in child pornography. There is no place for child abuse in a civilized, child-nurturing society, and if you traffic in or even privately possess child pornography in this state, Ohio intends to punish you. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Prince </em>v. <em>Massachusetts </em>(1944), 321 U.S. 158, 168:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-6\">\u201cA democratic society, rests for its continuance, upon the healthy, well-rounded growth of young people into full maturity as citizens. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Such must be the position and policy of this state. The state has a compelling interest in seeing that child pornography is eliminated in Ohio. The legislative response, in part, to accomplish this purpose is R.C. 2907.322(A)(5) which proscribes the private possession of material showing a minor participating in sexual activity. For the reasons stated, R.C. 2907.322(A)(5) does not violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">Accordingly, and for the foregoing reasons, I concur in the judgment of the majority of this court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b86-7\"> R.C. 2907.321(A)(5) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-8\">\u201c(A) No person, with knowledge of the character of the material or performance involved, shall do any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-9\">&lt;&lt;* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-10\">\u201c(5) Possess or control any <em>obscene </em>material, that has a minor as one of its participants; * * *\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-11\">R.C. 2907.322(A)(5) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-12\">\u201c(A) No person, with knowledge of the character of the material or performance involved, shall do any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-13\">* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-14\">\u201c(5) Possess or control <em>my material </em>that shows a minor participating or engaging in sexual activity, masturbation, or bestiality; * * *\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b86-15\"> Tribe, American Constitutional Law (1978) 666, Section 12-16, fn. 62.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b87-11\"> Appellant states in its brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-12\">\u201cWhat is beyond question is that the Defendant did nothing more than possess within his home one or more magazines which depicted minors of unspecified age or sex, engaging in sexual activity.

Thus, the question under the <em>Miller </em>test of whether a work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest of the average person bears no connection to the issue of whether a child has been physically or psychologically harmed in the production of the work. Similarly, a sexually explicit depiction need not be \u2018patently offensive\u2019 in order to have required the sexual exploitation of a child for its production. In addition, a work which, taken on the whole, contains serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value may nevertheless embody the hardest core of child pornography. \u2018It is irrelevant to the child [who has been abused] whether or not the material . . . has a literary, artistic, political or social value.\u2019 Memorandum of Assemblyman Lasher in Support of \u00a7 263.15. <em>We therefore cannot conclude that the Miller standard is a satisfactory solution to the child pornography problem.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added; footnote deleted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aly-dedup-0\">Thus, it would be irrational to conclude that child pornography is subject to state regulation only on the basis that it is a form of obscene material. Child pornography is simply objectionable on its own.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b91-9\">Wright, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A-\">concurring. I concur in the judgment and syllabus only as the majority opinion does not come to grips with the alleged invasion of privacy of appellee. The Supreme Court of the United States has declared that child pornography does not enjoy the status of protected free speech. <em>New York </em>v. <em>Ferber </em>(1982), 458 U.S. 747.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> This should be a source of com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>fort to all our responsible citizenry. Likewise, the Ohio General Assembly has concluded that this type of material is contraband because it poses a danger to the health and safety of our children. Without equivocation I conclude that R.C. 2907.322(A)(5) is an appropriate exercise of the state\u2019s police power under the stipulated facts of this case.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">However, I disagree with the majority\u2019s holding that the intrusion into appellee\u2019s privacy was \u201cslight.\u201d I believe that this statute creates a substantial intrusion into an individual\u2019s privacy by limiting the visual material he can keep and view in his home. The United States Supreme Court recognized the extent of this intrusion in <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Georgia </em>(1969), 394 U.S. 557, 564-565, in which it discussed an individual\u2019s fundamental \u201cright to be free, except in very limited circumstances, from unwanted governmental intrusions into one\u2019s privacy,\u201d and held that prohibition of private possession of written or visual materials in one\u2019s own home is a \u201cdrastic invasion of personal liberties.\u201d Since the court had previously held that \u201cobscenity is not within the area of constitutionally protected speech,\u201d <em>Roth </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1957), 354 U.S. 476, 485 [14 O.O.2d 331], the critical factor in <em>Stanley </em>was that the possession was within the privacy of an individual\u2019s home. Furthermore, the court has consistently refused to extend this protection to obscenity outside the home. See <em>Paris Adult Theatre I </em>v. <em>Slaton </em>(1973), 413 U.S. 49. The privacy invasion here is identical to that in <em>Stanley, </em>but the visual materials at issue are different.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">The most explicit guarantee of privacy is found in the Fourth Amendment which affirms the \u201cright of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d The principles reflected in the Fourth Amendment \u201capply to all invasions on the part of the government and its employees of the sanctity of a man\u2019s home and the privacies of life.\u201d See <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1886), 116 U.S. 616, 630; <em>Payton </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1980), 445 U.S. 573, 585. Since the alleged intrusion involved activities within appellee\u2019s home, his privacy concerns cannot be dismissed without consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">However, while I cannot ignore appellee\u2019s privacy claims, I believe that any right to privacy that appellee may have in his own home is not absolute. <em>See Bowers </em>v. <em>Hardwick </em>(1986), 478 U.S. __, 92 L. Ed. 2d 140. In my view Justice Hugo Black was correct as to the exceptions to and limitations on privacy rights. In his dissent in <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Connecticut </em>(1965), 381 U.S. 479, 508-510,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>\u201c * * * Strongly as I desire to protect all First Amendment freedoms, I am unable to stretch the Amendment so as to afford protection to the conduct of these defendants * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-5\">\u201cThe Court talks about a constitutional \u2018right of privacy\u2019 as though there is some constitutional provision or provisions forbidding any law ever to be passed which might abridge the \u2018privacy\u2019 of individuals. <em>But there is not. </em>There are, of course, guarantees in certain specific constitutional provisions which are designed in part to protect privacy at certain times and places with respect to certain activities. Such, for example, is the Fourth Amendment\u2019s guarantee against \u2018unreasonable searches and seizures.\u2019 But I think it belittles that Amendment to talk about it as though it protects nothing but \u2018privacy.\u2019 To treat it that way is to give it a niggardly interpretation, not the kind of liberal reading I think any Bill of Rights provision should be given. The average man would very likely not have his feelings soothed any more by having his property seized openly than by having it seized privately and by stealth. He simply wants his property left alone. And a person can be just as much, if not more, irritated, annoyed and injured by an unceremonious public arrest by a policeman as he is by a seizure in the privacy of his office or home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-6\">\u201c * * * <em>I like my privacy as well as the next one, but I am nevertheless compelled to admit that government has a right to invade it unless prohibited by some specific constitutional provision. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Thus, while the Fourth Amendment protects the sanctity of the home from governmental intrusion, \u201cotherwise illegal conduct is not always immunized whenever it occurs in the home. Victimless crimes, such as the possession and use of illegal drugs, do not escape the law where they are committed at home.\u201d <em>Bowers </em>v. <em>Hardwick, supra, </em>at 149. <em>Stanley </em>itself acknowledged that its holding provided no protection for the possession of drugs, firearms, or stolen goods in the home. <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Georgia, supra, </em>at 568, fn. 11. Furthermore, the privacy interest expressed in <em>Griswold </em>is not without limitations. Just this past term in <em>Bowers </em>v. <em>Hardwick, supra, </em>the high court held that privacy protections do not extend to homosexual relationships between consenting adults in the privacy of the home, and declined to take a more expansive view of its authority to discover new fundamental rights imbedded in the Due Process Clause. Therefore, since protection of the home is not absolute, the competing interests involved must be examined. However, before proceeding with this examination, I note that this case does not involve traditional search and seizure issues. The material at issue was obtained with a search warrant, and no questions about the validity of this warrant have been raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>The holding in <em>Stanley </em>did not extend to \u201cstatutes making criminal possession of other types of printed, filmed or recorded materials\u201d <em>(id. </em>at fn. 11) and noted that \u201ccompelling reasons may exist for overriding the right of the individual to possess those materials\u201d <em>(id.). </em>\u201cCompelling\u201d is the key word in this analysis. Regulations infringing on this privacy interest may be justified only by a compelling state interest and must be narrowly drawn to express only those interests. <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Population Services Internatl. </em>(1977), 431 U.S. 678. Child pornography is dangerous contraband which is intrinsically related to the sexual abuse and exploitation of children. <em>New York </em>v. <em>Ferber, supra. </em>In <em>Ferber, </em>the United States Supreme Court stated that \u201c[i]t is evident beyond the need for elaboration that a State\u2019s interest in \u2018safeguarding the physical and psychological well-being of a minor\u2019 \u201d is \u201c \u2018compelling\u2019 \u201d and explained that \u201c[t]he prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse of children constitutes a government objective of surpassing importance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 756-757.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Thus, the materials at issue here, child pornography, can be distinguished from the mere obscenity involved in <em>Stanley. </em>Since the protection of children through the eradication of child pornography is a compelling interest and since R.C. 2907.322(A)(5) is sufficiently narrowly drawn to limit its application to child pornography, the statute\u2019s intrusion into an individual\u2019s significant privacy interest is not unconstitutional. Accordingly, I join in the reversal of the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b91-12\"> \u201cWhen a definable class of material * * * bears so heavily and pervasively on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>welfare of children engaged in its production, we think the balance of competing interests is clearly struck and that it is permissible to consider these materials as without the protection of the First Amendment.\u201d <em>New York </em>v. <em>Ferber, supra, </em>at 764.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b92-11\"> It should be emphasized that our decision is confined to R.C. 2907.322(A)(5) and does not reflect upon the constitutionality of the remainder of R.C. 2907.322.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b92-12\"> Although the Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy, <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Connecticut, supra, </em>spoke of zones of privacy emanating from penumbras of specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights which prevent government interference into personal deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>sions in matters of marriage and contraception.
