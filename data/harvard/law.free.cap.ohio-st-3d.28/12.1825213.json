My dissents in <em>Blankenship </em>v. <em>Cincinnati Milacron Chemicals, Inc. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St. 2d 608, 621 [23 O.O.3d 504]; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>VIP Development Co. </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St. 3d 90, 103, and their progeny questioned the survival, upon motions to dismiss and summary judgment, of any common-law tort action brought by an employee against his employer. Such position was taken due to the Ohio Constitution and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>statutes which specifically provide for the exclusivity of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund. Further, after a review of the totality of the constitutional and legislative history, I had concluded, even prior to the passage of Am. Sub. S.B. No. 307, that if any exception to the exclusivity law be recognized, it would of necessity have to be based upon a test of the \u201cdeliberate intention\u201d of the actor in a subjective sense, and not a test of \u201csubstantial certainty\u201d as evaluated in <em>Jones, </em>etc. In my commentary on this court\u2019s opinions regarding workers\u2019 compensation laws to be found in 1 Workers\u2019 Compensation Journal of Ohio (April 1986), at 12, I suggested that if there be a test other than that of \u201cdeliberate intention,\u201d the minimum should be the \u201cvirtual certainty\u201d standard announced in <em>Millison </em>v. <em>E. I. duPont de Nemours &amp; Co. </em>(1985), 101 N. J. 161, 501 A. 2d 505. This would be the more reasonable rule to be applied in Ohio as a test for the allowance of a common-law action brought by an employee against his employer claiming an \u201cintentional tort.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Applying either the now existing law of R.C. 4121.80(G)(1), which states that \u201csubstantially certain\u201d means that \u201can employer acts with deliberate intent to cause an employee to suffer injury, disease, condition, or death,\u201d or applying the constitutional and statutory provisions as interpreted by this court prior to <em>Blankenship, Jones, </em>etc., or the \u201cvirtual certainty\u201d standard of <em>Millison, </em>or even the \u201csubstantial certainty\u201d test of <em>Jones, </em>etc., the trial court properly directed a verdict for the defendant based upon the facts presented within this case. \u201cReasonable minds\u201d should not differ as to whether an intentional tort was committed by the appellant company.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
