For the reasons to follow we affirm the BTA and deny the exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-15\">The standard of review in this instance is well-established. Exemption is the exception to the rule and statutes granting exemptions are strictly construed. Our duty is limited to determination of whether the decision of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>the Board of Tax Appeals was unreasonable or unlawful. <em>Ohio Masonic Home </em>v. <em>Bd. of Tax Appeals </em>(1977), 52 Ohio St. 2d 127, 129 [6 O.O.3d 343]; <em>White Cross Hospital Assn. </em>v. <em>Bd. of Tax Appeals </em>(1974), 38 Ohio St. 2d 199, 201 [67 O.O.2d 224].</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">R.C. 5709.07 allows exempt status for buildings and land owned by public schoolhouses that are not used with a view to profit. R.C. 5709.12 exempts from taxation real property belonging to institutions that is used exclusively for charitable purposes. R.C. 5709.121 sets forth the definition of exclusive use for charitable or public purposes as either one of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-6\">\u201c[A] (1) As a community or area center in which presentations in music, dramatics, the arts, and related fields are made in order to foster public interest and education therein;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">\u201c(2) For other charitable, educational, or public purposes;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-8\">\u201c(B) Otherwise made available under the direction or control of such institution, the state, or political subdivision for use in furtherance of or incidental to its charitable, educational, or public purposes and not with the view to profit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">Appellant\u2019s arguments involve all three of these statutes. The essential point of these arguments is that the questioned property is not being operated with a view to profit but is actually run to serve the incidental function of converting property to cash which, in turn, is used to support scholarships of the school, a charitable organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">In <em>Ohio Masonic Home, supra, </em>this court dealt with the question of what may constitute \u201cin furtherance of\u201d the taxpayer\u2019s purpose. In <em>Ohio Masonic Home, </em>a charitable institution \u2014 a home for the care of the aged \u2014 owned a farm. The proceeds from the income derived from the farm were used, in part, for the care of the home\u2019s residents. This court concluded that the farm was taxable because \u201c* * * [appellant's purpose is not to farm land, but rather to provide and maintain a place for the care of the aged * * * [and that] [farming remains functionally removed from appellant\u2019s charitable purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 130. The instant cause is analogous to <em>Ohio Masonic Home </em>because appellant\u2019s purpose is to be an educational institution and not a clothing distribution center.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, the educational or charitable function is removed from the property in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-11\">Appellant also contends that the property is not for \u201cprofit.\u201d We do not agree. Citing Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2d Ed. Unabr. 1960), appellant posits that profit \u201cin the meaning most pertinent here\u201d is \u201c \u2018[t]he excess of returns over expenditure in a given transaction or series <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>of transactions [and] [t]he excess of the price received over the price paid for the goods sold.\u2019 \u201d Because the clothing was donated, appellant argues that the store merely exchanges value for value and no \u201creturn\u201d is received. Appellant fails, however, to utilize the full definition set forth which describes profit as \u201c[t]he excess of the price received over the cost of purchasing and handling, or of producing and marketing, particular goods,\u201d and \u201c[e]xcess of income over expenditure, as in a business or any of its departments, during a given period of time.\u201d While we can sympathize with appellant\u2019s desire to limit the term \u201cprofit\u201d to its narrowest definition that will preclude application herein, we are compelled, under our general review standard that \u201cexemptions are the exception to the rule,\u201d to give wider scope to the definition of profit. Although the clothing may be donated for free, selling the clothing involves costs <em>(e.g., </em>salary of sales staff) offset by the proceeds. The excess which remains after such handling costs, although the clothing may cost nothing to purchase, must surely be construed as profit. The legislature is of course free to define profit in any manner it sees fit. Absent such definition we are obliged to use the ordinary meaning of the word which clearly applies to the revenues received by appellant herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Accordingly, we hold that R.C. 5709.07, 5709.12, and 5709.121(A) and (B) were neither unreasonably nor unlawfully construed by the board in the instant case and we therefore affirm that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b218-6\">Celebrezze, C.J., Locher, C. Brown and Wright, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b218-7\">Sweeney, Holmes and Douglas, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b217-12\"> It is the ongoing operation of the clothing exchange as a business venture, apart from any educational purpose, that is fatal to appellant\u2019s exemption request. Thus, we are not presented with a situation where it is claimed that the business venture is integrally related to a marketing or business course at an educational facility. Our decision should not be construed as impacting upon traditional fundraising events such as church or school book sales, or bake sales.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b218-8\">Holmes, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ach-dedup-1\">dissenting. I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s analysis of the relevant statutes and case law as applied to the facts of this case. The clothing exchange appears to be a necessary adjunct to the continued vitality of this school which operates to educate Ohio\u2019s children. The exchange should have received tax-exempt status under the statute. Accordingly, I must dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">The school is the successor in interest to two predecessor educational and non-profit organizations which were the College Preparatory School for Girls and the Hillsdale-Lotspeich School. In <em>College Preparatory School for Girls </em>v. <em>Evatt </em>(1945), 144 Ohio St. 408 [29 O.O. 574], paragraph two of the syllabus, we determined such school to be a charitable institution and \u201cused exclusively for charitable purposes.\u201d Since appellant carries out the same educational mission in the same manner, it also should be considered a charitable institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">The present school is open to the public without regard to race, religion, sex, or nationality. The school charges tuition which is con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>siderably less than the actual cost of the education. In addition, a number of scholarships are regularly bestowed upon particular students. The difference between the cost of education and the tuition is made up from charitable donations to the school. These include cash or negotiables as well as tangible personal property such as books, furniture, appliances and clothing. Like other organizations, appellant utilizes the lot and building at issue to receive, store, display and sell the above kinds of tangibles. All proceeds realized from such sales are utilized to subsidize the school, except for the sales manager\u2019s salary. Therefore, the clothing exchange is an integral part of furthering both the scholarship program and the school\u2019s ongoing fundraising activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Under R.C. 5709.121(B), the clothing exchange ought to be considered real property belonging to an educational institution which is used exclusively for charitable or public purposes. The statute provides tax immunity whenever such property is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\">\u201cOtherwise made available under the direction or control of such institution, the state, or political subdivision <em>for use in furtherance of or incidental to its charitable, educational, or public purposes </em>and not with the view to profit.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Without the exchange, tangible gifts received by the school could not be converted into their cash equivalent. It is reasonable to assume that absent the operation of the exchange, tuition for the school\u2019s children would be much higher, which in turn would greatly reduce the number of students who could attend, eliminate scholarships, and diminish the school\u2019s capability to fulfill its educational mission.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">Furthermore, the majority\u2019s decision effectively requires one to prove both that the property is functionally related to an exempt use and that it is used directly in furtherance of such exempt use. This directly contravenes the wording of R.C. 5709.121(B) which does not require such narrow prerequisites. I do not believe that this court\u2019s holding in <em>Ohio Masonic Home </em>v. <em>Bd. of Tax Appeals </em>(1977), 52 Ohio St. 2d 127 [6 O.O.3d 343], lends support to the majority here, since the process of converting tangible contributions to liquid assets utilized to meet school costs is no different than the activities of the business office which converts the negotiables into liquid assets. Thus, the exchange should not be viewed as an operation merely for profit, but an operation which is functionally related to the entire educational operation of the school.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">Since there is no use \u201cwith the view to profit,\u201d I would hold that the school\u2019s clothing exchange facility should be exempted under the above statutes. This reasoning also seems applicable to the issues presented by R.C. 5709.07. Accordingly, I would reverse the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals as to all three statutes.</p>\n<judges id=\"b219-10\">ion.
