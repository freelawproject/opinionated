The PUCO\u2019s exercise of this emergency authority was appealed to this court in a number of cases.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These appeals were summarily dismissed upon motion of the PUCO which asserted that the quasi-legislative nature of its decisions was not properly subject to judicial review. In addition, it is the opinion of this court that it is clearly within the PUCO\u2019s emergency powers under R.C. 4909.16 to fashion such relief as that provided by the PIP plan and we find the plan of the commission to be manifestly fair and reasonable as a solution to the crisis.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">In the same order creating the PIP plan, the PUCO acknowledged that while it was \u201c* * * foreclosing one method by which a utility may exercise its rights to collect * * *\u201d unpaid utility bills, to wit: service disconnection, the utility would still have \u201c* * * available to it all of its other remedies of law * * *\u201d including its ability \u201c* * * to recoup its bad debts through a rate case as provided in Chapter 4909 Revised Code.* * *\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14. The issue raised by this case, however, is whether the emergency powers extant in R.C. 4909.16 extend so far as to allow the PUCO to authorize recoupment of PIP arrearages through the EFC rate in apparent contravention of the plain meanings of R.C. 4909.191 and 4905.01. Specifically, appellant does not challenge the PUCO\u2019s authority to allow the utilities to recoup arrearages caused by the PIP plan. Rather, appellant contends that since such arrearages do not constitute either an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>acquisition or delivery cost as set forth in the preceding statutes, they may not lawfully be recovered through the EFC rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">R.C. 4909.191(C) provides that \u201c[t]he electric light company shall demonstrate at the hearing on its fuel component that its <em>acquisition </em>and <em>delivery </em>costs were fair, just, and reasonable.* * *\u201d (Emphasis added.) The term \u201cfuel component\u201d as used in the phrase \u201celectric fuel component rate\u201d is defined in R.C. 4905.01(G):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">\u201c \u2018Fuel component\u2019 means <em>acquisition </em>and <em>delivery </em>costs of fuel for the generation of electricity, including the allowable costs of purchased power as defined in section 4909.159 of the Revised Code * * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">R.C. 4905.01 further defines \u201cdelivery cost\u201d and \u201cacquisition cost\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-9\">\u201c(E) \u2018Delivery cost\u2019 means the cost of delivery of fuel, to be used for the generation of electricity, from the site of production directly to the site of an electric generating facility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-10\">\u201c(F) \u2018Acquisition cost\u2019 means the cost to an electric light company of acquiring fuel for generation of electricity.* * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">Appellant argues that the precise language of these statutory provisions preclude the PUCO from permitting a utility to recapture its PIP arrearages in an EFC adjustment proceeding. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">As a general rule of statutory construction, the specific mention of one thing implies the exclusion of another. <em>Saslaw </em>v. <em>Weiss </em>(1938), 133 Ohio St. 496, 498 [11 O.O. 185]; <em>State, ex rel. Boda, </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1952), 157 Ohio St. 368, 372 [47 O.O. 262], This principle is especially pertinent where, as in the cases <em>sub judice, </em>the statute involved is a definitional provision. Had the General Assembly intended to allow the utilities to recapture other types of expenses through this rate, it would have expanded the definitions. In addition, it is well-settled \u201c* * * that the General Assembly\u2019s own construction of its language, as provided by definitions, controls in the application of a statute.* * *\u201d <em>Ohio Civil Rights Comm. </em>v. <em>Parklawn Manor </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St. 2d 47, 50 [70 O.O.2d 148]. Definitions provided by the General Assembly are to be given great deference in deciding the scope of particular terms. See, also, <em>Good Samaritan Hospital </em>v. <em>Porterfield </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St. 2d 25, 30 [58 O.O.2d 75]. Moreover, in <em>Pike Natural Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1981), 68 Ohio St. 2d 181 [22 O.O.3d 410], this court enunciated its belief that policy determinations regarding whether certain costs should be recoverable pursuant to an adjustment clause lie exclusively within the province of the General Assembly. In <em>Pike, </em>at 186, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-13\">\u201cIn recent years, the desirability of adjustment clauses for utilities has been under debate. Those who favor adjustment clauses have argued that they are necessary because there is a lag between the time costs increase and the time those costs may be recovered through increased rates * * *. Those with a contrary point of view argue that the use of adjustment clauses diminishes utilities\u2019 incentive to provide consumers with the least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>expensive product. Whether a given adjustment clause, based upon these or other factors, should be adopted is not a question for the commission, or for this court; rather, its resolution lies with the General Assembly.* * *\u201d Previous to the <em>Pike </em>case, this court\u2019s decision in <em>Ohio Power Co. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St. 2d 342, 344 [8 O.O.3d 353], stated even more specifically:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-5\">\u201c* * * Fuel adjustment clauses are not and may not be permitted to become a carte-blanche authorization to an electric utility to pass through to its tariff customers expenses other than fuel costs fairly attributable to the production of the service to those customers.* * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The PUCO is a creature of statute, and may not exercise jurisdiction beyond that conferred by statute. <em>Dayton Communications Corp. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St. 2d 302, 307 [18 O.O. 3d 478]; <em>Consumers\u2019 Counsel </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St. 2d 153, 166 [21 O.O.3d 96]. As the General Assembly has explicitly set forth its policy regarding the types of costs recoverable through the EFC rate, we hold the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio may not lawfully authorize the recovery of Percentage of Income Payment plan arrearages through the Electric Fuel Component rate.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Appellee also urges that the PUCO may, pursuant to R.C. 4909.191 (C)(5),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> consider factors other than acquisition and delivery costs in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>establishing the EFC rate. However, this contention lacks merit. Although R.C. 4909.191(C)(5) permits the PUCO to consider \u201c[s]uch other factors as the commission considers appropriate,\u201d those \u201cother factors\u201d must, under R.C. 4909.191(C), relate to the commission\u2019s determination of whether the electric company\u2019s <em>\u201cacquisition </em>and <em>delivery </em>costs were fair, just and reasonable.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Finally, we are likewise not persuaded by appellee\u2019s additional argument that although the PIP arrearages do not constitute either acquisition or delivery costs, the emergency powers delegated to the PUCO under R.C. 4909.16 permit it to fashion any appropriate remedy in response to an emergency situation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In support of this contention, appellee directs this court\u2019s attention to <em>Inland Steel Development Corp. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1977), 49 Ohio St. 2d 284 [3 O.O.3d 435], and <em>Akron </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1948), 149 Ohio St. 347 [37 O.O. 39]. In those cases we recognized that the PUCO\u2019s discretionary emergency powers include authority to impair contractual provisions as needed to alleviate an emergency, if it bears a real and substantial relation to the health, safety, morals or general welfare of the public, and if it is not unreasonable or arbitrary. Even considering these prior decisions, appellee\u2019s arguments do not overcome the fact that the PUCO\u2019s order exceeds the legislative mandate as to the types of costs recoverable pursuant to R.C. 4909.191 as defined in R.C. 4905.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the PUCO, in each of the consolidated cases, unlawfully exceeded its authority by authorizing the re-coupment of PIP plan arrearages through the EFC rate. Since R.C. 4903.13 mandates that \u201c[a] final order made by the public utilities commission shall be reversed, vacated, or modified by the supreme court on appeal, if, upon consideration of the record, such court is of the opinion that such order was unlawful or unreasonable,\u201d the orders of the PUCO <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>are reversed. Recognizing the potential impact of our decision, we <em>sua, sponte </em>stay our order for one hundred twenty days from the date of this decision to give the PUCO and/or the Ohio General Assembly time to take whatever action they might deem appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">\n<em>Orders reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b208-5\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney, Locher and C.

As stated in the opinion of the PUCO in case No. 85-285-GA-UNC, at 2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-9\">\u201cThe Companies request approval to use the GCR mechanism, rather than a base rate proceeding, to recover PIP arrearages. The Commission agrees that this is a necessary and appropriate means of providing that recovery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-10\">\u201cIt was never the Commission\u2019s intention to create a cost to the companies which would not be recovered. As evidenced by our Opinion and Order and Entry on Rehearing in Case No. 83-303-GE-COI, the only question was the mechanism for recovery of those costs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-11\">\u201cThe most compelling reason to include the PIP arrearages in the GCR mechanism is the ability to reflect future recoveries. Those customers who stay on the plan during the summer months should pay off a portion of their arrearages during that time; some customers may only be on the PIP plan temporarily, and may pay their arrearages in better times. Using the reconciliation adjustment mechanism will permit the recognition of future payments. If the PIP arrearages were included with normal uncollectibles in a base rate proceeding, no adjustments could be made to reflect the pay-backs that the Commission hopes and believes will be made. It is this possibility of pay-backs, and the need for a mechanism to reflect those paybacks, that differentiates PIP arrearages from a company\u2019s regular uncollectibles, and that argues in favor of permitting recovery of PIP arrearages through the GCR mechanism.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-12\">Thus, while we cannot condone the recovery of arrearages through the EFC rate in light of the specific statutory language of R.C 4905.01 and 4909.191, we do not express the opinion that the PUCO would be precluded from fashioning an alternative accelerated recovery mechanism which is not contrary to statute, including recovery of arrearages on a more current basis rather than only after a twelve-month delinquency.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b206-13\"> R.C. 4909.191(C) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-14\">\u201cThe electric light company shall demonstrate at the hearing on its fuel component that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>its acquisition and delivery costs were fair, just, and reasonable.

Rates so made by the commission shall apply to one or more of the public utilities in this state, or to any portion thereof, as is directed by the commission, and shall take effect at such time and remain in force for such length of time as the commission prescribes.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b208-8\">Wright, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"asc-dedup-0\">concurring. I agree with the syllabus law announced in this case and with Justice Douglas\u2019 incisive analysis of the problem posed by the PUCO\u2019s efforts to exert its emergency powers pursuant to R.C. 4909.16 through the Electric Fuel Component rate. I agree that it is most difficult to rationalize the collection of PIP arrearages via the statutory scheme applicable to the EFC rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">However, I feel it necessary to write separately as the court\u2019s opinion could be clearer on the issue of just how the PUCO should implement \u201c* * * an alternative accelerated recovery mechanism which is not contrary to statute, including recovery of arrearages on a more current basis rather than only after a twelve-month delinquency.\u201d (See footnote 4 of the majority opinion.) The majority opinion has approved the power of the PUCO pursuant to R.C 4909.16 to fashion the relief provided by the PIP plan. Further, the majority decision has stated that it \u201c* * * is aware of the advantages associated with the recoupment of PIP arrearages on a current basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Obviously, the PIP plan was conceived under the PUCO\u2019s emergency powers and implementation thereof flows from that same power. Finally, the decision has granted the PUCO and/or the General Assembly one hundred twenty days from this date to solve the reimbursement problem. I, for one, have no desire to force the PUCO to guess about what course to adopt to the end militated by the majority opinion. I say this because the majority has pronounced the PIP program as \u201c* * * manifestly fair and reasonable as a solution to the crisis.\u201d With that said, I do not feel this court should bear the onus of terminating that PIP plan without giving some degree of guidance to the commission in solving the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">The time frame granted the PUCO by the majority precludes the inclusion of the PIP arrearages into the respective rate bases of the utilities involved. Therefore, it would appear obvious that the PUCO must forthwith allow or order intervening appellees to recover the arrearages through a surcharge pursuant to law. No other viable course appears to be available under the majority opinion since it makes no sense at all to find that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>emergency exists and not sanction a reaction to that emergency by way of altering rates.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">Likewise, it would make little sense for the return of PIP amounts already recovered by the utilities to customers so that these same amounts could be included in a rate case for later re-collection.</p>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b209-5\"> This court has repeatedly upheld the commission\u2019s broad statutory authority under R.C. 4909.16 to order rate relief in the event of an emergency.
