It is clear that the Mississippi jury was statutorily obligated to determine whether a defendant \u201cshould be sentenced to death,\u201d or to life imprisonment. Miss. Code Annot. Section 99-19-101.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-11\">In response to the defense counsel\u2019s assertions, the prosecution in <em>Caldwell </em>stated during closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-12\">\u201c \u2018* * * I\u2019m in complete disagreement with the approach the defense has taken. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair. I think it\u2019s unfair. I think the lawyers know better. Now, they would have you believe that you\u2019re going to kill this man and they know \u2014 they know that your decision is not the final decision. My God, how unfair can you be? Your job is reviewable. They know it. * * * [T]he decision you render is automatically reviewable by the Supreme Court. Automatically, and I think it\u2019s unfair and I don\u2019t mind telling them so.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 325-326.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-13\">Upon appeal, the Mississippi Supreme Court narrowly upheld the above closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-14\">In reversing, the United States Supreme Court noted that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks provided the jurors with \u201can invitation to rely on * * * [appellate] review\u201d which would \u201cgenerate a bias toward returning a death sentence,\u201d and which \u201cpresents an intolerable danger that the jury will in fact choose to minimize the importance of its role.\u201d <em>Caldwell, supra, </em>at 231. Also, the court found the statutory framework of appellate review insufficient to correct the complained-of error. The court noted that: \u201c \u2018Even a novice attorney knows that appellate courts do not impose a death penalty, they merely review the jury\u2019s decision and that review is with a presumption of correctness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 331, quoting <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>(Miss. 1983), 443 So. 2d 806, at 816 (Lee, J., dissenting), and citing Miss. Code Annot. Section 99-19-105 (Supp. 1984). Consequently, the prosecution\u2019s argument undermined the Eighth Amendment guarantee of a reliable determination of the appropriateness of death as punishment in particular cases. <em>Id. </em>at 323, citing <em>Woodson </em>v. <em>North Carolina </em>(1976), 428 U.S. 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Upon review of Ohio\u2019s statutory framework and the circumstances of this case, it must be concluded that none of the above dangers expressed in <em>Caldwell </em>threatened the integrity of the sentencing authority of the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">At the outset of the within analysis, it should be stated that Ohio\u2019s statutory framework for the imposition of the death penalty is altogether different from that of Mississippi, most importantly in that Ohio has no \u201csentencing jury.\u201d All power to impose the punishment of death resides in the trial court which oversees the mitigation or penalty phase of the trial. The duty of the trial judge is set forth in R.C. 2929.03(D)(3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">Immediately obvious is that, under this provision, the jury provides only a <em>recommendation </em>as to the imposition of the death penalty. The trial court must thereafter independently re-weigh the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors and issue a formal opinion stating its specific findings, before it may impose the death penalty. R.C. 2929.03(F). It is the trial court, not the jury, which performs the function of sentencing authority. Thus, no \u201csentencing jury\u201d was involved in the proceedings below. Furthermore, as actual sentencer, the trial court was \u201cpresent to hear the evidence and arguments and see the witnesses\u201d and was in a position to fully appreciate a plea for mercy. <em>Caldwell, supra, </em>at 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">Furthermore, Ohio\u2019s sentencing procedures are not unique both because a separate sentencing hearing is utilized, and because capital sentencing authority is invested in the trial judge. See, <em>e.g., </em>Ala. Code Subsection 13A-5-47 (1986 Supp.) (judge is not bound by jury\u2019s advisory verdict); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Annot. Section 13-703(B), (C) and (D) (1986 Supp.) (jury is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>completely excluded from sentencing); Colo. Rev. Stat. Section 16-11-103 (2)(C) (1985 Supp.) (trial judge may vacate a jury finding if clearly erroneous); Fla. Stat. Section 921.141(2) (1982 Cum. Supp.) (trial court independently re-weighs aggravating versus mitigating circumstances after an advisory jury verdict); Idaho Code Section 19-2515(d) (1986 Supp.) (trial court alone sentences and conducts a mitigation hearing), etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Florida\u2019s statutory system, which is remarkably similar to Ohio\u2019s, was expressly upheld in the case of <em>Spaziano </em>v. <em>Florida </em>(1984), 468 U.S. 447. Justice Blackmun, writing for the court, concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\">\u201cIf a judge may be vested with sole responsibility for imposing the [death] penalty, then there is nothing constitutionally wrong with the judge\u2019s exercising that responsibility after receiving the advice of the jury. The advice does not become a judgment simply because it comes from the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 465.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Recently, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit issued its decision in <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Wainwright </em>(C.A. 11, 1986), 804 F.2d 1526. That panel reversed a Florida death sentence because it felt that the trial court\u2019s instructions violated the spirit of the <em>Caldwell </em>decision. We need not consider the broad reading of <em>Caldwell </em>set forth therein since the case before us differs in several significant respects. Neither the trial court in the present case nor the prosecutor invited the jury to rely upon later judgments. Instead, merely correct legal statements were made. Furthermore, under Ohio\u2019s framework, the trial court is not a simple \u201cbuffer where the jury allows emotion to override the duty of a deliberate determination,\u201d <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>State </em>(Fla. 1976), 336 So. 2d 1133, 1140, certiorari denied (1977), 431 U.S. 925, but is the authority in whom resides the sole power to initially impose the death penalty. Finally, to hold that \u201cthe jury\u2019s sense of responsibility for its advisory sentence was diminished,\u201d <em>Adams, supra, </em>at 5, for the single reason that the trial court informed the jury that their verdict was a mere recommendation, creates an unacceptable dilemma. Either the relevant portions of Ohio\u2019s statutory framework for imposition of the death penalty must be ruled unconstitutional or any juror who at any time has learned the legal nature of the jury\u2019s finding must be considered hopelessly prejudiced. This court cannot accept either proposition based on <em>Caldwell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Thus, the Sixth Amendment provides no right to a jury determination of the punishment to be imposed; nor does the Ohio system impugn the Eighth Amendment. <em>Spaziano, supra, </em>at 464. See, also, <em>State </em>v. <em>Buell </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St. 3d 124, 142-144, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St. 3d 16, 21-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">Consequently, the trial court\u2019s instructions as well as the jury verdict forms,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> based as they were upon the very wording of a constitutional statutory sentencing procedure, merely gave \u201cthe jury accurate informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>tion of which both the defendant and his counsel * * * [were] aware.\u201d <em>California </em>v. <em>Ramos </em>(1983), 463 U.S. 992, 1004.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Also, the record before us differs from that of <em>Caldwell </em>in that neither the prosecution nor the trial court made mention of the appellate process or thereby sought to allow the jurors to minimize their role through dependence upon such process. Nevertheless, another important distinction from <em>Caldwell </em>is that the Ohio appellate courts are statutorily obligated to do much more than \u201cmerely review the jury\u2019s decision * * * with a presumption of correctness.\u201d R.C. 2929.05<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provides that the intermediate courts of appeals and the Supreme Court of Ohio must each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>weigh the mitigating factors against the aggravating circumstances; evaluate whether the sentence of death is appropriate, excessive, or disproportionate; and review again the aggravating circumstances and whether the trial court properly weighed them against the mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Such thorough review provides every opportunity and authority for a reviewing court to make an original determination, to independently weigh not only those factors weighed by the jury but also to determine whether the sentence was appropriate. This grant of wide latitude <em>requires </em>Ohio\u2019s appellate courts to function as much more than mere reviewers of jury findings. See, also, <em>State </em>v. <em>Glenn </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St. 3d 451, 462-463. Indeed, Ohio requires that appellate courts must perform a proportionality analysis, which goes beyond constitutional requirements. <em>Pulley </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1984), 465 U.S. 37. It therefore becomes clear that Ohio\u2019s statutory, multistepped sentencing process does not deprive the capital offender of a sensitive sentencer and then place him at the mercy of the normal appellate review system.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Turning now to the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal comments,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it is observed that these, too, were mere accurate statements of the law. Further, his few observations on the nature of the jury\u2019s finding fall far short of the kind of provocations to error found in <em>Caldwell, supra. </em>The prosecution in the present case neither invited erroneous reliance on an appellate overview, nor provided false assurances that the jury may more \u201cfreely \u2018err because the error may be corrected on appeal.\u2019 * * * \u201d <em>Caldwell, supra, </em>at 331, quoting <em>Maggio </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1983), 464 U.S. 46, 54-55 (Stevens, J., concurring). The prosecutor made no reference to any appellate court or to the Supreme Court of Ohio. No comment was made about automatic appellate review of death sentences. Consequently, the prosecution did not create a \u201cchance that an invitation to rely on that review will generate a bias toward returning a death sentence.\u201d <em>Caldwell, supra, </em>at 333. As he concluded his argument, the prosecution analyzed the balancing process required of the jurors.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Again, his use of the term \u201crecommend\u201d was in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>cidental to and merely part of the recitation of his views on the statutory requirements. He could hardly be expected to falsely inform the jurors of what act they must do should their findings be of a particular kind. This he would have risked had he used a different word to describe their actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">This court has never held that prosecutors are \u201cfree to expose capital sentencing juries to any information and argument concerning postsentencing procedures.\u201d <em>Caldwell, supra, </em>at 335. Although the Ohio jury is not a \u201ccapital sentencing\u201d jury because it cannot impose the death penalty, nevertheless this court has demonstrated an appreciation of the fact that some degree of unreliability in jury findings may be occasioned by arguments based on postsentencing procedures. We have repeatedly stated that \u201cbecause of the possible risk of diminishing jury responsibility, \u2018* * * we prefer that in the future no reference be made to the jury regarding the finality of their decision * * *.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, supra, </em>at 22, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St. 3d 164, 202-203, certiorari denied (1985), 473 U.S. _, 87 L. Ed. 2d 643. In so stating, we reserved power to evaluate such references in the context of the record to determine the impact of such statements and whether defense counsel, by its statements, created a reasonable basis for a response from the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">In the case here, the prosecution\u2019s single argumentative reference to the jury\u2019s \u201crecommendation\u201d was made expressly in response to defense counsel\u2019s remarks. In his comments on the death penalty, defense counsel stated that: \u201c[A]lmost nothing [is written] to indicate the death penalty is a deterrent. * * * In the 30 years that I have been representing people in murder cases, rarely has the * * * man or woman expressed any thought of what the penalty might be, at the time of the crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">After asserting that appellant did not act like a normal human being, counsel stated: \u201cDo we kill a man like this? Because that\u2019s what you\u2019re being asked to do.\u201d Counsel later challenged the jury with the following: \u201c* * * [W]e knew it would come to this point ultimately, are you going to kill Billy Rogers today or are you going to place him in an institution for the rest of his life?\u201d Appellant also described the jury\u2019s duty under the statute: \u201cThe mitigating circumstances \u2014 or the aggravating circumstances, rather, in order for you to impose the death penalty must outweigh the mitigating circumstances. Even if they are equal, * * * you cannot impose the death penalty.\u201d As part of his conclusion, counsel quoted: \u201c \u2018Though the justice of God may indeed ordain that some should die, the justice of man is all together [sic] and always insufficient for saying who these may be.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">In a strongly worded argument, defense counsel confronted the jurors with the following statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-10\">\u201cIs it justice, is it even seeking after justice to try to put Billy Rogers out of his miserable life some months hence? I submit to you, ladies and gentlemen, that life is something that this courtroom should not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>anything to do with. Life is God-given. It doesn\u2019t come from the state of Ohio. It should not be a punishment to take a man\u2019s life away from him. It goes back to barbarism. I hope that some day we will consider death penalty trials as barbarous as we consider the burning of Joan of Arc at the stake. And with the evolving decency, the evolving humanity of people like yourself, perhaps that day will come soon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">To assert that the jurors are going to <em>kill </em>the appellant is not only an inaccurate statement of the law of Ohio, it is a brash, if not inappropriate, argument as utilized by appellant\u2019s counsel. Defense counsel certainly has the right to plead for mercy and, indeed, has the very duty to cause the jury to \u201cconfront both the gravity and the responsibility of calling for another\u2019s death.\u201d <em>Caldwell, supra, </em>at 324. However, such does not create a license for counsel to cross over into the area where, as here, an attempt was made to create an improper sense of guilt in the jury, and to direct this guilt into a finding in appellant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Furthermore, portions of defense counsel\u2019s argument were not directed to the jurors\u2019 responsibility to feel the gravity of their decision, but were undisguised attacks on the merits of capital punishment itself. This issue has been legislatively determined and is not a subject for argument or comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">While the prosecutor\u2019s commentary in <em>Caldwell </em>was an unacceptable response to defense counsel\u2019s arguments because it \u201cdistorted the jury\u2019s deliberations,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 336, it can be concluded that the prosecutor in the case <em>sub judice </em>was not unreasonable in his determination not to allow these inaccurate representations to remain unchallenged. It is because of the circumstances contained in the record before us that this court has refused to adopt a <em>per se </em>rule concerning comments directed at the jury\u2019s role in the mitigation phase of a capital case. Where, as here, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were restrained in emphasis and contained a brief corrective comment on the jury\u2019s role, and only contained a basic recitation of the law, it cannot be said that error or distortion entered into the jurors\u2019 deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">In an order dated April 2, 1986, this court granted appellant\u2019s motion to expand the scope of review. Appellant\u2019s motion set forth a need to \u201craise the question in the state court\u201d of whether the prosecution\u2019s comments and questions about the acts of appellant after he was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights were in violation of <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Greenfield </em>(1986), 474 U.S. _, 88 L. Ed. 2d 623. Appellant cited <em>State </em>v. <em>Buell, supra, </em>as authority to \u201cinclude consideration of a recently decided constitutional issue not argued by an appellant * * *. This case is in the identical posture with respect to the <em>Greenfield </em>issue that <em>Buell </em>was with respect to the <em>Caldwell </em>issue.\u201d Appellant\u2019s motion, page 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">After examining the record in the present case, it becomes apparent that appellant does not stand in the asserted \u201cidentical posture\u201d as the appellant in <em>Buell. </em>Although appellant did fail to object at the trial level, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>appeared to be a conscious result of his own decision to initially broach the subjects now asserted to have been erroneously broached. However, the issue was firmly raised before the Court of Appeals for Lucas County in appellant\u2019s proposition of law number twenty-six. That court determined that any posssible error was self-induced.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">On direct appeal to this court, appellant abandoned this argument. By failing to challenge the ruling of the court of appeals on direct appeal to this court, appellant has acquiesced in the previous ruling. Accordingly, Ohio\u2019s doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>has foreclosed consideration of such issue at this time. <em>State </em>v. <em>Roberts </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St. 3d 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Having reconsidered the issues presented on remand from the Supreme Court of the United States, in light of <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>Mississippi, supra, </em>we hereby reaffirm our previous decision in this case for the reasons stated hereinabove.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">\n<em>Judgment reaffirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b465-9\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney and Locher, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b465-10\">C.

I concur in the majority\u2019s determination that the holding in <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>Mississippi </em>(1985), 472 U.S. 320, does not require reversal of appellant\u2019s death sentence. Our decision today is consistent with past pronouncements and is in harmony with the analysis of this issue found in my opinion in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St. 3d 16, 29-31 (Celebrezze, C.J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-13\">Additionally, I write briefly in regard to some of the seemingly sweeping assertions in the majority opinion concerning the propriety of remarks by appellant\u2019s counsel in closing argument of the penalty phase of this trial. Justice Sweeney correctly observes in his concurring opinion, <em>infra, </em>that this court need only have held that to the extent counsel misstated the applicable law, the remarks were improper. As the majority itself states, there should otherwise be no <em>per se </em>rule concerning comments to the jury by the prosecution or defense counsel in the penalty phase of a capital trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although the trial judge is usually in the best position to issue curative instructions, I agree that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks in the case <em>sub judice </em>were proper and restrained corrective statements in response to defense counsel\u2019s erroneous assertion that the jurors were going to kill appellant. However, as a <em>caveat, </em>it should be remembered that such respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>sive comments are risky because <em>improper </em>prosecutorial argument will not always be excused under the doctrine of invited response.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Caldwell, supra, </em>at 336-337; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Young </em>(1985), 470 U.S. 1, 11-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Finally, appellant also asked this court to determine whether he was deprived of a fair trial by the state\u2019s use of his <em>post-Miranda </em>silence as evidence of his sanity. The United States Supreme Court has recently addressed such a question in <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Greenfield </em>(1986), 474 U.S. _, 88 L. Ed. 2d 623. Thereafter, we granted a motion to expand the scope of review in this cause during rehearing to include consideration of appellant\u2019s contention that the state\u2019s conduct ran afoul of the <em>Greenfield </em>decision. In my view, it may have been wiser for the majority to have reached the merits. Hopefully appellant will move for rehearing before this court so that the merits of this question can be resolved. If left unresolved in this state\u2019s courts, appellant\u2019s recourse, <em>inter alia, </em>is to again petition the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Sweeney, J., concurring. I concur separately to emphasize that today\u2019s decision should not be interpreted as limiting, as a matter of law, the scope of defense counsel\u2019s argument. While it is necessary for the majority opinion to address the content of defense counsel\u2019s argument, because it was the basis for permitting the prosecution to \u201cmake a brief, corrective statement,\u201d I do not believe it is necessary to label defense counsel\u2019s argument as \u201cbrash,\u201d \u201cinappropriate,\u201d or \u201can attempt * * * to create an improper sense of guilt in the jury. * * *\u201d The prosecution did not object to the argument in question, nor did the trial court, which is in the best position to determine whether an argument is prejudicial, attempt to restrain the defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">Further, I do not believe that the issue of capital punishment should never be a \u201csubject for argument or comment\u201d by defense counsel, simply because the issue previously has been \u201clegislatively determined.\u201d Arguments concerning the propriety or constitutionality of capital punishment cannot be limited by this court as a matter of law, and such arguments may be, at times, essential to the conduct of a vigorous defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">Defense counsel\u2019s argument herein was misleading in that it misstated the jury\u2019s role in the penalty phase of the defendant\u2019s trial. As such, it formed the basis for the prosecution\u2019s \u201ccorrective statement,\u201d which \u201ccontained a basic recitation of the law.\u201d The prosecutor\u2019s argument thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>was proper and, in reaching this conclusion, we need not determine at this level that defense counsel\u2019s previous argument was inappropriate or improper.</p>\n<judges id=\"b467-6\">Celebrezze, C.J., concurs in the foregoing concurring opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b465-14\"> The majority\u2019s attempt to limit the scope of defense counsel\u2019s comments in future proceedings is contradictory to its own pronouncement against such <em>per se </em>rules.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b466-10\"> For example, in <em>Caldwell, supra, </em>the prosecutor\u2019s erroneous and improper invited response resulted in vacation of the death sentence. The majority quoted with approval the opinion of the dissenting state supreme court justices below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-11\">\u201c \u2018Assuming without accepting the majority\u2019s position that the defense counsel\u2019s argument invited error, it did not invite this error. Asking the jury to show mercy does not invite comment on the system of appellate review. This is true whether the plea for mercy discusses Christian, Judean or Buddhist philosophies, quotes Shakespeare or refers to the heartache suffered by the accused\u2019s mother.\u2019 \u201d <em>Caldwell, supra, </em>at 337.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b467-7\">Clifford F. Brown, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ae4\">dissenting. Because I believe that <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>Mississippi </em>(1985), 472 U.S. 320, requires that appellant\u2019s sentence of death be reversed and remanded for resentencing, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">As explained in Justice Wright\u2019s cogent dissenting opinion in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St. 3d 16, 32-35, \u201c* * * [t]he <em>Caldwell </em>court appears to hold that an instruction that is misleading in the sense that it diminishes the jury\u2019s sense of responsibility constitutes reversible error. * * * State-induced suggestions that the sentencing jury may shift its sense of responsibility for the imposition of the death penalty create a risk of substantial unreliability as well as potential bias in favor of death sentences.* * *\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">An instruction substantially similar to the one at bar formed the basis for reversing the denial of a writ of habeas corpus for a defendant who had received the death penalty in the recent case of <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Wainwright </em>(C.A. 11,1986), 804 F. 2d 1526. There, the trial judge instructed the initial panel of prospective jurors that their role in determining whether the defendant received the death penalty was only advisory, and that the ultimate responsibility rested with him as the trial judge. In holding that these comments impermissibly diminished the jury\u2019s sense of responsibility in violation of <em>Caldwell, </em>the circuit court reiterated the concern of the <em>Caldwell </em>court that a bias in favor of the death penalty is thereby created such that a jury, unconvinced that the death penalty is appropriate, might nevertheless impose it as an expression of outrage at the defendant\u2019s crime, secure in the comforting belief that any error will eventually be corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">A jury, understandably intimidated by the responsibility of deciding whether a human being shall live or die, will clutch at any comment from an authoritative source tending to relieve them of their terrible burden, and as a result, may discharge their grave responsibility with less than complete conscientiousness. <em>Caldwell, supra, </em>at 323-333. Such an effect cannot be tolerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">Accordingly, I dissent to the majority\u2019s reaffirmance of defendant\u2019s sentence of death. I would vacate defendant\u2019s death penalty and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<judges id=\"b467-12\">Reilly and Wright, JJ., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
