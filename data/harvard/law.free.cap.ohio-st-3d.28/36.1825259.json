For the reasons which follow, we find that it is not and reverse the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">R.C. 2913.61(C) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-9\">\u201cWhen a series of offenses under section 2913.02 of the Revised Code is committed by the offender in his same employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all such offenses shall be tried as a single offense, and the value of the property br services involved * * * is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the series. In prosecuting a single offense under this division, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series. It is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in his same employment, capacity, or relationship to another.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">Our concern is what constitutes a \u201cseries of offenses under section 2913.02.\u201d R.C. 2913.02 simply defines \u201ctheft,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>depriving an owner of property or services without the owner\u2019s consent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That section makes no mention of the theft in office statute, R.C. 2921.41. However, appellee in effect argues that R.C. 2913.61 and 2913.02 must be read <em>in pari materia </em>with R.C. 2913.01(K)(1), which defines a theft offense as \u201c[a] violation of section 2911.01 * * * or 2921.41 of the Revised Code.\u201d This argument ignores the fact that the <em>in pari materia </em>rule of statutory construction applies \u201conly where the statute to be construed is ambiguous or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>significance of its terms doubtful.\u201d <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Kaiser Engineers, Inc. </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St. 3d 45, 47, citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Fremont Lodge of Loyal Order of Moose </em>(1949), 151 Ohio St. 19 [38 O.O. 506], paragraph nine of the syllabus. Courts do not have the authority to ignore the plain and unambiguous language in a statute in the guise of statutory interpretation, <em>Bd. of Edn. </em>v. <em>Fulton Cty. Budget Comm. </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St. 2d 147, 156 [70 O.O.2d 300], especially when application of the rule of construction would be contrary to the clearly manifested intent of the legislature, <em>Fremont Lodge, supra, </em>at paragraph nine of the syllabus; <em>Volan </em>v. <em>Keller </em>(1969), 20 Ohio App. 2d 204, 206 [49 O.O.2d 286].</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">A reading of R.C. 2913.61(C) clearly indicates that only offenses under R.C. 2913.02 must be tried together when committed in the same employment, capacity, or relationship to another; the statute does not say \u201call theft offenses,\u201d but merely \u201c* * * a series of offenses under section 2913.02.\u201d In addition to the plain language of R.C. 2913.61(C), it is clear that any interpretation requiring the phrase \u201coffenses under section 2913.02\u201d to include violations of R.C. 2921.41, theft in office, would be contrary to the clearly manifested intent of the legislature, prohibited by <em>Fremont Lodge, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">It is clear that R.C. Chapter 2913 proscribes theft and fraud offenses, while R.C. Chapter 2921 addresses offenses of public officials which tend to subvert the processes of democratic government. See Committee Comment to Am. Sub. H.B. No. 511. The Committee Comment to R.C. Chapter 2913 and R.C. 2913.61, respectively, specify that the chapter addresses \u201cthe basic theft offense\u201d and the statute merely contains \u201crules for prosecuting as a single offense a series of theft offenses amounting to embezzlement, and gives detailed criteria for determining the value of stolen property or services\u201d when value is an element. Although value is not always an element of violations of R.C. 2913.02, <em>i.e., </em>when there is a theft and one or more prior theft offenses, value is never an element of violations of R.C. 2921.41. Any theft in office, no matter how small the value of the item stolen, is a third-degree felony, subject to the punishment applicable to third-degree felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">R.C. Chapter 2921 also has two additional requirements not found in R.C. Chapter 2913: (1) that the thief be a public official and (2) that he use his office to commit or facilitate commission of that theft or that the property or services involved be owned by the government. R.C. 2921.41(A). Thus, while thievery is regulated by both chapters, R.C. Chapter 2921 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>adds these requirements in order to serve a separate purpose \u2014 more stringent punishment of, and protection of the public from, those who abuse and corrupt public offices.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">In sum, we feel there is no need to read R.C. 2913.02, 2913.61(C), and 2921.41 <em>in pan materia </em>due to the unambiguous language of R.C. 2913.61(C). In enacting R.C. 2921.41, the Ohio General Assembly expressed the intent that theft in office by a public official or party official is of great public concern and to be dealt with separately. Additionally, the rule of statutory construction in which the specific or special statute controls over a general statutory provision covering the same and other subjects in general terms, <em>State, ex rel. Kerns, </em>v. <em>Rindsfoos </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 60, 66 [53 O.O. 2], would require the \u201cpublic official thief\u201d to be dealt with under R.C. 2921.41 rather than under the general thief provisions of R.C. 2913.02 and 2913.61(C). Accordingly, theft in office offenses, as defined in R.C. 2921.41, are not \u201ctheft offenses\u201d which must be tried as a single offense under R.C. 2913.61(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Appellee argues that the phrase \u201coffenses committed under section 2913.02\u201d in R.C. 2913.61(C) means all theft offenses committed, whether or not charged in the indictment. We take this argument to mean that the state should not be allowed to charge a \u201cnon-R.C. 2913.02\u201d offense in an indictment as a subterfuge to escape the mandate of R.C. 2913.61(C) to try a series of R.C. 2913.02 offenses as one offense. Our response to such an argument is that R.C. 2921.41 offenses, as we previously stated, require the establishment of more elements than R.C. 2913.02 offenses require, and, where the evidence fails to establish such further elements \u2014 that the thief is a public official who either used his office to commit the offense or who stole government property \u2014 the provisions of R.C. 2913.61(C) may apply under the general rule that the charges must conform to the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Here, however, the evidence clearly establishes, and appellee does not dispute, that he was a public official who was issued a VISA card and was authorized to use a checking account in his official capacity. Thus, the indictment properly charged appellee with forty-nine counts of theft in office for allegedly making forty-nine unauthorized purchases with such card and checking account. The dismissal of forty-eight counts was contrary to law and the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b69-9\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, C.
