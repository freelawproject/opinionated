A rule, was afterwards granted by that court, to show cause why the appeal should not be stricken off, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>the proceedings stand in the meantime. The court discharged the rule, and sustained the appeal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-6\">The defendant afterwards entered a rule of reference under the act of the 20th of <em>March, </em>1810, and the arbitrators gave an award for the defendant, upon which judgment was entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-7\">The record was removed, by writ of error, to this court, where <em>Armstrong, </em>for the plaintiff in error, contended,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-8\">1. That the court below erred, in refusing to strike off the appeal, none being allowed by the eighth section of the act of the 20th of <em>March, </em>1810, regulating arbitrations. He cited, 4 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>190. 2 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>463.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-9\">2. That the action being for a penalty, the arbitrators had no jurisdiction of the case. To this point he cited, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Buchwalter, </em>11 <em>Serg. Rawle, </em>197. 13 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>44. <em>Id. </em>102.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b244-12\"><em>Beecher, contra, </em>referred to 5 <em>Binn. </em>463.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b244-13\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b244-14\">Gibson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkS\">The right of trial by jury is supposed to be guarded by the constitution, and we are, therefore, to construe acts of assembly, which admit of construction, and would otherwise impair it, so as not to infringe on the constitution. The penalty in question, is made recoverable as debts of less amount than five dollars and thirty-three cents are recoverable, in respect to which the judgment is without appeal. But there are other consequences peculiar to an action for a debt of this class; such, for instance, as the judgment being without stay of execution, and these we must suppose to have been exclusively in the contemplation of the legislature, to whom-we ought not gratuitously to impute an intention to destroy a right secured by the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-15\">The remaining point is attended with still less difficulty. A prosecution for a criminal matter, whether by indictment, information, or action for the forfeiture, is not within the purview of the compulsory arbitration act, all the provisions of which are adapted exclusively to the proceedings in civil suits. But an omission to give notice of the time and place of the meeting of the arbitrators, is without the least smack of criminality whatever. The penalty is imposed not to punish, but to compensate; and, although the justice has ignorantly entitled the suit in the name of the commonwealth, for. the use of the party aggrieved, yet that cannot alter the nature of what the legislature had in view \u2014 satisfaction for a private injury, without the smallest cast of an offence against the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-16\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
