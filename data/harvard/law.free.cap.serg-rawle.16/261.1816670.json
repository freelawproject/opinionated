Gallagher, </em>in which a verdict and judgment was rendered in favour of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-14\">It was an action of debt on two notes, of one hundred dollars each, given by <em>Gallagher </em>to <em>Thomas Beale, </em>in his lifetime, dated each, 30th of <em>June, </em>1821, one payable on the 1st of <em>April, </em>1822, and the other on the 1st of <em>April, </em>1823.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-15\">Plea, payment with leave, &amp;c. The defendant proved, that the notes were given in part payment, for a house and lot in <em>Mifflin </em>town, sold by <em>Beale </em>to <em>Gallagher, </em>for three hundred and fifty dollars, by article of agreement, dated 17th of <em>February, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>1821, and a deed from <em>Beale </em>to <em>Gallagher, </em>with general warranty, dated <em>June </em>20th, 1821; after which, on the 30th of <em>June, </em>1821, <em>Gallagher </em>gave the notes in question. <em>Gallagher </em>entered into possession of the house and lots, and is still in possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-6\">The defendants then showed that the house and lots had been bought by <em>Beale </em>from one <em>Daniel Crawford: </em>that while <em>Crawford </em>owned the property, a judgment was entered against him in favour of <em>E. Banks, </em>for one hundred and thirty-four dollars and twenty-two cents. After <em>Gallagher\u2019s </em>purchase, and after he took possession, a <em>fieri facias </em>on this judgment was levied on the house and lots; and they were sold and purchased by <em>Gallagher </em>for one hundred and fifty dollars. The paper book stated they were not sold until after the two notes of one hundred dollars from <em>Gallagher </em>to <em>Beale </em>fell due; but it was alleged this was contrary to the fact, and that the sale took place before the last note was due.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-7\">The plaintiffs admitted the defendant was entitled to credit for the amount he paid for the incumbrance: viz. one hundred and fifty dollars, and claimed only the balance due on the notes after allowing such credit; and asked of the judge to charge the juiy, that the plaintiff was entitled to. recover such balance. In the abstract of the charge, it was stated, <em>\u201c </em>this the court refused, and charged the jury, that by the article a clear deed was to be made on the payment of three hundred and fifty dollars; these were mutual and dependent covenants. There being a lien and incumbrance on the land, when the payments were due, <em>Gallagher </em>might have refused to give his notes until that incumbrance was removed. I do not think the position of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel is sound; and it is my opinion, and that of the court, that under the evidence in the cause, the plaintiff cannot recover.\u201d</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b262-8\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b262-9\">Huston, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEW6\">Seldom has a cause been brought before a court more defectively; the judge takes no notice of the facts: viz. that notes had been given, or that a deed had been given; but says that <em>Gallagher </em>was not bound to gives his notes. Neither the article nor the deed are before this court; nor are they in possession of the counsel. What covenants are in the one or the other, is unknown, except in the vague statement above given. It happen^ much too often, that causes are brought before us so defectively, that our decision must be unsatisfactory to a certain extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">Whether there was any warranty in the articles, or, if any, to what extent, it left too uncertain. How far the deed and notes given put an end to, and extinguished the articles, is not so precisely known as could be wished; and whether the covenant of warranty in the deed was a warranty of seisin, against incumbrances, or for quiet enjoyment, or of all of them, is not apparent</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>The existing incumbrance is the alleged breach of that covenant. Now an incumbrance is a breach of such covenant, precisely to the amount of the incumbrance: if the incumbrance is two hundred dollars, and the price of the land two thousand dollars, it will not enable the purchaser, in ordinary cases, to recover back his two thousand dollars, if he has paid it; or to retain the two thousand dollars, if unpaid. An adverse title to the whole property may enable the party to retain all the purchase money; an adverse title to one-fourth of it, may enable him to retain in proportion to its extent and value. In this case, a part of the money being unpaid, <em>Gallagher </em>might have paid off the incumbrance, and retained its amount, but no more than its amount: if the incumbrance had exceeded the money due on the whole price of the property, it might have enabled him to resist the payment of any more, or to have recovered the whole as part of what he had paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">There may be cases where a purchaser buying property incumbered by liens not yet due, may accept a covenant against them, and agree to pay the purchase money, although they remain a lien on the land: but where this is not expressly, or at least,-evidently the contract of the parties, a purchaser may always pay off a lien and retain its amount out of money due the vendor. <em>Poke </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>13 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>165. I speak of liens reduced to certainty of amount, admitted and due. If the purchaser does not pay them off, but suffers the property to be sold, and it- goes <em>bona fide </em>to a stranger, he may or may not be released from the payment of any more mohey to the vendor, according to the contract and the facts and circumstances of the case. Here the incumbrance cost him less than he owed the representatives of <em>T. Beale. </em>The property is not gone <em>to </em>a stranger; he still has it. Justice requires he should have a credit for what this incumbrance cost him, and the samo justice requires he should have credit for no more than it costs him.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
