He was sued in debt for rent on an indenture of lease between <em>Wright </em>and <em>Wil-, let, </em>the plaintiffs below, lessors, and a certain <em>John Thompson, </em>lessee, of a tract of land at a certain annual rent, for nine years, ending the 1st of <em>April, </em>1822. This suit was brought for the rent of the last year against <em>Hultz, </em>who had come upon the land as purchaser from <em>John Thompson, </em>the lessee. <em>Wright </em>and <em>Willet </em>acted in the business as guardians <em>o\u00ed Benjamin Thompson, </em>the brother of <em>John Thompson. </em>The father of <em>John </em>and <em>Benjamin Thompson </em>had, by his last will, given the rents .and profits of the land in question to <em>Benjamin, </em>for his support and education, until he should attain the age of twenty-one, and then to <em>John </em>in fee simple. On the trial in the court below, the defence was, that for a great part of the last year of the lease; viz. for about ten months, no rent was due to <em>Benjamin Thompson, </em>or to his guardians; because <em>Benjamin </em>attained his full age in <em>June, </em>1821, and from that time <em>Hultz </em>himself was absolute owner of the land, and entitled to all the profits: and that at the executing of the lease it was agreed by parol between the guardians and <em>John </em>Thompson, the lessee, that the lease should be drawn to end on the usual day, the 1st of <em>April, </em>but'that the rent should terminate with the termination of <em>Benjamin\u2019s </em>interest; viz. in <em>June, </em>1821. To support this defence,-the deposition of <em>Joseph Philips, </em>who drew the lease and was one of the subscribing witnesses, was offered in evidence. The deposition, in substance, \u25a0was that the guardians and <em>John Thompson </em>came to his, (the wit-' ness\u2019s,) house, to get the lease written. That the making the lease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>for the full term of nine years was a matter discussed and understood by the parties, and that no rent was to be paid for any time after the boy, <em>Benjamin, </em>should come of age. That the lease was so drawn at the suggestion of him, the witness. That he stated to the parties, <em>Benjamin </em>could not claim any rent after he came of age, agreeably to his father\u2019s will, and they all knew it. That it was well understood no rent was to be paid after <em>Benjamines </em>coming of age; and that he, the witness, did not expect any difficulty would arise from extending of the term beyond the title of the lessors, inasmuch as they were all related. This deposition was objected to by the plaintiffs below, as contradicting the indenture; and, for that reason, was rejected by the court. Exception thereupon by the.defendant. He also excepted to the opinion of the court overruling the deposition of <em>James Hultz.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b346-6\">\n<em>Selden</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AO5\">argued for the plaintiff in error, and referred to <em>2 Johns.

It was offered to prove declarations and assurances by <em>John Thompson </em>to the defendant below, that no rent would be payable after <em>Benjamin </em>coming of age, which clearly was not evidence. But I think there was error in rejecting the deposition of <em>Joseph Philips. </em>The matter of receiving parol proof, in cases like this, can hardly now be said to be a question for argument. It was legal evidence,,and, if believed by the jury, was conclusive as to the portion of rent in dispute. It was evidence to prove, not only a defect of consideration, the land during the disputed time being not the land of <em>Wright </em>and <em>Willet, </em>nor of <em>Benjamin Thompson, </em>but of <em>Bichar\u00e1 Hultz, </em>the defendant, but to prove' also mistake, or if not mistake, fraud. For either purpose it was admissible. As to fraud, it is not supposed to be necessary to have proof ex.press, that a writing has been obtained fraudulently, in order to admit parol evidence against it on that score: but parol evidence may be admitted to resist the fraudulent use of a writing, in the obtaining of which no fraud can be made to appear. See <em>Thomson </em>v. <em>White, </em>1 <em>Dall. </em>426. There appears no substantial difference between this case, and the common case of defence against a bond or single bill for want of consideration, whether through fraud or mistake. The rule seems to apply here in full force, to consider <em>as paid </em>what in justice and conscience <em>ought not to be paid. </em>It is the opinion of the court that the judgment be reversed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
