The narr. stated, after premising certain facts, that a discourse was had, in which the plaintiff declared, that by virtue of a certain deed from <em>Henry M^Kellip, </em>jr., to the said <em>Joseph Johnston, </em>he the said <em>Johnston </em>was entitled to have and receive from the sheriff and purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale, <em>all the amount </em>of money bid for said land, beyond .the amount of debt, interest, and costs of the judgment on which it was sold; and the defendant denied this and a bet, &amp;c. . The plaintiff called a witness, who produced the following writing: \u201c 17th <em>o\u00ed February, </em>1S13, articles of agreement between <em>H. M'Kellip </em>and <em>Joseph Johnston, </em>whereby <em>M'Kellip </em>stated he had sold to <em>Johnston, </em>all that tract of land whereon he, <em>(M\u2018Kellip,) </em>then lived, at eight dol-.

That the said <em>M.\u2018Kellip, </em>is to give <em>Johnston </em>unincumbered possession on the 2d of <em>April, </em>1815. <em>The said M\u2018Kellip to enjoy the right of redemption, at any time before the 2d of April, </em>1815, <em>and to enjoy the possession of the place to that </em>time on this article were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>indorsed receipts for three hundred dollars, at date of articles, one hundred dollars on the 17th of <em>March, </em>1813, and four hundred dollars on the 26th of <em>February, </em>1815.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-6\">\u201c 17th of <em>February, </em>1813, deed from <em>H.

B. </em>The word assigns in the 57th and 59th line struck out before signing.\u201d <em>Joseph Johnston </em>did not sign this indenture; it w\u00e1s acknowledged by <em>M'Kellip </em>and wife the same day, and recorded on the 26th of <em>February, </em>1813. Also the plaintiff read a release of <em>M\u2018Kellip </em>to <em>Johnston </em>of the equity of redemption without date; but acknowledged on the 11th day of <em>May, </em>1814, and recorded the same day, in these words, \u201c for a valuable consideration heretofore received by us from <em>Joseph Johnston,- </em>we do hereby release all equity of redemption which we now have, or hereafter may have, of, in or to the foregoing premises or tract of land, hereby confirming and rendering the grant absolute, which was conditional, so that the said <em>Joseph Johnston </em>may have and enjoy in the said bargained premises, an absolute and unconditional estate in fee simple.;\u201d this was indorsed on the'deed of the 17th of <em>February, </em>1813. <em>M'Creary, </em>the witness, produced four single bills, the consideration of the release of the equity of redemption, each for two hundred dollars, all dated the 11th of <em>May, </em>1814; the first payable by <em>Johnston </em>to <em>M'Kellip, </em>the 1st of <em>April, </em>1817, the second, the 1st of <em>April, </em>1818, the third, payable to <em>M\u2018Kel</em>lip, or, <em>Jane </em>his wife, the 1st of April, 1999, and the fourth payable to <em>M\u2019Kellip </em>or his wife the 1st of <em>April, </em>2000. These were written by <em>Johnston\u2019s </em>son, and whether the two last were made payable in 1999, and 2000, by mistake or fraud, was not agreed, and the witness said \u201c these were put into my hands the 11th of <em>May, </em>1814, to be kept till the termination of the dispute, and I have had them ever since.\u201d He also produced the bond from <em>Johnston </em>to <em>M'Kellip, </em>dated the 17th of February, 1813, for four hundred dollars, payable the 1st of <em>April, </em>1816, on which was indorsed, \u201c 7th of <em>February, </em>1814, to be in force if <em>Johnston </em>gets my place on the 2d of <em>April, </em>181.5, otherwise, to be void and of no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>effect.\u201d On the 2d of <em>February, </em>1S.14, <em>M\u2018Kellip </em>entered into articles of agreement with <em>James Gray,, </em>by which he covenanted on or before the 20th of <em>March, </em>1815, to convey and assure to <em>Gray, </em>his heirs and assigns, the one hundred and fifty acres, &amp;e., being the same which <em>M'Kellip </em>by indenture, &amp;c., had sold and conveyed to <em>Johnston, </em>with a clause of redemption. The price was twelve dollars per acre payable, &amp;e., and a reserve of twenty acres, during the lives of <em>M'Kellip </em>and wife, two hundred dollars paid in hand, six hundred dollars payable before the 1st of <em>April, </em>1815, and the residue in small instalments. \" This was acknowledged and recorded the 2d of <em>March, </em>1S14. 20th of <em>February, </em>1815, <em>Johnston </em>paid <em>M'Kellip </em>four hundred dollars, the amount of his bond, due the 2d of <em>April, </em>1815. There was then shown the record of a suit, <em>John M'Kellip, </em>for the use of <em>George Williams </em>against <em>H. M'Kellip, </em>in which was a report of arbitrator's for two hundred and nine dollars, on the 21st of <em>October, </em>1812, an appeal and trial, and verdict and judgment for the plaintiff in 1817; this bound the land from the date of report; and, on execution on this, the land was sold for two hundred and ninety dollars and fifty cents; the debt, interest, and costs were paid to the plaintiff in the judgment, and the overplus, which exceeded two thousand dollars, was claimed by the plaintiff in this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-6\"><em>M\u2018Creary, </em>the witness, then proved, that <em>M\u2018Kellip </em>being embarrassed, and among others indebted to <em>Johnston, </em>applied to <em>Johnston </em>for a loan of money, and a mortgage -was drawn by witness. <em>Johnston </em>would not give the money on a mortgage, it was destroyed, the foregoing writings then drawn; there was an express agreement that no stranger should purchase; for this reason, the word <em>assigns </em>was struck out of the clause of redemption. <em>Johnston </em>said if the land had to go from <em>M'Kellip, </em>that he had the first right as he paid the first money. After the witness had drawn it, the word, assigns, was struck out at the suggestion of <em>Johnston\u2019s </em>son. Witness drew the writings according to the agreement of the parties; witness had heard <em>Johnston </em>say often, that <em>Gray </em>tendered him the four hundred dollars; it was admitted this was in the fall of 1814. It was also proved, that <em>Gray </em>tendered the four hundred dollars and interest to <em>Johnston, </em>on the 1st of <em>April, </em>1815. <em>Adam Johnston </em>(son of the plaintiff,) proved that in 1814, <em>M\u2018Kellip, </em>tendered back to <em>Gray, </em>the two hundred dollars, which he had paid <em>M\u2018Kellip </em>on his purchase, that <em>M\u2018Kellip </em>got the money from <em>James Johnston, </em>and when <em>Gray </em>refused to receive it, <em>M\u2018Kellip </em>gave it back to <em>Johnson.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-7\">The judge who tried the cause did not reduce the charge to writing. Several errors were alleged in that charge, whieh may be reduced to two.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-8\">1. That the judge charged, that on the face of the- papers,- the deed and Article of <em>February, </em>1813, amounted to a mortgage and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>no more for the four hundred dollars then lent; and that the parol evidence, if believed, did not alter the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-6\"><em>2. </em>That this being the case, the clause restricting the power of redemption to the party, was void.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b364-7\">Baldwin, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-8\">1. There was to be no redemption, after the 1st day of <em>Jlpril, </em>1815. If not then redeemed, the transaction was to become a sale. Equity will relieve against an agreement of this sort, only where the intention was exclusively a loan. Here a loan was to be a purchase on the happening of a contingency, and equity cannot relieve against the clear intention of the parties. Unquestionably they intended more than a pledge. Here there is no covenant of repayment. 1 <em>Yeates, 579. 5 Binn. </em>499. 1 <em>Call. </em>280. 2 <em>Call. </em>420. 9 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>446. The sale shall be absolute wherever it appears the parties intended it to be soi The <em>English </em>cases also recognize the same principle. 1 <em>Vern. </em>268. 3 <em>Vern. </em>190. <em>Ca. in Ch. </em>220. 2 <em>Ch. Rep. </em>26. Time may be made of the essence of the contract, 4 <em>Dall. </em>347; otherwise, where security and not time, is the object of the contract. 2 <em>Bro. P. C. </em>265. There may be a mortgage which may be a conditional purchase. 5 <em>Bro. </em>P. <em>C. </em>154. Once a mortgage, and always a mortgage is not of universal application. <em>Prac. in Ch. </em>95. 1 P. <em>N. </em>268. <em>2 Atk. </em>494. 2 <em>Vent. </em>364. <em>Pow.

Here, the parol evidence ought to have been left in connexion with the writing, to the jury to judge of the actual nature of the transaction. Whether a mortgage or not always depends on the circumstances.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-12\">2. The right of redemption was personal, the word assigns was struck out, expressly to have this effect. The tender by <em>Gray </em>went for nothing, even if made as the agent of <em>M\u2018Kellip; </em>for the period had elapsed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-13\">3.

It is in evidence, that the parties contemplated ,a mortgage, and one was <em>drawn </em>\u2014 Johnston objected to the word redemption; <em>M\u2018Kellip </em>was coerced into the contract. <em>Pow. Mort. </em>45, 46. The right of redemption may be lost by delay, but that is a distinct circumstance. <em>Pow. Mort. </em>173. 174. That the money was not advanced all at once, makes no difference; the mortgage is a security for all subsequent advancements. 1 <em>Cruise, </em>141, <em>sect. </em>26, 27. Right of pre-emption may be secured, but then it is only in case the mortgagee will give as much as any one else. Not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>that the estate shall in the mean time be tied up; for, that would be oppressive. The right of redemption is an interest, and may be made the means of raising money to pay the loan. But there was a tender in fact both at the day and before the day, by which <em>Johnston\u2019s </em>estate, of whatever nature, was divested. 6 <em>Bac. </em>450. No right exists to claim interest after tender.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b365-6\"><em>Baldwin, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4d\">Where a benefit or kindness is intended, it may be restricted to the person, and not extend to an assignee.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b365-7\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b365-8\">Huston, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"APld\">(after stating the two points before mentioned.)\u2014 The cause must eventually turn on these points, and in discussing them, I shall notice some matters discussed in the argument, intimately connected with, if not depending, on how these two were decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">The rule that what is once a mortgage, shall always be considered a mortgage, though stated as a general rule, will perhaps be found subject to several exceptions. Length of time, together with the subsequent conduct of the parties,' have often varied it \u2014 but I believe it is never varied by clauses inserted in the writings at the time of the loan of money. The needy borrower is not considered as treating on equal terms with the lender \u2014 hence the lender may stipulate for the pre-emption if the borrower sells, yet he has not been permitted, at the time of the loan, to stipulate that he shall in a certain event become the purchaser at a price then agreed on. The whole power of the court is founded on the idea that a needy man requires protection against the effect of his own agreements with one who having the power to relieve him from present distress, was found too often to grant such relief on unconscionable terms. A common mortgage is as plain and express an agreement for an absolute sale in case the money is not paid on the day as can be expressed. Yet it has long ceased to be any thing else than a security for money. And it would be an imputation on the administration of justice, if the same agreement differently expressed by the scrivener, though not more plainly, should have a contrary effect. If then the transaction was really a loan of money, secured on (and, it is nothing more, whatever language may be used in expressing the contrae*, or whether that contract is all contained in one instrument, or divided among several. And as in a plain express mortgage, the right of redemption is a right inseparable from the estate of the mortgagor, it is equally an essential right it* him, though the igreement be expressed in a more complicated form and manner The right of redemption cannot be destroyed or taken away, and of consequence cannof be restrained or fettered \u2014 for if it could, it would soon cease to exist. If this be a mortgage then, the attempt to confine the right of redemption to the mortgagor personally, as being a restraint on that right) would he void \u2014 it would in most instances he equivalent to denying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>right altogether \u2014 it tends to disable him to borrow, and restrains his right of raising the money by sale; in short, in almost all cases, it renders the right of redemption worth nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Was this a mortgage? On this it seems to be impossible to doubt \u2014it was a loan of money \u2014 it might be repaid in a day certain\u2014 but says the agreement, if not paid then, the mortgagee may pay or must pay four hundred dollars, and other four hundred dollars, and become purchaser. The mortgagee himself knows it to be only a mortgage, and treats it as such by purchasing the equity of redemption. If that had been done before the mortgagor had sold to <em>Gray </em>\u2014 if the eight hundred dollars agreed upon at the time of the loan, and the eight hundred dollars agreed to be given for the equity of redemption had been paid, and a <em>long time had been suffered to elapse, </em>I do not say what a court would have decided \u2014that case is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">If this be considered a conditional sale, in what respect would the situation of <em>Johnston </em>be better? the condition was performed to the letter, and in its spirit; the four hundred dollars lent was rendered before the 1st of <em>April, </em>1815, and on that day. I do not rely solely on the phrase that <em>M\u2018Kellip </em>should pay or cause to be paid, though if necessary, they might be relied on. There did exist <em>in M'Kellip </em>a right of redemption \u2014 that was not taken away merely by striking out the word assigns; and an express covenant not to raise the money by sale, extorted by a lender from a borrower, would not have availed.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">Other objections are made, that <em>Gray </em>did not state whether he made the tender in 1S14, and that on the 1st of <em>April, 1815, </em>as the agent of <em>M\u2018Kellip, </em>or in his own right as purchaser. It would be strange that a tender made by a man who had good right to make it, should be considered bad because he was not asked, and did not state in what capacity he acted \u2014 as a purchaser whose title was on record,, he had a right to tender and redeem \u2014 and as he did not pretend to act in any other capacity, the tender is good. It was alleged as error, that the judge told the jury, that on the face of the writings it was a mortgage; and that the parol evidence, if believed by them, also made it a mortgage \u2014 and this is called taking the facts from the jury. I should not have noticed this, if the same objection had not been made in several other cases at this term. There was no contradictory statement in the testimony; and the court was bound to give an opinion on the effect of it. The objection seems to be, that the judge ought to have repeated every sentence of it, and concluded each sentence, <em>\u201c </em>If you believe this sentence, it is a mortgage.\u201d If he had done so, it would have been novel, and, like most novelties, wrong! There may be cases where several acts are necessary to entitle a party, and where his right does not arise until he'has performed each of those acts; and in such case, a judge must so direct a jury. There are other cases where the state of a single fact is to be collected from testimony\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>if that testimony is variant, the jury will be told the law, as it would be if the facts, found in one way, and as it would be if the facts are found to be otherwise. When the evidence is all consistent, and express as to the facts, the only direction can be what was given here.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">From the entry of the amicable action, it would seem the intention was to ascertain who had a right to the money in the sheriff\u2019s hands \u2014 but the issue is confined to the point, whether <em>Johnston </em>had right to the whole of it. He claimed to be purchaser, and as such, claimed the whole. His' right to the four hundred dollars originally advanced by him, and interest up to the 1st of <em>Jlpril, </em>1815, is not only admitted, but it has been actually paid him, and received without prejudice to-this suit. We have been asked to give an opinion, as to who is entitled to this money \u2014 this to prevent further litigation \u2014 on the facts before us, and if no other facts exist, <em>Johnston </em>is entitled to the four hundred dollars advanced in 1813, and interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">And on the facts in evidence, and if no contradictory facts exist, he is not entitled to receive out of the money in the sheriff\u2019s hands the four hundred dollars he paid <em>M\u2018Kellip </em>on the 20th <em>February, </em>1815. He had legal notice on the 2d of March, 1S14, that <em>M'Kellip </em>had sold to <em>Gray </em>\u2014 and actual notice in the autumn of 1814, by the tender made by <em>Gray. </em>His payment to <em>M'Kellip </em>after-wards, if not, under all the circumstances, fraud, was at least folly. He could'not interfere with or embarrass the contract between <em>M'Kettip </em>and Gray, or acquire any further lien on the land by giving <em>M'Kellip </em>money, which he knew <em>M\u2018Kellip </em>had no right to receive.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">As to the residue of the money in the sheriff\u2019s hands, we have no facts on which to give an opinion, and we give none. <em>M'Kellip </em>is not before us \u2014 how he and <em>Gray </em>stand, or what at this time are the respective rights of <em>M'Kellip </em>and <em>Gray, </em>we know not.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">The charge of the judge being correct on all the facts of the case, and the verdict conformable to the law and evidence, the motion for a new trial is overruled, and judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
