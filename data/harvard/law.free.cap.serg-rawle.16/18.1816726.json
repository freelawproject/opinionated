The notice contained other matters not now material.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-11\">Under this notice, the defendants, among other things, offered in evidence the article of agreement to which the notice referred, the record of a judgment in a suit brought by <em>Samuel Ensminger </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>against <em>Daniel M\u2018Mullen </em>in the Court of Common Pleas of <em>Dauphin </em>county to <em>December </em>Term, 1814; to both which the counsel for the plaintiff objected; but the court overruled the objection, and admitted the evidence, and sealed bills of exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b19-6\">After the defendants had closed their case, the plaintiff proved that <em>Daniel M'Mullen </em>went to the house of old Mr. <em>Fox, </em>the father of <em>Ann Fox, </em>and offered the bond for sale. M'Mullen, accompanied by <em>Henry </em>Fox, the son of the old gentleman, called on <em>Jacob Wenner, </em>and told him he had found a pjace to sell bonds. He took the bond in question, with others, out of his pocket, and laid them on the table. <em>Wenner </em>took them up, looked at them, and said, \u201c Yes, they are my bonds, and I am willing to pay them at any time; but I have not got the money now.\u201d <em>M'Mullen </em>asked him if he was willing the old man should buy them. <em>Wenner </em>said, \u201cYes; it will be better for me if you sell them hereabouts; then I can pay them easier than go to <em>Halifax </em>to pay them.\u201d <em>M\u2018Mullen </em>then told <em>Wenner </em>that it was for this old <em>Fox </em>had sent his son along with him; that he did not trust to him. <em>M'Mullen </em>then asked <em>Wenner </em>again if he was satisfied, when he said, \u201cYes, I would rather have it so than not.\u201d This conversation was communicated to old Mr. <em>Fox </em>in the presence of his daughter <em>Ann, </em>and she afterwards purchased the bond on which the suit was brought, and took an assignment of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b19-7\">Several points of law were, at the conclusion of the trial, submitted to the plaintiiPs counsel to the court for their opinion; on all of which the charge was in favour of the plaintiffs, except the, following, viz.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b19-8\">\u201cThat it was the duty of <em>Jacob Werner, </em>the obligor in this bond, when called upon, to tell Mr. <em>Fox, </em>the brother of <em>Ann Fox, </em>that he had an objection to this bond, and that he would not pay it when it became due, because <em>Fox </em>was sent there for the express purpose tc^know whether the bond was good or not: he told <em>Jacob Wenner </em>so. And as <em>Jacob </em>did then say that this bond was good, and would be paid whenever he had money, that he cannot now gainsay it, but must pay the bond, although the consideration for which the bond was given has since failed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b19-9\">The charge of the court was in these words, viz.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b19-10\">\u201cThe promise to pay made by <em>Jacob Wenner, </em>in the presence of <em>Henry Fox\u2019s </em>agent, would bind him to pay the bond, if it had been assigned to <em>Henry </em>Aba:; but this promise would not bind him to pay a bond assigned not to <em>Henry Fox </em>but to a third person to whom or to whose agent no promise was made, and who was not present when he made such engagement or promise to <em>Henry Fox\u2019s </em>agent. <em>Ann Fox </em>cannot take advantage of this: young <em>Fox </em>was not sent by her to <em>Jacob Wennerf </em>he was not her agent, and she was not present when <em>Wenner </em>made the promise; and, however binding the declaration of <em>Jacob Wenner </em>would be as regards <em>Henry </em>Fox, they will not bind him as to <em>Ann </em>Fox, whose duty- it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>was to ascertain before the assignment, either personally or by an agent, whether <em>Jacob Wenner </em>would make defence against the payment of the bond or not, and to her bond he can set up his defence, for she is in the same situation in this suit as the assignor, M'M<em>ullen, </em>would be, were he the plaintiff. And there is not a tittle of evidence given to show that she intended to purchase this bond before <em>Henry Fox </em>called on <em>Wenner </em>and conversed with him on the subject of the bonds, or that she sent him, there, or had any thing to do with his going there.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b20-6\">The counsel for the plaintiff excepted to the charge.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b20-7\"><em>Weidman </em>and <em>Foster, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b20-8\"><em>Norris </em>and <em>Elder, </em>for the defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b20-9\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b20-10\">Rogers, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAJ\">This was a suit brought to recover the sum of one-hundred and thirty-one dollars, fifty cents, on a bond given to secure part of the purchase money of a tract of land sold by the defendants, to <em>Daniel M'Mullen, </em>and assigned by him for a valuable consideration to the plaintiff, <em>Ann Fox, </em>since intermarried with <em>John Rudy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b20-11\">There is no doubt, that the assignee of a bond, whether the assignment be legal or equitable, takes it at his own peril, subject to every defalcation which might have been made against the obligee by the obligor, at the time of the assignment, or notice of it. 1 <em>Dall. </em>23. 2 <em>Dall. 49. 4 Serg. &amp;. Rawle, </em>177. The defence relied on, was, that the bond, on which suit was brought, was given to secure the payment of the purchase money of a tract of land sold by <em>Daniel M'Mullen </em>to <em>Daniel </em>and <em>John Wenner:. </em>That subsequent to the articles of agreement, but before the execution of the deed, <em>Samuel Ensminger </em>obtained a judgment against <em>Daniel M'Mullen, </em>to wit, to the <em>December </em>Term, 1814, <em>No. 44. </em>The first question raised by the plaintiffs in erro\u00bb, is, what is the legal effect of this judgment? and about t \u00fas we have no difficulty. It binds the legal estate of <em>Daniel M'Mullen </em>in the land, which was not parted with at the time of the rendition of the judgment. The sheriff\u2019s vendee would stand precisely in the situation of <em>M\u2018Mullen, </em>and therefore it is incumbent on a purchaser to search the office for judgments, before payment of his money, up to the time of the execution of his deed. The sheriff\u2019s vendee would be entitled to the unpaid purchase money; the payment of which he could enforce, by an action of ejectment against the terre-tenant of the land. The sale of the legal estate by a judgment mesne between the articles of agreement and the execution of the deed would transfer, as a necessary incident, the money remaining unpaid. And in this there is no hardship upon the original vendee, as he has notice upon record, and can have no difficulty in protecting himself, if he uses ordinary diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-13\">In an action of ejectment brought by the vendee of the sheriff, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>the original vendee, could protect himself only, by payment or tendering the purchase money, unpaid at the time of the rendition of the judgment; on doing so, he would be entitled to a conveyance of the legal title vested in the sheriff\u2019s vendee.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-6\">In the case of the sale of an equitable interest in lands, it has already been decided, that the vendee of the sheriff stands in the same situation as the former owner of the equitable interest. In <em>Auwater </em>v. <em>Mathiott, </em>9 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle, </em>397, it has been held that the judgment creditors of a vendee of land, who has paid part of the purchase money, and has possession of the land, but has received no deed, are entitled to the proceeds of sale of his title under an execution, in preference to the vendor.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-7\">By the law of <em>Pennsylvania, </em>all the real estate of the debtor, whether legal or equitable, is bound by a judgment against him, and may be taken in execution and sold for the satisfaction of the debt. At common law, an equitable estate is not bound by a judgment, or subject to an execution. We have no Court of Chancery, and have, therefore, from necessity, established it as a principle, that both judgment and execution have an immediate operation on equitable estates. 9 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>397.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-8\">If then a judgment binds an equitable interest in lands, <em>a fortiori, </em>it binds a legal interest, and to the extent of the interest at the time of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"AWj\">Although <em>prima facie, </em>the obligor may make every defence against the assignee, which at the time of the assignment, or notice of it, he could have made against the obligee, yet he may by his own conduct, preclude himself from the benefit of that right. Thus it has been held that if the assignee calls on the obligor, and informs him he is about to take an assignment of his bond, and the obligor acknowledges that it is due, without any allegation of defence, he shall not be permitted to take defence against the assignee. And this whether his silence proceeds from ignorance or design. It would be most inequitable and unjust, that he should;, because if any loss afterwards occur, it arises from the negligence or folly of the obligor, and not the default of the assignee, who has taken every pains to inform himself of the real situation of the parties. If any injury accrues, it is right that he who causes it should bear the loss. The cases all go upon the ground that the assignee has acted with good faith, and without notice of any defect of title, or valid defence, and with a wish not to ensnare the obligor, but to protect himself. As bonds are an article of commerce, and are made transferable, equitably and expressly by an act of assembly, it would be legalising fraud to hold any other doctrine. It appears, that <em>Daniel M\u2018Mullen </em>came to the house of old Mr. Fox, offered to sell this bond, that <em>Henry Fox </em>with <em>Daniel M'Mullen </em>ealled on <em>Jacob Wenner, </em>and told. him. that he had found out a place to sell the bonds. That <em>M'Mullen </em>took the bonds out of his pocket, and laid them on the table, and that <em>Wenner </em>took them up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>and looked at them and said, \u201c Yes, they are my bonds, and I am willing to pay them at any time, but I have not got the money now.\u201d <em>M\u2018Mullen </em>then asked him if he was willing old <em>Fox </em>should buy them. <em>Wenner </em>said, \u201cYes, it will be better for me, if you sell them hereabouts; then I can pay them easier than go to <em>Halifax </em>to pay them.\u201d <em>M\u2018Mullen </em>then told <em>Wenner </em>that it was for this that old <em>Fox </em>had sent his son along with him; that he did not trust to him. <em>M'Mullen </em>then asked <em>Wenner </em>again if he was satisfied. He said, \u201c Yes, I would rather have it so than not.\u201d That this conversation was communicated to old <em>Fox </em>in the presence of <em>Ann Fox, </em>and that <em>Ann Fox </em>purchased the bond and took the assignment on which this suit was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">It was not, it is true, <em>Ann Fox </em>who called on <em>Wenner, </em>nor was <em>Henry Fox </em>her agent; but this can make no difference in the principle. The question is, was <em>Ann Fox </em>induced to purchase the bond under the representation made by <em>Wenner, </em>which w'as communicated to her, that he had no defence, and that he was willing and desirous that the bond should be sold in the neighbourhood. If this should be the opinion of the jury, who are the proper judges of the fact, and that there was no imposition on <em>Wenner </em>in which she was concerned, then every principle of law, and of common sense, would say, that <em>Wenner, </em>and not <em>Ann Fox, </em>should sustain the loss if any arises. In such a case, the verdict of the jury should he in favour of the plaintiff to the amount due upon the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-7\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
