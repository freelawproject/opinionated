This is too late. 4 <em>Yeates, </em>240. 1 <em>Sinn. 76.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b9-12\">Hopkins, contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ag\">said, the first day of the term is a unit, and if filing the appeal in the morning, before the sitting of the court, be in time, it necessarily follows, that filing it after the court sits, must be so too. The party must have the whole day, if he has any portion of it. When the court departed from the letter of the law, they necessarily let in this construction.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b9-13\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AW\">The first day of the term was intended to mean the actual sitting of the court, and this much has been decided; but it is impossible, without violating the law, to carry the construction further.
