A <em>fieri facias </em>issued returnable to <em>November </em>term, 1S12, and was levied on the land in dispute, which was condemned. A <em>venditioni exponas </em>issued to <em>February </em>term, 1S13, and the sheriff having returned that the land remained unsold, an <em>alias venditioni exponas </em>issued to <em>May </em>term, 1813, on which the premises were sold to <em>George Wienman, </em>for nine thousand six hundred and forty-three dollars and thirty-one cents.

On the 7th of <em>December, </em>1813, the jury found a verdict for the plaintiffs; on which auditors were appointed, who made a report, exhibiting a general statement of the respective claims of the plaintiffs in the issue, to the money in the hands of the sheriff, and an apportionment of the sums due to eaeh of the heirs of <em>John Hamilton, </em>deceased, from <em>John Kean, </em>was made of the property taken by him under the decree of the <em>Orphans\u2019 Court. </em>The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>statement exhibited also, the payments made by <em>John Kean, </em>to the heirs of <em>John Hamilton, </em>who, on receiving the balance due to them respectively, were to release their interests in the property sold by the sheriff.

That the interest of <em>Jane </em>in the parcels taken by the other children was divested; and their interest in those which she took through the medium of her husband, also divested. That each heir had a specific portion of the estate, those who did not take land, having taken money. That the interest of <em>Jane </em>originally diffused through the whole of the intestate\u2019s estate, was by the proceedings in the Orphans\u2019 Court, concentrated in those portions of it, which were taken by the husband in her right, in which her interest was enlarged by annexing .to and engrafting upon it, her interest in those portions which were taken by the other children: That her interest, equal to one-seventh part of all her father\u2019s estate, thus falling exclusively upon the several parcels taken by her husband in right of his wife, the premises in dispute, were to bear their proportion, which, by an arithmetical calculation not necessary now to be gone through, appeared to be fifty-eight acres; for which the court gave judgment upon the verdict. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-11\">To this opinion the counsel for the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b63-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number><em>Elder, </em>for the plaintiff in error, contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ajj\">that instead of a judgment for fifty-eight acres, the court below ought to have rendered judgment for the whole of the land in controversy. By the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court, giving the estate taken by <em>John Kean </em>in right of his wife, \u201c to <em>John Kean </em>and <em>Jane </em>his wife, and the heirs of the said <em>Jane\u201d </em>the fee is limited to the wife. The Orphans\u2019 Court, which proceeds as a Court of Chancery, had a right <em>to </em>make such a decree. It is empowered to order the estate to any daughter, she, <em>or some one for her, </em>paying, &amp;c. The words of the act, <em>\u201c </em>limit and appoint,\u201d have relation to the nature of the estate to be decreed and not to the time of payment, <em>Act of </em>1713, <em>Purd.

Consequently, a complete title to the whole vested in the purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale, and the plaintiff could recover nothing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-8\">If, however, she is entitled to any thing, her title does not extend beyond one-seventh, which was her original undivided interest in every part of the estate. This interest has been regularly extinguished in those parts of the estate taken by the other children, and cannot be transferred to and kept alive in those which her husband took.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AP14\">The legislature had in .view a partition among those who claim by descent from the intestate, unembarrassed by the intervening of a husband, which was not foreseen and therefore not provided for. When it occurred in practice, it gave rise to many difeulties and different opinions which prevailed in different pai\u2019ts of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>state. In some, it was thought that as the husband might have elected to take his wife\u2019s share in money, and as he paid for the other shares with his own funds, justice required that he should be permitted to take the whole to his own use. In others, it was thought that as he had nothing in the inheritance but his marital rights over his wife\u2019s share of it, he came in only as her representative, to perform for her an act which she was incapacitated hy the coverture to perform for herself, that the quantity of her interest and not her title, was altered by the decree; and consequently, that the recognizance to the other children was a lien on the whole, which might be sold as an indivisible mass; so that on all hands it was agreed that the turning of the wife\u2019s inheritance into personalty, was an evil incident to the husband\u2019s right of election, which it was impossible to prevent, and which the court would be compelled to disregard. Thus it was the practice to decree the whole to the husband, or to the wife, as the one or the other of these opinions happened to prevail. But when this court decided that the shares of the other children become the estate of the husband, as in the case of an ordinary purchase, and that the wife has an interest paramount the partition, which remains in her as her old estate, it cut the knot if it did not untie it. Whether the point decided will have the intended effect of preventing the wife\u2019s inheritance from passing to those who are not of her blood is by no means clear; but under all circumstances, perhaps nothing better could have been done. But the separating of the respective interests of the husband and wife removed all difficulty in regard to subordinate questions. As the <em>Orphans\u2019 Court </em>has not power over the rights of the parties, their estates are not to be moulded to the form of the decree; the legal estate, when confirmed to the husband or to the wife, being held by either in trust for the other, according to their respective interests. In the case before us, there is nothing in the record to show that the estate was decreed to the wife,- with the assent of the husband; on the contrary it is evident that it owes its form to a misconception of the rights of the parties. Had' the husband intended to vest the title to the whole in the wife, he would have executed a conveyance, without which his intention would rest on conjecture, which is of little account in fixing the rights of a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Then, as to the error assigned by the defendant. It is too plain for argument, that the recognizance of the husband does not bind the estate of his wife. He stands in a relation altogether different from that of a guardian, who elects to take at the valuation in behalf of his ward, and who for that reason, subjects the ward to his contract for payment of the purchase money. As concerns the share of his wife, who remains seised of her old estate, he takes nothing in her behalf or his own. Her right of election is an accident of her person and not of her estate, and he succeeds to it by the marriage as he does to all her other rights that are purely per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>sonal, but what he takes in virtue of it, he takes to his own use, and it would therefore be contrary to the dictates of natural justice to permit him to pledge her estate for the price of what he has purchased for his own benefit. He could no more do so by a purchase of the shares of the other children and giving a recognizance in the <em>Orphans\u2019 Court, </em>than by the purchase of any other real estate, and giving security for the purchase money by mortgage or judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Then if the title and estate of the wife are unaltered, the proportion to which the plaintiff is entitled here is easily determined. Claiming paramount the partition, she is entitled to what she inherited, \u2014 an undivided seventh of the lot in question. The children succeeded to the inheritance as tenants in common of the whole, the' estate of each being an undivided interest in every part and particle of it. By what process then has the plaintiff\u2019s interest which originally pervaded the whole, been concentrated in a part? As regards the land in dispute, her estate is what it was at the death of her father; and as regards the other portions, it has been divested by the decree of the <em>Orphans\u2019 Court, </em>or by her conveyance, and it would be obviously unjust to have her interest in those portions that were turned into personalty by her own act or the act of the law, fastened upon this part of the inheritance in the hands of a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser. She is therefore to recover but an undivided seventh of the land in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed, and judgment for the plaintiff for an sundivided seventh part of the lands described in the writ.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
