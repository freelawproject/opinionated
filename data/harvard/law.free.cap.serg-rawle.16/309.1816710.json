The executors of <em>Samuel </em>settled their administration account, and it was passed on the 23d of <em>August, </em>1819, in which a balance was due the said executors of five dollars and three cents. The debts due by <em>Benjamin </em>to <em>Samuel </em>in his lifetime, and which are mentioned in the said will, were not contained in the said account, and were never paid, nor any part thereof, by <em>Benjamin </em>to the executors, nor demanded by them, but the obligations for the payment thereof were cancelled by the executors. The interest of <em>Benjamin </em>in the tract of land in <em>Derry </em>township, devised to him by the will of <em>Samuel, </em>was \u00a7pld by the sheriff of <em>Westmoreland </em>county, in pursuance of executions, numbers 63 and 64, to <em>February </em>Term, 1819, on judgments against the said <em>Benjamin Parr, </em>in <em>November, \\3\\1, </em>and <em>February, </em>1S18, and purchased by <em>James Lemon </em>at the sheriff\u2019s sale for seven hundred and fifty-five dollars, and a deed made and duly acknowledged for the same by the said sheriff to the same <em>James Lemon, </em>on the-day of-, in the same year. The said house and lot in <em>New Alexandria, </em>and land thereunto adjoining, devised to <em>Benjamin, </em>by the said will of the said <em>Samuel, </em>was sold by the said sheriff in pursuance of execution, number 62, <em>February </em>Term, 1819, to the said <em>James Lemon, </em>for eight hundred and sixty-five dollars, upon a judgment against the said <em>Benjamin Parr, </em>number 153, <em>November </em>1817, for which a deed was made to the said <em>James Lemon, </em>by the said sheriff, and duly acknowledged on the-day of -\u00a1-, 1819. In pursuance of the said sale by the said sheriff, and purchase by the said <em>James Lemon, </em>the said <em>James Lemon </em>entered into and took possession forthwith according to law of the said lands, lots, and buildings, with the appurtenances, having paid the whole purchase money to the said sheriff before receiving the deed or taking possession. <em>Benjamin W. Parr, </em>mentioned in the said judgments and executions, is the same person mentioned as <em>Benjamin Parr </em>in the said will of <em>Samuel Parr, </em>and in this statement, The sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>plus monies arising from the said sales beyond the debt, interest, and costs in the said execution, were appropriated and paid by the sheriff to other judgments against the said <em>Benjamin W. Parr </em>in <em>Westmoreland </em>county. <em>Joseph Shoemaker </em>and <em>John Townsend, </em>executors of <em>John Townsend, </em>deceased, commenced a suit against <em>Isaac Parr, </em>and <em>John Kirkpatrick, </em>executors of the said <em>Samuel Parr, </em>deceased, number 59, <em>May, </em>1817, and obtained judgment thereon on the 18th of <em>August, </em>1817, which was liquidated on the 19th of <em>November, </em>1819, and issued a <em>fieri facias, </em>number 16, <em>February, </em>1820, by virtue of which the tract of land in <em>Derry </em>township, mentioned in said, will was levied on and by virtue of a <em>pluries venditioni exponas, </em>number 94, <em>February, </em>IS22, was sold to <em>James Lemon, </em>by the sheriff of the said county, and duly conveyed for the price of two hundred and eighty dollars and one cent, and the deed duly acknowledged, and the purchase money paid to the said sheriff, on the-day of-, in the same year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-6\">The plaintiffs by their guardians, they being minors, forthwith after the decease of the said <em>Samuel Parr, </em>took possession of the premises mentioned in the said ejectment, and continued the same until the said purchase by the said <em>James Lemon, </em>under the said last mentioned execution, number 94, <em>February Term, </em>1822, after which, and before the bringing of this suit, <em>James Lemon, </em>without their consent, entered into possession thereof, and put the defendant in possession thereof under him as his tenant. The said defendant is admitted to be in possession of the premises in the said declaration mentioned at this time, and when the said ejectment was brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-7\">The President of the court below filed of record the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-8\">\u201cThe land which the plaintiffs claim was devised to them by their father, <em>Samuel Parr, </em>and afterwards sold by the sheriff on a judgment for debts contracted by him in his lifetime. The will contains the following clause: \u201cIt is further my will and pleasure, that my son <em>Benjamin, </em>(to whom by a former claim one half of the tract had been devised by his father,) after my decease pay all my just debts out of the property bequeathed to him, except what are already provided for above, and in case he neglect or refuse so to do, mj' executors are hereby authorized to compel the same. And, whereas, I hold on mj' son <em>Benjamin </em>several obligations which my executors are hereby authorized to cancel and make void .upon condition of his paying the debts of the estate as mentioned above.\u201d It is admitted that those debts of the testator were not paid by <em>Benjamin, </em>nor demanded of him, and that his obligations were cancelled by the executors. What the amount of those obligations was, or whether it or any part of it could have been recovered from him does not appear. But, independent of these obligations, it does not appear that the whole of the assets which came into the executors\u2019 hands have been duly administered, and a ba* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>lance found due to them on the settlement of their account. The whole of the real estate of which the testator died seised, whether devised or not, was subject to the payment of his just debts. But it is contended, that the purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale took the premises in question, subject to the payment of those very debts, and thus, that the interest of the plaintiffs under the devise ought not to be affected by the sheriff\u2019s sale. I have not been able to discover the least analogy between the cases cited in support of this idea, and the present case. The one half of the land was sold on judgments against the testator in his lifetime. The whole of it was then liable to be sold on those judgments, if insufficient to pay those liens within seven years. It may have been irregular to sell only one half, and if application had been made in due time, the levy and sale might have been set aside. It may be presumed that the object was to save, if possible, the other half devised to the plaintiffs, with the hope of raising funds either from Benjamin, or by other means, to discharge the debts which be ought to have paid. But this object having failed, and a judgment having been rendered, in an action of covenant, against the executors of <em>Benjamin Parr, </em>and there being no assets in their hands to discharge it, the sale of the other half became, in a manner, inevitable. It might have been, perhaps, avoided by the plaintiffs paying it <em>pro interesse suo. </em>It may be regretted, indeed, that by the comparative smallness of the price for the half of the land last sold, or by some neglect on the part of the executors, they have suffered an injury. But, be the case as it may in that respect, the purchaser is entitled to be considered as a fair purchaser, and whether he had notice or not of the contents of the will, his title under the sheriff\u2019s deeds cannot be affected by any lien, (which, by the bye, I consider to be only supposititious,) created by it.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b313-6\"><em>Foster, </em>for the plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWF\">The purchaser of <em>Benjamin\u2019s </em>estate took it as it was in his hands, subject to the appropriation to the payment of these debts; not having done so, the debts are as against him to be taken as discharged.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b313-7\">Coulter, <em>contra.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b313-8\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b313-9\">Duncan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5Qi\">On the case stated in the nature of a special verdict on the will of <em>Samuel Parr, </em>the court are of opinion that the plaintiffs were entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">The land devised to <em>Benjamin </em>was, in express terms, charged with the payment of the testator\u2019s debts. <em>\u201c </em>It is my will and pleasure, that my son <em>Benjamin, </em>after my decease, pay all my just debts.\u201d <em>Benjamin </em>took it With this burden; the purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale took it subject to this charge. If there had been a Court of Chancery here, the creditors would have obtained a decree for a sale of the estate devised to <em>Benjamin, </em>and only on a deficiency could any other property be resorted to. As between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>the devisees and legatees, the residuary estate real and personal is exempt from the payment of debts, and specifically appropriated to the payment of the funeral expenses and legacies. The purchaser at sheriff's sale had notice of the debt, for judgment had been obtained: it was in its nature a schedule, and he took the estate subject to it. Having here bought at sheriff\u2019s sale, the estate discharged by the testator, shall he hold it in satisfaction of that which he was bound to pay? I think not. Every principle of justice, every rule of equity, forbids this. He stands now in the shoes of <em>Benjamin; </em>he is the owner of both estates. Say, if you please, the legal title has vested in him; equity would decree that he should hold in trust. lie is now able to do what in equity he ought to have done \u2014 what equity would have decreed him to have done, and his purchase at sheriff\u2019s sale shall enure to that very purpose. He was bound to pay the debts, at least the land in his hands: he has paid them, by the purchase of the property: he shall not be permitted, in a Court of Equity, to hold the property so as to exclude the other devisees from the right acquired under the will from which all deduce title, by a purchase for debts which his estate ought to have discharged. He shall not be permitted to say, <em>\u201c </em>True it is, I bought my lands subject to the payment of this debt. I ought to have paid it, but I did not; because, by suffering the lands of <em>Mary </em>and <em>Deborah </em>to be sold, which I ought not to have done, I can make the estate pay my debts. I could buy it in, and discharge my own, which was properly chargeable. I can hold your lands, to discharge a debt which my own ought to have paid.\u201d Equity always supposes that to have been done which a man ought to have done, and to be done at the time he ought to have done it; and, where he is in a situation to do that which he ought to have done, it shall be supposed that he put himself in a situation for the purpose of doing it: as, here, that he bought for the use of those who ought to hold the lands discharged of those debts, for the purpose that they should so hold them.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\"><em>Lemon </em>represents <em>Benjamin: Benjamin </em>took the estate subject to the payment of these debts. <em>Lemon </em>took it so subject, for he had notice: the judgment against <em>Samuel\u2019s </em>executors, when it was sold, was notice to him. Shall he, by suffering the lands of the plaintiffs to be sold for that to which his own land was subject, and purchasing it in himself, by this manoeuvre, I call it by no harsher name, cast the burden off his own shoulders and put it on theirs, make the land pay his debt, strip the plaintiffs of their patrimony, by omitting to do that which it was his duty to have done, and thus ease himself of the burden? Equity, in that case, will say he <em>shall </em>be considered as having done this for the benefit of the estate, to carry into effect the will of the testator, and will convert him into a trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Judgment reversed, and judgment to be entered for the plaintiffs in error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
