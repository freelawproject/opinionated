At the same time, one <em>Byer </em>owed a debt to <em>Walter Fortune, </em>and it was arranged between the three parties, that <em>Byer </em>should give to <em>Ormsby </em>and <em>Doane, </em>his <em>(Byer\u2019s) </em>promissory note, payable at sixty days: which was done under this agreement, that the note of <em>Byer </em>was to be in payment of the note of <em>Fortune </em>to <em>Ormsby </em>and <em>Doane, in case it should be paid at ma</em>turityr. <em>Byer </em>never paid this note. Demand .was duly made, and a protest for non-payment. No suit was brought against <em>Byer; </em>but <em>Orrnsy </em>and <em>Doane </em>proceeded with their suit against <em>Fortune, </em>and in two or three years obtained a verdict and judgment against him. There was no proof of notice by <em>Ormsby </em>and <em>Doane, to Fortune, </em>of <em>Byer's </em>neglect to pay, nor of his insolvency, \u2014 rior have they ever given up, or offered to give up the note itself to <em>Fortune. </em>For that neglect of notice, and for not using diligence to procure payment from <em>Byer, </em>this special action upon the case is brought by <em>Fortune, </em>alleging as a grievance the loss to him of the debt clue from <em>Byer. </em>On the trial, he offered proof for the purpose of showing that <em>Byer </em>was able to pay. On the other side, proof was offered for the purpose of showing <em>Byer </em>to have been at the time insolvent. It was also contended, on the same side, ' that the law did not require any notice in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">The evidence given on the trial is brought up with the record, and is not material in any other view, than as it is connected with the charge of the court. Judging only from the record, the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>would appear to be strong to establish the fact of <em>Byer\u2019s </em>insolvency: except that <em>Byer </em>himself, whose deposition was taken, proved that he offered to <em>Ormsby </em>and <em>Doane, </em>to pay them the note in merchandize, and that he made another, offer to <em>Fortune </em>to pay in the same way, provided his note was given back to him. His ability to pay was denied by other witnesses. To the same purport, sundry judgments against him, previous to the note and since, and yet unpaid, were produced from the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The court left the facts fully to the jury. They said that if <em>Byer </em>was insolvent, the defendants were not bound to hazard the costs of a law suit against him. In this, it is apprehended, they were clearly right. An error is alleged in the court\u2019s omission to charge the jury relative to the conclusive effect of the former verdict and judgment, against <em>W. Fortune, </em>in the suit on the first note, between the same parties about the same matter. This omission of the court is not error. Their attention was not called to that point. It does not appear to have been mentioned oh the trial. But in some other parts of the charge there does appear to me to be error. In it the court gave a pretty strong opinion to the jury, that <em>Ormsby </em>and <em>Doane </em>were bound to use diligence to recover the money from <em>Byer; </em>that, in order to relieve them from the imputation of laches, the proof of <em>Byer\u2019s </em>insolvency ought to be very clear; and they charged the jury, in point of law, that even if <em>Byer </em>was insolvent, yet <em>Ormsby </em>and <em>Doane </em>ought to have given notice to <em>Fortune </em>in a reasonable time, and to have returned the note. \u2022 It must be kept in mind, that the express agreement was for <em>Ormsby </em>and <em>Doane </em>to take <em>Byer\u2019s </em>note, <em>to be credited if paid when due. </em>They did not assume upon themselves, nor, in my opinion, did the law impose upon them, any trouble or risk. They demanded the money at the day which, perhaps, they were not required to do. As to restoring the note to <em>Fortune, </em>as contended for by the counsel, it had never been in <em>Fortune\u2019s </em>hands, nor was ever payable to him, nor was he upon it as indorser. Whatever might be its value to <em>Ormsby </em>and <em>Doane, </em>the note was a thing which they were not hound to part with; at any rate they were not bound to seek out the plaintiff, <em>Fortune, </em>in order to give it up. If <em>Fortune </em>wanted notice of <em>Byer\u2019s </em>insolvency, or on any subsequent event wanted the note in his own hands, he should have provided so in the agreement. Even if notice, in a case like this, were required; yet the parties all lived in the same place, and there appears to be strong proof that <em>Fortune </em>had aetual notice, not only of the non-payment, but of the insolvency; for <em>Byer, </em>his own witness, swears that, he offered to <em>Fortune </em>himself to pay the note in merchandize, provided the note was given up to him. I agree that it might have been a material advantage to <em>Fortune </em>to have an opportunity of saving the debt,-or part of it, in this way; and, if he had made this offer of <em>Byer </em>known to <em>Ormsby </em>and <em>Doane, </em>and requested that the note, apparently useless to them, might, be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>given up to him in order that he might get something for it, and they had refused without good reason, if <em>Fortune </em>had done and proved all this, what would have been the legal or equitable effect of such proof cannot now be decided; but certainly a case would have been made out very different from the present. For full authority to support the decision which the court is to give, I name the case of <em>Leas and another </em>v. <em>James, 10 Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>307. The unanimous opinion of the court, is to reverse the judgment, and award a <em>venire de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
