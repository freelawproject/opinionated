The account presented to the respondents, although duly authenticated, is not conclusive; and a jury alone is competent to determine the propriety of the charges. The remedy, in the first instance, is by action against the respondents in their corporate capacity; after which a <em>mandamus </em>to enforce the judgment, might be altogether proper: but, before the merits are determined in the usual way, an application like the present is premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-16\">Rule discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
