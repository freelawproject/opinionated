The court improperly admitted in evidence a release executed by <em>James Cochran </em>and <em>Jane Mary, </em>his wife, (the latter one of the plaintiffs in this suit, and the land being claimed in her right) to <em>James Hamilton </em>his heirs and assigns, which release was not duly acknowledged according to the provisions of the several acts of assembly in such case made and provided.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-14\">2. The court gave it in charge to the jury that the acknowledgment of the release before mentioned, was sufficient under the provisions of the act of the 3d <em>o\u00ed April, </em>1S26, to bar the recovery in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-15\">The act referred to declares, <em>\u201c </em>That no grant, bargain, sale, feoffment, deed of conveyance, lease, release, or other assurance of any lands, tenements and hereditaments whatsoever, heretofore <em>bona fide </em>made and executed by husband and wife, and acknowledged by them before some judge, justice of the peace, or other officer authorized by law within this state, or an officer in one of the <em>United States, </em>to take such acknowledgment as aforesaid before the 1st day of <em>September </em>next, shall be deemed, held, or adjudged invalid, or defective, or insufficient in law. or avoided or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>prejudiced, by reason of any informality or omission in setting forth the particulars of the acknowledgment made before such officer as aforesaid in the certificate thereof; but all and every such grant, bargain, sale, feoffment, and deed of conveyance, lease, release or other assurance, so made, executed, and acknowledg\u00e9d as aforesaid, shall be as good, valid, and effectual in law, for transferring passing and conveying the estate, right, title and interest of such husband and wife, of, in, and to the lands, tenements, and hereditaments mentioned in the same, as if all the requisites and particulars of such acknowledgment mentioned in the act to which this is supplementary, were particularly set forth in the certificate thereof, or appeared upon the face of the same.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-6\">Judge Huston having ruled the point without argument and without prejudice, for the purpose of bringing it before the court in bank, sat during the argument.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b36-7\"><em>Rogers </em>and <em>C. Champneys, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGP\">At common law the acts of a feme covert are void, and she can convey- her estate only by a deed acknowledged pursuant to the act of 1770. Here there was no separate examination and the defect not cured by the act of the 3d of <em>April,1826. Pamph. Laws of 1826,p.187 ; </em>because the case is not within it. That act was passed in consequence of certain decisions of this court, but in every case which had been decided, there was a separate examination. The act was intended to cure only an <em>informality </em>in a circumstance or particular omission, not the total want of compliance with a substantial provision of the existing acts: in this case there is no such certificate as is contemplated- by the act of 1770, under which the separate examination is of the essence of the acknowledgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-8\">But the act of 1826 is unconstitutional and void. At the passing of that act the deed of the feme being absolutely void, could not be set up by the legislature without making a conveyance for her,which was not competent for them to do. When that act passed the title was in the feme, or those who claim under her; and that title could not be divested by any subsequent legislative act. Whether she were in possession, or it had passed from her under a void conveyance, can make no difference. <em>Vanhorne </em>v. <em>Dorrance, 2 Dall. </em>304. There is no disguising the effect of this act, which transfers the property of A. to B. without his consent, and without making compensation. This is precisely the case of <em>Vanhorn </em>and Dorrance. To enable the legislature to exercise an arbitrary discretion over vested rights, would vest in them a tremendous power which it cannot be supposed the constitution ever meant to give them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-9\">The court did not hear the counsel for the appellees.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b36-10\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b36-11\">Duncan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A36\">This was an appeal from the decision of Mr. Justice Huston, at a Circuit Court held at <em>Lancaster, April, </em>1827, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>admitting in evidence the release of <em>James Cochran </em>and <em>Jane Mary, </em>his wife, on an acknowledgment of the instrument by husband and wife, of the 28th of <em>May, </em>1796, of the wife\u2019s real estate in the following <em>words: </em>\u2014 \u201c <em>James Cochran </em>and <em>Jane Mary, </em>his wife, came before me, the subscriber, one of the associate judges of the Court of Common Pleas, in and for the county of <em>Lancaster, </em>and acknowledged the within .instrument fo be their act and deed, and desired that the same might be recorded as such.\u201d And also in instructing the jury, that the release thus acknowledged was sufficient, under the provisions of the act of the 3d of <em>April, </em>1826, to bar all claim to recovery in right of the wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">It is contended, first, that this defective acknowledgment is not cured by that act. While I agree that the retrospective powers of this act are to be construed strictly, and that every law of this nature is to be construed with strictness, and not to be extended by equity beyond the words of the statute; yet I cannot agree to a construction that would defeat the end and object of the law, and I must confess it appears to me.that in words as clear as our language affords, this provision embraces every defect, cures every invalidity in the certificate of acknowledgment, where the conveyance is a <em>bona fide </em>one. The purview, the preamble, and the enacting clause, conduce to prove that it was the intention of the legislature that no acknowledgment should be held invalid, defective, or insufficient in law, by reason of any omission, formal or substantial, in not setting forth the particulars of an acknowledgment in the certificate. And my opinion is, that if the wife does acknowledge the conveyance to be her act and deed, before an officer authorized by law to take it, this acknowledgment is-sufficient, though it omit all the particulars required under the former act. It is impossible to make an enactment more expressive and comprehensive; for the naked acknowledgment is made as good, valid, and effective in law, for transferring the estate, as if all the requisites and particulars of the acknowledgment recited in the former aet had been particularly set forth in the certificate thereof, or appeared upon the face of the same. It is here to be observed, that this aet only alters defective acknowledgments before the 1st of <em>September, </em>1826.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">It is next objected, that this act is unconstitutional. The general rule is, that all laws are in their nature prospective, yet this does not prohibit the legislature from passing some laws which. have a retrospective operation. Where the laws do not impair the obligation of contracts; or are not <em>ex post facto, (ex post facto </em>relate to crimes only,) every confirmatory act is in its nature retrospective; and, in the opinion of the court delivered in <em>Underwood </em>v. <em>Lilly, </em>(10 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>101,) it is stated, <em>\u201c </em>that confirming acts are not uncommon. Deeds acknowledged defectively by femes covert, proceedings and judgments of commissioners, and justices of the peace, who were not commissioned, agreeably to the constitution, or when their power ceased on the division of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>counties until a new appointment. Retrospective laws, which only vary the remedies, divest no right, but merely cure a defect in proceedings otherwise fair, \u2014 the omission of formalities which do not diminish existing obligations, contrary to their situation when entered into. These, and several like acts, are clearly constitutional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">I have seen no reason to change that opinion. I will just add, that it is an abuse of terms to contend that this is an act divesting vested rights. Such acts would be odious and unjust, as well as unconstitutional; for it is not intended by a vested right, that it shall be a right to do wrong; to take advantage of a mere slip in form, where the transaction is a <em>bona fide </em>one; and to avoid an honest conveyance fairly acknowledged, in the hands of an <em>innocent </em>purchaser. Statutes made to confirm acts by <em>public officers </em>which would have been void for some informality, have neVer been questioned on constitutional grounds. See <em>Bond </em>v. <em>Appleton, </em>8 <em>Mass. Bep. </em>473.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">It is well that this question has been brought up so early after passing the act, to put the matter at rest, and silence the speculations, opinions, and doubts expressed even by some men in the profession, and to relieve from apprehension those <em>bona fide </em>purchasers who might otherwise have been affected by informal certificates of acknowledgments, and that the hundreds, I might say thousands, intended to be relieved from danger for this one cause, may now repose in peace under this law confirming their titles\u2014 eio man can make them afraid.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">It is the opinion of the court that the appeal be dismissed, and</p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b38-11\">Rogers, J., having been counsel in the cause, took no part in the decision.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
