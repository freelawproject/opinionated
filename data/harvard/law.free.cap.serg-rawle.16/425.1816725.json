A suit was instituted in the Court of Common Pleas of <em>Luzerne </em>county, to <em>flpril </em>Term, 1S04, in which <em>William Blackburn </em>was plaintiff, against <em>Thomas Duane, </em>defendant, and being removed to the Circuit Court', judgment was entered therein in favour of the plaintiff, on the 15th <em>oi-October, </em>1806, with stay of execution till the 1st of <em>March, </em>1807. <em>A fieri facias </em>issued to <em>December </em>Term 1807, and a <em>ca.'-sa. </em>to <em>March </em>Term, 1809, both which writs remained in the office. <em>To November </em>Perm, 1811, a <em>scire facias </em>to revive this judgment issued at the suit of <em>Mary </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number><em>Blackburn, </em>administratrix of <em>W.

A <em>fieri facias </em>was issued to <em>August, </em>1816, and land adjoining that in dispute, sold, and a <em>fieri facias </em>for residue of the debt issued on the 5th of <em>September, </em>1821, returnable to <em>November, </em>1821, which was levied on the land in controversy, and it was condemned'and valued at two thousand four hundred dollars, and sold on a <em>venditioni exponas </em>to August,-1822, to the plaintiff, <em>John Hollenback, </em>for fifty dollars; and on the 8th of <em>August, </em>1822, the sheriff made a deed to him accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-6\">. The plaintiff then gave parol evidence to prove that <em>Thomas Duane </em>made the first improvements on the land, built a house and barn about 1791, and was living on the lot before <em>October, </em>1806, when judgment was first obtained, and <em>Chahoon </em>lived there in 1806, 1807, and 1808 as his tenant, and it was admitted that <em>Chahoon </em>was not a tenant of <em>M. Hollenback.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-7\">The defendants proved that a certificate for the land in question, was, with another lot, granted on the 1 Oth of <em>November, </em>1803, to <em>Obadiah Gore, </em>that a patent issued to him for them in <em>May, </em>1805, and that on the 1st of <em>January, </em>1811, <em>O.

A deed was read from <em>Gore, </em>describing a property as bounded by the lot in dispute which was stated as belonging to <em>Thomas Duane. </em>It was further testified, that <em>Gore </em>said the patent was made to him to save some expense: that he did not dispute <em>Duane\u2019s </em>title, but <em>Duane </em>was to pay one or two hundred dollars the purchase money, or part of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-4\">The defendants requested the court to charge upon the following points:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-5\">1. That the judgment was not revived by the <em>scire facias </em>to <em>November </em>Term, 1S11, and proceedings thereon, so as to continue its lien upon the land in dispute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-6\">The court charged;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-7\"><em>George Chahoon </em>was a party to the <em>scire facias </em>to <em>November </em>Term, 1811. He appeared by his attorney, Mr. <em>Evans, </em>and the judgment rendered revived and continued the lien of the judgment against <em>Thomas Duane, </em>against the land in dispute. The great object of the act of 4th <em>o\u00ed. April, </em>179S, in requiring a <em>scire facias, </em>was to bring home notice to the terre-tenant of the intention of the judgment creditor to claim the lien of his judgment. And, if the executions previously issued cannot be regarded as sufficient for that purpose, the service of the <em>scire facias </em>on <em>George Chahoon, </em>and the proceedings thereon are.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-8\">2. That if the judgment was legally revived ag to the land in dispute by the judgment of the 2'9th of <em>October, </em>1813, yet the lien expired at the expiration of five years from that in consequence of the subsequent <em>scire facias </em>not having been served on <em>Chahoon, </em>if the jury believe he was in actual possession during the time those writs were in|the hands of the sheriff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-9\">The court charged;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-10\">After the judgment of the 29th of <em>October, </em>1813, the writs of <em>scire facias, </em>and the executions and the proceedings thereon within the five years continued the lien of the judgment, whether <em>Chahoon </em>was in the actual possession of the premises whilst the writs of <em>scire facias </em>were in the hands of the sheriff or not. The evidence is, that he was in possession from <em>May, </em>1806, until the service of the ejectment in this cause,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-11\">3. That the issuing <em>tho fieri facias </em>to <em>November </em>Term, 1821, without a revival of the judgment, was irregular, and if the jury believe that the plaintiff was the owner of the judgment or directed those proceedings, he is affected by the irregularity, and cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-12\">The court charged;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-13\">The <em>fieri facias </em>to <em>November,. </em>1821, is sustained by the previous proceedings in the case, and was therefore regular.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-14\">4th.

There is some evidence that <em>Obadiah Gore, </em>when applied to in 1806, to convey the legal estate to judge <em>Hollenback, </em>who had contracted with <em>Thomas Duane </em>for the premises, said that something was to be paid to the children of <em>John Shepard: </em>and one witness, <em>S. Tuttle, </em>deposes, that upon his application to <em>O. Gore, </em>at the instance of judge <em>Hollenback, </em>to convey the legal estate, <em>O. Gore </em>told the witness that something was to be paid to <em>John Shepard\u2019s </em>children; to the best recollection of the witness, one hundred and fifty or two hundred dollars. Before the necessity of a tender can be urged in this case, it must be satisfactorily shown that purchase money was due, and the amount thereof, that there was some person to whom the tender could have been made, and that the plaintiff is bound in equity and good conscience to pay it before he is entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-5\">5th, 6th, and 7th. That if the jury believe that no purchase money was paid by <em>Duane </em>to <em>Gore, </em>the verbal contract is not valid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-6\">That if the possession was not delivered by <em>Gore </em>to <em>Duane </em>in pursuance of the verbal contract, the contract is not valid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-7\">That if <em>Duane </em>had but an equitable interest in the land at the rendition of the judgment, and there was a conveyance of the legal title to a third person prior to the levy, the judgment is not a lien upon it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-8\">The court charged,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-9\">That if the jury believe from the evidence that <em>Duane </em>went into possession of the land in 1790 or 91, erected valuable buildings, and made other improvements, and remained in actual possession by himself and his tenants until 180S, a period of seventeen or eighteen years: that whilst he was in possession, <em>O Gore, </em>to whom the certificate and patent issued, declared that <em>Duane </em>was the owner of the premises, that he had no claim to them; that the certificate and patent were issued to him, including the premises in controversy for the purpose of saving expenses, and that he did finally purchase of <em>Duane </em>in 1807 or 1808, and that <em>Chahoon, </em>who purchased of <em>Gore, </em>was in possession of the premises as the tenant of <em>Duane, </em>at the time of the rendition of judgment: then, (as the defendants defend their possession upon the title of <em>Gore </em>alone,) evidence of the payment of the purchase money by <em>Duane </em>to <em>Gore, </em>or the delivery of possession by <em>Gore </em>to <em>Duane, </em>is not necessary to give validity to the title of <em>Duane. </em>Nor was the levy of an execution necessary to create a lien upon the land, if, as before observed, <em>Chahoon, </em>who purchased of <em>Gore, </em>was in possession of the premises as the tenant of <em>Duane </em>at the time of the rendition of the judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-10\">To this opinion of the court the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-11\">Errors were now assigned in the answers of the court to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth points, upon which the court were requested to charge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-5\"><em>Dennison, </em>for the plaintiffs in error. \u2014 The principal question is, whether the judgment in October, 1806, had not lost its lien on the land. The object of the act of the 4th of <em>April, </em>1798, (3 <em>Sm. </em>Laws, 332,) was to do away all effect of a judgment as a lien after five years. The court erred in charging, that the <em>fieri facias </em>to <em>November, </em>1811, revived the judgment as against <em>Chahoon. </em>There was no judgment on this <em>scire facias </em>against <em>Chahoon, </em>and therefore he was no way affected by the proceedings on it. <em>Coyle </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>7 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>328. The lien of a judgment expires at the end of five years from the judgment, without regard to a stay of execution not appearing on the record. <em>Black </em>v. <em>Dobson, </em>11 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>94. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>16 <em>Johns. </em>537.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-6\">There was error in the answer to the defendant\u2019s fourth point, that the purchase money due should have been tendered before suit; in saying that it was necessary to show that purchase money was due; that there was some person to whom the tender could have been made, and that the plaintiff is bound in equity and good conscience to pay it.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b429-7\"><em>Conyngham, </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMp\">As the cause has been argued, there are but two points: 1. Whether the lien of <em>Blackburn\u2019s </em>judgment against <em>Duane </em>continued or was extinct as to the property in question. 2. Whether the plaintiff could recover without a tender of the balance of the purchase money due to Judge <em>Gore.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-8\">1. In less than five years from the judgment, a <em>scire facias </em>issued against <em>Duane, </em>which was served on him and his terre-tenants, among whom was <em>Chahoon. </em>The entry was, \u201cwhereupon judgment, and judgment against <em>Duane </em>by default.\u201d By this we understand, that there was judgment in favour of <em>Hollenback </em>and his terre-tenants, for whom there had been a verdict, and judgment against <em>Duane </em>and all his terre-tenants. A judgment unreversed cannot be inquired into on account of its irregularity. <em>Colly v. Latimer, </em>5 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle, </em>211. The <em>scire facias </em>to <em>November </em>Term, 1811, which was served on <em>Chahoon, </em>gave notice to <em>Chahoon </em>that the plaintiff intended to hold this land bound; and evidence to contradict a sheriff\u2019s return is inadmissible. <em>Blythe </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>10 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>262, <em>Young </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>2 <em>Binn. </em>229, <em>Pennock </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>8 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>378, decide that an execution taken out continues the lien.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-9\">2. The question submitted to the court was, \u201cthat the purchase money due should have been tendered before the commencement of the suit.\u201d The court answered properly, that it should be clearly shown that some purchase money was due, and to whom and how much; neither of which were shown. <em>Hollenback </em>was the purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale, and could not know any thing about the purchase money.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b430-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number><em>Mallory, </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGyf\">The only exceptions are to the charge of the court: 1. Was the judgment revived, so as to continue the lien on the land in dispute. <em>Duane </em>was the owner of this house and lot; but, to save expense, it was agreed that, the certificate and patent should be included in a patent to be taken out in the name of Judge <em>Gore. </em>This was a common practice among the <em>Connecticut </em>landholders, when they took out patents from the commonwealth, under the act of assembly. How or from whom <em>Duane </em>had obtained his title, does not appear. <em>Blackburn </em>obtained judgment against <em>Duane. </em>The <em>scire facias </em>within five years gave notice to <em>Chahoon, </em>that <em>Blackburn\u2019s </em>execution was intended to preserve the lien of the judgment <em>against this property. </em>\u00a1But <em>Chahoon </em>did not purchase from <em>Duane: </em>he disclaims <em>Duane\u2019s </em>title, and stands on a purchase from Judge <em>Gore. </em>He purchased of <em>Gore </em>about five years after the judgment against <em>Duane. </em>After-wards, and within the five years, a <em>scire facias </em>was served on him: he made no plea. Why did he not <em>then </em>make defence, if he had any, on that <em>scire facias? </em>Judgment was entered by default against <em>Duane; </em>which would affect his terre-tenants so as to continue the lien against them: at least it would affect <em>Chahoon, </em>on whom the <em>scire facias </em>was served. Then the scire <em>facias </em>to <em>April, </em>1816, on which judgment was obtained, and followed by a <em>fieri facias, </em>or <em>venditioni exponas, </em>was sufficient to keep up the lien against the land held by <em>Chahoon. </em>We have sold <em>Duane\u2019s </em>right to the property held by <em>Chahoon. </em>If he had no title, we got nothing by the purchase.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-5\"><em>2. </em>As to the necessity of a <em>tender before suit? </em>The patentee, Judge <em>Gore, </em>did not say \u00e1ny thing was due to him, but that something was due to <em>Avery Gore, </em>or the children of <em>John Shepherd. </em>But whether due for'the purchase money of this land does not appear. <em>(N. B. Avery Gore </em>was the son of Judge <em>Gore, </em>and <em>Shepherd\u2019s </em>children were grandchildren of Judge <em>Gore.) </em>There was no money due to <em>Chahoon, </em>the defendant. <em>Bosler </em>v. <em>Niesley, 5 Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>355. <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>10 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, 43. </em>Even if a balance of purchase money was due, yet he had let, <em>Duane </em>into possession and therefore the purchaser under <em>Duane </em>had a right to recover the possession without tender of purchase money.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b430-6\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b430-7\">Gibson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ai7\">Under the <em>Susquehannah </em>Company, the title to the premises was in Gore,, from whom <em>Duane </em>acquired an equitable title by a parol contract in part executed by delivery of possession, and payment of a portion of the.purchase mon'ey. When the <em>Connecticut </em>claimants came to receive their titles from <em>Pennsylvania, Gore, </em>by agreement with <em>Duane, </em>obtained the patent in his own name, but in fact, as a trustee for <em>Duane. </em>The plaintiff below claims as a purchaser of the equitable title of <em>Duane, </em>at sheriff\u2019s sale; and <em>Chahoon, </em>under whom the other defendants hold. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>claims under a conveyance of the legal estate from <em>Gore: </em>so that the parties stand in the relation of <em>cestui que trust, </em>and trustee, the former demanding, and the latter resisting, a specific execution of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">In this view, it is plain that the points which were made in relation to the supposed expiration of the lien, and the revival of it in 1811, were irrelevant. This court has held that the legal estate may be bound by a judgment against one, and the equitable estate, by a judgment against another; and that the interest of either may be transferred to a purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale. Thus two purchasers, the one under a judgment against a vendor after articles for a purchase, the other under a judgment against the vendee, will stand in the relation of vendor and vendee with all the rights and remedies which those whom they represent, could have claimed or exercised against each othei\u2019. The x-eason is, that a judgment against a vendor-, binds, not only the legal estate, but the beneficial interest that remains in him, (which of course is an interest in the land to the amount of the unpaid purchase money;) and a judgment against the vendee, binds only the interest for which he has paid. The true question, thei-efore, was whether the sheriff\u2019s deed had transferred the equitable estate of <em>Duane: </em>And it undoubtedly had, even though the lien of the judgment were expired; unless indeed, <em>Duane </em>had conveyed it away previously \u2022 to the levy, which was not pretended. A purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale can be implicated in the consequences of having suffered the judgment to expire, only in a controversy with a purchaser from the debtor by a conveyance previous to the levy: in a controversy between judgment creditors, the only remaining case in which a question of the sort can arise, he cannot be implicated at ail. Much less can a party who claims not under the title' of the debtor, but adversely to it, derive an advantage from the expiration of tbe lien, it being sufficient for the purposes of the purchaser, that the sale and conveyance of the sheriff has vested in him the estate which was in the debtor at the time of the levy. In regard to these immaterial points, therefoi-e, it is unnecessary to inquire whether the direction given were erroneous in the abstract or not, as it cannot in any event be used to the prejudice of the defendant in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The regularity of the proceedings on the <em>scire facias </em>to <em>November </em>Term, 1812, may be doubted; but they are sufficient to support the execution. The writ was issued against <em>Duane </em>and \u201c terre-tenants,\u201d without naming them, which is the preferable course; and the sheriff returned that be had given notice to <em>George Chahoon, Eleazer Lake, Ager Hoyt, </em>and <em>Christian G. Voerhing, </em>without returning expressly, as he ought to have done, that they were terre-tenants in fact, much less that they were the terre-tenants of all the lands that were bound by the judgment. <em>Duane </em>was served by the present plaintiff under a special deputation; and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>at the return of the writ, judgment was signed against all by default. At the next term this judgment was set aside at the motion of Mr. <em>Evans, </em>who entered no appearance, and took no further part in the cause; and at the term succeeding, Mr. <em>Ross </em>appeared, as it is expressed, for <em>Matthias Hollenback, </em>the landlord .of <em>the </em>terretenants, and pleaded to issue, and it was found for him: Whereupon judgment was rendered on the verdict in favour of the terretenants, and, by default, against <em>Duane. The </em>plaintiff below was the party beneficially interested on the judgment, and also the purchaser under it at sheriff\u2019s sale; and the plaintiff in error availing himself of this circumstance, objects that all the defendants are not disposed of on the record, judgment not having been rendered expressly against <em>George Chahoon, </em>for whom it is said Mr. <em>Evans </em>appeared. But Mr. <em>Evans </em>did not appear at all. While the judgment by default remained in force, the cause was at an end, and no appearance could be received; and after it again became a cause depending, Mr. <em>Evans </em>did not think proper to appear. It is absurd, therefore, to speak of his motion as an appearance. <em>Chahoon </em>did not appear specially; and as he cannot be distinguished from the other defendants who appeared along with their landlord, <em>Hollenback, </em>he may be considered as disposed of by the judgment in their favour. We ought to favour every intendment in support of a judgment, rather than defeat the party on technical grounds, by laying hold on an ambiguity arising from the shortness of our entries, and the looseness of our practice: especially where, as here, no one who ought to have been heard, can be prejudiced. The persons summoned were in fact not terre-tenants; nor were they expressly returned as such, and the return was ill, as well for this cause, as for want of an averment that they were the terre-tenants of all the lands that were bound. (2 <em>Saund. </em>7, <em>n. </em>7,) for being entitled to contribution among themselves, all must be named; and, therefore, if the plaintiff attempt to name them in the writ, and omit the name of some of them, the omission may be pleaded in abatement. <em>(Ib. n. </em>10.) But they were in fact not terre-tenants, because they were only occupiers, and not owners of the fee. <em>(lb. n. </em>9.) At all events none of them was a terre-tenant to <em>Duane; </em>for none derived title from him by a conveyance subsequent to the judgment, or had an estate that was bound by it; and none else is entitled to notice on a <em>scire facias, </em>for none can interpose between a judgment creditor and his right to satisfaction by execution, but one who may be prejudiced by the judgment. <em>Hollenback </em>and those who came into possession of the premises claimed by him, had a verdict, because he derived title by a conveyance which was previous to the judgment; and <em>Chahoon, </em>although having eutered originally under <em>Duane, </em>now claims adversely by a conveyance from <em>Gore. </em>On this defective return, then, we ought not to treat as parties, persons who do not distinctly appear to have been treat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>ed as such in the court where the action was pending: nor even if they had been, ought we to favour an intendment against the regularity of the proceedings for want of disposing of them when they ought never to have been brought on the record at all. But here the most natural conclusion is, that <em>Chahoon </em>appeared and pleaded along with the tenants of <em>Hollenback.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">On the next point the judgment is to be reversed. The jury were informed that before the necessity of a tender could be urged, it ought to appear that a particular sum was due, and that there was some person to whom it might have been tendered; and further, that a tender was a condition precedent to recovery of the possession. Although this be true in the abstract, yet viewed in relation to the evidence it had a tendency to mislead. The trust was established by the admission of <em>Gore, </em>who at the same time declared that one hundred or two hundred dollars were due from <em>Duane, </em>and to go to <em>Avery Gore, </em>and <em>John Shepard\u2019s </em>children; and as these children may have been minors without a guardian, and, therefore, without capacity to receive, the jury might naturally suppose they were alluded to as persons entitled to receive, taking their capacity for granted: consequently, that the want of such capacity would excuse the tender altogether. But there was no room for uncertainty on this head. The trustee in his lifetime, or his personal representative after his death, was obviously the person to receive the purchase money, and see to its application \u2014 a matter with which the <em>cestui que trust </em>had nothing to do. The jury may also have been induced to think, that under all circumstances, the necessity of tender was not clearly established; for the court certainly treated that as a matter resting in contingency: whereas payment of the purchase money and the conveyance of the title are, in all cases where the contrary has not been stipulated, mutual conditions which the parties are bound respectively to observe before calling for a specific execution of the contract: and with us, as was held in <em>Wolfley </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>8 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle, </em>328, where the plaintiff relies on an equitable title, the tender must precede the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The remaining exception is not sustained. The original rights of the parties were given up for those which they acquired by the agreement to take out the title in a particular way. <em>Duane </em>might have contested the title before the commissioners, and if he had succeeded in obtaining the certificate and patent in his own name, <em>Gore </em>would have been concluded: but his right to do this was parted with for the terms of the agreement. Now if this right was not a doubtful one \u2014 and it certainly is far from being clear, that the original contract was within the statute of frauds \u2014 there is nothing in the point that was submitted; but even if it were doubtful, still the compromise of a doubtful right is a sufficient consideration to support an agreement. The original rights of <em>Connecticut </em>claimants have never been into as between themselves, the courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>never having gone further than to recognize a trust by agreement of the parties when the title was acquired under <em>Pennsylvania; </em>but where such a trust has been proved it has been executed according to the conditions and limitations of the contract.</p>\n<author id=\"b434-5\">Huston, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AuQ\">Blackburn obtained judgment on the 15th of Oc<em>tober, </em>1806, with a stay of execution till the 1st of <em>March, </em>1807. His administratrix issued a <em>scire facias </em>against <em>Duane </em>and the terre-tenants, to <em>November </em>Term, 1811, which was returned, served on <em>G. Chahoon </em>and several others, and served on <em>Duane </em>in <em>Oswego </em>by <em>J. H., </em>deputed for that purpose. Judgment generally opened, and a trial for defendants, terre-tenants of <em>M. Hollenback, </em>and verdict for them. It is admitted on both sides that <em>Chahoon </em>was not one of them. Judgment for them not to prejudice the plaintiff against other terre-tenants. Judgment against <em>Duane </em>by default, on the 26th of <em>October, </em>1S13. To <em>November </em>Term, 1815, a <em>scire facias </em>by <em>Blackburn\u2019s </em>administratrix against <em>Duane </em>and terretenants. This <em>scire facias </em>refers to the first judgment in 1806, and recites it: it does not notice the <em>scire facias </em>of 1811. It was returned, <em>nihil. </em>No terre-t.enants named in the writ or return. To <em>Jlpril, </em>1816, another <em>scire facias </em>between the same parties. This Writ issued on the 19th of <em>February, </em>1816. The writ is not here: it was returned <em>nihil, </em>and, on the 9th of <em>Jlpril, </em>1816, judgment. <em>Fieri facias </em>to <em>Jlugust: </em>land levied and condemned. <em>Venditioni exponas </em>to <em>Jlugust, </em>1817 \u2014 sold. <em>Fieri facias </em>to <em>November, </em>1821: levied on houses and lots in question, valued at #2,400; and, on a <em>venditioni exponas </em>to <em>Jlugust, </em>1822, sold to Ji <em>II </em>for fifty dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">It was proved, that <em>Duane </em>made the first improvement on the lot: that <em>Chahoon </em>lived there at the time of the judgment, and ever since: that <em>Chahoon </em>was <em>Duane\u2019s </em>tenant in 1S06 and 1807, till <em>Jlpril </em>1st, 1808; but never was after: that he then leased from <em>J. Gore: </em>that <em>Duane </em>demanded no rent since 1807: that the house then rented for ninety dollars, and was much improved since: that <em>Hollenback, </em>as agent'for <em>Duane, </em>settled with <em>Chahoon </em>about 1820, and demanded no rent after 1S07: that there was a suit between <em>Duane </em>and <em>Chahoon, </em>and <em>Hollenback </em>was agent for <em>Duane: </em>that <em>Hollenback </em>has paid most of this judgment to <em>Blackburn\u2019s </em>attorney: that <em>Blackburn </em>revived this judgment, had <em>scire facias </em>issued and executions: that neither <em>Blackburn </em>nor his agent had any thing to do with these <em>scire faciases </em>and executions, but expressly refused: that the judgment was now assigned to <em>Hollenback; </em>but that he, as agent for <em>Duane, </em>or for some other reason, has paid oil' the greatest part of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">It further appeared, that, under the compromising law, <em>O.Gore </em>returned this, with other property,'to the commonwealth, and received a certificate for it, and, in 1805, a patent from this state. This patent was conclusive against all commonwealth claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">It appeared that in 1806, <em>O. Gore </em>had stated to different persons, that he held the lot in question for <em>Thomas Duane., </em>and was ready <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>to convey to his assignee on receiving about two hundred dollars; but how this was due, did not'appear: it appeared the title was taken to <em>Gore </em>in pursuance of some agreement between <em>Duane </em>and <em>Gore.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">How <em>Chahoon </em>ceased to be <em>Duane\u2019s </em>tenant, and leased from Gore, was not explained: but it appeared that <em>Duane </em>never claimed any rent from <em>Chahoon </em>after he had leased from <em>Gore. </em>In 1811, <em>Chahoon </em>bought from <em>Gore.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">I lay the <em>scire facias </em>of 1811 out of the case, because no judgment was had on it against <em>Chahoon, </em>and no legal one against <em>Duane; </em>the service on him in <em>YorJe </em>state was void. If it was not, this judgment was still irregular; he should have been ruled to plead; and as no judgment was obtained-against <em>Chahoon, </em>no subsequent <em>scire facias </em>could affect Chahoon, founded on the judgment on this <em>scire facias. </em>In fact the <em>scire facias </em>in 1815 pays no regard to this, and recites the judgment in 1806.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">I think the lien of the judgment in 1806, was gone as to this lot, if <em>Chahoon </em>is a purchaser, either mediately or immediately, from <em>Duane, </em>whether <em>Duane </em>sold his equitable interest to <em>Gore, </em>and <em>Gore </em>to <em>Chahoon, </em>or whether <em>Qore </em>conveyed the legal title, <em>' </em>and he and <em>Duane </em>divided the.purchase money; but the fact that <em>Duane </em>ceased to claim or demand rent, and perhaps other facts would seem evidence of <em>Gore </em>and <em>Chahoon </em>having <em>Duane\u2019s </em>equitable interest. And if the jury should, believe <em>Chahoon </em>stands in the light of a purchaser from <em>Duane, </em>whether of a legal or equitable right, it seems to me the act equally requires that <em>scire facias </em>should be served on him, or the lien of the judgment is gone. If the <em>scire facias </em>in 1811 is still undisposed of, the whole proceedings on the subsequent <em>fi. fa. </em>of 1S15, are, at least as respects <em>Chahoon, </em>null and void, and the sheriff\u2019s sale vested no title against him in <em>J. H. </em>If the verdict and judgment for the defendant included him, he is equally safe.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">It seems to me strange to consider <em>Chahoon </em>as still the tenant of <em>Duane </em>after 1807, in opposition to positive proof that he was not, and that <em>Duane </em>did not even allege that he was. The fact whether he was a tenant or a purchaser, is necessary to be ascertained. If a tenant, as he attorned to <em>Gore </em>without the consent of <em>Duane, </em>a <em>scire facias </em>perhaps need not be served on him, bpt if <em>Duane </em>released to <em>Gore, </em>and <em>Chahoon, </em>by his direction, became the tenant of <em>Gore, </em>and afterwards his vendee, the <em>scire facias </em>must have been served on him or the lien was gone. For it is admitted he resided constantly in the bouse, in sight of the courthouse. I think it was necessary that the jury should find the fact whether he was a purchaser or not; if they found he was a purchaser, the lien is gone.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">The fate of the act of 1798, on the lien of judgments, is singular. In <em>Young </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>ah opinion of a single judge, entirely extra-judicial, made a strong impression; but it is entirely an <em>obiter </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number><em>dictum. </em>'The sheriff\u2019s deed was not acknowledged, and so far from deciding that <em>Young\u2019s </em>lien on the lots was preserved, they recommend further proceedings to bring the matter before the court in -such shape as that his right may be decided. The very point of the construction of this act came before this court, in <em>The Bank of North America </em>v. <em>Fitzsimons, 3 Binn. 342. </em>It is there said nothing can be more plain than this law. That no inconvenience will result from the law, but, on the contrary, it will promote the public Convenience.' The <em>dictum </em>of Judge Yeates was repeated again in <em>Lewis </em>and <em>Smith. </em>But in that case it was impossible to apply it to the matter before the court, for the levies were on personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">There have been several cases since, in the last of which it is said expressly the court will not decide; whether an execution will retain the lien of a judgment, except as to the lands on which it is levied.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">In <em>Young </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>the plaintiff had proceeded so irregularly, that the court refused to permit his deed to be acknowledged; there, also, the real plaintiff, the man who managed the suit, is the purchaser. At one time he notifies <em>Chahoon, </em>but obtains no judgment against him. He afterwards issues a <em>scire facias </em>on the judgment of 1806, and takes care not to notify him. He gets his judgment of <em>Duane </em>revived, leaving the suit which was to decide whether <em>Chahoon\u2019s </em>house and lot were liable, undecided. He sells in this uncertainty, and himself purchases for five hundred dollars,' property which rented at ninety dollars <em>per annum </em>ten years before, which had cost fifteen hundred dollars, and which, twelve men on their oaths have said was worth two thousand four hundred dollars. He obtains this monstrous advantage by his own misconduct. For we must suppose if he had tried his <em>scire facias </em>of 1811, and a court and jury had decided that the properly was subject to the lien, it would have sold for twenty times as much as it has been sacrificed for. I am not speaking of a case where a third person purchases at sheriff\u2019s sale; but of a case where the plaintiff or his agent purchased, after having proceeded with such irregularity as to deter prudent men from bidding against him. To make any intendment in favour of such a purchaser, would be to assist him in his oppression. For this reason, also, I think the eause ought to be reheard.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
