It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>also contained an averment of the non-payment of the money by <em>Lichtenberger </em>and of his insolvency.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-5\">It appeared from the evidence given on the trial, that in the year 1817, <em>Rudy </em>told <em>Day, </em>that he would be security no longer, and that he must push <em>Lichtenberger </em>for the money; and the several years after, <em>Day </em>had declared that <em>Rudy </em>had given him notice to push Lichtenberger, or he w'ould no longer be bail, to which he, Day, replied, <em>\u201c </em>If you wish to have <em>Lichtenberger </em>pushed, come to my house \u2014 pay me the money, and I will give you the bond, and you may push him yourself. I will not push him.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-6\">On the 7th of <em>Jipril, </em>1824, <em>Day </em>obtained judgment, upon the bond against <em>Lichtenberger, </em>who on the 16th <em>o\u00ed August, </em>1825, was discharged under the insolvent laws: at what term he became insolvent did not appear. Pie had, prior to his discharge, both real and personal property,, but was considerably indebted. When he applied for the benefit of the insolvent laws, he returned no property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-7\">The court below having charged the jury that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover the principal and interest due upon the bond, a verdict was returned accordingly; and the defendant took a writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b80-8\"><em>Gardner </em>and <em>Wadsworth, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AT2\">contended that the assignee of the bond, was bound by the nature of the covenant upon which the suit was brought, to use all the means in his power to recover the money from the principal debtor; and unless he showed that he had done so, he had no right to resort to the defendant, who was merely a surety. They cited 4 <em>Dall. 133. </em>10 <em>Johns. </em>587. 7 <em>Johns. </em>332, 339. 1 <em>Madd. Ch. </em>233. 5 <em>Johns. </em>176. 13 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>157. <em>Chitty on Bills, 130, </em>316, 317. 15 <em>Johns. </em>68.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b80-11\"><em>Barnitz </em>and <em>Durkey, contra,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AzQ\">said that this was not a case in equity, but at law. That the covenant was a positive engagement by the assignor to pay the money, and therefore the assignee was not bpund to sue the obligor. It was quite enough that he offered to permit the assignor to sue.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b80-12\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b80-13\">Rogers, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aat\">The 21st of <em>November, 1814, Jacob Lichtenberger </em>gave a bond for three hundred and fifty dollars to <em>George Rudy, </em>which <em>George Rudy </em>assigned for a valuable consideration, to <em>Frederick Day.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-14\">This is an action of covenant brought by the administrators of <em>Frederick Day, </em>on this assignment. The assignment is in the words following:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b80-15\"><em>May </em>20th 1814. \u2014 \u201cKnoiv all men by these presents, that for a valuable consideration to me in hand paid, I do hereby assign all my right, title, interest, and claim of the within bond, to <em>Frederick Day, which bond, I.stand security to the said Day for the payment of, </em>as witness my hand and seal,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>The breach assigned in the declaration is, that the said <em>George </em>did covenant and agree with the said <em>Frederick, </em>that in case the said <em>Jacob </em>should neglect and fail to pay the said sum of money due on the said bond, that he the said <em>George </em>would pay the same. The declaration, also, contains an averment of the nonpayment of the money, and of the insolvency of <em>Jacob Lichtenberger.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The question to be determined is, what is the character of the writing declared on? Is it an absolute engagement on the part- of <em>Rudy, </em>that if <em>Lichtenberger </em>neglect or fail to pay the money in a reasonable time, that he will pay it for him, or is it a conditional engagement to pay the money on the insolvency of <em>Lichtenberger? </em>It may be remarked that the latter seems to be the construction of the plaintiffs, otherwise the averment of the insolvency of <em>Lichtenberger </em>in the declaration was wholly unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">After consideration, I have no doubt of the legal construction of the assignment. It is an engagement to pay the money, on the insolvency of <em>Lichtenberger, </em>provided <em>Day </em>uses ordinary diligence for its collection. If <em>Day </em>has been guilty of gross negligence, or has not used due diligence, and in consequence the money has been lost, it would clearly be a discharge of <em>Rudy. </em>The assignment amounts to a guarantee, that if <em>Lichtenberger </em>became insolvent, \u00e1nd <em>Day </em>used due and ordinary diligence, then he would pay the amount of the money with its interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">It does not, in my apprehension, come within the scope of the eases of principal and surety, nor can I perceive a shadow of reason for considering <em>Rudy </em>as a principal debtor, and liable in the first instance to <em>Day. Rudy </em>sold <em>Day </em>the bond, and warranted the recovery of the money if due diligence was used. And this position is rather sustained than weakened by the case of <em>Hunt\u2019s Administrators </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>cited by the defendants in error. The Chief Justice says, \u201cif the note had been made by <em>Chaplin, </em>and delivered to <em>Bennet, </em>the intestate, and afterwards the defendant had been induced to guaranty the payment, it would have been necessary to consider the defendant\u2019s objection.\u201d 5 <em>Mass. R. </em>361, 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">It appears from the evidence, that <em>Lichtenberger </em>is now insolvent, but when he became so, does not appear; that <em>Day </em>refused to push him, although repeatedly requested to do so, and at the same time stated, \u201c If you wish <em>Lichtenberger </em>pushed, come to my house, pay me the money, and 1 will give you the bond, and you may push him yourself. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">This was founded on the idea, attempted to be sustained here, that <em>Rudy </em>was absolutely bound to <em>Day, </em>which it appears to me most apparent that he was not. It was the duty of <em>Day </em>to push <em>Rudy </em>in a reasonable time, and with reasonable diligence. If any loss accrued by neglect, it should be borne by <em>Day </em>and not by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number><em>Rudy. </em>He had no right to require <em>Rudy </em>to pay him in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">It is unnecessary for the court to examine the evidence particularly. It is sufficient if it be laid down, that <em>due diligence </em>to recover the money from the obligor, must be used; and 'what is <em>due diligence, </em>must always be a part of the determination of a jury upon the whole evidence submitted to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">This was the rule adopted in <em>Virginia, </em>on the covenant implied from the word assigned, which I consider as in point on the express covenant here. <em>Mackie\u2019s Executors </em>v. <em>Davis, 2 Wash. R. </em>226, since recognized and adopted by Judge Roan, in the case of <em>Berksdale </em>v. <em>Fenwick, 2 Hen. &amp; Munf. </em>113, <em>Note.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Judgment, reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
