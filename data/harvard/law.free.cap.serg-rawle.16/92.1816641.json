It was in my father\u2019s house, <em>Michael Valentine: </em>\u00cd was called over to sign it as a witness, and' <em>John Myers </em>allowed it to be his hand and seal. They had been making ?m agreement, and I was called as a witness to it. I cannot say whether he had signed it before I went in or not. He acknowledged his hand and seal. It was all written I think when I went over to them. <em>Christian Lay, Christian Snavely, </em>and Dr. <em>Wood </em>were present. On his cross examination the witness said, I cannot say whether the seal of the corporation was on it at that time or not; I have seen the /paper before often. I have been examined before. I think that nothing was written under my name at the time. If there had been any writing there, I would have signed below it. I think they had a seal there, and I saw the press. I saw the press, but cannot say whether it was there or not. I cannot say whether I saw the seal there at that time for certain, but I think I did. It is eight or nine years ago. I do not recollect whether that seal (the seal of the corporation was then exhibited to the witness,) was to the or not at that time.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-8\">After the examination of <em>Valentine, </em>the plaintiffs offered in evidence an article of agreement, dated the 29th of <em>April, </em>1817, signed, <em>John Myers, Christian Lay, </em>president, <em>Christian </em>Sna<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number><em>vely, </em>treasurer, <em>William, Wood, </em>secretary, and to which the seal of the corporation was affixed. The counsel for the defendants objected to the admission of the instrument, ,and an exception was taken to their opinion. <em>''</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-6\">When the plaintiffs bad closed their evidence, the defendants gave in evidence the record of a suit brought in the court of Common Pleas of <em>Lebanon </em>county to <em>November </em>Term, 1816, by the president, managers, and company, of the <em>Berks </em>and <em>Dauphin </em>turnpike road against <em>John Myers. Christian Suavely </em>was then called upon as a witness, and swore as follows: \u201cThe seal of the corporation was put to the instrument the same evening after <em>John Myers </em>signed the instrument. He was not present when the seal of the corporation was put on. The indenture was executed at <em>Myerstown, </em>at the house of <em>Michael Valentine. Christian </em>Lay,* <em>Lewis Reese, Christian Suavely, Samuel Jlddams, Henry Koppenhaeffer, Peter Lineweaver, William Wood, </em>and <em>Samuel Rea, </em>were present. I was not a manager, nor <em>William Wood. </em>JLbra<em>ham Raiguel </em>was there. There were two managers absent. The words \u00a3 The seal of the corporation\u2019 were written by Dr. Wood, the secretary at <em>Myerstown, </em>the same time the contract was executed. I saw <em>Myers </em>execute the agreement, also <em>Christian Lay, </em>and Dr. <em>Wood, </em>and the managers already mentioned, were in the room when they signed. I cannot say they saw them sign it. I was treasurer at that time, and keeper of the seal of the company.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-7\">. After the witness had given the evidence above stated, the plaintiffs proposed to ask him on his cross examination, \u00a3\u00a3 Whether the seal of the corporation was affixed to the contract on which this suit was founded by order and direction of the managers present at <em>Myerstown, </em>on the day the contract bears date, and at the time it was signed, as the minute of this direction appears to have been kept by the secretary of the corporation in the minute book of the corporation;\u201d to which evidence the defendants\u2019 counsel objected, but the court admitted it, and the defendants took a bill of exceptions. . \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-8\">The witness then proceeded thus: \u201c I was directed by the managers then present to affix the seal to it in the presence of <em>John Myers. </em>I mean the managers already named by me. It was agreed that I should take the agreement home and put the corporation seal to it, and Mr. <em>Myers </em>told me I should call on Mr. <em>Wright </em>and inform him that he had settled with the turnpike company, and should show him the agreement if he wanted to see it. I next day told Mr. <em>Wright </em>this. On the former trial, I said that Mr. <em>Godwin, </em>in, the presence of the managers and <em>John Myers, </em>told me to put the seal to it. I do not know whether <em>Myers </em>told me to put the seal to it or not. He assented to my taking it with me. <em>Myers </em>was next to me when I got the order and was near enough to hear it. I kept the agreement until the time of trial in <em>November, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>1817. I was employed by the company to carry on the law suit; there is a minute of it. I subpoenaed witnesses-to give evidence in the suit.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-6\">The defendants subsequently offered to prove that the original subscription for twenty-five shares was void; first, because <em>Myers </em>was drunk at the time; secondly, because no money was paid at the time of subscribing; thirdly, because the number (25) of shares was in a different handwriting; fourthly, because the company carried on the suit on the original subscription after the agreement had been entered into. The counsel for the plaintiffs objected to the evidence thus offered, except that part which relates to the former suit. The court sustained the objection, and the defendants\u2019 counsel excepted to their opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-7\">After the court had delivered their charge, the-jury were about to retire, but before the constable had been sworn, the defendant\u2019s counsel offered to send out with the jury the record of the suit of <em>November </em>Term, 1S16, No. 14, given in evidence to the court and jury, to which the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel objected, and the court having sustained the objection, the defendants\u2019 counsel excepted to their opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-8\">Among other matters, the court charged the jury, \u201cThat the company could legally enter into such an agreement with <em>John </em>Myers, as that given in evidence: that it might be entered into by a quorum of the managers, or by a committee appointed for that purpose, and whether the committee was duly appointed by a quorum of managers, and entered into the agreement, or whether a <em>quorum of </em>managers entered into it them selves, was a matter of fact for the jury, and might be proved by parol evidence, if there be no written evidence of such appointment, nor a minute made-of it in the books of the company.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-9\">To this opinion the defendant\u2019s counsel also excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-10\">On the return of the record to this court, the following errors were assigned:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-11\">1.

The court erred in not permitting the defendants below to-prove that the original subscription of <em>John Myers </em>was void, and that the plaintiffs prosecuted the suit on the original subscription after the execution of the agreement of the 29th of <em>April, </em>1817.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-14\">4.

When it does not correspond, something more is necessary. You are required to show the identity of the instrument with that declared on. Thus, the suit is brought in the name of <em>John Styles, </em>and the bond is in the name of <em>William Styles. </em>Here there would be a variance between the declaration and the evidence, and some proof would be required, to show that the bond was in fact given to <em>John Styles, </em>although it purported to be given to <em>William.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">It appears that the corporate name of the plaintiffs was, The President, <em>Company, </em>and Managers of the <em>Berks </em>and <em>Dauphin </em>Turnpike Road, and by that name the suit has been correctly brought, with the proper averments necessary to meet the peculiar situation of the cause. The agreement offered in evidence purported to <em>be, John Myers </em>with The <em>Berks </em>and <em>Dauphin </em>Turnpike Company. Without doubt, under the plea of <em>non est factum, </em>the evidence should not have been received, for this reason, that it appears to have been made with a different company, and, for aught that there appeared, there might have been two agreements of <em>John Myers </em>with entirely different incorporations. It then became necessary to give some testimony to the court, to show that there had been a mistake in the name, or misnomer, and that in truth the agreement offered in evidence was made with the company who brought the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">Without particularly stating the evidence, or saying what might be its effects before the jury, who are the ultimate judges of the fact of the execution, and the identity of the instrument declared on, I have no doubt sufficient was offered to justify the court in permitting the agreement to be made to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-12\">In the progress of the cause, a record of a suit to the <em>November </em>Term, 1816, No. 14, was given in evidence to the court and jury. I say to the court and jury, for this is expressly stated in the record, which is our only guide. The contradictory assertions of counsel can have no weight here. If the record speaks differently from the truth of the fact, it is not the fault of this court. The record <em>imports </em>verity. After the court had charged the jury, and they were about to retire to deliberate on their verdict, and before the constable was sworn, the counsel for the defendant offered to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>send out with the jury this record. This was objected to, and the court sustained the objection, to which the counsel of the defendants excepted, and have assigned it for error in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">The rule in <em>Pennsylvania, </em>as I have always understood it, is, that all papers given in evidence in the trial of a cause, except depositions, are to be sent out with the jury. The inspection of the papers is indispensable; for without it, it would in many cases be next to impossible for the jury to come to any correct conclusion. The only reason why depositions are not also sent out is, because the witnesses examined at the bar are not permitted to accompany the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The decision of the court has been attempted to be sustained by the allegation, that the evidence was given to the court under the plea of a former suit pending, and that the issues in fact and in law, were tried at the same time. The first allegation is contradicted by the record, and the second does not appear; for I cannot suppose that so irregular a practice, as the trial of both issues at the same time, has taken place in this cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">It is objected, that the evidence was improperly received, and that there was, therefore, no error in preventing the record from going out with the jury. It may be remarked, that the evidence was given without objection; but was it in time to take this exception, which is not that it was improperly received, but that the record given in evidence without objection should not have been sent out with the jury? The furthest the courts have gone, (when they found themselves in error,) is to instruct the jury to disregard the testimony. In this, there would be no injustice, as the party would have bis bill of exceptions, and would also, on a proper application to the court, have leave to supply the defect occasioned <em>by </em>the rejection of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">But was this record improper testimony? Without pretending to determine the effect of the evidence, I think it was not. One ground of defence was, that the company, after entering into the new agreement, still persisted in prosecuting the suit, which the agr\u00e9ement was intended to settle. If the jury should be of the opinion that the parties had .abandoned the new agreement, the defence would be most valid and proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">The decision of the court has also been defended, on the ground that it was contrary to a rule of court, which prohibits the parties from sending out the dockets with the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">If this clearly appeared, I should have no hesitation in saying the court were correct; for there is great inconvenience and danger in suffering the records of the court to be taken out by the jury. The party should be furnished with exemplifications of the record. As this, however, does not appear, I am constrained reluctantly, I admit, to say, that in not permitting the record to be taken out by the jury, there was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
