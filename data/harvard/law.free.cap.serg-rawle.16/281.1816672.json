He has a cabin, stable, and thirty acres of land cleared. In June, 1815, one <em>Johnstone </em>(who had bought an old improvement, which had been abandoned long before <em>Kelly </em>came to the land) having no title, induced <em>Kelly </em>to take a lease under him, for eleven years. In <em>June, </em>1815, <em>Johnstone </em>made a survey, including the land in question, at which <em>M\u2018Murray </em>was present. In <em>April, </em>1815, <em>M*Murray </em>took out a warrant for two hundred acres of unimproved land, surveyed it in <em>July, </em>1815, and obtained a patent in 1817. <em>Kelly </em>did not enter a <em>caveat. </em>Prior to 1815, <em>Kelly </em>had done some work in a piece of hollow ground, and made some heaps of brush: he was present when the deputy surveyor executed <em>M*Murray\u2019s </em>warrant on that part of the land, and objected to his taking the piece of bottomland into his survey, claimed it, and said' he had done the work. In <em>June, </em>1817, he sued <em>Abers, </em>the defendant, who had purchased from <em>Murray, </em>for hauling rails, from this place, and said he was bound by <em>Johnstone\u2019s </em>lease, to take care of the land. He said he claimed <em>Johnstone\u2019s </em>survey. It is admitted, that <em>Johnstone </em>had no title.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-15\">About the year 1833, <em>Abers </em>built a cabin near the bottom piece, and cleared twenty or thirty acres. This is the land in dispute. In 1817, there were no improvements on the land when <em>Kelly </em>claimed <em>Johnstone\u2019s </em>survey. <em>Gilland </em>purchased <em>Johnstone\u2019s </em>rights, at a sale for taxes, and <em>Kelly </em>became a tenant under him. In a suit between him and <em>Elliott, </em>one of the defendants, <em>Kelly </em>was a witness, and swore he had no interest in the suit. .</p>\n<p id=\"b281-16\">The question raised was, whether <em>Kelly </em>gave notice of his claim in time, and in a proper maimer.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>The court charged the jury, that unless <em>Kelly </em>gave notice of his claim, as an actual settler in his own right, and by virtue of his improvement and settlement, he could not recover. That it was not sufficient, that he claimed the land as the tenant of <em>John-stone.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The plaintiff, <em>Kelly, </em>claimed the land at the trial, as an aetual settler; thus having abandoned all right to a recovery, under the survey of <em>Johnstone. </em>If <em>Kelly </em>had given notice of his claim generally, it would have been properly referred to his better title by actual settlement and improvement, and this was properly left, by the court, to the jury, who have found that his notice was of a title claimed by virtue of <em>Johnstone\u2019s </em>survey, and the lease he held was <em>Johnstone\u2019s. </em>' He cannot now be permitted to say, that he was mistaken in his title; that he does not claim under <em>Johnstone, </em>but by virtue of his improvement and settlement. If this were permitted, it would enable <em>Kelly </em>to defraud <em>Abers, </em>who, no doubt, investigated <em>Johnstone's </em>claim, and found it worth nothing; and then made improvements on the land, which would be enjoyed by <em>Kelly, </em>by whose mistake or misrepresentation he was induced to expend his money and labour. If it were designed, on the part of <em>Kelly, </em>then there can be no pretence that he would have a right to recover. The laws will permit no man to. be benefited by his fraud. If it was a mistake of his bight, the maxim will apply, that when one of two innocent persons must suffer, he, who is the cause of the loss, must bear it.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Motion for a new trial overruled, and judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
