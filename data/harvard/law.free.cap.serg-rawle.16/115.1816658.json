The sheriff had sold the land of <em>William </em>Brown. After satisfying previous liens, there remained a balance of the money produced by the sale, applicable to the next judgment; which balance was claimed by <em>Johnson, </em>also by Ramsey, the parties in the issue. Each had a judgment against <em>Brown, </em>but <em>Ramsey\u2019s </em>was the elder. <em>Johnson </em>alleged that <em>Ramsey\u2019s </em>judgment had been satisfied. It appeared that the justice, from whose docket the transcript of <em>Ramsey\u2019s </em>judgment had been sent, issued an execution directed to <em>Jacob Stoner, </em>a constable. There was no return of this execution. <em>Johnson, </em>on the trial, produced the execution, and offered <em>Stoner, </em>as a witness, to prove that he, while constable, had, on that execution, seized the goods of <em>Brown, </em>and sold them at a public sale for more than enough to satisfy the judgment, and that he had paid over the debt and interest to the justice. The evidence was rejected, and a bill of exceptions taken by <em>Johnson.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b115-15\">The cause was now argued by <em>G. W.

The same objections have been relied upon in the argument here. 1st, That the evidence was in itself illegal, being by parol only. 2d. That admitting the evidence to be legal, <em>Stoner, </em>the witness, was incompetent to give it, being interested in the case, and being himself the officer who ought to put his return upon the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">1st, It would seem to me, that the question to be decided in this case, was precisely the question which would have been presented, had the contest been between <em>Samsey </em>and <em>Brown: </em>that is, had <em>Samsey </em>by action of debt or <em>scire facias </em>demanded the money appearing to be due on the face of his judgment, and <em>Brown </em>had answered, \u201cYou took your execution on this same judgment, and upon it the constable sold my goods for money enough to pay the debt and costs;\u201d offering parol proof of these allegations. It does not occur to me, what better proof he could be expected to offer. The reason appears stronger for receiving this sort of proof <em>from Johnson, </em>than from <em>Brown. </em>By no care of his could <em>Johnson </em>provide clearer evidence, having no pretence of right to intermeddle in the suit, and to call for the return of an execution to which he was a stranger. The authorities cited by the counsel for the plaintiff in error, seem to me conclusive. It was neither for <em>Brown </em>nor for <em>Johnson </em>to' see that the constable did his duty by paying over the money or making a return. Seizure of goods sufficient to pay the debt and costs, though without sale, <em>and though </em>wasted immediately by the officer, is a satisfaction of a judgment. By the old law, an <em>audita querela </em>lies if a man pay a judgment, and afterwards be taken in execution, <em>though he has no writing for the payment. </em>1 <em>Com. Dig. Audita Querela, </em>Letter A. Parol evidence was admitted to prove a levy upon a <em>fi. fa. </em>though no return had been made upon it. 1 <em>Munf. </em>269, and see <em>Com. Dig. Pleader, </em>2 <em>W. </em>36. Indeed, the directing the issue by the court below, to ascertain whether the judgment was paid or not, seems to show that <em>some </em>parol proof might be material: for, if the record only was to be loolied to, the court would have settled the contest at once by inspection. 2d. Was <em>Jacob Stoner, </em>the witness offered, incompetent from interest, or otherwise? I think not. Most clearly ho was interested against the side that called him. His admission of the sale of the goods, and of raising the money, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>is conclusive against him: adding that he paid over the debt and interest to the justice, is by no means conclusive in his favour. <em>Stoner\u2019s </em>credibility was a question for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
