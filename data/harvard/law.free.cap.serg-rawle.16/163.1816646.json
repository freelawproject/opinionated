There is no judgment for a sum certain. The judgment is for the sum due. What is that? The price of patenting two hundred, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>acres of land. It may be fourte\u00e9n dollars, or it may exceed- four hundred dollars. Whatever it was, for so much they had a lien. No suit was brought until both the parties to the mortgage were dead. Then it laid until the land was sold, and long after, until the money was paid and the deed made. In 1816, a <em>scire facias </em>issues, and a judgment is entered, without a trial, although there was a plea and issue: as this judgment was not for a specified sum, there was no right to take out execution. They seem to have had a right to some money, and in the negligent way in which theca,use is brought before us, it is entirely uncertain whether they, were paid or not. It appears the amount of the first sale went to prior liens, or rather, was ordered to be so appropriated. No prior lien is shown,, except this mortgage. If it was the only existing prior lien, it would seem they ought to have got their money from that fund, and are paid in, contemplation of law, at least so far as the amount of that sale; add they have not pretended to show whether it was or was not qqpal to their demand. , We are inclined to the opinion, that the'plaintiffs, on their own showing, could not recover, even against <em>Mien\u2019s </em>heirs, as defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-6\">If this is .the land sold to <em>Laird, </em>he has it clear of the mortgage. The mortgagee ought to have received his money.' '\u2022 He purchased in 1809. Four years afterwards he sdld to <em>Mering </em>and received-his money, and covenanted to defend against this mortgage. About \u00e1 month afterwards he gave an indemnifying bond to <em>Mering, </em>and in that'bond recited that he had bought subject to the mortgage. But the-levy-was not subject to the mortgage, nor the return of sale, nbr the deed. &gt; The defendant bought from a purchaser at sheriff\u2019s'sale.-\u2018Th\u00e9 levy was absolute \u2014 the sale absolute\u2014 the deed\u00bb absolute. \u25a0 In taking a~ security from the vendor against a rumoured incumbrance; a-month after the conveyance and payment of the money,-the bond recites that it was purchased at the sheriff\u2019s sale, subject to the , mortgage. This1 appears not to have been true in fact. No doubt it was supposed \u00bbto have been, true in law. Will this'statement, if made as a-conclusion of !law, make it so? We think not \u2014 not eveirif it was stated \u00bbby parol at the time of sale, that the purchaser would by law take subject to the mortgage. We protest against a sale by the law being any 'thing but-what the law makes it; against' a title by record being 'any thing but what the record shows it to be.\u201d <em>\u2019 ' \u25a0</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-7\">This opinion was excepted to by the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, and in this court, \u25a0Hale, for the plaintiffs in error, contended,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-8\">1. That the judgment was of s\u00fcch a character as to-sustain the execution. It has never been reversed or set aside, which is sufficient. It is objectionable, perhaps, in point of regularity, blit that cannot be taken advantage of collaterally.

As a general provision of the law, a sale on a judgment does-not devest an older mortgage; but whatever may be the difference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>of opinion on that point, a doubt has never been entertained where the purchaser agrees, as in this instance, .to take subject to the mortgage.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b166-6\">\n<em>Fisher, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-7\">1, The plaintiffs did not pretend that they were entitled to reco-. ver on the mortgage, but relied altogether on the sheriff\u2019s deed. That deed was founded on a judgment for unliquidated damages; and by the words of the act of assembly, an inquisition was a necessary preliminary to the execution. <em>2 Binn. </em>42, 86, 92. 1 <em>Str. </em>309. <em>Tid, </em>936. 11 <em>Serg.

There was no evidence that <em>Laird </em>agreed to purchase subject to the mortgage. The opinion of the judge was merely hypothetical, as to this part of the case.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b166-11\">The opinion of the, court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b166-12\">Rogers, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AmF\">I agree with'the learned judge who tried this cause, that the plaintiffs have neither proceeded regularly, nor legally. The judgment upon the <em>scire facias, (sur </em>mortgage) does not ascertain the amount claimed by the plaintiffs being merely a judgment for the sum due. The <em>scit'e facias quare executio non, </em>recites that two hundred and fifty-five pounds, ten shillings, and ten and a-half pence have been recovered, and demands execution for that sum. The defendants, instead of pleading <em>nul tiel record, </em>plead payment with leave, &amp;c., on which there is a judgment for the plaintiffs, which in strictness would be a judgment, that they have execution for the sum averred to have been recovered. The <em>levari facias </em>is clearly irregular, being for two hundred -, without stating whether it be pounds, shillings, dollars or cents. The <em>alias levari </em>is to levy on three hundred acres <em>of land, for </em>the non-payment of two hundred and fifty pounds. On these proceedings, the land in dispute was sold, and without anjr complaint from the administrators of <em>Allen, </em>or from any other person. <em>Thomas Stackpole </em>became the purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale, for the use of the heirs of <em>James Stackpole, </em>deceased. The court on motion, would have had no difficulty in setting aside these proceedings for irregularity, and the judgment would have been reversed by the Supreme Court, in error. These irregularities, however, do not render the proceedings so absolutely void, as to vest no title in the purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale. On the contrary, they are available against the present defendant until reversed, and are not to be examined in this collateral suit. <em>Henry Glassford </em>seeks to take advantage of a defect, with which he has no concern; for it is a matter of no consequence to him to whom the money arising from the sheriff\u2019s sale belongs,'whether to the mortgagee, or the judgment creditors of <em>Allen. </em>The erroneous process stands good until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>the party avoids it by error, and no person can bring a writ of error, but he who is party or privy to the record, and competent to. release it. <em>Carth. </em>148. 1 <em>Wils. </em>255. <em>Cro. E. </em>165. <em>Cro.J. </em>288. 2 <em>Saund. </em>46. <em>note b.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">As I understand this cause, the plaintiffs allege, that when the land was sold by the sheriff on the judgment, it was sold subject to the mortgage, and that there was an express understanding to that effect. That this was a condition of the sale, and so understood by the sheriff and the purchaser. If this were the <em>fact, </em>which it was for the jury to decide, it would be against equity, that the defendant should retain the land without paying the amount actually due on the mortgage. It forms a part of the purchase money; as much so as if <em>Laird </em>had paid an amount sufficient to cover the mortgage, with the additional sum of two hundred and nine dollars and fifty cents, paid for the land. He takes upon himself, the payment of the amount due in addition to the sum-paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">As it seems that this material fact was withdrawn by the judge from the jury, this is error.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">If the jury should find that there was such an agreement, the defendant can relieve himself, by paying or tendering on the trial the amount really due on the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
