He told Decamp, that if the- money tendered was not enough, he would pay the proper amount. <em>Decamp </em>said, you need make no tender, you need not count the money, I agree you have tendered enough, I will not make a title to <em>Hawthorn,\u201d </em>or words in substance the same. The tender'was made before this suit was brought. That some time before, of about the time <em>Bronson </em>was purchasing the said tract of land from <em>Decamp, </em>or paying part of the purchase money, he told the said <em>Bronson </em>he had better not purchase from <em>Decamp, </em>or pay him, as <em>Decamp </em>had sold the land to <em>Hawthorn, </em>and that <em>Hawthorn </em>would give him trouble, or turn him off the land at that time. _</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-6\"><em>John Hawthorn </em>stated, he heard <em>Thomas Bronson </em>say he knew of <em>Hawthorn\u2019s </em>claim -of his purchase, but that <em>Jacob Trout </em>had told him <em>Hawthorn </em>had given up, and that he would not have purchased but for that, and if he were put to trouble, he would blame <em>Trout </em>for it. He saw <em>Bronson </em>on this land in <em>February, </em>1824. Being cross-examined by the defendant, he stated that he lived there in <em>November, </em>1824; there.were considerable improvements; two cabins, and one end of a cabin barn: he could not say how much clear land; it might have been fifteen or twenty acres; he understood <em>Bi'onson </em>had made these improvements. Being reexamined, he stated that in <em>February, </em>1824, <em>Bronson </em>said to <em>Hawthor</em>n, I understand you are going to bring an ejectment against me:\u201d <em>Hawthorn </em>said he would have to see to himself: <em>Hawthorn </em>said, now <em>Bronson </em>you blame me for not taking <em>Decamp\u2019s </em>deed, and what have you done more than I have done? <em>Decamp </em>promised you, as he did me, to get the release of the rest of the heirs, and he has not done it.\u201d <em>Bronson\u2019s </em>reply was, Yes, we have done more, we have made a tender of the money.\u201d <em>Bronson </em>then said, 44 <em>Trout </em>had told him <em>Hawthorn </em>had given up.\u201d <em>Bronson </em>said, 44 I think you told me something like that yourself, and that you would have nothing to do with it.\u201d <em>Hawthorn </em>said, 44 it was the deed.he would have nothing to do with, without the release of the heirs.\u201d \u25a0 <em>Hawthorn </em>asked <em>Bronson, </em>44 what have you done more than I have? you paid two hundred dollars, and I paid one hundred and fifty dollars.\u201d <em>Bronson </em>said, 44 we have done more, we have tendered the money. \u201d <em>Hawthorn </em>said, 44 did I not give you warning, and tell you spt to have any thing to do with <em>Decamp: </em>you will find him a troublesome fellow.\u201d <em>Bronson </em>replied, 44 yes, you did.\u201d I cannot say they mentioned as to what time the former conversation between them, should have taken place.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-7\"><em>Samuel M\u2018Kay </em>testified, that before <em>Bronson\u2019s </em>purchase, fehe and the witness had a conversation respecting <em>Hawthornes </em>purchase, but he could not recollect the substance or amount of it; he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>could not recolleet <em>Bronson\u2019s </em>words, but he understood him he did not regard <em>Hawthorn\u2019s </em>claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-6\"><em>Thomas Templeton </em>stated, he understood that <em>Hawthorn </em>had sold to one <em>Hunter. Trout </em>seemed to manage <em>Decamp\u2019s </em>affairs. The contract between <em>Hawthorn </em>and <em>Hunter, </em>and <em>Trout </em>for <em>Decamp, </em>was disagreed to by <em>Hunter. Hawthorn </em>was to get twenty dollars, for finding a purchaser, as was indorsed on the article.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-7\">The defendant offered <em>Jacob Trout </em>as a witness; the plaintiff objected, but the court admitted, him and sealed a bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-8\"><em>Jacob Trout </em>testified, that in <em>February, </em>1822 or 1823, when the deed was shown to <em>Hawthorn, </em>he said the title was good enough. This was in <em>Graham\u2019s </em>house, and on the pavement in this town. <em>Hawthorn </em>said he had failed in his contract as to payment. <em>Hawthorn </em>advised <em>Haywood </em>to take the land, for the title was good, and he had failed in getting his money, and could not pay. <em>Hawthorn </em>\\yanted <em>Haywood </em>to take the land from <em>Decamp. </em>I told <em>Bronson </em>the thing was dead, as <em>Hawthorn </em>was cast in <em>Pittsburg. </em>I did not tell <em>Bronson </em>what took place at <em>Graham\u2019s </em>before, he bought. I made the first bargain with <em>Bronson, </em>eighteen months after the conversation at <em>Graham\u2019s. Haywood </em>was at that time at <em>Graham\u2019s.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-9\"><em>William Haywood </em>testified, that in 1819, in the fall, <em>Hawthorn </em>asked him if he heard of <em>Decamp: </em>witness said not. He said he wished he would come out and make his title; that he had a good opportunity to sell, so as to pay <em>Decamp </em>and have a handsome profit to himself, and wished me, if I had an opportunity, to send <em>Decamp </em>word. <em>Decamp </em>was out the next season, at my house: he said <em>Hawthorn </em>had a mind to give up the contract, and wished me to purchase. I agreed to meet him in <em>Mercer; </em>we did meet in <em>Mercer, </em>and <em>Hawthorn </em>was there also. I asked <em>Hawthorn, </em>if he had agreed to give up the contract. He said he had sold the land to <em>Templeton; </em>that he would go and see him; and, if he would give it up, there would be a compromise: he came back, and said <em>Templeton </em>would give it up, brought the article, and <em>Templeton </em>said, if <em>Hawthorn </em>could sell to better advantage, he was agreed he should. I told <em>Hawthorn </em>I understood he considered the title bad, and said if it would not suit him, it would not me. <em>Hawthorn </em>told the situation the title was in; that it had been sold by the Orphans\u2019 Court of Ohio, for the heirs; that it had been sold in this county two or three times for taxes; that <em>Decamp </em>had redeemed it as his land by assignment from the purchasers; that he thought all these titles put together it might make a good title; if a large improvement was put on it, it might sink the land. I asked <em>Hawthorn </em>why he did not take it, he said he could not pay; he was agreed that I should take it on that day. Mr. <em>Foster </em>came to <em>Graham\u2019s, </em>where we were, and produced certain papers which showed that the heirs were not of age, and that one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>of them was but thirteen or fourteen years of age; after we examined the papers, <em>Hawthorn </em>asked me if I would take the land: he had before this urged me to take it. I told him I would not, he said perhaps I was as safe not to take <em>it </em>\u2014 Trout was there. Being cross-examined by the plaintiff, he stated, that</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-6\">The arrangement we were attempting to make was to paya debt <em>Hawthorn </em>owed me, and also a debt <em>Decamp </em>owed me; the bargain soon broke up after the age of the heirs was discovered. <em>Decamp </em>offered to give me security for the title. <em>Haiothorn </em>did not offer or speak of giving up his title in any other way than in that arrangement with me. <em>Hawthorn </em>did not say the title was good, or that he would risk it after he saw the age of the heirs. '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-7\">It was admitted the plaintiff was to be considered as having paid one hundred and fifty dollars into court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-8\">The plaintiff requested the court to instruct the jury, 1st that if the defendant bought from <em>Decamp </em>with notice of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, he could not object to the plaintiff\u2019s recovery, for want of the purchase money being tendered to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-9\">3. That if the defendant had a knowledge of such facts and circumstances respecting plaintiff\u2019s claim to this land as might be sufficient to put a prudent man on inquiry, the defendant could not object to the plaintiff\u2019s recovery in this case for want of notice. The court charged the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-10\">In this case both parties claim under <em>George Decamp </em>by purchase from him; the defendant shows a legal title for this land by deed to himself and <em>George Shilling, </em>made and acknowledged on the 30th of <em>January, </em>1834, and recorded on the 39th of <em>September, 1824, </em>and <em>before </em>this suit was commenced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-11\">The plaintiff claims by an article of agreement without deed and without legal title. It is true that cases arise where the court will permit a plaintiff to recover land on an article of agreement or even on a parol contract if complied with.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-12\">The question to decide here is, is this such a case?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-13\"><em>Hawthorn, </em>the plaintiff, had an article of agreement dated the 10th of <em>October, </em>1818, whereon he paid one hundred and fifty dollars. On the 1st of <em>April, </em>1819, a deed was to be made, and one hundred and ten dollars paid as simultaneous acts. But no act was done by <em>Hawthorn, </em>showing a disposition to carry on the purchase, no more money paid, no possession taken; but, on the contrary, avowing himself to have become embarrassed by trade, and too poor to go on with the purchase of the land; talking of throwing up his bargain for the land, and wishing another to take it. Thus it remained, when <em>Bronson, </em>the defendant, and <em>Shilling, </em>bought the same land from <em>Decamp </em>on the 30th of <em>January, </em>1824, and got the deed. The defendant went into the woods to clear, build, and make improvements. The evidence is, that <em>Bronson, </em>in <em>November, </em>1824, when this suit was brought, had two cabin houses, the end of a barn,-and about fifteen or twenty acres of cleared land, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>had his deed recorded on the 29th of <em>September, </em>1824, and after this <em>Hawthorn </em>brings his suit; after the legal title to the land had become vested in <em>Bronson </em>and <em>Shilling. </em>He tenders one hundred and ten dollars to <em>Decamp, </em>some time in <em>September, </em>1824, but whether before or after <em>Bronson\u2019s </em>deed was recorded, does not appear.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-6\">The question for the court and jury, to decide is, does the plaintiff come into court with such a clear and pure equity that he is entitled to recover on his article against the legal title, possession and valuable improvements? We say he cannot recover the land, but should be turned to his action against <em>Decamp, </em>to recover back the money with such damages as he may be entitled to, <em>unless the jury believe there was combination between Decamp </em>and <em>Bronson to cheat and defraud Hawthorn by the purchase; and this question of fraud is the chief fact for the jury to decide. </em>The plaintiff\u2019s counsel contend there was such combination and fraud, and that there was full notice to <em>Bronson </em>of <em>Hawthorn\u2019s </em>right to the land. You \u2018will judge of the evidence on this subject connected with the law on the subject of notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-7\">1. If <em>Hawthorn </em>had got his article of agreement recorded, that would have been full notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-8\">2. If he had taken possession and made improvements, that would be notice without recording the article.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-9\">3. Or there may be actual notice of the subsisting right to the land; but this notice is not to be made out by mere implication from circumstances, nor from rumour or report, it must be made out by clear proof of actual notice. <em>The clear notice required by law, is actual, has a real form, to be established by direct proof, by a person authorized to give such notice. </em>The evidence on this subject, is the deposition of <em>J. </em>Cunningham, esq.: he does not undertake to say when that notice was given, whether when <em>Bronson </em>bought, or was about buying, or when about paying some money on his contract. And also the testimony of <em>John Hawthorn, </em>(here the judge read his testimony.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-10\">There is no proof of notice to <em>Shilling. </em>This question of notice and of fraud is for your decision, but there is so little proof of fraud in this case, that the court do not see which party is most chargeable with it; the charge may be as strongly retorted on the plaintiff. He talked of his being embarrassed and unable to go on with the purchase; pressed <em>Haywood </em>to buy; doubts being suggested to him as to title, he replies, that with all the titles together, a man that was able to go on and make improvements would make the title good. He lays back; makes no tender till <em>Bronson </em>lias improved the land, and this improved the title according to his notion, and now wishes to take it from him, thus improved and enhanced in value. He afterwards observed to <em>Haywood, </em>as to the title, \u201c May be you are as well without it;\u201d and still contends as bis excuse that the title of <em>Decamp </em>was bad. If so, why does he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>want now to take the land with so bad a title? unless it is that he conceives even the title is improved by <em>Bronson\u2019s </em>possession and improvements. The relinquishing the notion of holding <em>the land </em>on account of the badness of the title, and of the plaintiff\u2019s inability to pay for it, is a different thing from a total relinquishment of the article with <em>Decamp, </em>and of the plaintiff\u2019s rights under it. We think this attempt of the plaintiff, now to take the land, and improvements and improved title from <em>Bronson </em>without tendering a cent to him, has very little equity in it, unless you believe there was fraud or combination to cheat <em>Hawthorn; </em>in that case, there may be such an equity as to entitle the plaintiff to recover. There is no proof of notice to <em>Shilling, </em>who appeared (by the plaintiff\u2019s own showing) to be a purchaser for a valuable consideration. <em>Bronson </em>had heard of <em>Hawthorn\u2019s </em>contract, and had heard <em>it was dead, </em>and that he need not regard it. <em>If you believe that Shilling and Bronson made their purchase under the idea and belief that Hawthorn had given up the intention of holding the land, and that there was nothing unfair in their conduct, then, as they had the legal title, Hawthorn should have tendered the money to them (Bronson and </em>Shilling,) <em>and not Decamp, and he cannot recover without such tender. </em>It is material that the court know the plaintiff has another remedy and has taken a bond as security for it. If you should find for the defendant it does not preclude <em>Hawthorn </em>of his right to recover back the money he paid <em>Decamp, </em>and interest and damages if entitled to it for breach of the article. He has that remedy on the article, and a bond with <em>Trout </em>as security, which he may still pursue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-6\">To this charge the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-7\">The jury gave a verdict for the defendant, and judgment was l\u2019endered accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-8\">The following errors were now assigned:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-9\">1.

We say he was. If <em>Trout </em>had an interest in this cause, it was that the plaintiff should recover: then he offered to swear <em>against his interest, </em>in defeating the plaintiff. This verdict would be no evidence, in a suit by the plaintiff, against <em>Decamp </em>and <em>Trout, </em>on their bond. Before I speak to the errors assigned in the charge, I will read the evidence. (Mr. <em>Foster </em>then read the evidence from the record.) The plaintiff was to have paid <em>Decamp </em>one hundred' and thirty dollars in <em>JLpril, </em>1819, which he never offered to pay till <em>Septem~ ber, </em>1824. In <em>September, </em>1824, <em>T. S. Cunningham, </em>agent for the plaintiff, tendered the balance due to <em>Decamp, </em>who refused to receive.it. The defendant purchased in <em>January, </em>1824, and had made improvements in the mean time; viz. built a house and barn, and cleared twenty acres of land. - If one has trifled, or been backward in performing his part, equity will not give him a specific performance. 1 <em>Fonbl. </em>391, If, on the whole evidence, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover, this court will not reverse the judgment for a small slip of the judge, even granting there was a slip, which I do not admit. When one purchases with notice of a prior agreement to sell, the law implies a fraudulent combination between him and the vendor, and this was what the judge meant, when he said there must be evidence of a fraudulent combination. In this case, there was no notice, actual or constructive. A binding notice, must be given by one <em>interested </em>in the land. The assertion of a <em>stranger </em>is not notice. <em>Sugd. Vend. </em>490. Construe<em>tive </em>notice: what is sufficient to put a prudent man on inquiry, is constructive notice. <em>Ib. </em>492. It was a trick in the plaintiff to make a tender to <em>Decamp, </em>after he knew <em>Decamp </em>had conveyed to the defendant. 2 <em>Fonbl. </em>151, note.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-10\">Two of the errors assigned are, that the court gave no answer to certain questions. But it will appear that these questions were answered, <em>in substance, </em>in the course of the charge.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b277-11\"><em>Banks, </em>in reply, for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-12\"><em>1st Error. </em>\u2014 Competency <em>of Trout. </em>He was incompetent, because called to prove that the plaintiff had relinquished the contract with Decamp, for the performance of which, by <em>Decamps </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number><em>Trout </em>was bound in a bond to the plaintiff, as security for <em>Decamp.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-6\"><em>Charge of the Court. </em>\u2014 There was an essential error, in saying that unless there was a combination between <em>Decamp </em>and the defendant to cheat the plaintiff, he ought not to recover. <em>This </em>was a general position, which must have misled the jury; and it is not for this court to examine the evidence, and decide on which side the equity lies, or <em>whether notice was proved. </em>There was error, in saying that notice is not good, unless given by a person <em>authorized </em>to give it. <em>Per </em>Chief Justice: if notice is had <em>in any </em>way, it is sufficient. 5 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>261. 2 <em>Binn. </em>501. There was error in saying, that the not having given notice to <em>Shilling </em>would prevent the plaintiff\u2019s recovery; because <em>Shilling </em>was no party to this suit. There was error, in saying that <em>Bronson </em>had no equity in an attempt to take the land from the defendant, without any compensation, unless the jury think there was <em>combination </em>between the defendant and <em>Decamp: </em>it ought to have been said, unless the defendant purchased <em>with notice. </em>In <em>Yost </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>Judge Gibson said, that in case the legal title is purchased <em>with notice </em>of an outstanding equity, the tender of what is due by the <em>prior purchaser, </em>may be made either to the vendor, or the holder of the legal estate who purchased with notice. The judge did not say, throughout his whole charge, that the plaintiff should recover, if the defendant purchased <em>with notice. </em>There was error, in leaving two-of our questions unanswered.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b278-7\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b278-8\">Duncan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Agm\">The equitable action of ejectment, in this state, forms a considerable branch of the law. From the nature of our original titles, settlement rights, warrants, and applications, all imperfect rights, so variant in their circumstances from other countries, our courts of justice have been obliged to form a system of laws adapted to this species,of title, and accommodated to all its circumstances, and whieh perhaps could not, 'after all our experience, be changed to advantage; and which, indeed, ought not to be changed, however specious the reason might be, as it would tend to destroy all security of title, and introduce new confusion, which nothing but a steady adherence to decisions can prevent. And when to-this is added, that in general the people contract by articles for payment by instalments, and the legal title seldom made until all the purchase money is paid, and the frequent assignment of these articles, we ought not to be surprised at the numerous complicated cases which arise in our courts of law and equity; for they are courts of law and equity distributing justice by the same medium\u2014 the instrumentality of a jury. In <em>Pennsylvania, </em>equity is law. Courts give the equitable principle to the jury, as they lay down the legal principles. The facts are for the decision of the jury, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>all contested facts must be; but whether, on any state of facts found by the jury, the party is entitled to equity, and the mode, manner, and extent of relief, is for the court. If these principles were well understood and firmly acted upon* the tjtoe consumed in the trial of these vexatious causes would be, greatly shortened, and justice would be advanced. <em>\u25a0 ,.]y </em>\u2022'*N</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The rules of equity are as binding as tfkSrules of law. Applying these rules to the case under consid'eratio\u00e1j\u00ediias there been any error committed on the trial of this cause, substantial error, which has injured the plaintiff? I think there has hot, and that the plaintiff has not shown a case entitling him to call on the defendant to surrender up his possession and improvements,' the labour of years, and the title for which he has paid his money, and that whatever remedy he may have is against <em>Decamp.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">In executory contracts, such as this, time is generally an important circumstance. A vendor is not obliged to keep his property unimproved and unproductive, until it pleases the vendee to proceed. There should be no culpable dilatoriness, no backwardness, no shifting off, on his part; there should be no waiting for the rise of the lands; no catching at improvements made by subsequent innocent purchasers, who, though they may have had some notice of the contract, yet, at the same time may be informed, and have good reason to conclude, that it has be\u00e9n abandoned; given up, from inability to pay; from unwillingness to accept the title; in a country like this, where new land is plenty, and where all are in state of motion and emigration, one, after the lapse of years, would consider that the purchaser had suited himself with another place. If we had a regular Court of Chancery, proceedings by bill and answer, and, if a case like the present were brought before a Chancellor, he would without difficulty dismiss the bill, and leave the party to his remedy at law, to recover back the money from the vendor.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">From the evidence, it would appear that from the time of the first payment, until after <em>Bronson </em>and <em>Shilling\u2019s </em>purchase, payment of the money, deed, and valuable improvements, no movement was made by the plaintiff to complete the contract. He was desirous of getting rid of it; he was poor and embarrassed, and not able to pay for it, and did not like the title; and, it would seem his own opinion was that,the title, though defective, yet the owner might be improved out of it; and, when the improvements are in a state of forwardness, by <em>Bronson, </em>he steps forward, and says he will take the title, because <em>Bronson </em>has improved it, because the value of his improvements have sunk the land and improved the title.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">I do not think it necessary to travel over the whole case in detail, or to answer the minute objections made to the charge of the court; because I am satisfied, that, on the hinge on which the cause turned, the charge of the court was correct and accurate; and embraced in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>one strong and impregnable position, the whole merits of the case. \u201c The question for the court and jury,\u201d says the presiding judge, (and he could not have expressed it better,) is, <em>\u201c </em>Does the plaintiff come into court with such a clear and pure equity, that he is entitled to recover on his articles, against the legal title, possession, and improvements? We say he cannot recover the land, but should be turned to his action against <em>Decamp, </em>to recover back the money, with such damages as he may be entitled to, unless the jury believe there was a combination between <em>Decamp </em>and <em>Bronson </em>to cheat and defraud <em>Hawthorn </em>by the purchase; and this question of fraud is the chief fact for the <em>jury to </em>decide.\u201d I cannot discover the <em>scintilla </em>of equity in favour of the plaintiff\u2019s claim; it could not be, indeed, in a court of equity, that he, lying by as he did for years, not only lying by, but declaring his inability to complete the contract, the defect in the title, (the only cure for which, as he said, would be to improve the owner out of his land,) acknowledged by him, that he should, after the purchase by <em>Bronson, </em>payment of the purchase money, conveyance, and valuable improvements, pounce down upon him, and sweep all this away, even the very purchase money; for the tender to <em>Decamp was </em>nothing, the demand of the conveyance from him nothing, because <em>Bronson </em>was the notorious owner of the legal title with his deed on record; but, if he had tendered the money to him, and demanded the conveyance, I do not think that any court of equity would have compelled him to convey.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">This disposes of the whole case on the merits. There is, however, the bill of exceptions to the reception of <em>Trout </em>as a witness, which remains to be disposed of. <em>Trout </em>was a competent witness for the defendant. What interest had he in the event of the trial? If he had any, it would be in favour of the plaintiff; for if the plaintiff recovered, then he would be discharged of his liability to <em>Hawthorn. Decamp\u2019s </em>obligation would be complied with, and <em>Hawthorn </em>would have the title and the possession. But, if he did not recover in the ejectment, <em>Decamp </em>would continue responsible; so that it was clearly <em>Trout\u2019s </em>interest to sustain the plaintiff\u2019s action, and not to destroy it; because, by destroying it, it left him open to an action on the security for <em>Decamp.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
