But, in criminal cases, the writ is allowed only on cause shown; and before sentence is passed it cannot appear that the defendant may not have redress in the court below. At all events, it is time enough to permit him to arrest the course of the criminal law, when he has shown that he has suffered actual injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-15\">Writ quashed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
