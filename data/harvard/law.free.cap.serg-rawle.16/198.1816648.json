On this mortgage several payments had been made, and there were some judgments remaining a lien upon the estate of <em>William, Cook, </em>sen., deceased, part of whose estate was the land mortgaged, the whole amount of which the plaintiff consented should be deducted from the amount of the mortgage, being willing to look to the other devisees of <em>William Cook, </em>sen., for the contribution of their respective parts. As a defence to the <em>scire facias, </em>it was alleged, that the consideration of this mortgage was five tracts of land, containing in the whole about five hundred acres, and that one of them of about one hundred and fifty acres, called the <em>M'Cully </em>tract, the defendant had no title for. The plaintiff tendered and filed a deed in court for this tract. It was in evidence, that it was left out of the deed to <em>George Grant, </em>and left out of the mortgage given by him to <em>William Cook, </em>with the consent of all the parties concerned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-14\">The reasons assigned for leaving out the <em>M'Cully </em>tract were, that <em>Alexander Colt, </em>at the time of the delivery of the deed had some claim to it, and that the legal title to it was vested in <em>James Lemons, </em>the father-in-law of <em>William Cook.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-15\">The defendant offered as a witness <em>William Grant, </em>who was objected to by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel. In support ef the objection\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>they read the will of <em>Thomas Grant, </em>bearing date 12th of <em>May, </em>1815; from which it appeared, that the five tracts of land above-mentioned, were held by <em>George Grant, </em>in trust for his father, <em>Thomas Grant, </em>who had advanced all the purchase money which had been paid. He directed his executors to pay the residue of the purchase money, and that the said five tracts be subject to the general division to be made among his children, of whom <em>William, </em>the witness offered, was one. In order to remove the objection to the competency of the witness, the defendant read to the court a release, dated <em>August 25th, </em>1825, by <em>William Grant </em>and wife to his mother <em>Deborah Grant, </em>of all his interest in his father\u2019s estate, and contended that being no longer interested, he ought to be received as a witness. The court, however, rejected the witness, and at the request of the defendant\u2019s counsel, sealed a bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-6\">The plaintiff tendered to the defendant in open court a deed, dated <em>August, </em>25th, 1825, from <em>James Lemons </em>and wife to <em>George Grant, </em>for the <em>M'Cully </em>tract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-7\"><em>James Lemons </em>was then sworn, who testified that he was present when the deed and mortgage were exchanged, and the 'money paid. One reason why the <em>M\u2018Cully </em>tract was not included in the deed was, that <em>Cook </em>had previously sold part of it to <em>Alexander Colt, </em>and the witness wished a settlement with <em>Colt, </em>lest <em>Cook </em>should be prosecuted for selling the land twice. He also wished the price of the <em>M\u2018Cully </em>tract fixed in such a way that <em>Cook </em>eould not spend it. He took <em>Thomas Grant </em>out and told him, \u201che wished the money secured;\u201d but he did not recollect that <em>Grant </em>refused the deed until that tract was put in. The witness was satisfied with the sale made by <em>Cook, </em>and was present when the deed was made, and the papers securing the dower of Mrs. <em>Cook. </em>A settlement was afterwards made with <em>Colt, </em>who had begun to build a mill, and had part of the race dug. He did not know of any particular delivery of possession to <em>Grant. </em>He had nothing to do with the land since. Never rented it or received any of the proceeds. A good part was cultivated. When <em>Cook </em>sold it, to <em>Grant </em>it was leased to <em>Furman, </em>afterwards to <em>Fries </em>and <em>Gaskin. </em>After <em>Cook </em>moved to <em>Bloomsbury, </em>the witness acted for him in presence of Mrs. <em>Cook, </em>and in his absence had a power of attorney from him. He was present at a calculation made by Mr. <em>Priestly </em>and <em>John Cook, </em>in the presence of <em>George Grant </em>and <em>William Cook. </em>They were appointed by <em>George Grant </em>and the witness; at the time appointed <em>J. Priestly, John Cook, George Grant, William Cook, </em>and the witness attended. <em>William Cook\u2019s </em>mind was at that time very weak, and the witness acted for him. They went over the accounts, receipts, &amp;c., and a statement was made out by <em>J. Priestly </em>on the 16th of <em>April, </em>1821. Something was said by <em>George Grant </em>about the deed for the <em>M\u2018Cully </em>tract, and the witness said he might have it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>at any time. The witness frequently conversed with <em>George Grant </em>about the <em>M'Cully </em>tract, and said, he might have the deed for it at any time \u2014 offered it before the witnesses. He said he would not give a cent for any title that was in me. About the time that suit was commenced on the mortgage for Mrs. <em>Cook\u2019s </em>dower, after its commencement, the witness told him he ought have the title for the <em>M'Cidly </em>tract. <em>George Grant </em>told him not to give him the title, that he wanted to defeat <em>Simpson. </em>Afterwards when the witness said to him the same thing, he said, \u201c I bought no land of youN</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-6\">About the time of the arbitration in this suit with <em>Simpson, </em>the conversation took place, in which <em>Grant </em>asked the plaintiff not to make a deed. The witness then told <em>Grant, </em>be ought to have the deed for the <em>M\u2018Cully </em>tract. <em>Grant </em>told him, no \u2014 not to give it to him now; he wished to defeat <em>Perry Simpson. </em>When we were laying a plot to defeat <em>Simpson, </em>it was at the place of the arbitration; no one was present but <em>Grant, Hepburn </em>and <em>Simpson. George\u2019s </em>title was spoken of, and of the witness having the title to the <em>M'Cully </em>tract. Mr. <em>Hepburn </em>did not like to engage in it. There was no plot: he seemed to be afraid to go on with the suit. I advised him to go on, and said, he could not fail to gain it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-7\">The witness told <em>Thomas Grant </em>privately, he wished the proceeds of that tract might be secured to the wife and family of <em>William Cook: </em>he was satisfied, and the money was paid. A bond was deposited with Captain <em>Boyd </em>to secure the dower of old Mrs. <em>Cook. Thomas Grant </em>pulled out of his pocket part of <em>the </em>money. <em>George </em>had part. The witness paid one hundred and eighty-six dollars for the <em>M\u2018Cidly </em>tract. In 1811, Mr. <em>Cowden </em>swore it was worth ten dollars, and the witness thought it a high price.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-8\"><em>John Hannah </em>testified, that <em>Cook </em>told him in the winter of 1814, he had sold all his possessions in that property to <em>George Grant. </em>After <em>Cook </em>moved to <em>Bloomsbury, Lemons </em>said, that <em>William Cook </em>had been to <em>George Grant </em>to receive a payment, and he had received a payment and gone to <em>Bloomsbury, </em>and he was informed that several persons had gone from <em>Sunbury </em>after and with him, to get him to gamble, and get the money out of his hands; and it was his opinion the money would never do him any good \u2014 that there was part of the property, the title to which was in him \u2014 that if he got the mill, all the rest he was to take care of, and keep that for his wife and children. <em>Lemons </em>said he was present when the survey was made of the land sold to <em>Alexander Colt </em>\u2014 that he went along with them till they interfered with the <em>M\u2018Cidly </em>tract, and he then told them to stop.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-9\"><em>William Wilson </em>testified that he was present when <em>Cook </em>and <em>Grant </em>first made the bargain; they had concluded so far as that <em>Grant </em>offered him two thousand dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>They then went to Mr. <em>Hamilton's </em>room.

They went to <em>Hepburn </em>-to draw the article, but he would not\u2019 for fear of. the forfeiture \u2014 there \u25a0 was to be a deduction in proportion to the-quantity.wanting.

It is in evidence, that <em>James Lemons </em>was present at the delivery of the deed and mortgage; that he assented to the sale made by his son-in-law, <em>William Cook, </em>to <em>George Grant; </em>that he saw the first instalments paid by <em>Grant, </em>and bonds given for the balance. Possession of all the five tracts was taken by <em>George Grant; </em>he has held possession ever since, and a deed is now brought into court, and tendered to <em>George Grant, </em>and filed. <em>George Grant </em>recovered by a reference three hundred and twenty dollars, as a consideration for his not obtaining possession of the <em>M( Cully </em>tract as soon as he^ was entitled to it. <em>James Lemons </em>standing by, and seeing his son-in-law, <em>William Cook, </em>sell a tract of land to which he had a legal title, and, not objecting, <em>Lemons </em>would be postponed. Of this fact the jury will determine. A parol contract for the sale of land, the purchaser paying part of the purchase money, giving bonds for the remainder, and the purchaser taking possession and holding possession, is a part execution of a contract which cannot be rescinded without the consent of both parties; nor is such a case within the statute of fraud and perjuries. Upon the one hand, <em>George Grant </em>is entitled to a legal title, and the plaintiff to her money, which would be a compliance with the contract. If <em>George Grant </em>had tendered the purchase money, and demanded his title, and it had been refused to him, it would have presented a different case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-9\">The court are of opinion that the tender of\" the deed, and filing it in court., is sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to recover the purchase money. But if any legal objection could be made to the acceptance of the deed from any defect of title, or a want of proper warranty, the court could stay \u00e9xecution, and would do it until the title was completed. There has been a great fall of property since this pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>chase. It would appear that the <em>Grants </em>gave an extravagant price* for this land, and every person must commiserate their situation. But whether land rises or falls in price, the court has no power to alter the contracts of the parties; - If it was not in the power of ' the plaintiffs to make a title for the <em>M'Cully </em>tract,-the court would ' direct the jury to-deduct the value of this tract from the purchase money of the mortgage; but there was no evidence before the court but what Lemons-can make good the title; and if the deed filed in the court does not convey a good title,.the court could stay execution until every defect, ifany, is remedied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-6\">The defendant requested the court to charge the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-7\">1. That, as there-was no contract between <em>James Lemons </em>and <em>George Grant, </em>for the <em>M\u2018Cully </em>tract, there could be no part execution of contract-in the present casej and that this is not a case of partexeeution of contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-8\">. 2. That <em>James .Lemons </em>has done no act by which he would be</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-9\">bound to-convey to <em>Grant, </em>that, as- he is- not bound, <em>Grant' </em>also is not bound.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-10\">3. -The Court-are requested to state by what act or acts, if any, <em>Lemons </em>is bound to convey to <em>Grant </em>the <em>M\u2018Cully </em>tract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-11\">4; That <em>James Lemons, </em>in an ejectment, might legally recover possession of the <em>M'Cully </em>tract; nor has he done a single act that would prevent his recovery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-12\">5. That, if the jury believe that <em>Lemons </em>would not convey without settlement on <em>Cook\u2019s </em>wife,-the taking possession of <em>Grant, </em>under <em>Cook, </em>was a trespass, and no part execution of the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-13\">6. That <em>Cook </em>is nota <em>bona fide </em>contractor, and not having tendered a deed to <em>Grant, </em>during his life; and procured no title from <em>Lemons, </em>his representatives cannot recover for the <em>M\u2018Cully</em>tract; and,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-14\">7.

In every contract, there must be a reciprocity, so as to be binding on each party; and <em>Lemons, </em>by assenting to the contract made by his son-in-law, <em>William </em>Cook, with <em>George Grant, </em>is bound to convey to <em>George Grant,</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-18\">3.

If the jury believe- <em>George Grant </em>took possession of the <em>M'Cully </em>tract, by the consent of <em>Lemons </em>and <em>Cook, </em>he is not a trespasser.

The defendant\u2019s bond and mortgage were given, on a promise by <em>Cook to </em>make a conveyance in a short time, of the <em>Cully </em>tract; therefore the mortgage was void. <em>\u25a0 Lemons </em>never promised or intended to convey, unless the price of these one hundred and fifty-acres were settled on his daughter, <em>(William Cook's </em>wife,).and <em>Cook </em>refused to make a settlement. I consider this suit as being for the use of <em>James Lemons. .Lemons </em>refused to convey when the defendant-asked him. Land was then high \u2014 now it has fallen. There is said to have been a tender of conveyance of the <em>M'Cully </em>tract, before commencement of this suit. - We say, that the defendant owes but seventy dollars, independent of the price of the <em>M'Cully </em>tract.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b208-7\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b208-8\">Gibson, C. <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AiP\">William <em>Grant </em>was undoubtedly a competent witness. He had divested himself of all interest, and this is all \u25a0 that is necessary to be said in regard to the first point.</p>\n<p id=\"AMqm\">As the cause is to be tried again, it will be more useful to point out the principles on which it depends, and which appear to have been misconstrued, than to enter into an analytical examination of -the errors assigned in the opinion1 of the judge on the points made \u2022\u2018below; and, for this purpose, it is necessary to trace the features of the case as it appeared on the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"Apj3\">In 1814 <em>George Grant </em>entered into a parol agreement with <em>\u25a0 William Cook, </em>to purchase five tracts of land, at the price of sixteen thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine dollars and ninety-nine cents; and shortly afterwards, \u25a0 <em>Grant, </em>attended by his father, <em>Thomas Grant, </em>and <em>Cook, </em>attended by his wife\u2019s father, <em>James Lemons, </em>met together to execute the contract.. Four of the tracts were conveyed, and bonds and a mortgage executed for the purchase money of the whole five. Why the remaining tract was -not conveyed, will appear in the sequel. \" The mortgage recites the bonds and the conveyance of the four tracts; but nothing is \u25a0said of the fifth, denominated the <em>M\u2018Cully </em>tract, as regards which, the contract still rests.on parol: and the action is brought on the mortgage to recover the price of this last-mentioned tract, the price of the others being nearly,--if not. altogether paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-13\">Possession of the tracts conveyed, was delivered in -season, and of the <em>M\u2018Cully </em>tract some time afterwards;. <em>Grant </em>accepting a sum of money in compensation of the delay. At the trial, <em>Lemons </em>tendered a deed for the <em>M\u2018Cully </em>tract, executed by his W\u2019ife and himself, but without warranty; on-which the court charged, that the plaintiff was entitled to -recover. Evidence of other eircum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>stances, thought to be material, was given (luring the trial, and will be noticed in the course of the inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">What are the principles of the action to recover the price of land? It was formerly thought, that as the vendor wants nothing but the purch\u00e1ge money, which may be recovered in an action of debt, his remedy is exclusively at law, <em>(Sugd. Vend. </em>164,) and undoubtedly an action lies.' But, it having been thought proper to execute the contract specifically, it was supposed that justice required the remedies between the parties to be mutual, and in the same courts; consequently, a bill will be entertained to enforce payment of the purchase money. <em>(Newl. Cont. </em>91.) But, in an action on the contract, even the <em>English </em>courts take cognizance of equitable objections, <em>(Sugd. Vend. </em>178;) and, in <em>Pennsylvania, </em>where we have no separate court to control the exercise of legal rights, there is still greater reason for doing so. Accordingly, in <em>Huber </em>v. <em>Burk, </em>(11 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>238,) it was held, that an action for purchase money is in effect a bill in equity; the purchaser being at liberty, under the plea of payment, to give evidence of any circumstance that would actuate a chancellor to withhold his assistance. In the case before us, therefore, the action is to be viewed as a bill to execute a contract, already so far executed as not to be within the statute of frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">The inquiry then is, whether enough has been shown to induce a chancellor to dismiss the bill. The intrinsic evidence of the transaction, as well as the testimony of- <em>Lemons </em>himself, proves incontestibly that he, and not <em>Cook, </em>was the actual vendor of the <em>M'Cully </em>tract. He was the owner of it, and it was well known that no one else could convey it. He also exercised a superintending power over the agencj' of <em>Cook. </em>He says he <em>knew </em>of the sale, and <em>approved </em>of it; and the reason this tract was not conveyed with the others was, that <em>Cook </em>had contracted to sell it to <em>Colt, </em>and he was afraid <em>Cook </em>might be made liable for a breach of that contract. <em>But he wanted the purchase money to be settled to the separate use of his daughter, Mrs. Co.ok. </em>it was <em>Lemons, </em>therefore^ and not <em>Cook, </em>who prevented the contract from being entirely executed at the date of the mortgage. Last of all, he acted openly in the business, when <em>Cook\u2019s </em>intellects, had become loo weak to prevent him to act even ostensibly for himself. These, no doubt, are considerations for a jury; but at present I assume as a fact, which may be satisfactorily proved, that <em>Lemons </em>was the actual vendor of this particular tract; and, if this be cstablis'hed, it will be immaterial that the price of it was payable to Cook. On the other hand, it is as little to be doubted that <em>Thomas Grant, </em>the father of the defendant, was the actual purchaser. We have then a transaction between two fathers, each treating for his child; and, in equity, these al.so are parties: so that it.remains to inquire how far the acts of <em>Lemons, </em>as a vendor, will affect the plaintiff^ title to a specific performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>It is admitted that if <em>Lemons </em>and <em>Cook </em>acted throughout by direction, or with the knowledge and assent of . the defendant, the fact would furnish a triumphant answer to every objection to the action but one; and of that I shall speak in the conclusion. But the affirmative of the proposition depends almost exclusively on the testimony of <em>Lemons </em>himself, whose connexion with the cause is so intimate, whose bearing in the transaction is so equivocal, whose story implicates him in a conspiracy to defraud, and who is contradicted in material points by so many witnesses, that his testimony ought to be left to the jury, with a direction to find for the defendant, if he were thought unworthy of credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">But if <em>Cook </em>concealed the ownership of <em>Lemons, </em>and the delusion were kept up till the mortgage was executed, the plaintiff must fail. The suppression of that fact would be a positive fraud, which, according to <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>M\u2018Cullough, </em>(4 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>438,) would so infect the contract as to render it incapable of subsequent confirmation without a new consideration; and fraud in the concoction of a bargain is a decisive answer to a bill for specific performance. Where the contrary is not stipulated, a purchaser is entitled to the conveyance and the covenants of the vendor himself. Here the conveyance of the other tracts by <em>Cook,&lt; </em>contains a covenant of general warranty; and, if the parties intended that he should convey this tract also, it would be fair to infer that the deed was to contain the same covenant. The deed tendered by <em>Lemons </em>at the trial contains no covenant at all; but that is comparatively of little importance, as although the personal responsibility of <em>Cook </em>may have been an object of less value than that of <em>Lemons, </em>yet, if the defendant bargained for it, he is not bound to accept of any thing else as an equivalent. So that <em>Lemons\u2019s </em>conveyance with or without warranty, would not be an execution of the contract on the part of. the vendor.</p>\n<p id=\"A_f\">Again. If <em>Lemons </em>declared at different times, and on different' occasions, that he had bought and paid for the <em>M'Cully </em>tract, and. would keep it, that would furnish a substantial ground of objection to the action. A bill for a specific performance is an application to the discretion of the chancellor, who will not interfere where the party who seeks relief, has trifled or shown a backwardness in performing his part of the agreement, especially, if in the meantime a change has taken place in the situation of the parties, or an alteration in the value of the property. There must be no temporizing, but the plaintiff must show that he yvas always \u201cready, desirous, prompt, and eager.\u201d <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> If, since the time when the conveyance was to have been made, he has done any act inconsistent with the equitable ownership of the vendee, such as incumbering, he will be concluded; as in <em>Huber </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>(11 <em>Serg. &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number><em>Rawle, </em>238.) Laches <em>per se </em>may be an insurmountable obstacle; and the delay of even a few months has been a bar where there was an alteration of the value. (1 <em>Mad. Ch. </em>417.) If then the jury shall believe that <em>Lemons </em>withheld the title because <em>Cook </em>was a spendthrift, and would not be prevailed on to settle the purchase money to the separate use of his wife, or even if without this or any other particular motive, he declared a determination not to execute the contract, he comes too late, after <em>Cook's </em>death has removed the cause of his repugnance, to put <em>Cook's </em>wife in a situation to call for the purchase money, and compel the defendant to take the property after it has greatly depreciated.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">On the other hand, there is a circumstance which is a waiver of all delay previous to the time when it occurred. I allude to the compensation awarded to the defendant in 1817, for having been kept out of possession of this tract after the possession of the others had been delivered. The acceptance of this compensation was a recognition of the contract as existing for the purpose of specific execution, but subsequent trifling or backwardness might still be set up as a defence. What passed at the settlement before Mr. <em>Priestly </em>and <em>John Cook, </em>has not been disclosed, and we are unable to judge of its effect on the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">But there is a circumstance yet to be noticed, the effect of which I take to be decisive against the plaintiff, be the knowledge and acquiescence of the defendant what they may. An action to recover dower in this tract was brought against <em>Grant, </em>by the mother of <em>Cook; </em>and, being submitted to arbitrators, came to a hearing in <em>July, </em>1822. <em>Lemons, </em>who appeared before the arbitrators, asa witness for <em>Grant, </em>distinctly swears, that he and <em>Grant </em>entered into a plot to defeat Mrs. <em>Cook, </em>by denying the right of her son, who was then dead, to sell; <em>Lemons </em>declaring his own intention never to convey. Other witnesses testify, that having appeared as a witness to disprove the estate of <em>Grant, </em>he produced his deed, and declared under the sauction of an oath, that he had bought the land, and was determined to keep it. Here, again, we find him acting a part in the business, for, his own benefit; for <em>Grant </em>would undoubtedly have been entitled to an allowance out of the purchase money, for whatever should have been recovered in the action of dower. But the circumstance, most material to the inquiry, is, that we find him declaring on oath, (hat he considered the contract at an end. The consequence is, that <em>Grant </em>and <em>Lemons, </em>having conspired to cheat an innocent person, by repudiating the contract, shall never after set it up against each other. The principle that a sham agreement, or fraudulent representation, though absolutely void as to third persons, is nevertheless binding on the parties, is as old as the law itself. A fine illustration of it, is found in <em>Montefiori </em>v. <em>Montefiori, </em>(2 <em>Bl. Rep. </em>363;) a case which bears a striking resemblance to the one before us. In an action on a promissory note, the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>fendant was not permitted to show that it had been given to serve the plaintiff\u2019s purposes, in a treaty of marriage, by giving him a false credit as a man of fortune, the balance of accounts for which the note purported to be drawn, having no existence in fact; and this because, wherever third persons collusively represent any thing in a light different from the truth, they shall be held to make it good between themselves; or, to use the emphatic language of Lord Mansfield, \u201c it <em>shall </em>be, as represented to be.\u201d The same thing in effect, was done in <em>Small </em>v. <em>Brackley, </em>(2 <em>Vern. </em>602.) And in <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Longbridge, </em>tried before Chief Justice Tilghman, at a Circuit Court for <em>Cumberland </em>county, held in <em>June </em>1807, at <em>Carlisle, </em>a judgment creditor who had delivered to his debtor a written acknowledgment of satisfaction, while the land of the latter was in execution, .and before a jury of inquiry for condemnation, was not permitted to allege that his judgment was unsatisfied. The cause was argued by able counsel, who thought proper to acquiesce in the decision. If, then, <em>Lemons </em>disaffirmed the contract, to enable <em>Grant </em>the more successfully to make a dishonest defence in the action of dower, he is <em>ipso facto </em>estopped from affirming the contrary. It seems to me this point removes all difficulty, by superseding every other inquiry; for if the jury shall believe that <em>Lemons </em>was the real party, and that he acted the part which is proved upon him by his own confession, and the testimony of witnesses, it would reflect but little credit on the administration of justice, to permit him to recover.</p>\n<judges id=\"A6X\">Duncan, J., delivered an opinion <em>contra.</em></judges>\n<judges id=\"b212-6\">Rogers, J., and Huston, J., concurred with the Chief Justice.,</judges>\n<judges id=\"AFT\">Tod, J., not having heard the argument, took no part.</judges>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
