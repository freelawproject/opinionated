As a federal civil servant, Kelliher also claimed unlawful termination under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513 and that his discharge was in violation of the Whistleblower Protection Act (\u201cWPA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302. Kelli-her initially brought his claims before the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cMSPB\u201d or \u201cBoard\u201d). He then appealed to the district court, which granted the USDA\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the discrimination claims and affirmed the MSPB determinations as to his civil service claims on the record. Kelliher appeals the court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and challenges the standard of review applied by the district court in affirming the MSPB\u2019s opinion. The question of the correct standard of review to be applied by district courts reviewing MSPB determinations for non-discrimination claims is one of first impression in this Circuit and constitutes the main issue before the court in this appeal. #</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-14\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-15\">The USDA, Food Safety Inspection Service, employed Kelliher as a Supervisory Veterinary Medical Officer (\u201cSVMO\u201d) in a poultry processing plant in Alabama. As SVMO, Kelliher was responsible for ensuring that the chickens were processed according to USDA food safety rules and regulations. The USDA terminated Kelli-her in April of 1997, citing serious shortfalls in performance, insubordination and dereliction of duty.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Kelliher alleged before the MSPB that he was actually terminated because of racial and age discrimination and in retaliation for previous calls to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>the whistleblower hotline of the USDA and filing an EEOC complaint. The MSPB found in favor of the USDA on all issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-4\">Kelliher then appealed the determination of the MSPB to the district court. Reviewing the discrimination claims de novo, the magistrate judge<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> granted summary judgment to the USDA. After examining the record of the MSPB hearing, the magistrate judge affirmed the MSPB\u2019s findings as to the civil service claims. Kel-liher asserts that the court below erred in its grant of summary judgment to USDA on the race discrimination, age discrimination, and EEOC retaliation claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Kelli-her also contends that the district court inappropriately conducted its review of the MSPB\u2019s decision as to his civil service claims. We will examine both in turn. First, however, we must determine the standard of review this court and the district court should apply in reviewing appeals from \u201cmixed cases\u201d before the MSPB.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-5\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"A3p\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703 provides for judicial review of decisions of the Merit Systems Protection Board. Generally, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction over appeals of Board determinations. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(1). In cases where certain discrimination claims are presented before the MSPB, however, the plaintiff may seek review in district court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(2). In these \u201cmixed\u201d cases where discrimination claims as well as claims not based on discrimination were both presented before the Board, the appeals are not bifurcated; instead, the district court has jurisdiction to review both the discrimination and non-discrimination claims. <em>See Doyal v. Marsh, </em>777 F.2d 1526, 1536 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-9\">The discrimination claims are then \u201csubject to trial de novo by the reviewing court.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c). Appellant contends that because the claims are treated as a unit rather than bifurcated on appeal, the same de novo standard of review should apply to all of the claims presented before the district court, not just the discrimination claims. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-10\">The de novo standard of review for discrimination claims is an exception to the general rule that MSPB determinations are reviewed on the record and set aside only if the \u201cagency action, finding or conclusion\u201d is found to be: \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>found no case law in this or any other Circuit that would require a de novo review of claims other than discrimination claims presented in a \u201cmixed case.\u201d Courts that have addressed the issue uniformly apply the de novo standard of review only to the discrimination claims while other claims adjudicated before the MSPB are reviewed on the record. <em>See Carr v. Reno, </em>23 F.3d 525, 528 (D.C.Cir.1994); <em>Washington v. Garrett, </em>10 F.3d 1421, 1428 (9th Cir.1993); <em>Johnson v. Burnley, </em>887 F.2d 471, 474 n. 1 (4th Cir.1989); <em>Barnes v. Small, </em>840 F.2d 972, 979 (D.C.Cir.1988); <em>Romain v. Shear, </em>799 F.2d 1416, 1421 n. 1 (9th Cir.1986); <em>Williams v. Dept. of the Army, </em>715 F.2d 1485, 1488 (Fed.Cir.1983); <em>Hayes v. U.S. Gov\u2019t Printing Office, </em>684 F.2d 137, 141(D.C.Cir.1982). Non-discrimination claims in \u201cmixed cases\u201d should be reviewed by district courts under the same deferential statutory standard of \u00a7 7703(c). <em>See Washington, </em>10 F.3d at 1428; <em>Johnson, </em>887 F.2d at 474 n. 1; <em>Romain, </em>799 F.2d at 1421 n. 1. Therefore, in \u00a7 7703 \u201cmixed cases\u201d the district court should try discrimination claims de novo but apply the arbitrary and capricious standard of \u00a7 7703(c) to its review of all other claims brought before the MSPB. <em>See Barnes, </em>840 F.2d at 979. On appeal we also review the findings on the nondiscrimination claims using an arbitrary and capricious standard of review. <em>See Carr, </em>23 F.3d at 528.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1295-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-6\">A. Discrimination Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-7\">The district court granted summary judgment to 'the USDA on Kelliher\u2019s Title VII and ADEA claims. We review the district court\u2019s grant .of summary judgment de novo and apply the same standards as that court. <em>See Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 </em>F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-10\">Kelliher alleges that his discharge from employment with the USDA was motivated by racism and ageism in violation \u2022 of Title VII and the ADEA. In order to prove a prima facie case of age or race discrimination a plaintiff must prove that he or she was: (1) a member of the protected class; (2) qualified for the position; (3) subjected to adverse employment action; and (4) replaced by a person outside the protected class or suffered from disparate treatment because of membership in the protected class. <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973); <em>Chapman v. AI Transport, </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1024-25 (11th Cir.2000); <em>Armstrong v. Flowers Hosp., Inc., </em>33 F.3d 1308, 1313-14 (11th Cir.1994). After the plaintiff proves a prima facie case of discrimination, the defendant need only to produce evidence that there is a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the challenged employment action. <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp., </em>411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817; <em>Chapman, </em>229 F.3d at 1024-25; <em>Armstrong, </em>33 F.3d at 1313-14. The presumption of discrimination is then rebutted and the employer is entitled to summary judgement unless the plaintiff proffers evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact that discrimination was actually the reason for the challenged action. <em>Chapman, </em>229 F.3d at 1024-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-11\">Neither party contends that Kelliher, a white male over 40, does not meet the requirements of the first three elements of a prima facie case of discrimination under both Title VII and the ADEA. The parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>disagree, however, whether or not Kelliher was \u201creplaced\u201d by a person under 40 of a different race or if younger employees of a different race were treated differently. We need not determine this issue. Assuming arguendo that Kelliher established a prima facie case of discrimination, the USDA\u2019s documented evidence of Kelliher\u2019s dereliction of duty and insubordination constituted an adequate non-discriminatory reason for his discharge.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Kelliher failed to present sufficient evidence to contradict the numerous reasons proffered by the USDA to convince this court that a genuine issue of material fact exists that the USDA\u2019s asserted reasons were a pretext to fire Kelliher because he was a white male over 40 years old.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on Kelliher\u2019s Title VII and ADEA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-4\">B. Civil Service Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-5\">Kelliher also appeals the district court\u2019s affirmance of the MSPB decision in favor of the USDA on his Whistleblower Protection Act and unlawful termination claims. ' <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8); 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513. W\u00e9 review only to ensure that the determination is (1) not arbitrary or capricious, (2) made without regard to law, or (3) not based on substantial evidence. <em>See Carr v. Reno, </em>23 F.3d 525, 528 (D.C.Cir.1994); 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-8\">1. <em>Not arbitrary or capricious</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1296-9\">In determining whether the outcome in an adjudication before an administrative agency such as the MSPB is arbitrary and capricious we do not substitute our judgment for that of the agency but rather only seek to ensure that the decision was reasonable and rational. <em>Zukas v. Hinson, </em>124 F.3d 1407, 1409 (11th Cir.1997). \u201cAlong the standard of review continuum, the arbitrary and capricious standard gives an appellate court the least latitude in finding grounds for reversal.\u201d <em>North Buckhead Civic Ass\u2019n v. Skinner, </em>903 F.2d 1533, 1538 (11th Cir.1990) (citations and internal quotations omitted). We must only \u201cconsider whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error in judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1538 (citations and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-10\">We determine that the MSPB\u2019s decision as to Kelliher\u2019s WPA claim and unlawful discharge claim was not arbitrary or capricious. The Board articulated the reasons for its fact finding decisions in its written opinion and applied those facts to the legal standards governing Kelliher\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>claims.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We find that there was no clear error in the judgment of the Board in approving Kelliher\u2019s discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-5\">As to Kelliher\u2019s WPA claim, the Board found Kelliher had established a prima facie case under the WPA. Based on the testimony presented and the documentation provided by the USDA, however, the Board found that the USDA had proven, based on clear and convincing evidence, that they would have fired Kelliher despite his whistle-blowing activity. We therefore find that the decision of the MSPB was not arbitrary or capricious.'</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-6\">2. <em>Without regard to law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1297-7\">Plaintiff also asserts that the decision of the MSPB was made without regard to law because the determination of the MSPB was not made within 120 days as required by 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.156(a). Although the 120 days may be relevant in allowing an appeal before a final decision of the Board is issued,, we can find no authority for Kelliher\u2019s assertion that it renders the decision lawless. <em>See Butler v. West, </em>164 F.3d 634, 642 (D.C.Cir.1999) (stating \u201calthough the MSPB does not lose its jurisdiction when 120 days elapse without a final decision, the appropriate federal district court can take jurisdiction as well\u201d). Furthermore, Kelliher does not contend that the delay of the Board in rendering its decision prejudiced his rights or affected the outcome of his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-11\">3. <em>Substantial evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"AOS\">When reviewing administrative decisions to determine if they are supported by substantial evidence this court examines the entire record but defers to the agency\u2019s factual determinations as long as there is relevant evidence that supports the finding as reasonable. <em>Fort Valley State Coll. v. Bennett, 853 </em>F.2d 862, 863 (11th Cir.1988); <em>City of Pompano Beach v. FAA, </em>774 F.2d 1529, 1539-40 (11th Cir.1985). This deferential standard of review means that as long as the conclusion is reasonable, we defer to the agency\u2019s findings of fact even if we could have justifiably found differently. <em>Fort Valley State Coll., </em>853 F.2d at 864, 866; <em>City of Pompano Beach, </em>774 F.2d at 1540. We do not reweigh or re-examine the credibility choices made by the fact finder. <em>Fort Valley State Coll., 853 </em>F.2d at 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-12\">We find that there was relevant evidence before the Board that supported its determinations. Affidavits, testimony, and agency records were presented that support the Board\u2019s factual findings that were the basis of its decision.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Factual findings involving contested facts were supported by credibility determinations included in the record.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>Therefore, because we conclude that the decision of the MSPB was not arbitrary or capricious, made without regard to law, or not based on substantial evidence, we affirm the decision of the MSPB as to Kelli-her\u2019s WPA and unlawful termination claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-4\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the decision of the district court in full.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1293-12\">. We see no need to describe in detail the disturbing information presented by the USDA regarding adulterated chicken carcasses that passed as fit for human consumption under Kelliher's watch. Specific facts related to our legal determinations will be cited as necessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1294-6\">. Because the parties consented to the jurisdiction of the magistrate judge for all proceedings in the case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c), the term magistrate judge and district court will be used interchangeably.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1294-7\">. Kelliher only mentioned his EEOC retaliation claim in the summary of the argument in his initial brief. Because Kelliher made no arguments on the merits as to this issue, the issue is deemed waived. <em>See U.S. v. Ardley, </em>242 F.3d 989, 990 (11th Cir.2001); <em>Greenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, </em>881 F.2d 1570, 1573 n. 6 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1294-11\">. Claims of discrimination included in 7703(b)(2) are \"section 717(c) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C.2000e-16(c)), section 15(c) of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (29 U.S.C. 633a(c)), and section 16(b)of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended (29 U.S.C. 216(b)) as applicable.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1294-12\">. On the face of the statute, \u00a7 7703(c) only applies to appeals from MSPB decisions before the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c); <em>Romain v. Shear, </em>799 F.2d 1416, 1421 n. 1 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1295-8\">.

The USDA presented seventeen non-discriminatory reasons for Kelliher\u2019s discharge including failure to maintain slaughter inspection standards on multiple occasions, insubordination in the face of direct orders, failure to perform job duties, and intimidation and mistreatment of subordinate employees. The USDA presented records, memoranda, deposition testimony, and affidavits to support each of the seventeen enumerated bases for discharge. For example, on an inspection of the facility Kelliher\u2019s supervisor found carcasses that should have been fit for human consumption but that instead contained gall stains, sores, scabs, fecal stains, and skin or other infections. In addition, Kelliher does not dispute that he ignored direct orders from his supervisor and was absent without leave from his postings on more than one occasion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1296-12\">. In fact, Kelliher\u2019s assertions that the allegations made against him are untrue and that his supervisor was out to get him present no relevant proof that his termination was in fact a pretext for race or age discrimination. In his brief in opposition to defendant's motion for summary judgement, Kelliher presented not a scintilla of evidence beyond his prima facie case to show that age or racial animus was the motivation behind his termination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1297-8\">.Specifically, the Board found that the penalty was reasonable because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-9\">[Kelliher\u2019s] neglect of duty specifications go to the heart of the agency's mission to ensure that, unwholesome fpod products do not enter the marketplace. Additionally, failure to follow instructions, and absence without leave warrant a heavy penally. Furthermore, the appellant\u2019s misconduct is aggravated by his supervisory status and the repeated and intentional nature of the offenses. I further note that the appellant has been counseled several times regarding the proper manner to accomplish his duties, and the record does not appear that he did not know how, rather it appears that he intentionally chose not to heed his supervisors' counselings, (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1297-14\">.

Specifically, the Board credited the testimony of four subordinate employees and Kel-liher's immediate and area supervisor. The MSPB also found Kelliher's theory that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>supervisor was out to get him to be completely unsubstantiated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
