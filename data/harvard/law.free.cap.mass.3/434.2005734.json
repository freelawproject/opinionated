D., </em>master, the intestate being the second mate, on the account and risk of the plaintiff, to sell the same for the most it would fetch, and invest the proceeds in such other goods as he, the intestate, should think would yield the most profit, for which he was to receive one half the net profits in lieu of freight and commissions. The outward adventure was sold at the <em>Isle of France, </em>and the proceeds carried in specie to <em>Batavia, </em>whither the plaintiff knew the ship was bound, and he was acquainted with the usages of trade there. On the ship\u2019s arrival at that place, the master of the. ship gave bond that he, his officers and crew, should conform to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>revenue laws, against the violation of which he particularly cautioned the officers and men. The risk of illicit trade at <em>Batavia </em>was very great, all commercial intercourse being confined to the masters and supercargoes of ships. The master of the ship, while on shore, sent a messenger on board for the private adventures belonging to himself, his officers and crew, to lay [ * 435 ] * out for them. All the people, except the intestate and one other officer, complied with the order, and those two, the day before the ship sailed, carried their money, including the proceeds of the plaintiff\u2019s adventure, on shore, in expectation of purchasing coffee. Not being able to procure the coffee, they were returning with the money in the boat to the ship, when the officers of the government seized it for a breach of the revenue laws, which prohibit money once landed to be brought away without a special permit from the government, and the money was lost. The defendant\u2019s intestate had been in <em>Batavia </em>with the same master before. If, upon the facts, the Court should be of opinion that the plaintiff was entitled to recover, judgment to be entered for him for 185 dollars, 85 cents; if not, he was to become nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b390-5\"><em>Story, </em>of counsel for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AxH\">being called on by the Court, observed that the principal object of the defendant in permitting nerself to be sued in this action was that, in case she was held to pay the demand, she might be protected in the payment as admin istratrix, by a judgment of the Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-6\">But he argued against the plaintiff\u2019s demand, that the intestate was guilty of no fraud in the transaction thus shown to the Court; that he was limited by no instructions, the whole being left to his discretion; that when a factor, not bound by particular instructions, acts fairly and uprightly, although he does not conform to the usual course of trade, he ought to be protected; that the plaintiff, being acquainted with the rules and usages of trade in <em>Batavia, </em>must have known that an under-officer was not permitted by the law to trade, and must, therefore, be understood to have authorized the intestate to use his own discretion, even though it should lead to an attempt iO smuggle; and when the intestate acted as he did, he acted as the plaintiff had the fullest reason to expect he would act.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b390-7\"><em>Putnam, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFBU\">cited the case of <em>Lewson </em>vs. <em>Kirie </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> in which it was decided that if goods are consigned to a factor, and upon arrival he make a false entry at the custom-house, or land them without paying the customs, whereby they become for- [ * 436 ] felted and are seized, whatever the * principal hereby suffers, the factor must inevitably make good, although his commission was general.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b390-8\"> <em>Cro.
