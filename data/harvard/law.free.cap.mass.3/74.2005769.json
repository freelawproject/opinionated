In one of the parcels thus brought, were two checks drawn by <em>Stephen Bawson </em>on the <em>Branch </em>Bank, for 550, and 300 dollars, which were instantly pronounced to be bad, and sent to the <em>Union </em>Bank, from which they were supposed to have been received, though in fact they were brought from the <em>Boston </em>Bank. The teller of the <em>Union </em>Bank received them, presuming that they had been sent from that bank, and sent their amount in money. On Tuesday, the 6th, they were again sent by the <em>Union </em>Bank to the <em>Branch </em>Bank, in part of the payment of that day, and were returned and paid for, as before. On Wednesday, the 7th, <em>Bawson, </em>the drawer of- the checks, was known to [ <em>*75 </em>] have * failed. On Thursday, the 8th, the teller of the <em>Union </em>Bank first discovered that, these checks had been originally sent on Monday, from the <em>Boston </em>Bank, of which he immediately gave information to the <em>Branch </em>Bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-6\">On Sunday, August 4th, <em>Bawson </em>embarked in a vessel for <em>Gibraltar, </em>and sailed the next morning, for the purpose of avoiding his creditors. But his absconding was not generally known until the Wednesday following, on which day the property in his store in <em>Boston </em>was attached by his creditors: which- property exceeded in value the amount of the said checks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-7\">If upon these facts it should be the opinion of the Court that the plaintiffs have a right to recover of the defendants the amount of the said checks, judgment to be entered for 850 dollars ; if otherwise, the defendants to recover their costs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b72-8\"><em>Gray, </em>for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYE\">contended that they should recover on the common principle, that money paid by mistake was recoverable by this form of action. The plaintiffs paid this money under a mistaken apprehension that the checks had been sent from their bank; and to make their case still stronger, he observed that the mistake was occasioned by an untrue averment on the part of the defendants. The rule of pleading, that he who commits the first fault shall be the sufferer, applies equally well to the common transactions between man and man. Here the defendants unquestionably made the first mistake, and in doing so, occasioned all the subsequent errors and misfortune <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark>. It was their duty to have ascertained from whom they had received the checks, and to have returned them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>accordingly. As accuracy is very essential in all bank transactions, and as these transactions are intimately connected with commerce in general, the Court will not countenance this gross negligence of the defendants, by throwing the loss, which has arisen out of it, on innocent persons.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b73-5\"><em>Otis, </em>for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3t\">objected to this demand, that the plaintiffs had been guilty of gross negligence in keeping the checks by them so long. It was unreasonable to charge the * defendants with this money now, whereas, if they had [ *76 ] immediately ascertained, as they might and ought to have done, that the checks had not been sent by them, they would have been carried to the <em>Boston </em>Bank in season to have had their amount secured from <em>Rawson, </em>whose property it appears was subject to attachment for two days after the first error took place. But by retaining them as they did, they had deprived the defendants of their remedy against the <em>Boston </em>Bank, and against the drawer <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b72-9\"> 2 <em>Wils. 100.\u2014Palmer </em>vs. <em>Stone &amp; Al., </em>1 <em>Mass.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Am_\">It appears from the case that on the 5th day of August, 1805, the <em>Union </em>Bank, being indebted to the <em>Branch </em>Bank paid their debt to the messenger of the <em>Branch </em>Bank, who had sen him to the <em>Union </em>Bank to receive it. On the return of the messenger to the <em>Branch </em>Bank with the payment he had received, the officers of that bank supposing, by mistake, that the two checks drawn by <em>Rawson </em>were received in payment from the <em>Union </em>Bank, and those checks being bad, they sent them to the <em>Union </em>Bank, who, crediting the affirmation of the <em>Branch </em>Bank, received the checks, and paid the <em>Branch </em>Bank for them. This payment was made by mistake; and the <em>Union </em>Bank may well maintain an action to recover back the money, unless they have lost their right of action by their own loches, in not seasonably detecting the mistake, or in not collecting the money due from <em>Rawson </em>on those checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">In considering the facts in the case, it appears that the messenger was the servant of the <em>Branch </em>Bank only, and that if he committed any error in his returns of payment from the several banks, the <em>Union </em>Bank is not responsible for those errors. Whatever delay there was m that bank, in not collecting the checks, arose from their confiding in the mistaken affirmation of the <em>Branch </em>Bank ; and although this confidence might be improper, yet the <em>Branch </em>Bank, whose affirmation was the occasion of it, cannot take any advantage of it, they committing the first fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Let judgment be entered for the plaintiffs, according to the agreement of the parties <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(3)\">\n<p id=\"b74-5\"> <em>[Milnes </em>vs. Duncan, 6 <em>B. &amp; C. </em>671.\u20149 <em>D. &amp; R. 731.\u2014Wilkinson </em>vs. Johnston, 5 <em>D. &amp; R. </em>403.\u20143 <em>B. &amp; C. 429.\u2014Cox </em>vs. <em>Prentice, 3 M. &amp; S. 344.\u2014Gomery </em>vs. Bond, 3 <em>M. &amp; S. 378.\u2014Shaw </em>vs. <em>Picton, </em>7 <em>D. &amp; R. </em>201.\u20144 <em>B. &amp; C. 715.\u2014Skyring </em>vs. <em>Greenwood, </em>6 <em>D &amp; R. </em>401.\u20144 B. &amp; C. 281.\u20141 Car. &amp; P. 517.\u2014Ed.]</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
