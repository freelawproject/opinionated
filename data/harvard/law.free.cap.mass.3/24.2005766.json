The plaintiff calls himself of <em>Charlotte-Town, </em>in the province of <em>Nova Scotia, </em>within the <em>British </em>dominions. The defendant is named of <em>Boston, </em>in this county. The note declared on purports to have been made at <em>Charlotte-Town, </em>June 6, 1792, for \u00a336, * <em>Halifax </em>cur- *35 rency, payable to the plaintiff in ten days from the date, and subscribed by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-11\">The defendant pleads to the jurisdiction of the Court tnat, &amp;l the time when the supposed promise was made, the p\u2019\u00e1int\u00ed\u00edf and defendant were, and still are, both aliens and subjects of the United Kingdom of <em>Great Britain </em>and <em>Ireland; </em>that the said promise, if made at all, was made at <em>Charlotte-Town, </em>aforesaid; that the cause of action accrued, if at all, at said <em>Charlotte-Town, </em>in the province of <em>Nova Scotia, </em>aforesaid, and within the jurisdiction of the courts of <em>Great Britain, </em>and not within the jurisdiction of this Court. And this he is ready to verify.

This was an action between two alien friends, upon a promise made in their own country, and brought here, upon some property of the defendant\u2019s being found here. It was submitted to the Court, after argument upon the case stated. The opinion of the Court was, that they had no jurisdiction of the action.\u2014Minot, for the plaintiff; Amory, for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-10\">In the case of <em>Walton </em>vs. <em>M'Neil, </em>the declaration was upon promises made at <em>Quebec, viz., </em>at <em>Boston. </em>The action was brought in the Circuit Court of the <em>United States, </em>holden at <em>Boston, </em>June, 1794. The defendant pleaded to the jurisdiction of the Court, that the parties were both inhabitants of <em>Quebec, </em>and that the cause of action, if any, accrued in <em>Canada, </em>and not within the <em>United States, </em>and that conu sanee thereof belonged to the courts of <em>Great Britain, </em>and not to any of the courts of the <em>United States. </em>To this plea there was a demurrer and joinder. The judgment was, \u201c that the plea in bar is good, and that the Court will take no further conusance of this suit. And that the defendant recover his costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b30-11\">In the case of <em>Fields </em>vs. <em>Taylor &amp; Al. </em>in <em>United States </em>Circuit Court, Oct. 1799, the plaintiff named himself of <em>London, </em>and the defendants of <em>Manchester, </em>both in <em>England, </em>and declared on two notes made and endorsed in <em>England. </em>Tne defendant <em>Taylor, </em>in his proper person, pleads to the jurisdiction of the Court that the causes of action accrued to the plaintiff at <em>Manchester, </em>&amp;c., and out of the jurisdiction of this Court, and that since the said notes become due, he, <em>Taylor, </em>came to <em>Boston </em>to reside, and is now there with the property only brought with him. The plaintiff, in his replication, confesses that the causes of action accrued at <em>Manchester, </em>&amp;c., bm Inasmuch as the defendant has, by his own showing since that time, come to reside in <em>Boston, </em>he prays judgment whether the Court will not take cognizance, &amp;c. And pfler hearing the parties by their counsel, the Court adjudged the plea in bar a good and sufficient answer in law to the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, and that he ought not to have or maintain his action, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-12\">It may be well to observe that these decisions in the Circuit Court were not founded on the principles of the common law, but on the limited jurisdiction of the courts of the <em>United States, </em>under the constitution and statutes thereof.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b30-5\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b30-6\">Parsons, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aa\">In the writ, the plaintiff is named of <em>Charlotte-Town, </em>in <em>Nova Scotia, </em>in the dominions of the king of <em>Great Britain, </em>and the defendant is called of <em>Boston, </em>in this county. The action is transitory, the plaintiff counting on a promise made by the defendant to him at <em>Charlotte-Town, </em>to wit, at said <em>Boston. </em>The allegations in the plea to the jurisdiction are that the parties, at the time when the promise was made, were, ever since have been, and now are, aliens and subjects of the said king; and that the cause of action, if any, accrued to the plaintiff within the jurisdiction of the courts of the said king, and not within the jurisdiction of this Court. To this plea there is a demurrer and joinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">A plea to the jurisdiction in a transitory action is proper when some court of the nation has jurisdiction of the cause of action, but not the court in which the suit is instituted. The plea must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>therefore allege that some other court of the nation has jurisdiction. But if no court has jurisdiction of the cause of action, then, by the law of the land, the action cannot be maintained ; and the defendant may avail himself of this defence under a plea which goes to the action. We are, therefore, of opinion that the plea is bad; the defence, which the defendant intended to make, not being a legal foundation for a plea to the jurisdiction in this action.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b31-7\"><em>Selfridge, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Pleas to the jurisdiction of this form have sometimes been made, and no exception being taken to the form, they have been considered upon their merits ; but they cannot be considered as a precedent of any authority. The defendant must answer farther.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">If it should appear, on a trial of the merits, which seems to be aumitted by the plea, that the defendant, after the making <em>* </em>of the contract declared on, had removed to this state, [ * 27 ] and now dwells here, the Court will decide whether, by our laws, he is protected from all suits on contracts made with his fellow-subjects before his removal <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">Defendant\u2019s plea bad.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b31-9\"> <em>Barrell </em>vs. Benjamin, 15 <em>Mass. 354.\u2014Tingley </em>vs. Bateman, 10 <em>Mass </em>343.\u2014 <em>Lawrence </em>vs. Smith, 5 <em>Mass. 362.\u2014Gardner </em>vs. <em>Barker </em>Trustees, 12 <em>Mass. </em>36-. <em>Jacob </em>&amp; <em>Al. vs. Mellen Trustees &amp; </em>14 <em>Mass. </em>132.\u2014Ed.]</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
