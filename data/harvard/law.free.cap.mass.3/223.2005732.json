This writ <em>of </em>error is brought to correct the judgment of <em>that court, </em>whose record only is certified, and not that of the justice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-15\"><em>The Court </em>granted the <em>certiorari de bene esse, </em>without giving any opinion as to the effect of it, and the cause was continued.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-16\">And now, at this term, <em>Ely </em>moves the Court to quash the writ of error, because it is brought in the name of two only of [ * 224 ] *ihe original defendants, the judgment of the Common Pleas being against three, and he cited the cases of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number><em>Brewer </em>vs. <em>Turner </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark>, <em>Walter vs. Stokoe </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark>, <em>Radcliffe </em>vs. <em>Buron </em><footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark>, and <em>Cooper </em>vs. <em>Ginger </em><footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b201-5\">\n<em>Bliss</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ak2\">thought the Court might presume the other original defendant dead, and then the writ would be right. He contended, also, that this matter ought to have been pleaded in abatement at the first term, and that at any rate it was too late in the present stage of the cause, after the defendant in error had appeared, and taken his <em>certiorari </em>upon suggesting a diminution of the record, for such a motion to be sustained.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b201-8\"> 1 <em>Sir. </em>233.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"AkP2\"> 1 <em>Ld.
