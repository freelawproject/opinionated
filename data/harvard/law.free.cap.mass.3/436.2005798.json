The declaration contained three counts: the first was a general <em>indebitatus assumpsit; </em>the second was a <em>quantum </em>meruit; and the third was for money laid out and expended. The general issue was pleaded and joined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-14\">On the trial before <em>Sewall, </em>J., at the sittings after the .ust November term in this county, a verdict was found for the * plaintiffs. The defendants excepted to the direction [ * 437 ] of the judge at the trial, which exceptions now came before the Court on the judge\u2019s report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-15\">From the report it \u2019 appears that the wife of <em>Stimpson </em>and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>three children were in <em>Salem, </em>fallen into distress, and proper objects of relief by the overseers of <em>Salem, </em>who had in fact granted the relief, the expenses of which were the subject of this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-5\">But the great question between the parties was, whether the settlement of the paupers was or was not in <em>Andover. </em>Upon this point the facts were, that <em>Elizabeth, </em>the wife of <em>Stimpson, </em>and the mother of the pauper children, is the daughter of <em>Francis Nicholson, </em>who lived at <em>Salem, </em>in October, 1775, when she was born there; that lie continued in <em>Salem </em>until the year 1779, when he removed, with <em>Elizabeth </em>and the rest of his children, to a farm in <em>Andover, </em>which he had purchased in fee simple, and on which he has ever since lived and now lives, the farm being worth 1000 dollars, at the least; but he was legally warned by <em>Andover, </em>on the 11th day of February, 1792, to leave that town ; that <em>Elizabeth </em>continued in her father\u2019s family, until she was fifteen or sixteen years of age, when she went to <em>Middleton </em>in this county, and there lived as \"a maid-servant until 1798; except a short interval, in which she lived as a servant in <em>Reading, </em>and except also a few occasional visits to her father\u2019s of a short time each, without an intention of remaining there; that during all this term she received her wages for her own use, but always considered her father\u2019s house as her home; that in the course of the year 1798 she went to <em>Salem, </em>and after a short residence with her aunt, she lived there at service about six months; after which she returned to her father\u2019s family, and continued there until the 9th of April, 1799, when she was married to <em>Stimpson; </em>and afterwards lived with him in <em>Salem, </em>where her three children were bom, but that her husband has never had any legal settlement within the state.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-6\">Upon these facts, the judge directed the jury that <em>Francis Nicholson </em>gained a legal settlement in <em>Andover, </em>in June, 1791, by force of the statute of 1789, <em>c. </em>14. That his daughter <em>Eliza- </em>[ * 438 J <em>beth </em>was then a member of his family, and * gained a settlement, which she had not lost by her subsequent marriage with <em>Stimpson. </em>For this direction of the judge, the defendants moved to set aside the verdict.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AKN\">Before the question of settlement was argued, <em>Dane, </em>counsel for the defendants, insisted that no judgment could be rendered on this verdict, because the declaration stated no legal consideration in this case; that from the report there appeared to have been no evidence of any express promise; and no consideration was alleged to support an implied promise; that, independent of any statute, the obligation of a town to reimburse any person, who had expended money in the necessary relief of the poor of that town, was a moral, and not a legal obligation; that a moral obligation was a sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>consideration to support an express promise to fulfil it, but was not a sufficient ground in law to raise an implied promise; that the remedy, if any, to which the plaintiffs were entitled, was given by the statute of 1793, c. 59, \u00a7 9; and that they should have declared specially on the statute <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark>.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b393-5\"><em>Prescott, </em>for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQ_\">admitted that the declaration was insufficient, and requested the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to consent to an amendment, as the merits of the cause would not be affected by it.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b393-10\"> <em>Atkins &amp; Al. </em>vs. <em>Banwell &amp; Al. 2 East's R. </em>505.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b393-6\">\n<em>The Court</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Ap-\">then observed that the declaration was certainly bad ; that the principle stated by the defendants\u2019 counsel was correct. A moral obligation was not a sufficient ground on which the law wrnuld imply a promise, although it was a sufficient consideration to support an express promise <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> ; that in this case,\"if the settlement of the paupers was in <em>Andover, </em>the obligation of <em>Andover </em>to reimburse <em>Salem, </em>when seasonably requested, was a legal obligation created by the statute of 1793, and was sufficient to raise a promise in law. But the declaration was insufficient, because it did not contain any averment that the settlement of the paupers was in <em>Andover, </em>nor that notice was given to that town within three months after <em>Salem </em>had begun to be at expense for their relief, for the reimbursement of which the action is brought. The declaration would be sufficient, if those averments had been made ; *for the [ * 439 ] defendants would thereby be charged with a legal obligation to reimburse the plaintiffs, whence a promise to reimburse would be implied by law. And there was another reason why these averments were necessary; for a recovery in this action by the plaintiffs was, by the 9th section of the statute before referred to, made a bar to the disputing of the settlement of the paupers in <em>Andover </em>by the defendants in any future action brought against them by the plaintiffs for the support or removal of these paupers.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">The declaration was then amended by consent of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">It is not necessary to mention the points made by the parties upon the question of settlement, nor the arguments of their counsel, as they will sufficiently appear from the opinion of the Court (the substance of which only is reported), as given by</p>\n<author id=\"b393-9\">Parsons, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AiA\">It is admitted by the counsel on each side, that <em>Elizabeth </em>gained no settlement by her marriage with <em>Stimpson, </em>as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>he never had any settlement within the state; and also that the settlement of her infant children must follow the settlement, of the mother. And it is very clear from the report that the mother has not gained any settlement in her own right; and that her settlement in <em>Salem, </em>the place of <em>her </em>birth, or elsewhere, still remains, without her having gained a settlement in <em>Andover, </em>unless her father had gained a new settlement there in his own right, and <em>Elizabeth, </em>as a child and part of his family, had acquired a derivative settlement in <em>Andover </em>through her father. This conclusion is not contested by the counsel on either side.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The question is then reduced to these points; whether <em>Francis Nicholson, </em>the father, ever gained a settlement in <em>Andover; </em>and if he did, whether <em>Elizabeth </em>was a member of her father\u2019s family at that time, and thus gained a derivative settlement with him in <em>Andover.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The counsel for the plaintiffs insist that <em>Nicholson </em>gained a settlement in <em>Andover </em>in 1779, when he purchased a freehold estate, and with his family lived on it, and has continued on it ever since; that the statute of 7 <em>Geo. </em>3, c. 3, must have a reasonable construction, and ought not to be extended so far as to authorize any town to remove a man from his freehold.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">[ * 440 ] * On the other side it has been argued that <em>Nicholson\u2019s </em>case is within the express words of that statute; for it not only declares that residence in any town for any length of time shall not gain a settlement there, unless with the approbation of the inhabitants obtained in town meeting; but further, that no town shall be obliged to support any person residing there, unless such approbation has been obtained for his dwelling there.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">The Court are strongly inclined to believe that the objection of the defendants is good ; that by force of this statute a man shall not be removed from his -freehold is a reasonable construction, but he may not gain a settlement by purchasing and living on his own freehold; for irremovability does not necessarily imply a settlement <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark>. So the statute of 1793, <em>c. </em>34, enacts that any person, having a <em>freehold estate </em>of 10 dollars per <em>annum </em>in the place where he dwells, and taking the rents and profits thereof three years successively, shall gain a settlement; but a freehold estate of less annual value will not give a settlement, although the owner may not be removable from it against his consent. But we do not think it necessary now to decide this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel has argued, that if <em>Nicholson </em>did not gain a settlement in 1779 in <em>Andover, </em>by then moving into that town <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>and living on his own freehold, yet he gained a settlement by virtue of the statute of 1789, <em>c. </em>14. The first section of this act provided that any citizen seised of an estate of freehold in any town, of the annual income of ten dollars, and residing thereon or within the town, occupying the same for two years, should gain a settlement in that town. This act passed June 23, 1789, when <em>Nicholson </em>lived on his freehold estate in <em>Andover, </em>of greater annual value than ten dollars, which he has ever since occupied, and consequently, it is contended, gained a settlement in <em>Andover, </em>on the 23d of June, 1791.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">This conclusion was objected to by the defendants\u2019 counsel. He reasoned from a further clause in the same act, and from the provisions of some subsequent statutes. In the same * section of the statute of 1789, it was further provided, [ * 441 ] that any person of the age of twenty-one years, residing in any town two years successively, without being warned to depart the town, should gain a settlement there. By the additional statute of 1790, <em>c. </em>39, the time was prolonged to three years. By the second additional statute of 1791, <em>c. </em>44, the time was further extended to four years. By the third additional statute of 1792, <em>c. </em>69, the time was prolonged to five years. All these acts are repealed by the statute of 1793, c. 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The defendants\u2019 counsel argued that from a view of these several acts, a freeholder occupying his freehold for two years under the statute of 1789, did not gain a settlement; because, as he insisted, the subsequent acts, in requiring further times of residence without warning before a settlement could be gained, also extended the times of occupancy of a freehold, before the expiration of which a settlement by estate could not be gained ; and an interval of two years had not elapsed between the passing of any two successive acts. He admitted that <em>Nicholson, </em>by a three years\u2019 occupancy under the last statute, gained a settlement in <em>Andover; </em>but not until Feb. 11, 1797, when his daughter, <em>Elizabeth, </em>was emancipated, and no longer a member of his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">But after consideration we are all of opinion that <em>Nicholson </em>gained a settlement in <em>Andover, </em>under the statute of 1789, by the occupancy of his freehold for two years. In that statute several different methods are described by which a settlement may be gained. One is the occupancy of a freehold by the owner for two years. Another method is the residing in any town, two years successively, by any person above the age of twenty-one years, without being warned to depart. These methods we consider'as independent of each other ; and, therefore, that the extension of the time of residence without warning, does not affect the gaining of a settlement by the occu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>pancy of a freehold by the owner. And if the free- [ * 442 ] holder has been warned to depart the town * within two years after his occupancy commenced, yet if he continued his occupancy two years, he would gain a settlement notwithstanding the warning.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">If this opinion be correct, <em>Nicholson, </em>the father, gained a settlement in <em>Andover, </em>on the 23d of June, 1791, when his daughter was a member of his family, about sixteen years old, and who also through him gained a derivative settlement in the same town. In forming this opinion, we have considered <em>Nicholson\u2019s </em>farm, agreeably to the consent of the parties, as of the annual income of ten dollars, although the report has stated only the price of the farm at 1000 or 1200 dollars, which certainly must be of greater annual value than 10 dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The counsel for the defendants has further argued that, admitting the settlement of <em>Elizabeth </em>and her children was in <em>Andover, </em>yet <em>Salem </em>cannot maintain this action, because the father is able to maintain his daughter and grandchildren. This argument is founded on the second section of the statute of 1793, <em>c. </em>59, in which it is enacted that the overseers of the town in which a pauper Is settled, shall take care that such pauper is suitably supported at the expense of the town, provided that certain kindred of the pauper, of sufficient ability, if he has any, shall be holden to support him in proportion to their ability.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">When this objection was made, it appeared to deserve attention; but upon consideration, we think it cannot prevail. Upon looking into the whole section, and comparing it with the eighth section, which gives the present action, we are satisfied that the kindred of the pauper cannot be called on to contribute to his support, but by the overseers of the town in which he is settled, or by some other of his kindred; and that when the overseers of any town, in which <em>the pauper </em>is not settled, shall provide for his relief, when fallen into distress, .their only remedy for compensation is against the town in which the pauper is settled, and not against any of his kindred <footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">We are of opinion that the direction of the judge was right, and that judgment must be entered according to the verdict.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b393-11\"> [ <em>Wells </em>vs. Horton, 2 <em>Car. &amp; P. 383.\u2014Scago </em>vs. <em>Deane, </em>4 <em>Bingh. 459.\u2014Wing </em>vs. <em>Mill, </em>1 <em>B. </em>&amp; <em>A. </em>104 <em>\u2014Andover and Medford Corporation </em>vs. <em>Gould, </em>6 <em>Mass. </em>40.\u2014 <em>Davenport </em>vs. <em>Moore, </em>15 <em>Mass. 85.\u2014Smith </em>vs. <em>Jameson, </em>5 <em>D &amp; E. 603.\u2014Belfast </em>vs. <em>Leominster, </em>1 Pick. <em>123.\u2014Lee </em>vs. <em>Muggridge, </em>5 <em>Taunt. </em>36.\u2014Sed vide <em>Mills </em>vs. Wyman, 3 <em>Pick. 207.\u2014Littlefield </em>vs. <em>Shee, 2 B. &amp; Ad. </em>811.\u2014And the cases collected in <em>Chitty on Contracts, </em>pp. 40, 41, 42, 43, 44 <em>\u2014Cook </em>vs. <em>Bradley, </em>7 <em>Con.
