This sum the defendant retained on adjusting the accounts of the adventure with the plaintiff, and this sum the plaintiff demands in the present action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-5\">The judge directed the jury that, upon this evidence, and taking the most favorable view of the case for the defendant, the loss incurred, if the plaintiff\u2019s adventure was liable to any deduction in consequence of it, ought to be divided between the parties in the same proportion in which the profits were shared. And a verdict was taken for the plaintiff, the damages being assessed according to that opinion; it being agreed that if the Court should be [ * 483 ] of opinion, upon the * judge\u2019s report of the case, that the defendant is entitled to no deduction by reason of the leaking of the vessel, the verdict should be amended by inserting the sum of 300 dollars and 1 cent, with interest; if the Court should be of opinion that the plaintiff cannot recover any thing in this action, the verdict to be set aside, and a general verdict entered for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b430-6\">The cause coming on now to be heard, the Court called on <em>Livermore, </em>counsel for the defendant, to show how, on these \"facts, his client was entitled to retain this money.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b430-7\">\n<em>Livermore</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUDy\">argued that the ship is found to be in a complete state of repair, when the voyage commenced at <em>Neivburyport; </em>that this being but one voyage in the whole, it was as much as was to be required of the owner that the ship be tight, stanch and streng* and in every respect seaworthy at the commencement of it. Whatever damages arise after sailing, are perils of the sea. These the plaintiff expressly assumed on himself; yet by this action, he would throw the risk upon the defendant, thereby converting him into an underwriter on his goods, contrary to their express stipulation. The plaintiff\u2019s proper remedy is against his own underwriter, if he made insurance ; if he made none, he must bear the loss himself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-8\"><em>Chief Justice. </em>Suppose the plaintiff had insured these goods <em>a. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>and <em>from Calcutta </em>to her port of discharge, would the underwriters be chargeable with a loss arising in the manner this arose ?</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b431-5\">\n<em>Livermore.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWk\">This contract between these parties having relation to one entire voyage, any supposed insurance must be considered as referring to such a contract and such a voyage.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b431-6\"><em>Jackson, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AfO\">contended that the ship-owner is bound, by the very undertaking to carry goods for others, not only to provide a vessel tight and stanch at the commencement of the voyage, but he is further bound, at every port where the ship may be, to make all necessary repairs. He' is responsible to the shipper of goods for every injury happening to them while on board the ship, which might have been prevented by human foresight and care j and this equally, whether the defects occasioning the damage ire known or unknown to the ship-owner If his own ship becomes incapable to perform the voyage, the master * is [ * 484 ] even bound, as the owner\u2019s agent, if it be in his power, to procure another ship, and with her to transport the cargo to the port of discharge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b431-7\">But the facts in this case, it is further contended, show negligence and a want of due care. There is strong ground to apprehend that the defect in this vessel existed at the outset of the voyage ; but at any rate, there was a want of due attention while receiving the cargo on board at <em>Calcutta. </em>If it was at all allowable to load the vessel so much by the head as was done in this case, it was clearly the duty of those, to whom the charge of the ship was committed, to have observed more carefully the effects of thus loading her. It must be considered as gross negligence to delay an examination until there were four feet of water in the hold. But granting that this damage arose from the perils of the seas, and, therefore, that the plaintiff is liable to bear his proportion of the .css, then this verdict is right. The loss ought to be deducted out of the profits, in which case the defendant will take his share of it; and not out of the principal adventure, which would throw the whole of it upon the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b431-8\"><em>[Note. The Court </em>were clearly of opinion with <em>Jackson </em>in this last position <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark>.]</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b431-9\">\n<em>Livermore.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFl\">Whether the master or mariners were chargeable in this case with negligence, was a proper subject for the consideration of the jury. It never was intended to refer that question to the Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b431-10\">Suppose a ship receives a cargo on board here for <em>Lrndon </em>on freight, and meeting with damage on her passage, within the meaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>of perils of the sea, whereby the cargo is damaged, it will not be said the owner is chargeable. Suppose, instead of taking in the cargo here, the contract were that she should go in ballast to <em>Madeira, </em>and there load; on her passage to <em>Madeira, </em>damage is received by the ship from the violence of the seas, but being undiscovered, until the goods are shipped, they receive damage, would the ship-owner be liable in this case more than in the one first put ? If he would not, as is confidently believed, neither is the defendant liable in this action.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b431-11\"> <em>[Peace </em>vs. <em>Phillips, </em>4 <em>Mass. </em>672.\u2014Ed.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The cause was continued <em>nisi, </em>and at March term, 1808, in <em>Suffolk, </em>the opinion of the Court was delivered as follows by</p>\n<author id=\"At3\">* Parker, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Anh\">[After reciting the facts from the report.] The defendant claims a right to deduct the whole sum from the plaintiff\u2019s adventure, contending that it is a proper charge against him, being caused, as the defendant alleges, by perils of the seas, for which the plaintiff alone was accountable. But if he has not a right to retain the whole, 'he contends that the loss ought to be divided between the plaintiff and himself, and therefore that he has a right to retain one moiety thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">On the other hand, the plaintiff contends that no part of this sum is properly chargeable to him, because, he says, that the loss was occasioned by a defect in the vessel at the- time she received the cargo on board at <em>Calcutta, </em>and that, by such a loss, the defendant alone, being owner of .the ship, ought to be the sufferer.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">If the loss were occasioned by the perils of the seas, according to the legal meaning of those terms, the plaintiff cannot maintain his action; because in the bill of lading, which is referred to by the parties in their contract, that risk is agreed to be taken by the plaintiff himself. But we are of opinion that the facts do not show that the loss happened from this cause. The gales, which weie met with on the outward passage, did no essential injury to the vessel; it was not found necessary to repair her at the <em>Isle of France </em>or at <em>Batavia; </em>but when she arrived at <em>Calcutta, </em>she was repaired with a view to fit her for her return voyage, although not sufficiently.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">It is the duty of the owner of a ship, when he charters her, or puts her up for freight, to see that she is in a suitable condition to transport her cargo in safety; and he is to keep her in that condition, unless prevented by perils of the sea or unavoidable accident If the goods are lost by reason of any defect in the vessel, whether latent or visible, known or unknown, the owner is answerable to the freighter, upon the principle that he tacitly contracts that his vessel shall be fit for the use for which he thus employs her. This principle governs, not only in charter-parties and in policies of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>insurance, but it is equally applicable in contracts of affreightment <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">* At the time this vessel received her cargo at <em>Cal- </em>[ * 486 ] <em>cut\u00eda, </em>it is obvious that she was not <em>fit </em>to receive it; for, without any marine accident, but lying in the harbor, she sprung a leak. In order to avoid the consequences of this misfortune, it is incumbent on the defendant to show that it was occasioned by perils of the sea; which he cannot do, unless the gales, which happened on her outward voyage, were the cause; and even then it was the duty of the owner, or of his agent the master, to have seen that she underwent a thorough and effectual repair; if she did not, however innocent the owner may be, he must abide the loss ; for it is of the essence of his contract, that his vessel shall be able to receive, retain, and transport her cargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">But upon looking into the survey had at <em>Calcutta, </em>it is at least questionable, whether the leak was not occasioned by a defect existing before the commencement of the voyage from <em>Newburyport. </em>The persons appointed to make the survey say, in their report, that they found a butt on the starboard side quite open; and that two inches of the seam appeared never to have been calked at all; which alone, they say, would have been sufficient to let in what water was in the hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">But whether the vessel was, or was not, seaworthy at the time ol her sailing from <em>Newburyport, </em>it appears that when at <em>Calcutta </em>she was totally unfit to receive her cargo, a\u00f1d that, therefore, the defendant is not entitled to retain any thing out of the plaintiff\u2019s adventure, to indemnify him for the loss <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">According to the agreement of the parties, the verdict must be amended, so that the plaintiff recover the sum of three hundred dollars and one cent, with interest from the date of his writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">\n<em>Judgment was entered accordingly, as of this term.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b433-10\"> <em>Abbott on mapping, </em>146, &amp;c.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(3)\">\n<p id=\"b433-11\"> [A different rule is applied in the case of <em>insurance.\u2014Holdworth </em>vs. <em>Wise, </em>7 <em>B &amp; C. </em>794.\u20141 <em>M. &amp; R. </em>673.\u2014Ed.]</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
