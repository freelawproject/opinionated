The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>statute expressly enacts that \u201c the goods, effects, and credits, of the principal, in the hands and possession of his trustee or trustees at the time such writ was served upon him or them, shall stand bound and be held to satisfy such judgment as the plaintiff shall recover against the principal.\u201d But in this case it is believed the trustee had no means to hold the credits in his hands. The report of the referees was of the nature of a verdict, to which the defendant had no legal exception. It was not in his power to stop the course of legal proceedings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-4\">*By another clause in the statute, the trustee is to be [ * 123 J discharged from all demands of the principal on account of the goods, effects, or credits, taken under this process. But how can he obtain indemnity of an insolvent debtor, who has, by a legal process not to be resisted, already taken out of his possession the very credits with which he was to satisfy the attaching creditor ?</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b113-5\"><em>E. Whitman, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4Kj\">thought this case within the provisions of the statute. Unquestionably, <em>Frye </em>had <em>credits </em>in his hands and possession belonging to <em>Freeman </em>when the writ was served. These credits being bound from the service of the writ to respond to the plaintiff, it became the duty of the Court, in which the action of <em>Freeman </em>against <em>Frye </em>was pending, to protect the latter from mischiefs. Perhaps the defendant had a right to plead this matter as a temporary bar, whereby the judgment would have been delayed until the issue of this process should be known, and then entered for the balance remaining due; or the report might have been recommitted to the referees, who would have done justice between the parties. In one or the other of these methods, <em>Howell, </em>the creditor, might receive the benefit the statute intended to afford him, and all wrong would have been prevented.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b112-10\"> 1794, c. 65</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b113-6\">At this term the opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b113-7\">Parsons, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A60\">[who, after reciting the facts as before stated, proceeded.]</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">That the sum reported by the referees was a credit of <em>Freeman\u2019s </em>in <em>Frye\u2019s </em>hands is very clear, as it was a debt due before, but not liquidated until the report. But whether this credit was so situated as to be the subject of <em>Howell\u2019s </em>attachment, is the great question.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">The eighth section of the act, which authorizes the attachment of credits, provides that the taking of the goods, effects, and credits, out of the hands of the trustee, pursuant to that statute, shall discharge him against all suits and demands of the principal; and, if sued, he may plead the general issue, and give that statute in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">It is the design of the statute, and manifestly just, that the trustee shall not be twice charged for the same credit, once <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>[*124] *by the attaching creditor, and again by his principal. The credit, therefore, liable to this attachment, must be so situated, that, if it be taken by the attaching creditor, the trustee may legally defend himself, when called on by the principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">In the present case, before the attachment, a suit to compel pay ment was pending, a rule of reference had been entered into, in which the parties had agreed that judgment should be entered according to the report, and the referees had agreed on their report. In this state of the action, no day for pleading remained for the trustee, and the law furnished him with no legal defence against the principal\u2019s demand of judgment. The principal being entitled to judgment, his execution was properly sued out and satisfied. The debt consequently due him from the trustee was, at the time of <em>Howell\u2019s </em>attachment, so situated, that he could not defend himself against paying it to <em>Freeman: </em>it is not, therefore, a credit in the hands of the trustee subject to this attachment <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">The trustee must be discharged and have his costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b114-8\"> <em>[Locke </em>vs. <em>Tippets &amp; Trustee, 7 Mass. 149.\u2014Foster </em>vs. <em>Jones, </em>15 <em>Mass. </em>185.\u2014 <em>Gridley </em>vs. <em>Harraden, </em>14 <em>Mass. 496.\u2014Thorndike </em>vs. <em>De Wolf, </em>6 <em>Pick. 120.\u2014Kidd </em>vs <em>Shepherd, </em>4 <em>Mass. 238.\u2014Eunson </em>vs <em>Healy Trustee, </em>2 <em>Mass. </em>32.\u2014Ed.]</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
