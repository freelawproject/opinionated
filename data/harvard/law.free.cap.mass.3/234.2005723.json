Goulding.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b212-5\">A plaintiff recovers less than <em>four pounds </em>damage in an action commenced at the Court of Common Pleas; full costs are allowed him; he reviews the action, and recovers <em>one cent </em>damage ; the defendant shall recover the difference ot the two sums awarded as damage, together with full costs of the review.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-6\">In the original action, of which this is a review, the plaintiff recovered eleven dollars damage. The Court adjudged him full costs, being of opinion that he had a reasonable expectation of recovering larger damages than <em>four pounds </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark>. The plaintiff brought this review, with a view of obtaining larger damages. He recovered but <em>one cent </em>on the review.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A6O\">And now, <em>F. Blake, </em>for the defendant, moves the Court that the costs of the original suit may be reduced to one fourth of the damages found on the review, the second verdict having disproved the opinion of the Court on the first trial.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b212-8\"><em>Bigelow, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A66\">cited the case of <em>Billerica </em>vs. <em>Carlisle </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark>; and he observed that the opinion of the Court as to the reasonableness of the plaintiff\u2019s expectation, was still in force, notwithstanding a jury had seen fit to be of a different opinion.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b212-10\"> Vide <em>Stat. </em>1786, <em>c. </em>51.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"AYk\"> 2 <em>Mass.

Full costs were allowed by the Court, pursuant to the power vested in them by the statute. The equity is with the defendant, who rested [ * 235 ] satisfied with the former judgment, but * the whole, which he is legally entitled to, is the difference between the damages recovered in the original suit, and those now found, together with the costs of the review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
