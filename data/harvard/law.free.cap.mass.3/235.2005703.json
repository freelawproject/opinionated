Suppose, in an action on such a bond as this, judgment upon pleadings is rendered against the judge, still he *may maintain another action on the same [ * 236 ] bond for the use of other parties, creditors or legatees. This shows him not a party in the usual sense of the term. He is no more than nominally a .party.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b213-12\"> 2 <em>Mass.

This award of the referees may, perhaps, be good <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the amount due to these parties, upon a hearing in chancery, after the obligation is regularly adjudged to be forfeited. But the point had been repeatedly determined, that a judge of probate cannot refer an action brought in his name upon an office bond, before the case in <em>Plymouth, </em>which has been cited by the defendants\u2019 counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-11\">\n<em>Buie discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b213-13\"> Vide <em>Coffin </em>vs. <em>Jones, </em>5 <em>Pick. 61.\u2014Robbins </em>vs. <em>Hayward, </em>16 <em>Mass. </em>524.\u2014In the case vi <em>Coffin </em>vs. <em>Jones, </em>where the writ was endorsed by the heirs, the Court seemed to regard the action as if it were a suit in the name of the heirs only, although it was in the name of the judge of probate, as it ought always to be.
