Babcock and Another.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b33-10\">A consignee of goods on his own account refusing to receive them, and alter wards selling them as agent to the consignors, is a competent witness for the consignors in an action by them against the purchasers for the price of the goods, although he had endorsed the bill of lading in blank.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-11\">This action was brought to recover the amount of all invoice of goods shipped by the plaintiffs, merchants in <em>Great Britain, </em>to <em>Lewis Glover. </em>At the trial before <em>Parker, </em>J., at the last November term, the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel stated that after the shipment, and before the arrival of these goods, <em>Glover, </em>who had discontinued business, informed an agent of the plaintiffs here, that he should not take the goods on his own account, to which the agent agreed; that, on the arrival of the goods, no person appeared to take the consignment of them, and they remained for some time in the custody of the officers of the customs ; that <em>Glover </em>made several attempts to sell them for the plaintiffs, and finally sold them to the defendants, informing them that he disposed of them as the agent of the plaintiffs, and agreed to take the defendants\u2019 note for the amount, payable in nine months; that the defendants, after receiving the goods, refused to give such note, and .had not yet paid for the goods.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-12\">To prove this statement, among other witnesses, he called <em>Glover, </em>who was objected to by the defendants\u2019 counsel as incompetent on two grounds: 1st, that he was interested in the event of the suit; and 2dly, that, having endorsed his name on the bill of lading generally, and not as agent, he should not be permitted by his own testimony to invalidate that instrument.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-13\">The objections were overruled by the judge, and <em>Glover </em>was admitted as a witness. A verdict was given for the plaintiffs, sub-to the of the the above state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>ment, which was reported by the judge, the witness ought to have been admitted ; judgment to be rendered according to the verdict, unless the Court should be of opinion that the witness was incompetent; and in such case the verdict to be set aside, and a new trial granted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-5\">[ * 30 ] * And now <em>Dexter, </em>in support of the objections, contended that the invoice and bill of lading which accompanied the goods, and were in the usual form, purporting that the goods were shipped on the account and risk of <em>Glover, </em>vested the property of the goods consigned in him ; and that the whole contract being in writing, parole testimony ought not to have been admitted to control, impeach, or explain it away.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-7\"><em>Glover </em>is directly interested in the event of the action ; for if by his testimony he enables the plaintiffs to recover of the defendants, he avoids the plaintiffs\u2019 action against him for assuming to dispose of the goods, after he had disclaimed the consignment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-8\"><em>Chief Justice. </em>The plaintiffs can never sue <em>Glover </em>for a misfeasance, since, by this action, they have affirmed the sale by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-9\"><em>Dexter. Glover </em>is still interested in supporting this action ; for the defendants are attached, as his trustees, on account of these same goods. So, if the sale by him should be disaffirmed, he not <em>only </em>cannot <em>receive any </em>benefit, but the costs of the process against his trustees would first be taken out of his effects. A direct interest, however small, in the event of the action, renders a witness incompetent, and supports our objection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-10\">Finding the Court strongly inclined against him upon the sec\u00f3n i objection, <em>Dexter </em>would not press it.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b34-11\"><em>Sullivan, </em>for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Az3\">insisted that <em>Glover </em>had no interest m the event of this action, or rather he was equally interested for each party. If the plaintiffs recovered, he was discharged from them If they failed, on the ground that the defendants were debtors to him, and not to the plaintiffs, then the price of these goods would go to his benefit <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark>, and the plaintiffs would have their remedy against him for the same amount.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-12\">Should <em>Glover </em>be sued by the plaintiffs for the price of these goods, the evidence in this case would protect him; for it would show his refusal to take the goods on his own account; [ * 31 ] *and the bringing this action is in substance a release to him. A similar answer would apply to an action for a tortious intermeddling with these goods; for the plaintiffs have adopted and affirmed his doings <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>As to the second objection, <em>Sullivan </em>referred the Court to the cases in the margin <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b34-13\"> <em>Ilderton </em>vs. Atkinson, 7 <em>Term R. </em>480, and <em>Evans </em>vs. <em>Williams &amp; Al., </em>in a note to the same case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b34-14\"> <em>Peake\u2019s Law of Evid. 98.\u2014Carter </em>vs. Pearce, 1 <em>Term R. </em>104.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(3)\">\n<p id=\"b35-9\"> <em>Preston </em>vs. <em>Merceau, </em>2 <em>W.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2V\">As the plaintiffs, in their declaration <footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark>, admit <em>Glover </em>to be their agent in this transaction, they are bound by this admission ; and if they fail in this action, they cannot have recourse to him as the purchaser. If therefore he has any interest, he is called to testify against that interest. But in fact he has no interest ; for if the defendants should pay the money to him on his account, he would then be chargeable to the plaintiffs as for money received to their use. And if the money is not paid to him, the plaintiffs can have no action against him for the price of the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">There does not appear to be any weight in the second objection. The rule that a man shall not be permitted to invalidate his own endorsement, is confined to negotiable securities ; and in those cases he may, if not interested, testify to any facts excepting such as may prove the security void at the time of his endorsement <footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark>. But if the rule extended to the endorsement of bills of lading, in the present case <em>Glover </em>was not called on to invalidate, but to explain his endorsement. Upon his explanation the title of the defendants to the goods remains unimpeached ; and as it does not appear that they have any cross demands against Glover, it must be immaterial to them, whether in the sale he acted as agent or as principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">We are all satisfied that he was rightly admitted as a witness, and that judgment must be entered according to the verdict <footnotemark>(6)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(4)\">\n<p id=\"b35-10\"> One count in the declaration charged the goods as sold \u201c by the agency of <em>Lewis Glover.\"</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(5)\">\n<p id=\"b35-11\"> [ <em>Worcester </em>vs. <em>Eaton, </em>11 <em>Mass. 368.\u2014Loker </em>vs. <em>Haynes, </em>11 <em>Mass. 498.\u2014Hill </em>vs. <em>Payson, </em>post, <em>559.\u2014Bridge </em>vs. <em>Eggleston, </em>14 <em>Mass. </em>245.\u2014But quzere whether it te not most conformable to the rules of evidence to admit the witnesses in both cases.
