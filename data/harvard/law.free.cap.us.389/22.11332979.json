S. 129, 133. Petitioner was thereupon afforded an evidentiary hearing on his allegations. Although the evidence was in dispute regarding the inclusion of Negroes in the grand and petit jury venires in the county in which petitioner was indicted and tried, it appeared that no Negro served on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>the grand jury which indicted or the petit jury which convicted petitioner. It further appeared that up to the time of petitioner\u2019s trial, no Negro had ever served on a grand jury panel and few, if any, Negroes had served on petit jury panels. This \u201ctestimony in itself made out a <em>prima facie </em>case of the denial of the equal protection which the Constitution guarantees.\u201d <em>Norris </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>294 U. S. 587, 591. In the absence of evidence adduced by the State adequate to rebut the prima facie case, petitioner was therefore entitled to have his conviction reversed. <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>376 U. S. 773; <em>Eubanks </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>356 U. S. 584; <em>Reece </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>350 U. S. 85, 87-88; <em>Hernandez </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>347 U. S. 475, 481; <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>316 U. S. 400, 406; <em>Norris </em>v. <em>Alabama, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">On our independent examination of the record, we are unable to discover any evidence adduced by the State adequate to rebut petitioner\u2019s prima facie case. The Alabama Supreme Court, in affirming the trial court\u2019s denial of relief, acknowledged that the evidence indicated \u201ca disparity\u201d and stated only that \u201cthat disparity can be explained by a number of other factors.\u201d 280 Ala. 509, 512, 195 So. 2d 800, 802. The only factors mentioned, however, were that Negroes had moved away from the county and that some may have been under the statutory disqualification of having suffered a felony conviction. In the circumstances of this case these factors were not in our view sufficient to rebut petitioner\u2019s prima facie case.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The judgment of the Alabama Supreme Court is therefore reversed and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
