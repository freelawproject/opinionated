S. C. App. \u00a7 462. Before trial he filed an affidavit with the court requesting assigned counsel pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3006A. The court considered the affidavit, questioned petitioner and disapproved the request. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit granted leave to appeal <em>in forma pauperis, </em>assigned counsel to assist petitioner in his appeal and affirmed the conviction. Petitioner seeks a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-13\">Before this Court the Solicitor General has conceded that the record does not convincingly show that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>was adequate inquiry into the question of petitioner\u2019s financial ability to retain counsel, in that \u201cthe trial court should have explored the possibility that petitioner could afford only partial payment for the services of trial counsel and that counsel be appointed on that basis, as the Criminal Justice Act permits (see 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3006(A) (c) and (f)).\u201d The Solicitor General urges, however, that there is no basis for believing that petitioner suffered prejudice from the District Court\u2019s error, an argument we find unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The motion for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>and the petition for writ of certiorari are granted, the judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit for reconsideration in light of the Solicitor General\u2019s Memorandum and the relevant criteria of the Criminal Justice Act.</p>\n<judges id=\"b131-6\">Mr. Justice Black dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b131-7\">Mr. Justice Marshall took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
