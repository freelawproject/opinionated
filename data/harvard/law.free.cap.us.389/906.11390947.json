The prosecutor promised Triplett leniency if he testified against the petitioner. Triplett, however, testified that he had not been promised anything. The prosecutor knew this testimony was false, and the jury heard Trip-lett\u2019s entire testimony under the erroneous impression that he had not received promises of leniency. Later in the trial, and over the prosecutor\u2019s objection, petitioner called Triplett\u2019s lawyer and the prosecutor as witnesses. Both admitted that the prosecutor promised Triplett leniency if he would testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">I think this case is governed by the principle of <em>Napue </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>360 U. S. 264 (1959).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> It is true that in the present case, the prosecutor was called by the defense and compelled to admit that he offered leniency to the witness if he testified. So, here, the jury ultimately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>knew not only that the witness lied, but also that the prosecutor knew he was lying.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">It may be that upon hearing the prosecutor\u2019s admission, the jury could properly discount Triplett\u2019s testimony. However, the jury heard him under the impression that he was not receiving benefit for his testimony, and the subsequent admission by the prosecutor, later in the trial, might not adequately overcome the jury\u2019s initial impression of the testimony. Accordingly, in these circumstances, I must conclude that petitioner was prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s acquiescence in the misrepresentation by his witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">In any event, it is by no means clear that petitioner must show that the prosecutor\u2019s knowing acquiescence in a material falsehood prejudiced him. There is no place in our system of criminal justice for prosecutorial misconduct. See <em>Giles </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>386 U. S. 66 (1967) (opinion of Brennan, J.); <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Pate, </em>386 U. S. 1 (1967); <em>Napue </em>v. <em>Illinois, supra; Alcorta </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>355 U. S. 28 (1957); <em>White </em>v. <em>Ragen, </em>324 U. S. 760 (1945); <em>Pyle </em>v. <em>Kansas, </em>317 U. S. 213 (1942); and <em>Mooney </em>v. <em>Holohan, </em>294 U. S. 103 (1935). See also <em>Giles </em>v. <em>Maryland, supra, </em>at 96 (opinion of Fortas, J.); and <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U. S. 83 (1963). Especially in a capital case, a false denial by the critical State\u2019s witness that he was promised leniency in return for his testimony, knowingly acquiesced in by the prosecutor, requires reversal of a state conviction, even though the prosecutor was later compelled to admit that the denial was untrue.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">I would grant certiorari and reverse. <em>Napue </em>v. <em>Illinois, supra.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b802-7\">In response to a question by the prosecutor, a principal state witness in <em>Napue </em>testified that he had received no promise of consideration in return for his testimony. In fact, the prosecutor had promised him consideration but did nothing to correct the false testimony. (Earlier, the witness had been forced by defense counsel to admit that someone, tentatively described as a public defender, \u201cwas going to do what he could\u201d to help the witness.) The Court held that the prosecutor\u2019s knowing acquiescence in the witness\u2019 lie deprived the defendant of a fair trial under the Fourteenth Amendment even though the jury had been apprised that the witness might have been lying about whether he had any interest in testifying.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
