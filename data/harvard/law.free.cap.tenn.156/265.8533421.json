The Chancellor held that the tax should be limited to the pumps or tanks used for the delivery of the petroleum products sold <em>as a fuel, </em>and granted a de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>cree in favor of complainant, from which the State Comptroller has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-3\">\"While the provision of the Act quoted is not as clear as it might be made, we concur with the Chancellor. <em>(2) </em>The limiting words \u201cas a fuel for the same\u201d can be given effect only by adopting this construction and it is the duty of the Court to look to the pertinent statute as a whole and give all parts of it meaning, whenever practicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">If it was the intention of the Legislature to have lubricating oil pumps included in the estimate of pumps or tanks made the basis of the tax under the Act, then it might readily have said so. <em>(3) </em>Of course, the rule is well settled that tax laws are not extended by inference, and that all doubts in construction must be resolved in favor of the taxpayer. This quotation by counsel for appellant from <em>Plow Company </em>v. <em>Hays, </em>125 Tenn., 155, is in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">\u201cIt is also a settled rule of interpretation in this State that statutes levying taxes or duties upon citizens will not be extended by implication beyond the clear import of the language used, nor will their operation be enlarged so as to embrace matters not specifically pointed out, although standing upon a close analogy. All questions of doubt arising upon the construction will be resolved against the government and in favor of the citizen, because burdens are not to be imposed beyond what the statute expressly imports.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">And these rules of construction have often been applied by this Court. *</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">The decree will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
