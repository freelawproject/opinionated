When the defendant saw the officers he ran, and, after getting off a piece, pulled out his pistol and fired at the officers. This testimony was excepted to, and the exception was properly overruled by the trial court. The evidence as to the pistol was not obtained as a result of an unlawful search or an illegal arrest. If the defendant had not drawn his pistol and exhibited it the officers would not have seen it.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">This court has held in numerous cases that evidence obtained as the result of an unlawful search was inadmissible. For example, where premises were unlawfully searched and whisky found, testimony as to the possession of the whisky was held incompetent. Likewise, where a person was unlawfully searched and a pistol found. But here the evidence as to carrying a pistol was not obtained as a result of any search.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">As was pointed out in <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>State, </em>145 Tenn., 554, this is not a case \u201cin which an unlawful act of the officer itself disclosed the unlawful act of the defendant.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>The distinction is obvious, <em> </em>and we are not disposed to extend tlie rule further than was done in the Hughes and other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">In this view of the case the court did not commit error in charging the jury that if, in the circumstances testified to, the defendant drew his pistol and fired at the officers, he would be guilty of unlawfully carrying arms.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">The judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
