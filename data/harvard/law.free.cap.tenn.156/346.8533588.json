Both are in form amendments to the charter of the City of Chattanooga.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">In section 1 of the Act of 1907 it is provided that the charter is amended so as to confer upon the city government \u201cthe powers conferred by this act, in addition to those now possessed by it.\u201d ,</p>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">In the Act of 1927, section 1, it is provided that the charter is amended \u201cso as to confer the following powers on said city in addition to the powers heretofore granted. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b373-12\">It thus appears that by express provision, the Act of 1927 discloses a legislative, intention that the powers therein conferred upon the city should not be exclusive nor in lieu of those previously granted, but should be in addition to the existing powers of the city government.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>The Chancellor was of the opinion that the question at issue is controlled by the principles stated in the opinion of this court in <em>City of Rockwood </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>154 Tenn., 638, and accordingly sustained the first two grounds of the city\u2019s demurrer. In this holding of the Chancellor we concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">In this view of the cause, it is unnecessary to pass upon the third ground of the city\u2019s demurrer, also sustained by the Chancellor, to the effect that even though the Act of 1907 be considered as having been repealed by the Act of 1927, the city might still proceed to the completion of improvements and the making of assessments therefor under the Act of 1907, because commenced and under way prior to the passage of the Act of 1927.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Upon sustaining the city\u2019s demurrer, the Chancellor entered a decree dismissing complainant\u2019s bill. It seems to us that the better practice in a case brought under the Declaratory Judgment Law, Acts 1923, chapter 29, is to enter a decree, sometimes referred to as a \u201cdeclaration,\u201d defining the rights of the parties under the issues made, even though such decree is adverse to the contentions of the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">A decree will accordingly be entered in this court adjudging that the -Acts of 1907, chapter 149, is not repealed by the subsequent enactment of the Acts of 1927,' chapter 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">The costs will be adjudged against the complainant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
