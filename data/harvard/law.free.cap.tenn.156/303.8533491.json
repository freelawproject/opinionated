As stated by the attorney-general in his brief, <em> </em>\"the common practice of transporting whisky in fruit jars has become so general that the sight of one being concealed by a person would be practically equivalent to concealing a well labeled whisky bottle, inasmuch as they have long since ceased to be the innocent receptacles which they once were.\u201d The question would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>he more serious had the fruit jar been carried openly instead of concealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">In <em>Smith </em>v. <em>State, </em>290 S. W., 4, this court held that where a policeman, on approaching automobile in dark alley observed disarrangement of cushion, resulting in discovery of liquor concealed under rear seat, such search was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">We are further of the opinion that where, as here, the search preceded the arrest, no different result would obtain, since in either case the competency of the testimony depends upon the reasonableness of the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
