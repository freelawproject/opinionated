The injuries complained of are thus described in the second count as having resulted from said \u201ccontinuing carelessness and negligence of the defendant,\u201d which remained undiscovered until January 5,1925, notwithstanding diligence on the part of plaintiff and his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>In the companion case of <em>Mrs. Mollie Bodne </em>v. <em>Dr. J. L. Austin, </em>this day decided in an opinion delivered for the conrt by Mr. Justice Chambliss, it is held that the canse of action stated in the declaration is within the application of the statute of limitation pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">There remains for consideration plaintiff\u2019s contention that the declaration states a cause of action arising within the period of one year prior to the beginning of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The suit was commenced by the issuance of summons on March 6,1925. The declaration avers that the operation for the removal of the teeth of plaintiff\u2019s wife was performed on or about the first day of June, 1916, and that the fact that a portion of a tooth had been left in the mouth was first discovered on or about January 5, 1925.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">The first count of the declaration avers that the defendant carelessly and negligently treated and healed the gums of plaintiff\u2019s wife without removing the portion of a tooth, and that he negligently and carelessly failed to notify plaintiff that the broken tooth had not been extracted.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">The first count further avers that the illness of plaintiff\u2019s wife began \u201cimmediately after said operation,\u201d and grew worse day by day, on account of which plaintiff\u2019s wife was successively placed under the care of physicians in Chattanooga, Hot Springs, Nashville, Brooklyn, and Rochester, Minnesota.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">The second count of the declaration avers that the negligence of the defendant in failing to remove the broken tooth was a continuing negligence; \u201cthat for a long time after said dental operation\u201d plaintiff\u2019s wife continued under defendant\u2019s treatment, and defendant carelessly \u00a1and negligently upon each and every day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>thereafter permitted the broken tooth to remain unex-tracted, \u201cand carelessly and negligently failed to disclose the fact to plaintiff\u2019s wife, on account of which and soon thereafter plaintiff\u2019s wife began to be afflicted,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\">In <em>Whaley </em>v. <em>Catlett, </em>103 Tenn., 347, 356, it was said that \u201cfraudulent concealment of the cause of action will prevent the running of the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">However, the declaration in the present case fails either to aver that the concealment of the cause of the illness of plaintiff\u2019s wife was fraudulent on the part of the defendant, or that the existence of this cause was known to the defendant. The averment that the failure to disclose the breach of duty was careless and negligent implies a lack of knowledge on the part of the defendant rather than otherwise. Certainly we would not be justified in assuming fraud in order to prevent the running of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Plaintiff relies upon State, for the use of <em>Cardin </em>v. <em>McClellan, </em>113 Tenn., 616, as authority for his further contention that the limitation did not begin to run until his cause of action was discovered and made known to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The authorities reviewed by this court in the case cited clearly indicate a contrary holding, in so far as the facts of the present case are concerned, particularly the quotation from Wood on Limitations of Actions (113 Tenn., 626, 627), a portion of which is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">\u2018 \u2018 Thus a breach may not inflict any immediate wrong on an individual, but neither his right to a remedy, nor his ability to be precluded by time from its prosecution, will commence until he has suffered some actual inconvenience. But it is otherwise where there is a private relation between the parties, where the wrongdoing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>one creates a right of action in the other; and it may be stated as an invariable rnle that when the injury, however slight, is complete at the time of the act, the statutory period then commences, but, when the act is not legally injurious until certain consequences occur, the time commences to run from the consequential damage, whether the party injured is ignorant of the circumstances from which the injury results, or not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s (declaration does not aver that his wife was under the care of the defendant at- any time within the period of one year preceding the commencement of the action. It is clearly averred that the injuries consequent upon defendant\u2019s breach of contract or wrongful act began immediately after or soon after the operation for the removal of the teeth, in June 1916, and were not postponed to the period of one year immediately preceding the commencement of the action. The continuation of the illness of plaintiff\u2019s wife within the period immediately preceding the commencement of the action was no more than an aggravation of the legal injury already suffered or inflicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">If the damages claimed can be said to be based only on the consequential injuries shown in the declaration, it is not averred that such injuries developed within the year preceding the commencement of the action, and we have been referred to no authority holding that mere ignorance and failure to discover the existence of the cause of action, or the consequential damages resulting from the breach of duty or wrongful act, can prevent the running of the statute of limitation. 37 C. J., 863.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Nor can the declaration be sustained upon the theory that it is based upon recurrent injuries within the statutory period. The declaration fails to aver that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>the defendant was guilty of any breach of duty or wrongful act within the period of the limitation. <em>Railway Company </em>v. <em>Roddy, </em>132 Tenn., 568.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">We are of the opinion, therefore, that the judgment of the circuit court sustaining the demurrer to the plaintiff\u2019s declaration must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
