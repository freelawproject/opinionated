Wilson was temporarily totally disabled for twenty-six weeks, or until July 13, 1926, and was temporarily partially disabled after that date. The physician, who set his leg, testified that a perfect union had been effected, and that, in all probability, his ability to work would be restored to normal in about twelve months from the date of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-13\">Wilson testified that his earnings prior to the accident had been $16.50 per week, and the point is made that it was not shown that his weekly earnings for fifty-two weeks preceding the accident had been that sum. Wilson and the Coal Company, however, agreed upon that sum, and the Coal Company paid him $8.25 per week, or fifty per cent of his average weekly earnings, as provided by subsection (a) of section 28 of the Corn-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>pensation Act, for the first thirteen weeks, and tendered him a check for a like amount for the following thirteen weeks, upon condition that he execute a release from further liability, which was declined. In these circumstances, we find there was some evidence as to his earnings, and that he is entitled to recover for twenty-six weeks at $'8.25 per week, or $214.50, less $107 paid, and a store account of $93.72, leaving $13.78 for which he is entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\"><em> </em>With respect to compensation for temporary partial disability, subsequent to July 13, 1926, we find that he is entitled to recover $5 per week, the minimum sum provided in subsection (b) of section 28 of the Act, not to exceed, however, two hundred and seventy-four weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">The act provides that such compensation shall not be paid for more than three hundred weeks, and this period should be reduced by the twenty-six weeks, for which he was paid compensation for temporary total disability, since the act only contemplates compensation for a maximum period of three hundred weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">The trial court entered a judgment for one hundred weeks temporary total disability and fifty weeks temporary partial disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">We find no evidence to support this judgment, and it will be reversed and the case remanded. Upon the remand judgment will be entered in favor of Wilson for $13.78 and for $5 a week for the period that he was temporarily partially disabled, subsequent to July 13, 1926, not to exceed two hundred and seventy-four weeks. If Wilson is still temporarily partially disabled when the case is heard, judgment will be entered for the amount then due, and the company will pay him $5 per week <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>until two hundred and seventy-fonr payments have been made, or nntil his disability is removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-3\">The costs of the appeal will he paid, two-thirds by the company and onerthird by Wilson. Other costs will he adjndg\u2019ed by the trial conrt.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
