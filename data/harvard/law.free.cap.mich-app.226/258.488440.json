Plaintiff claimed that an exclusion in the automobile policy issued to defendants Wilbur and Maureen Roe relieved it of the duty to defend the Roes and pay damages on their behalf or indemnify them for the injuries suffered by their son, Michael Roe, in a vehicular accident. After entering an order reversing the trial court\u2019s order and opinion and remanding the case for entiy of a judgment in plaintiff\u2019s favor, this Court granted a rehearing. We again reverse and remand for entry of a judgment in plaintiff\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b316-12\">Wilbur operated a logging and sawmill business, W. D. Roe Lumber Company, a sole proprietorship, which involved cutting and milling lumber at various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>sites around the state. Michael worked for his father and lived with his parents. Maureen, the wife of Wilbur and mother of Michael, was not an employee of W. D. Roe Lumber Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">Wilbur paid his employees at varying hourly rates, but did not provide any benefits, although he provided transportation to and from the job sites for employees who wanted to ride with him. The employees did not pay for the gasoline used in transporting them. For several weeks before the accident, Wilbur and four employees, including Michael, worked at a job site that involved a drive of approximately one hour. As was his usual custom, Wilbur provided optional transportation to and from this job site to Michael and others.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">On the day of the accident, Wilbur drove himself and his employees, including Michael, to the work site in an Oldsmobile that was titled in the names of both Wilbur and Maureen, insured by plaintiff under a no-fault policy, and primarily used by Maureen. While driving home from work, Wilbur was involved in a collision with another vehicle, causing extensive injuries to Michael. Plaintiff then paid statutory personal protection insurance benefits to Michael pursuant to the priorities set forth in MCL 500.3114(3); MSA 24.13114(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Eventually, Michael sued Wilbur and Maureen, claiming that his injuries were caused by negligent driving. In response, plaintiff brought this declaratory judgment action, claiming that the following exclusion in the liability section of the insurance policy relieved it of the duty to defend Wilbur and Maureen and pay damages on their behalf for the injuries suffered by Michael as a result of this accident:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>There is no coverage under coverage a:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\">1. FOR ANY <em>BODILY INJURY </em>to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">b. any employee of an <em>insured </em>arising out of his or her employment. This does not apply to a household employee who is not covered or required to be covered under any worker\u2019s compensation insurance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Subsequently, pursuant to a consent judgment, the parties agreed that Michael would have a judgment against Wilbur and Maureen, jointly and severally, in the amount of $100,000. The parties also agreed that Michael would limit the recovery of this judgment to the proceeds of plaintiffs automobile liability policy issued to his parents, and plaintiff agreed to pay Michael the amount of $100,000 in the event of an adverse decision in its declaratory judgment action. Following a bench trial, the trial court found that the injury did not occur within the scope of Michael\u2019s employment and that plaintiff had a duty to indemnify Wilbur and Maureen. Thereafter, the trial court denied plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">On appeal, plaintiff argues that the trial court erred in ruling that Michael\u2019s injuries did not arise out of his employment, and, therefore, that the policy exclusion did not apply. An insurance policy is much the same as any other contract; it is an agreement between the parties. <em>Auto-Owners Ins Co v Churchman, </em>440 Mich 560, 566; 489 NW2d 431 (1992). When presented with a dispute, a court must determine what the parties\u2019 agreement is and enforce it. <em>Fragner v American Community Mut Ins Co, </em>199 Mich App 537, 542-543; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>502 NW2d 350 (1993). Exclusionary clauses are to be strictly construed against the insurer. <em>Fire Ins Exchange v Diehl, </em>450 Mich 678, 687; 545 NW2d 602 (1996). Exclusions limit the scope of coverage provided and are to be read with the insuring agreement and independently of eveiy other exclusion. <em>Hawkeye-Security Ins Co v Vector Const Co, </em>185 Mich App 369, 384; 460 NW2d 329 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">Plaintiff argues that the \u201carising out of his or her employment\u201d language of the exclusion should be construed in the same way as worker\u2019s compensation cases interpreting similar language found in the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act. MCL 418.301 (1) and (3); MSA 17.237(301)(1) and (3) provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-5\">(1) An employee, who receives a personal injury <em>arising out of and in the course of employment </em>by an employer who is subject to this act at the time of the injury, shall be paid compensation as provided in this act... .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-7\">(3) An employee going to or from his or her work, while on the premises where his work is to be performed, and within a reasonable time before and after his or her working hours, is presumed to be <em>in the course of his or her employment. </em>[Emphasis provided.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">In support of its position, plaintiff primarily relies upon <em>Konopka v Jackson Co Rd Comm, </em>270 Mich 174; 258 NW 429 (1935), a worker\u2019s compensation case in which the Supreme Court held that the accident resulting in the death of a highway commission employee while he was being transported from his place of work to his home in a truck belonging to another employee arose out of and in the course of such employment and was compensable. In determin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>ing whether it was \u201can accident arising out of and in the course of his employment,\u201d the Court in <em>Konopka </em>held that if an accident arises out of transportation provided by the employer, it is an accident arising \u201cin the course of the employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 176-177. The test for determining whether transportation is employer-provided is whether, under the contract of employment and in light of all attendant circumstances, there is an express or implied undertaking by the employer to provide the transportation. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">We agree with plaintiff that the exclusionary language \u201carising out of his or her employment\u201d should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>be construed in a manner consistent with the worker\u2019s compensation act and <em>Konopka </em>for several reasons. First, the exclusionary language at issue is identical to that used in \u00a7 301 of the worker\u2019s compensation act. While the claimed exclusion does not specifically state that the language in question is to be interpreted in accordance with the worker\u2019s compensation act, we believe it apparent that the exclusion was crafted in consideration of worker\u2019s compensation law. As support for our conclusion, we note that the policy at issue also excludes coverage for obligations of an insured or his insurer under any type of worker\u2019s compensation, disability, or similar law.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">Second, we believe that construing the exclusionary language in accordance with worker\u2019s compensation case law supports the policy considerations underlying the worker\u2019s compensation act. Generally, the right to recover benefits for personal injury or occupational disease under the worker\u2019s compensation act is the exclusive remedy of an employee against an employer who has complied with the act. MCL 418.131(1); MSA 17.237(131)(1); <em>Smith v Mirror Lite Co, </em>196 Mich App 190, 192; 492 NW2d 744 (1992). If an employer fails to comply with the insurance requirements of the worker\u2019s compensation act, as Wilbur did,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it is liable in tort for injuries to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>its employees. MCL 418.641(2); MSA 17.237(641)(2); <em>McGillis v Aida Engineering, Inc, </em>161 Mich App 370, 372; 410 NW2d 817 (1987). Here, the exclusion in the insurance policy sought to prevent plaintiff from becoming a worker\u2019s compensation insurer and limit plaintiff\u2019s liability to only those risks properly assumed by an automobile insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the exclusionary clause barred coverage for Michael\u2019s injuries because they arose out of his employment. Similar to <em>Konopka, </em>it was customary for Wilbur to furnish employee transportation to and from the job site, even though employees could provide their own transportation. As in <em>Konopka, </em>the manner of going to and from the job site was not compulsory, but it was \u201cthe general method\u201d that Wilbur would provide the employees with transportation. Further, similar to <em>Konopka, </em>the transportation arrangement was for the \u201cmutual advantage\u201d of employer and employees because Wilbur was assured a full crew of workers each day to assist him in conducting the sawmilling operations and the employees received free transportation. Moreover, unlike in <em>Konopka, </em>the transportation here was provided in a vehicle owned and operated by the employer, and not merely another employee. Thus, although transportation was not expressly made part of the employment contract and employees were not paid for their travel time, transportation became \u201can essential incident of the employment as to be a part of it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Given that there was \u201can expressed or implied undertaking by the employer to provide the transportation\u201d in light of all the attendant circumstances, we believe that the exclusion applied because the injuries that Michael <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>sustained in the accident arose out of his employment. Because Michael\u2019s recovery under the terms of the consent judgment was limited to the proceeds of plaintiff\u2019s automobile policy and because plaintiff is not liable to indemnify Wilbur and Maureen, we reverse and remand for entry of a judgment in favor of plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Contrary to defendants\u2019 claim, this case is not controlled by <em>Francis v Scheper, </em>326 Mich 441; 40 NW2d 214 (1949). In <em>Francis, </em>our Supreme Court concluded that a phrase in an insurance policy excluding coverage for employees while \u201cengaged in the employment... of the insured\u201d did not apply because the employee who was injured while being transported home from work had ceased the day\u2019s productive work for which he was being paid. We believe the exclusion in this case, excepting coverage for injury \u201carising out of his or her employment\u201d to be broader than the phrase \u201cwhile engaged in the employment of the insured,\u201d used in <em>Francis. </em>As noted by our Supreme Court in <em>Nemeth v Michigan Building Components, </em>390 Mich 734, 736; 213 NW2d 144 (1973), \u201cthe concept of course of employment is more comprehensive than the assigned work.\u201d Similarly, we find the phrase \u201carising out of his or her employment\u201d refers to a course of employment that is more expansive than merely the assigned work and more comprehensive than \u201cengaged in the employment of the insured,\u201d which under <em>Francis </em>refers only to the performance of assigned work that an employee is paid to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Defendants further contend that the exclusion is contrary to public policy because it is broader than that permitted by chapter five of the Vehicle Code, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>the financial responsibility act, MCL 257.501 <em>et seq.-, </em>MSA 9.2201 <em>et seq., </em>specifically \u00a7 520(b)(2), MCL 257.520(b)(2); MSA 9.2220(b)(2), which applies to all liability insurance policies. As a matter of law, when an automobile accident occurs in Michigan, the scope of liability coverage is determined by the financial responsibility act. <em>Farmers Ins Exchange v Anderson, </em>206 Mich App 214, 217; 520 NW2d 686 (1994). Notwithstanding, \u00a7 520(e), MCL 257.520(e); MSA 9.2220 (e), provides that an insurer may exclude \u201cany liability under any workmen\u2019s compensation law\u201d and \u201cany liability on account of bodily injury to or death of an employee of the insured while engaged in the employment, other than domestic, of the insured.\u201d Thus, under this section, an insurer may exclude not only all liabilities within the coverage of the worker\u2019s compensation act, but also those arising from nondomestic employment relationships even if they are not covered by the worker\u2019s compensation act. In this case, we believe the exclusion to be well within what is permitted by the statute and not contrary to public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Michael also argues that even if his injuries arose out of his employment, the exclusion in \u00a7 1(a) of the policy excepts Wilbur and Maureen from any course or scope of employment exclusion by providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">A FELLOW EMPLOYEE WHILE ON THE JOB AND ARISING FROM THE MAINTENANCE OR USE OF A VEHICLE BY ANOTHER EMPLOYEE IN THE employer\u2019s business. <em>You </em>and <em>your spouse </em>are covered for such injury to a fellow employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Here, Wilbur and Maureen are the referenced \u201cyou and your spouse,\u201d and what they would be covered for are, among other things, vehicular injuries to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Michael caused by \u201canother employee,\u201d which must be a person other than themselves. Accordingly, this provision does not apply because Michael\u2019s injuries were not caused by another employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Michael further asserts that even if his injuries arose out of his employment, the sentence in the exclusion stating that \u201c[t]his [exclusion] does not apply to a household employee who is not covered or required to be covered under any worker\u2019s compensation insurance\u201d defeats the claimed exclusion because he was a member of the same household and was not covered under worker\u2019s compensation insurance. However, this exception to the exclusion is not applicable because Michael was not a household employee and was required to be covered under worker\u2019s compensation insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">There is likewise no merit to Michael\u2019s claim that the exclusion at issue does not apply to Maureen on the ground that she was liable to her son under the owners liability statute, MCL 257.401; MSA 9.2101, because she was not his employer when she allowed Wilbur to drive the vehicle involved in the accident. However, because the car was titled in the names of both Wilbur and Maureen and covered under an insurance policy issued to both of them, the exclusion is applicable because Michael was an employee of \u201can insured,\u201d namely, Wilbur.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">likewise, there is no merit to Michael\u2019s claim that even if coverage did not apply to Wilbur, it would still apply to Maureen because plaintiff had a separate and distinct duty to cover each of the insureds individually. As plaintiff points out, defendants\u2019 reliance on <em>Shelby Mut Ins Co v United States Fire Ins Co, </em>12 Mich App 145; 162 NW2d 676 (1968), is misplaced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>because there is nothing in the policy in question concerning the severability of the insureds\u2019 interests and because the exclusionary clause applies as long as the person seeking recovery is an employee of \u201can insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Finally, we note that even though the worker\u2019s disability compensation magistrate denied Michael\u2019s claim for compensation, finding that his injuries did not arise out of and in the course of his employment under \u00a7 301 of the worker\u2019s compensation act, this Court is not bound by the magistrate\u2019s ruling in determining whether the exclusionary clause in plaintiff\u2019s insurance policy is applicable in this action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Integral Ins Co v Maersk Container Service Co, Inc, </em>206 Mich App 325, 330; 520 NW2d 656 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Reversed and remanded for entry of judgment for plaintiff.</p>\n<judges id=\"b326-7\">Corrigan, C.J., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b320-7\"> See also <em>Chrysler v Blue Arrow Transport Lines, </em>295 Mich 606, 608-609; 295 NW 331 (1940), where the Court followed <em>Konopka </em>in ruling that a fatal accident involving the plaintiff truckdriver, who had spent the weekend at home in Grand Rapids and was returning to Chicago to unload a truck, was compensable under the worker\u2019s compensation act as an accident arising out of and in the course of employment where his contract of employment contemplated free transportation by the defendant employer in one of the defendant\u2019s trucks to and from the home city; <em>Lemanski v Frimberger Co, </em>31 Mich App 285; 187 NW2d 498 (1971), where this Court affirmed a finding by the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board that the injuries suffered by a journeyman sheet metal worker in an automobile accident while en route to the job site arose out of and in the course of his employment where the plaintiff was paid for travel to and from the job site under his employment contract; <em>Stark v L E Myers Co, </em>58 Mich App 439, 442-443; 228 NW2d 411 (1975), where this Court, while recognizing the general rule that injuries sustained by employees going to or from work were not compensable under the worker\u2019s compensation act, cited <em>Chrysler, supra, </em>and <em>Lemanski, supra, </em>in observing that among the considerations in making the ultimate determination whether \u201can injury to an employee while on the way to work is sufficiently employment-related to be compensable\u201d is \u201c[wjhether employer paid for or furnished employee transportation\u201d; <em>Torres v Armond Cassil Co, </em>115 Mich App 690, 694; 321 NW2d 776 (1982), where this Court, quoting the considerations set forth in <em>Stark, supra, </em>reversed the appeal board\u2019s decision denying compensation for injuries suffered by the plaintiff in an automobile accident while being driven home from work because the plaintiff established that the employer furnished transportation; and, more recently, <em>Botke v Chippewa Co, </em>210 Mich App 66, 69; 533 NW2d 7 (1995), citing <em>Stark, </em>in connection with the \u201cdual-purpose exception\u201d whereby travel to and from work is covered by the worker\u2019s compensation act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b321-5\"> Although Wilbur stated that he had carried worker\u2019s compensation insurance for a number of years, he apparently chose not to renew his coverage because his business was small and he was \u201cwinding it down.\u201d Given that Wilbur decided not to comply with his legal requirement as an employer, he should not be rewarded by having his no-fault insurer bear the costs of his decision to drop worker\u2019s compensation insurance. To find coverage under plaintiff\u2019s automobile policy for the injuries sustained by Michael would provide an incentive for other employers not to comply with their statutorily mandated obligation to carry worker\u2019s compensation insurance under MCL 418.611; MSA 17.237(611).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b326-10\"> Nonetheless, we believe that the magistrate\u2019s ruling was erroneous because the record shows that Wilbur furnished employee transportation. Although the magistrate sought to distinguish <em>Konopka </em>on the basis that the employment contract in this case did not provide for transportation, that it was \u201cstrictly voluntary on the part of the employees,\u201d and that \u201c[i]n <em>Konopka, </em>the employees all gathered at the employer\u2019s place of business, from which they were conveyed to the job site,\u201d the purported distinctions miss their mark. In light of all the attendant circumstances, it is clear to us that here, as in <em>Konopka, </em>there was an implied undertaking by Wilbur to provide transportation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b326-8\">Michael J. Kelly, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEI\">(dissenting). Because I believe that the trial court correctly interpreted the insurance contract, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">Ordinarily, this Court reviews a trial court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. A finding is clearly erroneous when, although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire record is left with a def-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>mite and firm conviction that a mistake was made. MCR 2.613; <em>Andrews v Pentwater Twp, </em>222 Mich App 491, 493; 563 NW2d 713 (1997). In this case, the trial court found that Michael Roe\u2019s injury \u201cdid not occur within the scope of [his] employment\u201d and \u201c[t]hus the plaintiff would have a duty to indemnify Wilbur and Maureen Roe.\u201d I fully agree with this determination, and I would not disturb it. When the language in the parties\u2019 contract for insurance is examined in light of existing case law, there is little basis upon which this Court could be left with a <em>definite and firm </em>conviction that the trial court was mistaken in granting judgment for defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Plaintiff has successfully convinced the majority that the following contractual exclusion shields it from its obligations to defendants, primarily \u201cbecause the exclusionary language ... is identical to that used in \u00a7 301 of the worker\u2019s compensation act\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">There is no coverage under coverage a:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-6\">1. FOR ANY BODILY INJURY to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-8\">B. ANY EMPLOYEE OF AN INSURED ARISING OUT OF HIS OR HER employment. This does not apply to a household employee who is not covered or required to be covered under any worker\u2019s compensation insurance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">When interpreting a contract of insurance, we construe exclusionary clauses strictly against the insurer. <em>Fire Ins Exchange v Diehl, </em>450 Mich 678, 687; 545 NW2d 602 (1996). Moreover, we interpret exclusionary clauses in isolation, reading them with the insuring agreement and independently of every other exclusion. <em>Hawkeye-Security Ins Co v Vector Const Co, </em>185 Mich App 369, 384; 460 NW2d 329 (1990). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>The majority opinion, I think, dilutes these principles of construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The majority inteiprets the exclusionary language in a manner consistent with the worker\u2019s compensation act because it finds that the exclusion contains language \u201cidentical\u201d to the worker\u2019s compensation law. This is plainly not so. The worker\u2019s compensation act covers injuries \u201carising out of and in the course of employment,\u201d MCL 418.301(1); MSA 17.237(301)(1), not just injuries \u201carising out of employment.\u201d By adding the phrase \u201cand in the course of employment\u201d into the exclusionary clause contained in the contract, the majority has reformed the contract. This is unfortunate, because this revisionary act completely ignores that our courts have treated the phrase \u201carising out of employment\u201d differently from the phrase \u201cin the course of employment\u201d for the purposes of the worker\u2019s disability compensation law, and whether the two phrases require separate tests remains an open question under Michigan law. See <em>Simkins v General Motors Corp, </em>453 Mich 703, 712-713, n 14, 724-725; 556 NW2d 839 (1997). Here, the insurer, a sophisticated business entity, purposefully chose not to employ the phrase \u201carising out of and in the course of employment,\u201d the words \u201cgenerally used ... to refer to the connection between the injury and employment,\u201d <em>id., </em>and yet contends that it intended to disclaim liability for injuries compensable under the worker\u2019s compensation law. This puiposeful omission of the phrase \u201cin the course of employment\u201d shows that plaintiff intended only to disclaim liability for injuries arising <em>directly </em>from the circumstances and conditions of employment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>\u201cIt is sufficient to say that an injury is received \u2018in the course of the employment when it comes while the workman is doing the duty which he is employed to perform. It \u2018arises out of the employment, when there is apparent to the rational mind, upon consideration of all the circumstances, a causal connection between the conditions under which the work is required to be performed, and the resulting injury. Under this test, if the injury can be seen to have followed as a natural incident of the work and to have been contemplated by a reasonable person familiar with the whole situation as a result of the exposure occasioned by the nature of the employment, then it arises \u2018out of the employment. But it excludes an injury which cannot fairly be traced to the employment as a contributing proximate cause and which comes from a hazard to which the workman would have been equally exposed apart from the employment. The causative danger must be peculiar to the work and not common to the neighborhood. It must be incidental to the character of the business and not independent of the relation of master and servant. It need not have been foreseen or expected, but after the event it must appear to have had its origins in a risk connected with the employment, and to have flowed from that source as a rational consequence.\u201d <em>[Appleford v Kimmel, </em>297 Mich 8, 12-13; 296 NW 861 (1941), quoting <em>McNicol\u2019s Case, </em>215 Mass 497; 102 NE 697 (1916); see also <em>Pearce v Michigan Home &amp; Training School, </em>231 Mich 536, 537-538; 204 NW 699 (1925). <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">By no stretch of the imagination can the injuries Michael Roe incurred in an automobile accident be considered \u201cpeculiar to the work\u201d he performed at his family\u2019s logging and sawmill business. Therefore, his injuries cannot be said to have arisen from his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>employment, although it may be fair to say that they arose from the more comprehensive \u201ccourse\u201d of his employment. See <em>Konopka v Jackson Co Rd Comm, </em>270 Mich 174, 176-177; 258 NW 429 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Unlike the majority, I find the case of <em>Francis v Scheper, </em>326 Mich 441; 40 NW2d 214 (1949), to be instructive. I believe that <em>Francis </em>is helpful not because the exclusionary language in the instant insurance contract tracks that of the exclusionary clause considered by the Supreme Court in <em>Francis, </em>which disclaimed liability for injuries incurred while the employee was \u201cengaged in the employment... of the insured,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 445, but because the Supreme Court stated the following, which should be the lodestar here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\">The phrase, \u201cengaged in the employment,\u201d can fairly be construed as meaning, active in the work plaintiff was employed and paid to do. <em>It was incumbent on defendant casualty company, who drafted the policy, in order to escape liability under the circumstances of this case, so to draft the policy as to make clear the extent of nonliability under the exclusion clause. [Id. </em>at 447-448 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">In this case, if, as it argues, plaintiff intended to disclaim liability for injuries covered by the worker\u2019s compensation disability law, it could have and should have made that intent clear. At the very least, plaintiff should have used language that actually is identical or comparable to the language used in the worker\u2019s compensation law. Because it did not do so, I would hold the insurer to the definition of the phrase \u201carising out of employment\u201d that prior case law sets forth. Further, it should be of no consequence that, in a separate provision, the insurance policy \u201calso excludes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>coverage for obligations of an insured or his insurer under any type of worker\u2019s compensation, disability, or similar law.\u201d After all, and as the majority correctly states, exclusionary clauses are to be read in isolation and independently of every other exclusion. <em>Hawkeye-Security, supra. </em>Lastly, I fail to see why this case has become a vehicle for advancing the policy considerations underlying the worker\u2019s compensation disability law. This case involves an inartfully drafted private contract between an insurer and an insured; it does not concern the employer\u2019s liability for disability payments. The majority states that the employer \u201cshould not be rewarded by having his no-fault insurer bear the costs of his decision to drop worker\u2019s compensation insurance.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 265, n 2. I do not consider the employer\u2019s attempt to hold the insurer to the terms of the insurance contract and gain the benefits for which the employer bargained and paid as a quest for an unjustified \u201creward.\u201d Quite the contrary. The majority has rewarded the insurer\u2019s ineptitude at the expense of the blue-collar logger who paid for coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">In light of these considerations, I would affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b329-7\"> The Supreme Court has found that <em>Whetro v Awkerman, </em>383 Mich 235; 174 NW2d 783 (1970), a case in which that Court stated, \u201cMichigan ... no longer requires the establishment of a proximately causal connection between the employment and the ipjury to entitle a claimant to compensation,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 242, has no precedential effect. <em>Dean v Chrysler Corp, </em>434 Mich 655, 660-661; 455 NW2d 699 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
