In this personal injury negligence action by an employee against her employers, plaintiff is not entitled to rely upon the provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>of section 5 of the Employers\u2019 Liability Law which, in an action arising out of the course of employment, make contributory negligence a defense to be pleaded and proved by the defendants. Not only does plaintiff\u2019s complaint fail to allege any statutory violation, but she has not complied with section 3 of the statute, which mandates notice to the employer of the time, place and cause of injury. Plaintiff is bound by the usual rule, as charged, that she must plead and prove her freedom from contributory negligence. Christ, Acting P. J., Brennan, Benjamin, Munder and Martuseello, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
