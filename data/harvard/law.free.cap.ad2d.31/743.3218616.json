P. L. Yacht Sales, Inc., by its service manager, Charles Smith. Order modified, on the law and the facts, by striking from the last ordering paragraph thereof the words \u201cbe strictly limited to the issues raised by the pleadings\u201d and by substituting in place thereof the words \u201cbe limited to matters which are material and necessary in the defense of the action.\u201d As so modified, order affirmed insofar as appealed from, without costs. In our opinion it was an improvident exercise of discretion to limit the examination of the witness Parker to the issues raised by the pleadings (CPLR 3101, subd. [a]; <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Crowell-Collier Pub. Co., </em>21 N Y 2d 403). Beldock, P. J., Christ, Benjamin, Munder and Martuscello, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
