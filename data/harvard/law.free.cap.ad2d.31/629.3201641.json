Order modified, on the law and in the exercise of discretion, by striking from the ordering paragraph everything following the word \"granted\u201d and :by substituting therefor the following: \u201c on condition that defendant stipulate that the third counterclaim set forth in his original answer is discontinued with prejudice.\u201d As so modified, order affirmed, without costs. Ho questions of fact have been considered. In our opinion, that portion of the order which offered to defendant the option of going forward with the third counterclaim or abandon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>ing it entirely is proper. The reason offered by defendant for discontinuing the counterclaim is specious and plaintiff has a substantial interest in having it proceed to final determination <em>(Matter of Cowles, </em>22 A D 2d 365, 370). However, that portion of the order which purports to effect a summary dismissal of the counterclaim is improper and should be stricken (cf. <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>3130 Grand Concourse, </em>23 A D 2d 555). Christ, Acting P. J., Rabin, Hopkins, Munder and Martuscello, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
