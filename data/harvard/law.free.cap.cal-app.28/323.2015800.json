But the defendant having filed an amended pleading after the demurrer to its original pleading was sustained, and the case having thereupon gone to trial and judgment, it must be held under the authorities in this state that it waived any error the court may have committed in so ruling. It is a well recognized rule that an amendment to any pleading after a demurrer is sustained thereto is a waiver of the right to object to any error in the sustaining of such demurrer. <em>(Ganceart </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>98 Cal. 281, [33 Pac. 92] ; <em>Brittan </em>v. <em>Oakland Bank of Savings, </em>112 Cal. 2, [44 Pac. 339]; <em>City of Plankinton </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>63 Fed. 416, [11 C.
