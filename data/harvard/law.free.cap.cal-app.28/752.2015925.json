In addition to the facts there referred to, it may be stated that the practically undisputed evidence in this ease discloses that if the plaintiffs were entitled to a writ of mandate, compelling the delivery of water for irrigating purposes upon their land, they were also entitled to damages as a result of the failure, refusal and neglect of the defendant to deliver such water during an entire irrigating season after a seasonable and proper demand for the same, and hence that the trial court was in error in declining to award damages in some amount to the plaintiffs after a finding in their favor upon the main issues in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">It follows that that portion of the said judgment from which the plaintiffs have appealed should be reversed, with instructions to the trial court to try anew the issue as to damages. And it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">Lennon, P. J., and Kerrigan, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">A petition for a rehearing of this cause was denied by the district court of appeal on December 9, 1915, and a petition to have the cause heard in the supreme court, after judgment in the district court of appeal, was denied by the supreme court on January 6, 1916.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
