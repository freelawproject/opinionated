The attorney-general, therefore, submitted the cause upon the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Rule II of the supreme court (160 Cal. xliii [119 Pac. x]) provides that, \u201cin criminal cases, the appellant shall file his points and authorities (with proof of service of a copy thereof on the attorney-general) within ten days after the filing of the transcript,\u201d and rule V (160 Cal. xlvi [119 Pac. x]) authorizes a dismissal of the appeal where such points and authorities are not so filed. \u201cThe reason of the last mentioned rule is that, since an appeal presupposes at least some debatable ground of complaint against the verdict and the manner of its procurement, it is the duty of the complaining party (the appellant) to point out the specific points upon which he seeks to support his appeal, and that it is not intended or contemplated that the reviewing court, unaided by appellant himself, shall make an independent investigation for the purpose of ascertaining whether he has been legally or illegally convicted of the offense charged against Mm.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mario, </em>18 Cal. App. 70, [122 Pac. 76]; see, also, <em>People </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>16 Cal. App. 771, [117 Pac. 1036].)</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">We may remark, however, that, although not required under the circumstances present herein to examine the record, we have taken the pains to read the testimony and the court\u2019s instructions, and thus have been persuaded to the conviction that the verdict is amply supported and the law applicable to the case correctly declared.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">The appeals are dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
