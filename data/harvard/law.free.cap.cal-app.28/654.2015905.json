This objection, however, does not appear to the court tenable. Section 1490 of the Penal Code, relied upon by the state, providing for the issuance of a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>for the purpose of giving bail, does not, in terms, purport to be an exclusive remedy, and an examination of the different sections contained in chapter I of title XII of the Penal Code, relating to writs of <em>habeas corpus, </em>fails to disclose any provision supporting the state\u2019s position upon this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>January, </em>70 Cal. 34, [11 Pac. 326], and <em>Ex parte Turner, </em>112 Cal. 629, [45 Pac. 571], the proceeding appears to have been identical with the case at bar. In other states having somewhat similar code provisions, a proceeding to admit to bail may be either an application for bail by motion or by writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>(5 Cyc. 86).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">While not an exclusive remedy, we are satisfied that an application by way of motion to the court in which a defendant\u2019s appeal is pending is a proper procedure and one of which the court has jurisdiction. This being an application to an appellate court for admission to bail after denial of a like petition in the trial court, it seems proper to ascertain and declare the rule which should be followed in such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">By section 1272 of the Penal Code admission to bail pending appeal is a matter of discretion, and by section 1291 of the same code the power to admit to bail is lodged in any magistrate having the power to issue a writ of <em>habeas corpus. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>This wide distribution of power necessitates the adoption and adherence to some consistent rule governing such proceedings, otherwise constant confusion would ensue.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">In the case of <em>People </em>v. <em>January, </em>70 Cal. 34, [11 Pac. 326], the court, speaking through Justice McKinstry, says: \u201cThis is an application to this court that the defendant be admitted to bail pending appeal. It does not appear- that any like application has been made to the superior court or a judge thereof. The power to admit a prisoner to bail pending an appeal taken by him from a judgment of conviction of felony ought not to be exercised by the supreme court in the first instance, nor until after the determination upon its merits of an application for bail before the judge who tried the cause. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Perdue, </em>48 Cal. 552.) \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">In <em>Ex parte Turner, </em>112 Cal. 627, 629, [45 Pac. 571], the application was made to the supreme court after denial of a similar application by the judge of the trial court, and the rule governing these proceedings was there declared as follows: \u201cAdmission to bail after conviction is purely a matter of discretion and not of right, and it has been several times held by the supreme court of this state that such discretion should not be exercised in favor of the liberation of a defendant pending appeal, except in instances where circumstances of an extraordinary character have intervened since conviction, which makes it obviously proper.\u201d Citing a number of cases, and then adding: \u201cThe discretion in cases of this kind is vested primarily in the court that tried the case, or the judge thereof <em>(People </em>v. <em>Perdue, </em>48 Cal. 552, <em>People </em>v. <em>January, </em>70 Cal. 34, [11 Pac. 326]), and the determination of the latter should not be disturbed or ignored except in an instance of manifest abuse. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\"><em>Ex parte Hatch, </em>15 Cal. App. 186, [114 Pac. 410], approves the rule herein stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">The case of <em>Ex parte Smith, </em>89 Cal. 79, [26 Pac. 638], has been cited as a limitation of this rule, but a careful reading of that case fails to justify such conclusion. The court, speaking through Justice Garoutte, did say: \u201cThis court passes upon the merits of the petition as presented to it, and regardless of any action or rule the trial court may have adopted,\u201d but this criticism is directed to the rule adopted by the trial court that bail would not be allowed to any one pending appeal from a conviction of felony. Such a rule on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>its face may very well be said to be an apparent abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">The opinion of the court in the Ward Case, 127 Cal. 489, [47 L. R. A. 466, 59 Pac. 894], is silent upon this question, and, therefore, is not an authority upon when an appellate court should or should not interfere with the determination of the court below, though it does lay down a very careful rule as to when the discretion to admit to bail should be exercised.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Adopting the rule which we believe to be wise and salutary, that an appellate court should not interfere with the determination of a trial court upon an application for bail pending appeal except in cases of manifest abuse, the question remains. Has the trial court in this case abused its discretion ?</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">The testimony of Dr. Cox, presented by way of affidavit, is chiefly relied upon by applicant and may be set forth as a fair statement of the defendant\u2019s condition. It is substantially as follows: \u201cDefendant gave me a history of having had a cough for the past three or four weeks, or more; he has lost some twenty-five pounds in weight, his hands are cold and clammy, with blueness of the nails; general circulation at a very low ebb, and temperature sub-normal. Examination of the lungs of defendant showed dullness in the right upper lobe, with a roughness of breath sounds over this area. While said defendant does not show any active tubercular lesion, he would be considered by the medical profession, generally, as being a border-line case, namely: If there is not now a tubercular lesion in his lungs, it is a very fertile field for tubercular invasion. I believe he should be put to rest in bed with proper nursing, good food, plenty of fresh air and sunlight, with proper tonic medication, so that his physical welfare may be guarded.\u201d Dr. Stephenson, another physician, testifies substantially as Dr. Cox, but adds that \u201can examination of the sputum revealed no tubercular bacilli; that the lesion of the right lung had been kindly arrested by nature\u201d; also refers to occasional night sweats and loss of appetite. \u201cThat the defendant\u2019s physical condition in his chest shows some improvement, but no improvement in other respects.\u201d Dr. Stephenson also adds that he believes Mr. Cornell\u2019s physical condition will be seriously, if not permanently, damaged by confinement under present conditions. Other physicians testify to substantially the same effect, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>also added, in substance, that they did not believe that the defendant was in imminent danger notwithstanding that his physical condition would be improved if he were given better attention and plenty of sunshine. There is nothing in the testimony showing that the county jail at Sacramento is either unsanitary or poorly kept, the chief objection being want of sunshine.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">The defendant is not a man of robust health; he does not appear to have been very strong at the time of his arrest, or at the time of his arraignment in June, 1915, but the record shows that he was under the constant supervision of the trial court for a considerable period of time. The defendant pleaded to the indictment in this case on the twenty-first day of June, 1915, his trial began September 13th and judgment was pronounced on September 20th. Almost a month later, on October 16th, the trial court passed upon his application for admission to bail pending appeal. During that period of time the trial court had an opportunity to determine whether confinement was or was not proving injurious to the defendant\u2014an opportunity which from the very nature of the case cannot be afforded any other court. With this opportunity, and the testimony before it, the trial court appears to have followed the rule laid down in the case of Turner, that \u201cthe evidence does not show that there is such imminence of dangerous results to the life or health of the defendant' as to obviously require his removal from the county jail at the present time.\u201d The trial court is also in a position to follow the remainder of the opinion in that case, to wit: \u201cShould more serious consequences of the defendant\u2019s confinement thereafter manifest themselves, and such as to render it proper that bail should be allowed, there is nothing to preclude another application for that purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">In the Ward case the supreme court had before it a condition which does not seem to be present here. There one reputable physician testified that in his opinion confinement in the jail under the conditions there existing, if continued two or three months, would result fatally. Another physician also testified that \u201cthe balance of chances is that if said Ward shall continue to be confined for a period of three months or more in said county jail, a fatal result will ensue.\u201d No such extraordinary circumstances appear from the testimony in this case. The most that can be said from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>testimony is that there is reasonable fear, not imminent danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">In <em>Ex parte Watson, </em>1 Okl. Cr. 595, [99 Pac. 161], a case strongly relied upon by the petitioner, bail before conviction was granted \u201cfor the sole reason that the defendant was suffering from pneumonia and other ailments, and that this continued confinement in said jail would greatly endanger his health and probably result in his death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">In 3 R. C. L., section 18, the rule is thus stated: \u201cSlight siclmess is not sufficient, since there are few persons who will not be injuriously affected by imprisonment. There must be strong grounds for apprehending a fatal result or permanent impairment of health.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">In the Turner case the evidence showed that \u201cthe prisoner was not, at the date of his being taken into custody, a man of robust health; that during his confinement his health had further declined, that he had lost flesh and strength to some extent, and that in the judgment of his physician there was danger arising from his present condition that his health might be permanently and dangerously affected by further confinement at the present time,\u201d which is somewhat stronger than the case at bar, yet the supreme court in that case held that a proper showing for admission to bail had not been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">As a further reason why bail should be granted herein the fact that a certificate of probable cause has been issued was urged upon the court, and that numerous errors were committed upon the trial. In these particulars we deem it sufficient answer to say that the issuance of a certificate of probable cause has become so common that this court would not be warranted in considering it either an evidence of illegal conviction or of the existence of reversible errors, and that such grounds constitute no reason for admission to bail pending appeal, and that the record in this cause has not been examined to ascertain whether reversible errors are shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">Being of the opinion that the trial court has not abused the exercise of its discretion herein, and that nothing of an extraordinary character has since intervened warranting the issuance of bail, the defendant\u2019s application is hereby denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">Chipman, P. J., and Burnett, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
