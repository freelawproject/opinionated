The court overruled a demurrer interposed to the petition and held the return insufficient in any statement of facts constituting a reason for not granting the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">The contention of appellants is that the record was not one required by law to be kept by the officers of the corporation, and hence petitioner was not entitled to an inspection thereof. In our opinion, the contention is wholly without merit. The board of directors as officers of the corporation are trustees of the stockholders \u201cand cannot, without being guilty of fraud, secure to themselves advantages not common to the latter.\u201d (Bigelow on Fraud, p. 248; <em>Farmers\u2019 &amp; Merchants\u2019 Bank </em>v. <em>Downey, </em>53 Cal. 468, [31 Am. Rep. 62].) The list containing the names and post-office addresses is shown to have been prepared by order of the board of directors acting as trustees for petitioner, who as principal was clearly entitled to inspect the list made at his expense and presumably for his benefit by his agents. Section 377 of the Civil Code, requires all corporations for profit to keep a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>record of their business transactions, which shall embrace every act done or ordered to be done: and section 565 of the Penal Code, provides that \u201cEvery officer or agent of any corporation, . . . who has in his custody or control any book, paper, or document of such corporation, and who refuses to give to a stockholder or member of such corporation, lawfully demanding, during office hours, to inspect or take a copy of the same, or any part thereof, a reasonable opportunity so to do, is guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d That petitioner as a stockholder in the corporation was entitled to have the writ issue, to our minds, admits of no doubt. Nor does the fact alleged in the answer, that in Ms desire to inspect the list he was actuated and prompted by an improper motive, affect the question. \u201cThe clear legal right given by the constitution and the statute cannot be defeated by stopping to inquire into motives.\u201d <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>Langdon, </em>135 Cal. 624, [87 Am. St. Rep. 156, 67 Pac. <em>1050].</em></p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Conrey, P. J., and James J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
