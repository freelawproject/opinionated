One of the counts in the complaint is for the reasonable value of caring for certain horses during a given time, which it is alleged the defendant promised to pay. The answer, in addition to denying this allegation in the language of the complaint, also set forth that the plaintiff agreed with the defendant to take care of the horses for a specified sum. The finding upon this phase of the controversy follows the language of the complaint in accordance with plaintiff\u2019s contention; hence the court, by necessary implication, found against the new and inconsistent matter set up in the answer. Aside from this, the appellant supporting his appeal by the judgment-roll alone, it necessarily follows that he has failed to show in this court that any evidence was introduced in proof of such new matter. We will presume, therefore, in favor of the correctness of the judgment and findings, that no evidence upon this phase of the case was in fact presented to the court <em>(Bliss </em>v. <em>Sneath, </em>119 Cal. 526, 529, [51 Pac. 848]).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">Lennon, P.
