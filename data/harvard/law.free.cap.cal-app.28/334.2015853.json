The confession of the defendant testified to by police officers contributed to the conviction of the defendant, and the error of the court, therefore, in refusing to permit the defendant to introduce testimony tending to prove that the confession was involuntary and induced by improper influences, was clearly prejudicial. In the ease of <em>People </em>v. <em>Cahill, </em>11 Cal. App. 685, 691, [106 Pac. 115], it was held that testimony on the question whether the confession was voluntary or not should be presented before the confession is admitted in evidence; that it is purely one of law, the determination of which is committed exclusively to the court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Soto, </em>49 Cal. 67, 70.)</p>\n<p id=\"b366-13\">When a confession is offered against a defendant on trial, and he objects to it, and offers to prove that it was procured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>by threats or promises, or under such circumstances as would render it incompetent, it is 'error to receive the confession without first hearing the proof offered and ruling upon the competency of the confession as evidence against the party making it. <em>(Ammos </em>v. <em>State, </em>80 Miss. 592, [92 Am. St. Rep. 607, 18 L. R. A. (N.
