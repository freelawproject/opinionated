Plaintiff prays for an injunction restraining the defendants from calling a special election for the purpose stated in said petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">The complaint was duly verified on March 8, 1915, and presumably was on that day presented to the court, as on March 8th the judge of the superior court of said county made an order reciting that it satisfactorily appeared to him from the complaint \u201cthat there are sufficient grounds for granting a temporary restraining order and an order to show cause why an injunction should not be granted\u201d and \u201can undertaking having been given by plaintiff herein as required by me, and approved, it is therefore ordered,\u201d etc., then follows the restraining order and an order to show cause why defendants should not be perpetually enjoined \u201cfrom ordering or calling a special election to be held, \u2019 \u2019 etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The defendants appeared by demurrer, which was overruled, and they have taken this appeal from, the order of March 8th, aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The appeal is directly to this court and, as the cause is one cognizable in equity, the jurisdiction is in the supreme court. (Const, art. VI, sec. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">This court is without jurisdiction to determine the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"A2c\">The cause is transferred to the supreme court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
