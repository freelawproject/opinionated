(Const, art. VI, sec. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">Although the court below found that the property involved here was worth the sum of $724.50 only, still the test of the authority of this court to entertain appeals in actions at law is to be found in the <em>ad damnum </em>clause of the complaint, which, in this case, as seen, calls for damages in the sum of three thousand dollars for the alleged wrongful taking and the conversion of the property in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">Therefore, the appeal in this cause is in the supreme court, to which tribunal it must be transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-12\">So ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
