It was alleged the alteration of the affidavit would, if the same had been legally made, have increased the pecuniary obligation of the State of Texas to the city of Laredo, and to the census trustees of said city.

The alteration of the same, changing the ages of the children so that they came within the legal benefit of the funds apportioned to the district, created a pecuniary obligation.

Under article 531 of the Penal Code, it is immaterial who made the original affidavit charged to be altered.

This has been held adversely to appellant. Her right is made so by law, and the law need\u2019not be pleaded. Thomas v. State, 18 Texas Crim. App., 222; Mee v. State, 23 Texas Crim.

In fact, the only contention of appellant is that the indictment is defective.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b477-6\">BROOKS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AqbA\">Appellant was convicted of forgery, and his punishment assessed at confinement in the penitentiary for a term of two years; hence this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">In the view we take of this case, it is only necessary to consider appellant\u2019s motion to quash the indictment, the first ground of which is \u201cthat the indictment charges no offense against the law.\u201d The facts, as stated in the indictment, show that appellant, after having enumerated the ages of the three children of Matea Harper de Knott, and as having been born in the years of 1892, 1895, and 1896, altered the dates of their birth so as to make it appear that they were born in 1885, 1888, and 1890, and thereby created a pecuniary obligation of the State of Texas and the city of Laredo, and to the census trustee of said city. Article 3964, Revised Statutes, as amended by General Laws, Called Session Twenty-fifth Legislature (1897), page 44, reads: \u201cThe scholastic census of each school district of this State shall be taken in the year 1898, and every year thereafter. The county superintendent of public instruction shall, on the first day of January of each year, or as soon as practical thereafter, appoint one of the trustees of each school district, or some other qualified person, to take said census, who shall be known as the census trustee of the district. It shall be the duty of the census trustee to take, between the first day of May and the first day of June after his appointment, a census of all the children that will be over eight and under seventeen years of age on the first day of the following September, and who are residents of the school district on said first day of May; and to make report under oath,\u201d etc. The indictment shows that the city of Laredo was a school district, and that appellant took the census of the children of Matea Harper de Knott on the 25th day of April, 1898. The law above quoted, governing school districts, states very explicitly that the census trustee must take the same \u201cbetween the first day of May and the first day of June.\u201d Therefore it follows that appellant took the census at a date not authorized under the law. And by another clause it is provided that the census trustee must enumerate all the children \u201cwho are residents of the school district on said first day of May.\u201d This clause of the statute makes it obligatory upon the census trustee not to commence his enumeration until that date; for how could he enumerate children that are residents of the district on the 1st day of May, when he commenced his enumeration on the 25th day of April. It is true, an inspection of another clause of the article quoted above indicates that the enumeration may commence on the 1st day of January, instead of May; but a casual inspection of this clause discloses the fact that it has sole and exclusive reference to the census of community counties, and does not apply to school districts or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>independent districts. It follows, therefore, that appellant\u2019s contention that the indictment charges no offense against the laws of the State of Texas is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The second ground of appellant\u2019s motion is \u201cbecause the indictment is repugnant.\u201d We think this objection is also well taken. We find that appellant, if he took the census of the children of Matea Harper de Knott, subscribed and swore her to the same as \u201ccensus trustee or sub-census trustee.\u201d There is no such office authorized under the law as a \u201csubcensus trustee.\u201d Therefore, having stated that he was \u201ccensus trustee or subcensus trustee,\u201d the allegations are repugnant, and in the alternative, and we are unable to tell in what capacity the indictment charged or sought to hold appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Appellant\u2019s sixth objection to the indictment is \u201cbecause, if the instrument had been made alone by the person whose act it is alleged to be, there is no allegation showing that such person had power or authority to appoint or create an obligation against the State of Texas.\u201d This objection, also, is tenable. We. have examined the indictment carefully, and it nowhere states how, or in what manner, or by whom, appellant was appointed or authorized to take the census. The indictment is fatally defective in these particulars, and the judgment is reversed, and the prosecution- ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
