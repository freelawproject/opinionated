D. Montgomery was her brother; that she remembered about the time her brother had abase in the County Court, but did not know the date; that she remembered her brother\u2019s case was dismissed; that she remembered her brother being a witness in a case in the County Court where John Humphries was defendant; that her brother left Waco this year (1898), but did not know whether it was last April or not; that \u201con the morning that my brother\u2019s case was called in the County Court, the witness Georgia Tippen, who had him arrested, did not show up, and he got the case dismissed. He came home, and I was sewing when he got there; when he came home I got up and came to town. When I got as far as Mr. Hathaway\u2019s, on Second Street, I met the deputy sheriff and he inquired for my brother; I told him I did not know where he was. I came on up to John Humphries\u2019 saloon. John was standing in the door and spoke to me, and came out on the sidewalk and asked me where I was going. Mr. Humphries stopped me there in front of his saloon on Sec- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>and Street. He stopped and asked me where my brother was. I said, \u2018Brother has just left my house/ He (Humphries) told me to tell him to lay low until night and catch the first out. I guess he meant the first train. I said, \u2018Yes, sir,\u2019 and stood there awhile, and then I started on, and he said, \u2018Where are you going ?\u2019 And he said, \u2018I want to give you some money to give L. D. Montgomery to leave town on.\u2019 I said all right. That was between 9 and 10 o\u2019clock, and he told me to come back at 4 that evening; so when the clock struck 4 I went back to the saloon. I asked John Irwin where John Humphries was, and he said he was in the back part of the saloon. He told him to come out, and John Humphries came to the door, and I said, \u2018Here I am,\u2019 and he said, \u2018I will give old man Jack Long some money to give you,\u2019 and he said, \u2018You give it to L. D. Montgomery, and tell him the sheriff is after him, and if they catch him they will give me hell.\u2019 He told me to go around in the wineroom, and John Humphries walked around behind the counter, and I went on in the wine-room, and Mr. Long came in and handed me four silver dollars, one twenty-five cent piece and two nickels. I carried the money on home with me. I did not see my brother any more until that night. When he came home that night I gave him the money and told him what John Humphries told me to tell him. He left town that night. * * * That four dollars and some cents was paid to me for my</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-5\">brother to leave town on. John told me that he wanted L. D. Montgomery to leave town to keep from appearing against him as a witness.\u201d L. D. Montgomery testified: \u201cI remember a case against me last fall or spring in the County Court. It was for aggravated assault. I remember some cases in the County Court against John Humphries. I was a witness in John Humphries\u2019 cases; was a witness in No. 11076, for keeping open on Sunday. I was in the County Court when John Humphries\u2019 cases were called, but I was there on a case of my own, not John Humphries\u2019. My case was dismissed. I do not know exactly that John Humphries\u2019 case was set for the same day. I left Waco on October 19th and was gone until March. One reason I left was the fine; the next reason was, I had been asked if I would leave. I had been asked by John Humphries on the morning of the trial if I would leave. We were down stairs in the hallway of the courthouse. I told him that I had not been summoned in his case for that day and I would leave. I agreed to leave. Nothing was said to me about money at all by him. I got money to leave on from my sister; that was on the night of October 19th. I got four dollars and a little over. * * * I left the County Court as soon as my case was dismissed, about 12 o\u2019clock. I left before the case of Mr. Humphries, that I was a witness in, was called. I heard the court had fined me after I left court and was going home. Tip to that time Mr. Humphries had not offered me any <em>money to </em>leave town on. I left town after I learned I had been fined $50. That fine was pending against me when I left; that is one reason I left\u2014the main reason. I was going to leave whether I got that money or not. I would have been there at John\u2019s trial if he had not asked me to leave, if I had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>been summoned. I had an agreement with Mr. Humphries before the trial for me to leave, but it was not made with him personally. I left by reason of that agreement. The agreement was that he was to pay that $57.95, and I was to leave town and stay until his ease was dismissed. 1 made that agreement with my sister at home. She told me what it was. She said that he said he would. I got $4 of that fifty. The only talk that I had with Mr. John Humphries about paying me any money was through a letter that he wrote me. There was no agreement made between me and Mr. John Humphries before I left that he was to pay my fine. I did not see him after I was fined. Before I left I had no agreement with him that he was to pay my fine, or that I was to be paid for leaving.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-5\">The court charged the law as to accomplice as to L.

Proc., art. 741; Irvin v. State, 1 Texas Crim. App., 302; Kelly v. State, 1 Texas Crim. App., 629; Freeman v. State, 11 Texas Crim. App., 95; Philips v. State, 17 Texas Crim. App., 175; Walker v. State, 37 S. W. Rep., 423; Bell v. State, 7 Jour. App., 421; see Willson\u2019s Crim. Stats., sec. 2450, for other cases collated on the subject.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-10\">The evidence having inculpated the State\u2019s witness Minnie Montgomery by her own testimony, as well as that of her brother, as an accomplice, the duty was devolved upon the court to charge the law of accomplice as respected her testimony, whether requested or not. Kelly v. State, 1 Texas Crim. App., 637; Hines v. State, 27 Texas Crim. App., 125; Sitterlee v. State, 13 Texas Crim. App., 587; Winn v. State, 15 Texas Crim. App., 169; Anderson v.

App., 421.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-3\">The court erred in refusing to charge the doctrine of circumstantial evidence, in view of the fact that Minnie Montgomery and L. D. Montgomery were accomplices, the court charging the jury that the latter was such, and the evidence showing each of said witnesses to be accomplices, which left the case of defendant dependent on circumstances, if in fact there was any evidence.

The charge is that the bribery was for the purpose of disobeying a subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The first error assigned is the failure of the court to apply the law in regard to accomplice testimony to the evidence of Minnie Montgomery, a witness for the State. This matter was also made the first ground of the motion for new trial. The statement of facts discloses that appellant stood charged in the County Court with a violation of the Sunday law. The record in that cause showed that a subpoena had been served upon L. D. Montgomery as a witness in behalf of the State. It was also shown that Montgomery had pending against him a case of aggravated assault in the same court. On the morning of the 19th of November, 1897, Montgomery\u2019s case was called, and the prosecution dismissed. Appellant requested Montgomery to leave, and he did leave the courthouse, and went about the town of Waco. Appellant\u2019s case was called on the same morning, and the trial commenced. During the progress of the trial it was discovered that Montgomery was not present. Appellant then consented to a withdrawal of the case from the jury, and its continuance to the next term of court. A fine of $50 was entered against the witness Montgomery. At the subsequent term the case was again continued on account of Montgomery\u2019s absence; and at the March term, 1898, of said court, the case was dismissed on account of his continued absence. After appellant\u2019s case was withdrawn from the jury and continued, the witness Minnie Montgomery (sister of L. D. Montgomery) was passing along the street in Waco, near appellant\u2019s place of business, when appellant hailed and had a conversation with her in regard to her brother, L. D. Montgomery. During said conversation appellant made an appointment with said Minnie at his place of business at 4 o\u2019clock that evening for the purpose of giving her money to bear the expense of her brother, L. D. Montgomery, in leaving McLennan Count). The appointment was kept by the parties, and appellant, through John Long, gave her four dollars and thirty or thirty-five cents for her brother; that she returned home, and that night gave the money to her brother, and stated to him the request of appellant that he should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>leave on the first train. The witness L. D. Montgomery left, and was gone until subsequent to the dismissal of appellant\u2019s case in the County Court. It is placed beyond cavil that the conversations between Minnie Montgomery and defendant with regard to her brother, and the money conveyed by her to the brother, were for the purpose of his leaving McLennan County to avoid appearing against appellant as a witness. This she thoroughly understood, and to prove these facts she was used by the State as a witness. The court failed to charge the jury the law in regard to accomplice testimony as applied to her evidence. There can be no question that under the state of case shown by the record she was an accomplice. When used as a witness, and under an indictment charging her as a principal in this transaction, this testimony, if true, would have sustained a conviction against her. In this connection it may also be stated that the whole record makes the fact evident that appellant in person did not at any time or place offer the witness L. D. Montgomery any consideration as an inducement for him to leave McLennan County, or fail to appear as a witness against him. It is true that defendant requested him to leave at the courthouse, but Montgomery says that at that time he did not say anything about money or any other consideration for his leaving. So, the only wajr by which the witness was bribed, if bribed, was through his sister Minnie Montgomery, and subsequent to his leaving the courthouse. This is the State\u2019s case. Appellant was not even present at the time of the conversation between Minnie and her brother, or when the money was paid by her to her brother. There was no meeting between appellant and L. D. Montgomery from the time he disappeared from the courthouse in the morning of November 1, 1897, until subsequent to March, 1898. Because the court failed to charge the law in regard to accomplice testimony as applied to the evidence of Minnie Montgomery, this judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">There is also another reversible error apparent from the record. The indictment charges that the bribe was given in order to secure a disobedience of the subpoena served upon L. D. Montgomery. The witness L. D. Montgomery testified that he had never been subpoenaed to appear before the County Court in said case; and the State offered no proof upon this question, save the introduction of the subpoena itself. Without going into the probative force of this subpoena and the return thereon, suffice it to say that after its introduction the court withdrew it from the consideration of the jury, save that with other records in the case, to show that such a case was pending; and instructed them that they could consider it for no other purpose. Then we have the case without any proof as to the fact that the party was summoned as a witness, and a direct contradiction of that fact by the witness himself. It seems that this left the case without anjr proof of the fact that a subpoena had ever been served upon the witness, and therefore there was nothing for him to disobey. The officer who made the alleged return upon the subpoena was not introduced as a witness; and in fact, as the case stands, there was no evidence introduced to show that the subpoena <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>had ever been served upon the witness. It may be questioned, even if the subpoena with the return thereon had remained before the jury, whether this would have been evidence of the fact that the witness had been summoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-3\">We would suggest, in view of another trial, that it may be advisable to put two counts in the indictment, one charging appellant as a principal, and the other as an accomplice. Inasmuch as the judgment must be reversed upon the other two grounds,'we deem it unnecessary to enter into a discussion of this phase of the case. The judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
