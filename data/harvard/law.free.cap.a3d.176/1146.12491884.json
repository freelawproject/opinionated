When the action had been pending for almost one year, the plaintiff withdrew its action as a matter of right under \u00a7 52-80 prior to any hearing on the merits. The defendant thereafter sought an award of attorney's fees pursuant to \u00a7 42-150bb. The trial court denied the defendant's motion for attorney's fees, and the Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.

We conclude that, in certain circumstances, \u00a7 42-150bb permits an award of attorney's fees to a defendant when a plaintiff withdraws an action as of right prior to a hearing on the merits and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following undisputed facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. On May 24, 2004, the defendant executed a mortgage, which was secured by a parcel of residential property located at 465 Greenwood Street in the city of Bridgeport, and a promissory note in the amount of $216,500, which was made payable to Guaranty Residential Lending, Inc. On June 27, 2012, the plaintiff commenced the present foreclosure action alleging, inter alia, that the mortgage had been assigned to it and that the defendant had failed to make payments on the note. The plaintiff further alleged that, pursuant to an acceleration clause, it had demanded full payment of the note's balance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The defendant filed an answer to the plaintiff's complaint, admitting only that he was in possession of the property. The defendant also asserted two special defenses, each contending that the plaintiff lacked standing to bring the action. The plaintiff filed a motion\n   for summary judgment, arguing that there was no genuine issue of material fact and that it was entitled to foreclose on the mortgage as a matter of law. The defendant objected to the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, contending that there were several unresolved genuine issues of material fact, including whether the plaintiff owned the note and was entitled to enforce it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before the trial court ruled, however, the plaintiff withdrew its motion for summary\n   judgment. Shortly thereafter, the plaintiff withdrew the present action as a matter of right pursuant to \u00a7 52-80. The plaintiff did not provide any reason for these withdrawals. The defendant subsequently filed a motion for an award of attorney's fees pursuant to \u00a7 42-150bb, claiming that he had \"successfully defended\" the present action as a result of the plaintiff's withdrawal of the underlying complaint. The plaintiff objected to the defendant's motion, asserting, among other things, that it had an absolute right to withdraw the action pursuant to \u00a7 52-80, and that such a withdrawal, prior to any hearing on the merits or the rendering of a judgment, does not constitute a successful defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The trial court denied the defendant's motion for an award of attorney's fees. The trial court agreed that the plaintiff's withdrawal of the action as a matter of right pursuant to \u00a7 52-80, prior to any hearing on the merits, did not mean that the defendant had \"successfully defended\" the action. According to the court, there were \"a myriad of reasons that the plaintiff withdrew the action, including but not limited to the plaintiff deciding that it did not want to redeem the property.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial\n   court reasoned further that, \"[i]f the defendant's claim were accepted, lenders would be unreasonably exposed to claims for attorney's fees every time a lender withdrew a foreclosure action.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendant appealed from the trial court's judgment to the Appellate Court, which affirmed.\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Housing Finance Authority\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Alfaro\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=163%20Conn.%20App.%20587\">\n    163 Conn.

The Appellate Court reviewed the trial court's decision for clear error only, reasoning that the question of whether the defendant had \"successfully defend[ed]\" the action was a factual one to which deference should be afforded. Id., at 592,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=135%20A.3d%201256\">\n    135 A.3d 1256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Appellate Court concluded that, because the plaintiff's withdrawal of the action could have been for any reason, and there was no evidence offered to prove that withdrawal resulted from the special defenses, the defendant had failed to meet his evidentiary burden of establishing an entitlement to attorney's fees. Id., at 593-94,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=135%20A.3d%201256\">\n    135 A.3d 1256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Appellate Court did not engage in any statutory construction of \u00a7 42-150bb, although it observed that, \"to successfully defend an action, a consumer party must prevail on the merits of [an] answer or special [defense].\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., at 593,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=135%20A.3d%201256\">\n    135 A.3d 1256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, the Appellate Court declined to reach the question of whether a plaintiff's withdrawal of an action, as of right, in response to a special defense could ever constitute a successful defense as contemplated by \u00a7 42-150bb, because the defendant had not established the factual predicate for such a claim in the present case. Id., at 591,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=135%20A.3d%201256\">\n    135 A.3d 1256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendant argues that, given the language used in \u00a7 42-150bb and that provision's legislative history, he was not required to prevail on the merits of his special defense, or to defeat the underlying obligation, in order to show that he had successfully defended the present foreclosure action. According to the defendant, a plaintiff's withdrawal of its action, as of right, can qualify as a successful defense. Specifically, the defendant contends that the withdrawal of the present action followed, and was prompted by, his contesting of the plaintiff's standing. Moreover, the defendant claims the Appellate Court improperly required him to provide further evidence of the reason for the plaintiff's withdrawal of the action, because this information was uniquely in control of the plaintiff and provides an unworkable standard that is inconsistent with the statute's remedial purpose.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree that, in certain circumstances, a plaintiff's withdrawal of an action as of right under \u00a7 52-80 prior to a hearing on the merits may constitute a successful defense, entitling the defendant to attorney's fees pursuant to \u00a7 42-150bb. Consequently, we conclude that the Appellate Court improperly affirmed the judgment of the trial court on the ground that the defendant had failed to meet his burden of establishing his right to attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We begin with the standard of review. Because the defendant's claim requires us to construe the meaning and scope of the phrase \"successfully ... defends,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   in \u00a7 42-150bb, our review is de novo.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491008\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/170/662/#p29\">\n    327 Conn. 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 29,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491008\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/170/662/#p29\">\n    170 A.3d 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017) (questions of statutory construction present issues of law subject to plenary review). \"When construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature....

The word \"successful\" is defined with substantial similarity in a number of dictionaries. The American Heritage College Dictionary (4th Ed. 2002) defines \"successful\" as \"[h]aving a favorable outcome,\" and \"[h]aving obtained something desired or intended ....\" Similarly, Webster's Third New International Dictionary (2002) defines \"successful\" as \"resulting or terminating in success,\" \"gaining or having gained success,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   and \"having the desired effect ....\" The word \"defend\" is also defined with substantial similarity in a number of dictionaries. The American Heritage College Dictionary, supra, defines \"defend\" as \"[t]o make or keep safe from danger, attack, or harm.\" Webster's New Third International Dictionary, supra, defines \"defend\" as \"to deny or oppose the right of the plaintiff [in regard to] a suit or a wrong charged,\" \"to oppose or resist [a] claim at law,\" and \"to contest [a] suit.\" Black's Law Dictionary (4th Ed. 1968) similarly defines \"defend\" as follows: \"To prohibit or forbid. To deny. To contest and endeavor to defeat a claim or demand made against one in a court of justice.\" Likewise, Black's Law Dictionary (10th Ed. 2014) defines \"defend\" as follows: \"To do something to protect someone or something from attack.... To use arguments to protect someone or something from criticism or to prove that something is right.... To do something, to stop something from being taken away or to make it possible for something to continue.\" These definitions suggest that the legislature intended \"successfully ... defends\" to include\n   any resolution of the matter in which the party obtains the desired result of warding off an attack made by the action, regardless of whether there was a resolution on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We next examine \u00a7 42-150bb in relation to other statutes. First, we examine \u00a7 52-80, which allowed the plaintiff in the present case to withdraw the action prior to a hearing on the merits. The language codified in \u00a7 52-80 was in existence long before the legislature enacted \u00a7 42-150bb in 1979, yet the legislature did not seek to exclude actions that were withdrawn as a matter of right from the attorney's fees provisions in \u00a7 42-150bb. See General Statutes (1949 Rev.) \u00a7 7801; Public Acts 1979, No. 79-453. In construing statutes, we presume that the legislature has created \"a harmonious and consistent body of law ....\" (Internal quotation marks\n   omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Hartford/Windsor Healthcare Properties, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hartford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344696\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/298/191/#p198\">\n    298 Conn. 191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 198,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=3%20A.3d%2056\">\n    3 A.3d 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). \"We are entitled to presume that, in passing a statute, the legislature not only did so with knowledge of the existing statutes but also that it did not intend to enact a conflicting statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Perille\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Raybestos-Manhattan-Europe, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"692412\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/196/529/#p541\">\n    196 Conn. 529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 541,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=494%20A.2d%20555\">\n    494 A.2d 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985). With this principle in mind, the legislature's decision not to exclude matters that are withdrawn pursuant to \u00a7 52-80 from the provisions of \u00a7 42-150bb lends further support to interpreting \u00a7 42-150bb in a manner that allows for attorney's fees when an action is withdrawn, as of right, prior to a hearing on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Furthermore, General Statutes \u00a7 52-81 is also relevant to understanding how a defendant in a civil action that is withdrawn under \u00a7 52-80 is treated. Section 52-81 provides in relevant part: \"Upon the withdrawal of any civil action after it has been returned to court and entered upon the docket, and after an appearance has been entered for the defendant, a judgment for costs, if claimed by him, shall be rendered in his favor, but not otherwise....\" Therefore, \u00a7 52-81 entitles a defendant in an action voluntarily withdrawn by a plaintiff to recover costs in the same manner as a defendant in an action in which there has been a determination on the merits in the defendant's favor. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-257. Section 52-81 was in existence at the time the legislature adopted \u00a7 42-150bb in 1979. See General Statutes (1949 Rev.) \u00a7 7802; Public Acts 1979, No. 79-453. As a result, we presume that the legislature was aware of that provision. Accordingly, the presence of \u00a7 52-81 further supports the idea that the legislature intended for a defendant in an action that has been withdrawn to be treated similarly to when there has been a determination on the merits in the defendant's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The plaintiff asserts, however that the term \"successfully ... defends\" in \u00a7 42-150bb may be read interchangeably with \"prevailing party.\" Indeed, the plaintiff cites to cases that have interpreted \u00a7 42-150bb in a manner requiring consumers to \"prevail\" in order to obtain attorney's fees. See\n   <em>\n    Wilkes\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Thomson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=155%20Conn.%20App.%20278\">\n    155 Conn.

Conn. 2009). Relying on language from those cases, the plaintiff contends that a prevailing party includes only those defendants that have succeeded \"on the merits of their answer or special defenses.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilkes\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Thomson\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 283,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=109%20A.3d%20543\">\n    109 A.3d 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In further support of its position, the plaintiff cites various definitions of the term \"prevailing party.\" See Black's Law Dictionary (4th Ed. 1968) (defining \"prevailing party\" as \"[t]hat one of the parties to a suit who successfully prosecutes the action or successfully defends against it, prevailing on the main issue, even though not to the extent of its original contention\"); see also\n   Black's Law Dictionary (10th Ed. 2014) (defining \"prevailing party\" as \"[a] party in whose favor a judgment is rendered, regardless of the amount of damages awarded\"). Although not controlling, these prior interpretations of \u00a7 42-150bb, together with the definitions on which they are based, demonstrate that the plaintiff's proposed interpretation of \u00a7 42-150bb is plausible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On the basis of our review of the plain language of \u00a7 42-150bb and other related statutes, we conclude that both parties' proffered interpretations are reasonable and that \u00a7 42-150bb is, therefore, ambiguous. Specifically, we deem plausible the defendant's reading of \u00a7 42-150bb, which reads the term \"successfully ... defends\" in a manner permitting an award of attorney's fees following a withdrawal of an action before a hearing on the merits. We also find reasonable, however, the plaintiffs' understanding of \u00a7 42-150bb, which requires a party to demonstrate that it has prevailed on the\n   merits of an action in order to be awarded attorney's fees. Accordingly, pursuant to \u00a7 1-2z, we turn to extratextual sources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The legislative history surrounding the enactment of 42-150bb was discussed by this court in\n   <em>\n    Rizzo Pool Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Del Grosso\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1613224\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/240/58/#p74\">\n    240 Conn. 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 74,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=689%20A.2d%201097\">\n    689 A.2d 1097\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997). \"In 1979, [the legislature] enacted No. 79-453 of the 1979 Public Acts, entitled 'An Act Concerning Attorney's Fee Clauses in Consumer Contracts.' ...

It would be wholly incongruous with the design of \u00a7 42-150bb to allow a commercial party to avoid paying attorney's fees simply by withdrawing the action pursuant to \u00a7 52-80. Indeed, if we were to interpret \"successfully ... defends\" in the manner the plaintiff proposes, a commercial party that becomes aware, either through the consumer's defense or through its own discovery, of problems in successfully prosecuting its action, could simply withdraw the action to avoid paying the attorney's fees that it has required the consumer to incur. We conclude that allowing for such a result when a consumer has been required to defend an action would be wholly inconsistent\n   with the recognized legislative purpose behind \u00a7 42-150bb. Instead, we conclude that, when a consumer moves for attorney's fees under \u00a7 42-150bb and is able to show that a commercial party has withdrawn an action, the burden then shifts to the commercial party to demonstrate that the withdrawal was unrelated to the defense mounted by the consumer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Furthermore, interpreting \u00a7 42-150bb in a manner that allows for attorney's fees in the event of a voluntary withdrawal pursuant to \u00a7 52-80 is consistent with the approach taken by other states. \"In applying a statute providing for an award of costs to the 'prevailing party' or the 'successful party' to cases in which the plaintiff had voluntarily dismissed his action, the courts have generally held that the defendant in such a case is entitled to recover his costs as the 'prevailing party' ....\" ( Footnote omitted.)

Thereafter, the plaintiff did not provide any evidence that it had withdrawn the action for a reason unrelated to the defense mounted by the defendant. Indeed, although the plaintiff's counsel may have asserted that the defendant's bankruptcy in federal court prohibited the current action, it did not introduce any evidence on that issue, and the trial court did not make a specific factual finding on that issue. See footnote 5 of this opinion. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court incorrectly denied the defendant's motion for attorney's fees. The Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, concluding that the defendant did not meet his burden of demonstrating that the withdrawal of the action was as a result of his defense. Having now clarified that once the consumer asserts that the action was withdrawn pursuant to \u00a7 52-80 as a result of the consumer's actions, the burden then\n   shifts back to the commercial party to demonstrate that the withdrawal was not a result of the consumer's defense, we conclude that the Appellate Court incorrectly affirmed the judgment of the trial court and that the case must be\n   remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Once the defendant seeks attorney's fees on the ground that the action has been voluntarily withdrawn by the plaintiff as a result of the defendant's actions, the trial court must then make a factual determination, by a preponderance of the evidence, as to whether the withdrawal is a result of the defendant's defense.

The plaintiff's concern that fees will be awarded for \"meritless defenses or no defenses at all\" is baseless, as the trial court has the discretion to disallow attorney's fees in cases in which defense counsel took little or no action that resulted in the plaintiff's voluntary withdrawal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We conclude, therefore, that the trial court is permitted to make findings regarding the reasons for the plaintiff's withdrawal of an action. The findings need not be made after a full evidentiary hearing. Instead, once a defendant moves for an award of attorney's fees pursuant to \u00a7 42-150bb after a termination of proceedings that in some way favors the defendant, there exists a rebuttable presumption that the defendant is entitled to such fees unless the plaintiff can show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the withdrawal occurred because of some reason other than the actions taken by the defendant's counsel. The plaintiff can show its reasons for withdrawing the action through affidavits, and it is for the trial court to determine whether an award of attorney's fees is proper in light of the totality of the circumstances. The trial court, after reviewing the affidavits, may wish to conduct a hearing to resolve any questions created; however, the trial court is not required to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to reverse the judgment of the trial court and to remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In this opinion ROGERS, C. J., and PALMER, McDONALD and ROBINSON, Js., concurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   ESPINOSA, J., with whom, D'AURIA, J., joins, dissenting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   This certified appeal requires us to interpret the meaning of the phrase \"successfully ... defends an action,\" as used in General Statutes \u00a7 42-150bb,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   where a commercial party plaintiff, here, the plaintiff, the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority, has withdrawn an action as a matter of right prior to any hearing on the merits pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-80,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a defendant-consumer, the defendant Asdrubal Alfaro, thereafter seeks attorney's fees.

I interpret the operative statutory language in \u00a7 42-150bb to require a defendant to win-or actually to prevail in-the action, as evidenced by a \"[material] alter[ation] [of] the legal relationship between the parties ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Wallerstein\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Stew Leonard's Dairy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"358018\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/258/299/#p304\">\n    258 Conn. 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 304,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=780%20A.2d%20916\">\n    780 A.2d 916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001). A material alteration of the legal relationship between the parties does not occur when a plaintiff withdraws its action as a matter of right. Put another way, all that the defendant gains when the plaintiff withdraws its action as of right is a return to the status quo, which means that an action could be\n   brought against him again tomorrow. That is not winning. Thus, I disagree with the majority and, accordingly, respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   To begin, I agree with the facts and procedural background as set forth by the majority opinion and, thus, I need not repeat them in this dissent. I also agree with the majority that, in determining the meaning of the phrase \"successfully ... defends\" in \u00a7 42-150bb, we apply plenary review in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Mayer\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Historic District Commission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489691\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/160/333/#p774\">\n    325 Conn. 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 774,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489691\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/160/333/#p774\">\n    160 A.3d 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   I turn first to the statutory text, as \u00a7 1-2z requires. Section 42-150bb provides in relevant part that in an action on a consumer contract that provides for recovery of attorney's fees by the commercial party, \"an attorney's fee shall be awarded as a matter of law to the consumer who successfully prosecutes or defends\" that action. Because \"the statute does not define the phrase ['successfully ... defends an action'], in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a), we look to the common understanding expressed in dictionaries in order to afford the term its ordinary meaning.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Elianah T.-T.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12490239\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/165/1236/#p620\">\n    326 Conn. 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 622,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12490239\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/165/1236/#p620\">\n    165 A.3d 1236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   I agree with the majority that the definitions of the component terms \"successfully\" and \"defend\" fail to provide a single unambiguous meaning to the phrase as used in \u00a7 42-150bb. My review of the definitions of the terms in \u00a7 42-150bb leads me to conclude, however, that \"successfully defend\" is the functional equivalent of \"prevailing party.\" Specifically, the occurrence of the phrase \"successfully ... defends\" in the definition of\n   \"[p]revailing party\" in Black's Law Dictionary (5th Ed. 1979), a review of related statutes, and the contextual usage of \"successfully ... defends an action\" in \u00a7 42-150bb provide further clarity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The phrase \"successfully defends\" appears in Black's Law Dictionary, supra, as part of the definition of \"[p]revailing party,\" which specifically provides in relevant part: \"The party to a suit who successfully prosecutes the action or successfully defends against it, prevailing on the main issue, even though not necessarily to the extent of his original contention....\" This definition of prevailing party hews very closely to the ordinary understanding that is created when one combines the definitions of the component words of the phrase \"successfully ... defends an action,\" and is functionally equivalent.

Moreover, the term \"successfully prosecutes\" accompanies the term \"successfully defends\" in the definition of \"[p]revailing party\" in Black's Law Dictionary, supra, strongly supporting an understanding that \"successfully prosecutes\" and \"successfully defends\" are interrelated terms and, depending on the context, functional equivalents to \"[p]revailing party.\" Following this relationship to its logical conclusion in the context of \u00a7 42-150bb, if a successful prosecution requires a party to prove the underlying claim in an action; see\n   <em>\n    Blake\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Levy\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 261,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=464%20A.2d%2052\">\n    464 A.2d 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; then a successful defense may be interpreted similarly to require a party to\n   <em>\n    disprove\n   </em>\n   the underlying claim in an action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Disproving a claim on its merits is not the same as winning a case by default because the opposing party has withdrawn as a matter of right. In the latter situation, the defendant's efforts have not caused the withdrawal, and no change to the parties' legal relationship has occurred. Rather, the withdrawal results from the plaintiff's voluntary choice and not from a successful defense. Accordingly, I reject the majority's contention that one may win an action by virtue of the opposing party's voluntary withdrawal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The majority relies on General Statutes \u00a7 52-81 as support for its contention that costs are due to a defendant whenever a civil action is withdrawn. Although \u00a7 52-81 sets forth when costs are due following a\n   withdrawal under \u00a7 52-80, its scope has not been interpreted by this court. Further, nothing in \u00a7 52-81 indicates that the defendant will be awarded costs when a determination in his favor is made on the merits. Moreover, costs are different from attorney's fees, and neither \u00a7 52-80 nor \u00a7 52-81 discusses attorney's fees. Thus, I am persuaded that the specific attorney's fees statutes discussed previously, \u00a7 52-257 for civil actions and \u00a7 52-240a for product liability, are relevant to interpreting the award of attorney's fees under \u00a7 42-150bb, but \u00a7 52-81 is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The majority contends that individual definitions of \"successful\" and \"defend\" support an understanding that \"successfully ... defends\" means \"any resolution of the matter in which the party obtains the desired result of warding off an attack made by the action, regardless of whether there was a resolution on the merits.\" I agree generally that the definitions of these individual terms may reasonably support a commonly understood meaning of \"successfully ... defends an action\" as encompassing temporary relief from a legal action, unaccompanied by a resolution on the merits. I contend, however, as previously explained, that an\n   interpretation of the operative statutory phrase is incomplete without consideration of the related term \"prevailing party,\" a review of related statutes and the linked phrase, \"successfully prosecutes.\" Thus, although I ultimately determine that my view of the common understanding of \"successfully ... defends an action\" is persuasive, I agree with the majority that the phrase \"successfully ... defends an action\" is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation and, therefore, ambiguous when read in the context of a withdrawal as a matter of right prior to a hearing on the merits. This ambiguity requires us to consider extratextual evidence. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Mayer\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Historic District Commission\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489691\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/160/333/#p774\">\n    325 Conn. at 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489691\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/160/333/#p774\">\n    160 A.3d 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter .... The test to determine ambiguity is whether the statute, when read in context, is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.\" [Internal quotation marks omitted.] ). Unlike the majority, however, I conclude, after reviewing such evidence, that one who \"successfully ... defends an action,\" as contemplated by \u00a7 42-150bb, is functionally equivalent to a prevailing party. A prevailing party is one who wins a lawsuit, which is demonstrated by a material alteration of the parties' legal relationship. A successful defense, in my view, cannot occur when the plaintiff withdraws its action as a matter of right prior to a hearing on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   I observe initially that the legal origin of the rebuttable presumption recognized by the majority, which is that attorney's fees are owed to a defendant once he has asserted that the plaintiff withdrew its action as a\n   matter of right pursuant to \u00a7 52-80 as a result of the defendant's actions, unless the plaintiff provides as alternative reason for the withdrawal, is far from clear. The text and legislative history of \u00a7 42-150bb do not provide support for the majority's interpretation, and it is otherwise unexplained. Despite citing to decisions in the courts of other states, the majority does not provide any case law that explicates this rebuttable presumption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The majority's interpretation employs a rationale similar to the catalyst theory, which was discarded by the United States Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Buckhannon Board &amp; Care Home, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    West Virginia Dept. of Health &amp; Human Resources\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301812\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/598/\">\n    532 U.S. 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301812\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/598/\">\n    121 S.

The catalyst theory posits that attorney's fees are owed to a party who demonstrates that its actions catalyzed the \"desired result\" by bringing \"about a voluntary change in the [opposing party's] conduct.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301812\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/598/\">\n    Id., at 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301812\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/598/\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1835\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It is particularly instructive that in rejecting the catalyst theory, the court cited to the principle that \"[o]nly when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims ... has there been a determination of the substantial rights of the parties ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301812\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/598/\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   The majority claims that its interpretation is necessary to ensure that a commercial party does not unilaterally withdraw in order to avoid paying attorney's fees where problems in successfully prosecuting an action have been revealed. I note that the United States Supreme Court, in construing the analogous term, \"prevailing party,\" rejected a similar argument that \"the 'catalyst theory' is necessary to prevent [parties] from unilaterally mooting an action before judgment in an effort to avoid an award of attorney's\n   fees\" as \"entirely speculative and unsupported by any empirical evidence ....\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301812\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/598/\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Although federal precedent is not binding on this court, I find this analysis persuasive and applicable to the present case. See\n   <em>\n    Lyme Land Conservation Trust, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Platner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489665\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/159/666/#p759\">\n    325 Conn. 737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 759,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489665\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/159/666/#p759\">\n    159 A.3d 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017) ( \"Connecticut follows the American rule\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Moreover, this method of proving that one party catalyzed the result sets up a system of competing affidavits where the trial court must then make factual determinations on why, precisely, an action was withdrawn. To make these determinations where both parties offer plausible reasons for the withdrawal, the trial court may need to hold an evidentiary hearing to hear a witness or to obtain other evidence. This not only causes more litigation in a situation where a case would otherwise be concluded, but also may raise questions of fact and credibility determinations. For instance, when faced with a need to prove its withdrawal was not due to the defendant's actions, a plaintiff may contend that it realized it would require too much money or effort or time to pursue the case to a conclusion, because it knows the defendant will fight every step of the process. Making the necessary factual findings in this situation places a burden on the trial court that is detrimental to judicial economy and requires the parties, including consumers, to use more resources. See\n   <em>\n    Buckhannon Board &amp; Care Home, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    West Virginia Dept. of Health &amp; Human Resources\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301812\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/598/\">\n    532 U.S. at 609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301812\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/598/\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1835\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (observing that \"[a] request for attorney's fees should not result in a second major litigation,\" and that the court has \"accordingly avoided an interpretation of the fee-shifting statutes that would have spawn[ed] a second litigation of significant dimension\" [citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted] ). Moreover, a policy permitting voluntary withdrawals is intended to avoid litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In my review of extratextual evidence, I turn first to the legislative history of \u00a7 42-150bb. As discussed by the majority, the legislative history has been interpreted previously by this court. We explained that \u00a7 42-150bb\"was designed to provide equitable results for a consumer who successfully defended an action under a commercial contract [providing that] the commercial party ... was entitled to attorney's fees.\"\n   <em>\n    Aaron Manor, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Irving\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=307%20Conn.%20608\">\n    307 Conn. 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 617-18,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=57%20A.3d%20342\">\n    57 A.3d 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013) ; see also\n   <em>\n    Rizzo Pool Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Del Grosso\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1613224\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/240/58/#p74\">\n    240 Conn. 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 74-76,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=689%20A.2d%201097\">\n    689 A.2d 1097\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997) (discussing legislative history of \u00a7 42-150bb ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The majority claims that the legislative intent of assuring parity between commercial parties and consumers supports its interpretation of \u00a7 42-150bb as being pro-consumer. I disagree. The majority's rule could give rise to incentives that have a decidedly anti-consumer effect. For instance, the majority's rule may cause a plaintiff to continue pursuing a case in order to avoid liability for the defendant's attorney's fees even in situations in which the plaintiff might have determined on its own not to pursue the case. I also disagree with the majority's claim that its interpretation protects consumers because it prevents a commercial party plaintiff from withdrawing to avoid attorney's fees. This argument ignores an already existing deterrent. Under the existing rules, commercial party plaintiffs are already selective about the lawsuits they bring. Specifically, a plaintiff is disincentivized from bringing a lawsuit by the fact that, pursuant to \u00a7 42-150bb, if the case goes to judgment and the defendant prevails, the plaintiff would be liable for attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The majority also alleges that my interpretation of \u00a7 42-150bb is anti-consumer. I disagree. By enabling withdrawals as of right without additional burdens of proof, my interpretation supports the goal of ending litigation sooner. From a policy standpoint, this promotes\n   judicial economy, which benefits all parties, including consumers. The majority's interpretation runs counter to principles of judicial economy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In interpreting the phrase \"successfully ... defends an action\" in the present case, I observe that the word \"defends\" was added only after the suggestion of Attorney Raphael Podolsky, speaking on behalf of the Legal Services Legislative Office in support of Senate Bill No. 1559.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Attorney Podolsky explained that, as originally drafted, the bill said \"that it makes [attorney's fees] reciprocal to the consumer who successfully prosecutes an action or a counterclaim. Most cases in which the consumer will be involved, the consumer will be the defendant. And, if the consumer prevails in defending a suit, he should also get the benefit of the reciprocal attorney's fees, so it ought to say who successfully prosecutes or defends an action or a counterclaim. You need that to have a true reciprocity under the bill.\" Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 3, 1979 Sess., p. 801. It is logical to infer that the subsequent incorporation of the phrase \"successfully ... defends an action\" into the draft statute was intended to ensure that the \"consumer [who] prevails in defending a suit\" is the recipient of fees, as advocated by Podolsky. The concept of \"prevailing\" relating to the operative phrase was reinforced by Senator Alfred Santaniello, Jr., who similarly stated that fees would be owed \"to the prevailing debtor who successfully prosecutes or defends an action ....\" 22 S. Proc., Pt. 8, 1979 Sess., p. 2542.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   My interpretation of \u00a7 42-150bb also finds support in background principles concerning attorney's fees. Connecticut follows \"[t]he general rule of law known as the American rule .... [Under this rule] attorney's fees and ordinary expenses and burdens of litigation are not allowed to the successful party absent a contractual or statutory exception.\" (Internal quotation\n   marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Rizzo Pool Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Del Grosso\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1613224\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/240/58/#p74\">\n    240 Conn. at 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=689%20A.2d%201097\">\n    689 A.2d 1097\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, as we have explained previously in this opinion, although \u00a7 42-150bb was intended to provide parity, the genesis of that provision was to protect consumers in light of the fact that form contracts typically provided for attorney's fees to commercial entities. See 22 H.R. Proc., supra, pp. 7487-90. Second, because the plaintiff has the ability to voluntarily withdraw the action, it is necessary to allow for attorney's fees, even without a determination on the merits, so as to protect the defendant if a plaintiff withdraws the action after learning that the action will be unsuccessful as a result of the defendant's actions. Third, allowing the plaintiff to avoid paying the defendant's attorney's fees in the event it can demonstrate that the withdrawal was unrelated to the defense mounted by the defendant furthers the legislative intent of parity.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    Although the dissent acknowledges that the legislative history demonstrates that \u00a7 42-150bb was enacted to provide parity for consumers because commercial contracts typically already provided attorney's fees for commercial entities, the interpretation of \u00a7 42-150bb proposed by the dissent does not provide such parity. Instead, the dissent requires that there be a \"material alteration of the legal relationship between the parties.\" Under the interpretation proposed by the dissent, a commercial entity could initiate an action requiring its consumer to incur significant attorney's fees, the consumer could then demonstrate that the action would ultimately be unsuccessful by filing a persuasive dispositive motion, and then the commercial entity could avoid attorney's fees by voluntarily withdrawing the action before the court has had a chance to rule. On the other hand, our interpretation provides for parity between commercial entities and consumers by allowing commercial entities to demonstrate that a withdrawal was not as a result of its consumer's defense. Furthermore, that determination by the trial court and the ability for a consumer to move for a judgment for costs under \u00a7 52-81 are arguably a \"material alteration of the legal relationship between the parties.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    The dissent asserts that our interpretation of \u00a7 42-150bb\"employs a rationale similar to the catalyst theory, which was discarded by the United States Supreme Court in\n    <em>\n     Buckhannon Board &amp; Care Home, Inc.\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     West Virginia Dept. of Health &amp; Human Resources\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301812\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/598/\">\n     532 U.S. 598\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301812\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/598/\">\n     121 S.Ct. 1835\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301812\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/598/\">\n     149 L.Ed. 2d 855\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2001).\" We disagree. Our interpretation of \u00a7 42-150bb is not based on the catalyst theory; it is based on unique statutory language in \u00a7 42-150bb, the legislative history underlying its enactment, and precedent from other jurisdictions. Furthermore, although a majority of the United States Supreme Court rejected the catalyst theory, Justice Ginsburg, joined by Justices Stevens, Souter, and Breyer dissented. In that dissent, Justice Ginsburg explained as follows: \"The [c]ourt today holds that a plaintiff whose suit prompts the precise relief she seeks does not 'prevail,' and hence cannot obtain an award of attorney's fees, unless she also secures a court entry memorializing her victory.... The decision allows a defendant to escape a statutory obligation to pay a plaintiff's counsel fees, even though the suit's merit led the defendant to abandon the fray, to switch rather than fight on, to accord plaintiff sooner rather than later the principal redress sought in the complaint. Concomitantly, the [c]ourt's constricted definition of 'prevailing party,' and consequent rejection of the 'catalyst theory,' impede access to court for the less well heeled, and shrink the incentive Congress created for the enforcement of federal law by private attorneys general.... Nothing in history, precedent, or plain English warrants the anemic construction of the term 'prevailing party' the [c]ourt today imposes.\"\n    <em>\n     Buckhannon Board &amp; Care Home, Inc.\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     West Virginia Dept. of Health &amp; Human Resources\n    </em>\n    , supra, at 622-23,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301812\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/598/\">\n     121 S.Ct. 1835\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    General Statutes \u00a7 42-150bb provides in relevant part: \"Whenever any contract or lease ... to which a consumer is a party, provides for the attorney's fee of the commercial party to be paid by the consumer, an attorney's fee shall be awarded as a matter of law to the consumer who successfully prosecutes or defends an action or a counterclaim based upon the contract or lease....\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    General Statutes \u00a7 52-80 provides in relevant part: \"The plaintiff may withdraw any action ... returned to and entered in the docket of any court, before the commencement of a hearing on the merits thereof.
