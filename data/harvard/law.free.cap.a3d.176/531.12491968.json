The plaintiff commenced this action against the defendants, the city of New Haven (city), the Board of Education of the City of New Haven (board), and Garth Harries, the Superintendent of New Haven Public Schools,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   seeking damages for, inter alia, their negligent supervision of\n   students\n   pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-557n (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the defendants claim, inter alia, that the trial court improperly held that the plaintiff satisfied the imminent harm to identifiable persons exception to governmental immunity, which this court recently clarified in\n   <em>\n    Haynes\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Middletown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=314%20Conn.%20303\">\n    314 Conn. 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=101%20A.3d%20249\">\n    101 A.3d 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). The plaintiff disagrees, and also claims, as an alternative ground for affirming the judgment of the trial court, that the defendants failed to plead governmental immunity as a special defense in the operative answer. We conclude that the plaintiff has failed to prove that the defendants' conduct had subjected an identifiable person to imminent harm. We also conclude that the trial court implicitly granted the defendants' request to amend their answer to plead governmental immunity as a special defense. Accordingly, we reverse in part the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record reveals the following facts, as found by the trial court, and procedural history relevant to our resolution of this appeal. On March 19, 2013, the plaintiff, who was eleven years old, attended the Engineering Science University Magnet School (school) in New Haven. Upon his arrival at the school that day, the\n   plaintiff went to the auditorium to eat breakfast and wait for classes to start. At that time, a teacher, David Scott Stewart, was present in the auditorium because the principal had assigned him to supervise student behavior. There were between seventy and seventy-five students in the auditorium that morning. While there, the plaintiff observed two female students running around the auditorium chasing after one of the plaintiff's friends. Stewart did not see the students running because he was talking to other students at the time. One of the female students had safety scissors in her hand as she ran. As that female student approached the plaintiff, the scissors fell to the ground. The plaintiff and the other female student bent down to retrieve the scissors and, as that female student lifted the open scissors from the ground, she accidentally cut the plaintiff on the left side of his face.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The plaintiff's laceration began to bleed, so he went to the bathroom with his friend to tend to the injury. Other students advised another teacher, Karissa Stolzman, of the incident. Stolzman went to the bathroom and gave the plaintiff paper towels to care for the cut and then took him to the main office. Stolzman then reported the incident to the principal and filed an incident report. The school informed the plaintiff's parents of the incident and called an ambulance to transport him to a hospital emergency room for treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The plaintiff subsequently commenced this action against the defendants, seeking\n   monetary damages for his injuries. In the operative complaint, the plaintiff alleged that the defendants had failed to supervise the students in the auditorium properly. The plaintiff further alleged that the defendants failed to inspect the premises properly to ascertain the presence of dangerous objects, and, as such, they failed to remove the dangerous object that caused his injuries. The plaintiff also alleged that the defendants and their agents, servants\n   or employees were negligent, and that the action was being brought pursuant to \u00a7 52-557n. The defendants filed their first answer on July 29, 2015, which denied the plaintiff's allegations of negligence. On September 11, 2015, the defendants filed a request for leave to amend their answer to include, inter alia, the special defense of governmental immunity. The trial court never explicitly ruled on that motion for leave to amend the answer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The matter was tried to the court, which found in favor of the plaintiff on counts one and two of the complaint. Specifically, the trial court concluded that the plaintiff satisfied the imminent harm to identifiable persons exception to governmental immunity under the standard articulated in\n   <em>\n    Haynes\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Middletown\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=314%20Conn.%20303\">\n    314 Conn. at 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=101%20A.3d%20249\">\n    101 A.3d 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The trial court rendered judgment on counts one and two of the complaint awarding the plaintiff past economic damages of $2814.19, future economic damages of $3000, and noneconomic damages of $35,000. The trial court rendered judgment against the plaintiff on the remaining three counts of the complaint. See footnote 5 of this opinion. This appeal followed. See footnote 6 of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On appeal, the defendants claim, inter alia, that the trial court improperly concluded that the plaintiff was an identifiable person subject to imminent harm. The plaintiff disagrees and also posits, as an alternative ground for affirmance, that the defendants failed to plead the special defense of governmental immunity in the operative answer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   We address these issues in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We first address the question of whether the trial court properly determined that the plaintiff met his burden of proving the imminent harm to identifiable persons exception to governmental immunity. Specifically, the defendants contend that, because the trial court did not identify how the harm was imminent, the plaintiff could not be found to be an identifiable person. Additionally, the defendants argue that the trial court did not identify the dangerous condition or explain how that dangerous condition was apparent to Stewart. Finally, the defendants contend that the trial court's reliance on whether the harm was foreseeable is improper because this court rejected that standard in\n   <em>\n    Haynes\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Middletown\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=314%20Conn.%20303\">\n    314 Conn. at 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=101%20A.3d%20249\">\n    101 A.3d 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In response, the plaintiff contends that the trial court properly concluded that he was a member of an identifiable class of victims as a student at school during school hours. Moreover, the plaintiff further contends that the dangerous condition was students running with scissors and that it was, or should have been, apparent to Stewart that the plaintiff was in danger of imminent harm. To this end, the plaintiff argues that\n   <em>\n    Haynes\n   </em>\n   did not reject the foreseeability standard; rather, it rejected the notion that foreseeability was limited only to temporal and geographical considerations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Our analysis begins with a review of the law concerning governmental immunity, including the imminent harm to identifiable persons exception. \"[ Section] 52-557n abandons the common-law principle of municipal sovereign immunity and establishes the circumstances in which a municipality may be liable for damages.... One such circumstance is a negligent act or omission of a municipal officer acting within the scope of his or her employment or official duties.... [Section] 52-557n (a) (2) (B), however, explicitly shields a municipality from liability for damages to person or property caused by the negligent acts or omissions which require the exercise of judgment or discretion as an official function of the authority expressly or impliedly granted by law.\" (Citation omitted; footnote omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Edgerton\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Clinton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=311%20Conn.%20217\">\n    311 Conn. 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 229,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=86%20A.3d%20437\">\n    86 A.3d 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"This court has recognized an exception to discretionary act immunity that allows for liability when the circumstances make it apparent to the public officer that his or her failure to act would be likely to subject an identifiable person to imminent harm ....

First, there is no evidence that possessing safety scissors in the auditorium violated any school policy. On the contrary, Stolzman testified that there was no prohibition on students having these safety scissors at school. Additionally, Stewart testified that he had never experienced any behavioral problems with any of the students involved. There is also no evidence that any\n   similar incident had occurred in the past that would have alerted the defendants that additional safety procedures were needed in the auditorium. In fact, Stewart never previously had experienced problems caused by any dangerous student behavior in the auditorium, students running with scissors or otherwise. Moreover, Stewart saw neither the students running nor the safety scissors. Unlike the broken locker and student horseplay in the locker room in\n   <em>\n    Haynes\n   </em>\n   , which the school had been aware was a problem since the beginning of the school year;\n   <em>\n    Haynes\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Middletown\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=314%20Conn.%20303\">\n    314 Conn. at 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=101%20A.3d%20249\">\n    101 A.3d 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; the defendants had not experienced any problems with student behavior in the auditorium. Thus, the defendants had no reasonable way to anticipate that a student would be cut in the course of attempting to pick up safety scissors in the auditorium at the same time as another student. Similar to the defendants in\n   <em>\n    Strycharz\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cady\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487866\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/148/1011/#p574\">\n    323 Conn. at 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487866\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/148/1011/#p574\">\n    148 A.3d 1011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , it was not apparent to the defendants that any harm was imminent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, we conclude\n   that the trial court improperly determined that the plaintiff satisfied the imminent harm to identifiable persons exception to governmental immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We now turn to the plaintiff's alternative ground for affirmance, namely, that the defendants failed to plead governmental immunity as a special defense in their operative answer and, as such, this is simply a negligence\n   case. In response, the defendants contend that the plaintiff failed to raise this issue distinctly before the trial court, and, thus, the trial court was \"under no obligation to decide the question.\" Practice Book \u00a7 5-2. Additionally, the defendants argue that the plaintiff did not adequately brief this issue on appeal because he failed to cite to any legal authority in support of his position. We conclude that the trial court implicitly granted the defendants' request for permission to amend their answer to plead governmental immunity as a defense, and that the plaintiff failed to show that the trial court abused its discretion by allowing that amendment to the pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The record reveals the following additional relevant facts and procedural history. In response to the plaintiff's complaint, the defendants filed their first answer on July 29, 2015. That answer denied the plaintiff's allegations of negligence but failed to raise any special defenses. Thereafter, on September 11, 2015, the defendants filed a request for leave to amend their answer to include certain special defenses. In the attached amended answer, the defendants asserted four special defenses, specifically, that (1) the plaintiff's claims were barred by the doctrine of governmental immunity pursuant to \u00a7 52-557n, (2) the plaintiff's claims for damages were barred by \u00a7 52-557n (b) (6),\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (3) the plaintiff's complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, and (4) the intervening and superseding acts and omissions of the other students caused the plaintiff's injuries. On September 25, 2015, the plaintiff filed an objection to that motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At the conclusion of the trial, the defendants reminded the court that \"there was an amended answer to the plaintiff's complaint, [dated] September 11, 2015, which the plaintiff objected to, but it was never resolved. And there [is] the [defense] of governmental immunity in our amended answer.\" The plaintiff responded that the motion was never decided by the court, so the original July 29, 2015 answer was the operative pleading. At that time, the trial court did not resolve the issue, but instead responded, \"[a]ll right,\" and then proceeded to explain that it was reserving decision on an unrelated motion to dismiss filed by the defendants. Subsequently, the trial court issued a memorandum of decision concluding that the plaintiff had satisfied the imminent harm to identifiable persons exception to governmental immunity.

The trial court's memorandum of decision treats the special defense of governmental immunity as the primary issue to be resolved in the present case. Nearly the entire decision is devoted to addressing governmental immunity and the exception for imminent harm to an identifiable person. Nowhere in the memorandum of decision does the trial court treat the matter as \"simply a negligence case,\" as the plaintiff now attempts to characterize it. Accordingly, we disagree with the plaintiff's claim that the defendants never pleaded the special defense of governmental immunity, because the record demonstrates that the trial court granted-albeit implicitly-the defendants' motion for permission to amend their answer. Moreover, because the plaintiff does not argue that the trial court abused its discretion by granting the defendants' motion for permission to amend their answer,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   we do\n   not disturb\n   the trial court's decision to allow the defendants to assert the special defense of governmental immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The judgment is reversed as to counts one and two of the plaintiff's complaint and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment for the defendants on those counts; the judgment is affirmed in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In this opinion ROGERS, C.J., and PALMER, McDONALD, D'AURIA and ESPINOSA, Js., concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    We note that the present action was commenced on behalf of Anthony Martinez by and through his mother, Luz Mercado, as next friend and parent, who was also listed as a plaintiff in her individual capacity.

Accordingly, we agree with the plaintiff and the trial court that the school officials' duty to protect the plaintiff from imminent harm attached once he arrived at school on the day of the accident.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487866\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/148/1011/#p574\">\n    Id., at 576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487866\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/148/1011/#p574\">\n    148 A.3d 1011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, I agree with the majority that there can be no question that the trial court was correct when it found that the plaintiff was an identifiable victim in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Regarding the issue of imminent harm, I respectfully disagree with the majority opinion. In my view, this incident cannot be regarded as an isolated event of two children going to pick up a pair of safety scissors and one accidently getting cut. Rather, I view the case as a failure to\n   supervise the continuum of activity that revolved around two students, one of whom had safety\n   scissors in her hand, chasing another student. In my opinion, this activity, which the trial court found began after Stewart, the assigned supervisor, arrived at 9:15 a.m. and continued for a period of time thereafter, should have been stopped prior to the scissors being dropped. The plaintiff certainly presented enough evidence to allow a determination of fact by the trial court, which was acting as the finder of fact in the present case. The trial court found facts in favor of the plaintiff, and I do not believe that we should be interfering with those findings because they are not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Strycharz\n   </em>\n   , this court held that, \"[b]ecause we are unable to conclude, on the basis of the record before us, that a reasonable juror could find that the circumstances were such that the defendants would have been aware of this problem, the defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on this claim.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487866\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/148/1011/#p574\">\n    Id., at 590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487866\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/148/1011/#p574\">\n    148 A.3d 1011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, in the present case, a teacher specially assigned to an auditorium to supervise students, most of whom are eating breakfast, would have been aware of children running around the auditorium. At the very least, this issue presents a question for the finder of fact-namely, whether it would have been apparent to Stewart that, unless he acted, there was a risk of imminent harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Moreover, I disagree, respectfully, with the majority when it downplays the nature of the harm that may be caused by safety scissors. For instance, the majority states that \"there is no evidence that possessing safety scissors in the auditorium violated any school policy.\" While that fact may be true, it belies the real issue, which is whether there was a policy against either horseplay or children running after one another. Even if a specific policy does not exist, in my view, the situation presented an issue of fact that a risk of imminent harm existed. There was certainly a risk of imminent harm created by the horseplay. The child with the scissors\n   could have fallen on the scissors and injured herself or others in the process of the fall. The fact that a child was injured while attempting to pick up the scissors, after the scissors dropped during the horseplay, while unfortunate, was certainly understandable as a direct result of the horseplay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Second, the majority states that \"[t]here is also no evidence that any similar incident had occurred in the past that would have alerted the defendants that additional safety procedures were needed in the auditorium. In fact, Stewart never previously had experienced problems caused by any dangerous student behavior in the auditorium, students running with scissors or otherwise.\" This was an incident of horseplay. The question of whether such conduct had occurred previously, while important from a notice standpoint for the defendant, does not change the fact that a fact finder could reasonably find that that conduct created a risk of imminent harm. There may not have been a need for additional safety procedures if the teacher had been attentive to his duties of supervision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Third, the majority states that \"[m]oreover, Stewart saw neither the students running nor the safety scissors.\" Respectfully, this is the central point of my disagreement with the majority. As we stated in\n   <em>\n    Strycharz\n   </em>\n   , the question is whether a reasonable fact finder could find that a teacher \"would\" have been aware of this problem if he had been executing his duties properly.\n   <em>\n    Strycharz\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cady\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487866\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/148/1011/#p574\">\n    323 Conn. at 590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487866\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/148/1011/#p574\">\n    148 A.3d 1011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Certainly, it cannot be enough to excuse one charged with the duty of supervising young schoolchildren that he did not see the challenged activity in a room that he was in charge of\n   supervising. Indeed, if that were the case, every teacher charged with supervision could escape liability by saying that he or she never saw the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In my view, the present case is very similar to\n   <em>\n    Haynes\n   </em>\n   , in which this court held that \"[t]he jury reasonably could\n   have inferred from this evidence that the dangerous condition was apparent to school officials. Although this evidence is far from compelling, we are unable to conclude that no reasonable juror could find that it was apparent to school officials that, in combination, the ongoing problem of horseplay in the locker room and the presence of the broken locker were so likely to cause an injury to a student that the officials had a clear and unequivocal duty to act immediately to prevent the harm either by supervising the students ... to prevent horseplay or by fixing the broken locker.\" (Footnote omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Haynes\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Middletown\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=314%20Conn.%20303\">\n    314 Conn. at 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=101%20A.3d%20249\">\n    101 A.3d 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In my view, this case is even stronger than\n   <em>\n    Haynes\n   </em>\n   because, in that case, a teacher was not present in the locker room. In the present case, a teacher was physically present in the auditorium. Thus, in my view, a reasonable fact finder could find that it would have been apparent to Stewart that students were engaging in horseplay with a pair of scissors, and that Stewart had a clear and unequivocal duty to act immediately to prevent the horseplay and potential injury. It is axiomatic that the purpose of assigning a teacher to the auditorium was to maintain order, answer questions, and promote student safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   I note that the majority has criticized the clarity of the trial court's decision. However, \"an opinion must be read as a whole, without particular portions read in isolation, to discern the parameters of its holding.\"\n   <em>\n    Fisher\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Big Y Foods, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343792\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/298/414/#p424\">\n    298 Conn. 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 424-25,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=3%20A.3d%20919\">\n    3 A.3d 919\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). Furthermore, \"[w]e read an ambiguous trial court record so as to support, rather than contradict, its judgment.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Matza\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Matza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"738706\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/226/166/#p187\">\n    226 Conn. 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 187,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=627%20A.2d%20414\">\n    627 A.2d 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993). In the present case, the trial court applied the proper law to the facts. On the basis of the trial court's findings, I would affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Therefore, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    I note that Luz Mercado is also named as a plaintiff in the present action.
