(Afford), claims that the trial court\n   improperly denied its motion to discharge its obligation on a surety bail bond.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Afford claims that the\n   court, in denying its motion, improperly concluded that: (1) the standard for demonstrating \"good cause\" for discharge of an obligation upon a surety bail bond pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 38-23\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   is the standard first set forth in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Taintor\n   </em>\n   , 83 U.S. (16 Wall.) 366, 369-70,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"411266\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/83/366/\">\n    21 L.Ed. 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1872), rather than a more holistic, equitable assessment; and (2) the failure of the defendant in error, the state of Connecticut, to extradite the criminal defendant, Jay Garcia, after representing that it would do so, was not relevant to the court's good cause determination. The state argues that the requirement of good cause for discharge of the obligation upon the surety bond pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-65c and aspects of the common-law rule in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   as explicated in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sheriff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6775803\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/301/617/\">\n    301 Conn. 617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20A.3d%20808\">\n    21 A.3d 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011), were not satisfied. We conclude that the trial court properly denied Afford's motion to discharge its obligation on the surety bond and, therefore, we dismiss the writ of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following allegations of fact by Afford and procedural history are necessary for our resolution of this writ of error.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the underlying criminal case, the criminal defendant, who identified himself to police as Garcia, was arrested and charged with robbery in the first\n   degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134, conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 52a-134, larceny in the sixth degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-125b, and conspiracy to commit larceny in the sixth degree in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 53a-125b. These crimes were alleged to have been committed on or about December 20, 2014. Garcia was arraigned in court on December 22, 2014. Bond was set at $75,000 and the case was continued to February 3, 2015. Garcia subsequently executed a $75,000 bond with surety for his appearance at future court dates. Afford is the surety on the bond. On February 3, 2015, Garcia failed to appear and the court ordered Afford's bond forfeited and imposed a six month statutory stay pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-65a.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 29, 2015, Afford filed a motion to vacate bond forfeiture. In its motion, it asserted the following: \"Upon being arrested by the local authorities, [Garcia] was processed. However, the true identity of [Garcia] was never verified or his passport seized, due to the fact that he is an\n   illegal immigrant. [Garcia's] legal name is Jonatan Lovis Mattos....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"Subsequent to the offense date in which [Garcia] was criminally charged (December 20, 2014), [Afford] became bo[u]nd by a bail bond, as surety, in the amount of $75,000 for the appearance of [Garcia]....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"Following the issuance of the bond, [Garcia] was ordered by this court to appear on February 3, 2015. [Garcia] failed to appear for his scheduled court hearing and a rearrest [order] was issued....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"It was discovered that on February 22, 2015, [Garcia] fled the jurisdiction of the United States from Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks ... and absconded to Lima, Peru.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"Officer Nestor Silva Angeles, of the National Police of Peru-Division of Criminal Investigations, has confirmed the location of [Garcia].\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"The country of Peru will not detain the defendant unless the state ... extradites him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"It is presumed that the Office of the State's Attorney [in] New Britain will decline to seek extradition of [Garcia] given his location in another country....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"The bond was written by an agent of [Afford], who was not authorized to write bonds for subjects who are classified as undocumented, and as a result, [this agent's employment] was terminated from [Afford's] company.\" (Footnotes added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On July 21, 2015, the court denied Afford's motion and declined to vacate the forfeiture ordered on the bond. On August 3, 2015, Afford filed a motion for extension of satisfaction of the bond forfeiture, which was denied on August 4, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On September 4, 2015, Afford filed a motion for reconsideration of its motion for extension of satisfaction of the bond forfeiture and a motion to compel the extradition of Garcia. In the latter motion, Afford alleged that the denial of its motion to vacate the bond forfeiture on July 24, 2015, was exclusively based on the fact that the state had represented that it would extradite Garcia and had initiated the extradition process. On September 4, 2015, the court granted Afford's motion for reconsideration of its motion for extension of satisfaction of the bond forfeiture and extended the stay of the forfeiture of the bond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On October 6, 2015, the court heard argument on Afford's motion to compel extradition. Afford also again moved, by way of an oral motion, to have its obligation on the bond discharged pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 38-23.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Counsel for Afford provided two arguments in support of its motion to discharge. First, Afford's counsel alleged that the state made a representation in court three months earlier that it would extradite Garcia back to the United States and that it should be compelled to take the necessary steps to extradite Garcia and provide written documentation of such efforts within thirty days. In the alternative, counsel requested that Afford's obligation on the bond be vacated due to the state's\n   lack of action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response to this argument, the state's attorney indicated: \"It has been made clear that we certainly intend to extradite [Garcia].... I don't know what inquiries were made, but this is a fully extraditable offense. That the bondman should not be let off the bond for that reason because it's extraditable and because we intend to extradite once the Peruvian authorities notify us that [Garcia] is in custody.\" Counsel for Afford responded that the state's attorney had not taken any steps to put an extradition into place. The court indicated that the state had no obligation to seek extradition and denied the motion to compel extradition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Second, counsel for Afford argued that its \"rogue agents,\" for their own monetary gain, lied about Garcia's alienage to obtain authorization to write the bond. Rather than rule on Afford's oral motion to discharge its obligation on the bond at that time, the court continued the hearing and indicated that it would terminate the stay that had been imposed on the bond forfeiture 2 p.m. on December 14, 2015, if there was no further information from Afford by that time, and provided Afford with an opportunity to provide affidavits substantiating its allegations of fraud on the part of its rogue agents, to produce Garcia on that date or to prove that an extradition had been initiated by that date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Subsequently, on December 8, 2015, Afford filed two affidavits signed by Shane Burby, the owner of Afford, and William Munck, its operations manager. According to both Munck and Burby, former employees named Daniel Ruiz and Jesus Agosto provided them with \"false and omitting\" information as to the status of Garcia's employment. The affidavits stated that their agents also\n   falsely advised them that Garcia was a United States citizen and his father was a former police officer. This erroneous information led them to believe that Garcia was not a flight risk, resulting in approval of the bond without requiring collateral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On December 14, 2015, the court, after a hearing, denied Afford's oral motion to discharge its obligation on the surety bond and again denied its motion to compel extradition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   On December 30, 2015, Afford filed this writ of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On February 6, 2016, the court issued a written memorandum of decision articulating its reasons for its denial of Afford's oral motion for discharge of its obligation on the bond and motion to compel extradition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court stated: \"[Afford's] arguments and the facts upon which it relies do not entitle [Afford] to any relief from this court because they do not constitute good cause .... This court notes that [Afford] was not entitled to an order vacating bond forfeiture pursuant to ... \u00a7 54-65c because it did not provide proof of [Garcia's]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   incarceration in or removal to another country. No proof was provided because [Garcia] was not, in fact, incarcerated in Peru, or removed to Peru .... It was the wilful act of the accused which caused his departure from this country and his nonappearance for trial, not an act of God, an act of the obligee, or an act of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"The [representation by the] state's attorney's [office] ... that it will extradite [Garcia] is not relevant to the question at hand.... The [state] was not a party to the agreement between [Garcia] and [Afford], and did not promise, when the bond was executed, to extradite [Garcia] in the event that he flees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"Likewise, the actions of [Afford's] agents in executing the bond are not relevant to the determination of whether good cause has been established .... These actions may have violated [Afford's] procedures, but they are not an act of God, an act of the obligee, or an act of law that prevented [Afford] from fulfilling the requirements of the bond.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Afford first claims that the trial court improperly concluded that the standard for demonstrating \"good cause\" for discharge of an obligation upon a bond pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 38-23 is the standard first set forth in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Taintor\n   </em>\n   , supra, 83 U.S. at 369-70, rather than a more holistic, equitable assessment that presumably would consider the alleged fraudulent actions of its agents and the state's failure to follow through on its alleged July 24, 2015 promise to initiate the extradition process for Garcia as good cause to discharge its obligation upon the bond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We begin with the standard of review. \"The interpretation of a rule of practice is a question of law, subject to plenary review ... and such an interpretation begins with the text of the provision at issue.\" (Citation omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sheriff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6775803\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/301/617/\">\n    301 Conn. 617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 622,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20A.3d%20808\">\n    21 A.3d 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Although Practice Book \u00a7 38-23 does not specify the exact legal test to be used by a court in determining good cause, this state has followed the common-law rule set forth in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Taintor\n   </em>\n   , supra, 83 U.S. at 366, which affirmed the decision of the our Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Taintor\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"782607\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/36/242/#p255\">\n    36 Conn. 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 255 (1869), that a surety will be relieved of its obligation on a bail bond only when \"the performance of the condition [of the bond] is rendered impossible by the act of God, the act\n   of the obligee, or the act of the law\" (\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   rule).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Taintor\n   </em>\n   , supra, 83 U.S. at 369.

The legislature, by enacting \u00a7 54-65c in 2011 and amending it in 2014, has since expanded the common-law definition of \"good cause.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   , the criminal defendant and principal on the bond, Edward McGuire, was released after posting bond in a Connecticut criminal court.\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Taintor\n   </em>\n   , supra, 83 U.S. at 368. He later voluntarily left Connecticut for New York and failed to appear in court as ordered. Id. Meanwhile, Maine issued a governor's requisition to New York to take custody of McGuire so he could be prosecuted on a pending burglary charge in Maine, and New York delivered him to proper officers of the state of Maine. Id. Neither of the two sureties on the bond\n   knew, when they entered into the recognizance, that McGuire had a burglary charge pending in Maine. Id., at 369. After McGuire was sent to Maine, he was convicted and sentenced to a term of incarceration of fifteen years. Id., at 368. During his confinement, the Connecticut court forfeited the bond. Id.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Henry G. Taintor, the Connecticut state treasurer, brought an action against McGuire and the sureties on his bond to collect the debt on the recognizance.\n   <em>\n    Taintor\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"782607\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/36/242/#p255\">\n    36 Conn. at 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The sureties sought to be discharged from their obligation claiming that they did not know at the time they posted bond for McGuire that he had charges pending against him in Maine. They had not acted in New York to obtain custody of McGuire after he had left Connecticut.\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Taintor\n   </em>\n   , supra, 83 U.S. at 368-69. The sureties claimed they were excused by acts of both the law and the obligee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The United States Supreme Court provided examples of what would satisfy each of the common-law conditions of the\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   rule. An act of God occurs when the bonded defendant \"dies before the day\" on which he must appear.\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Taintor\n   </em>\n   , supra, 83 U.S. at 369. An act of the obligee, or the party protected by the bond, which is the state, occurs when the state does something that makes it impossible for the defendant to appear in its courts, such as abolishing the court in question without qualification. Id. The third condition, an act of law, arises when the state protected by the bond takes custody of the defendant and then surrenders his custody to another state, thereby exercising control of the defendant in such a way as to make compliance with the bond impossible. Id., at 369-70. Because Connecticut had not abolished the court in which McGuire was required to appear, the court in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   focused on the third condition and stated that good cause cannot exist as an act of law when McGuire\n   voluntarily removed himself from Connecticut by crossing the border into New York. Id., at 370. \"There is a distinction between an act of the law proper and the act of the [criminal defendant], which exposes him to the control and action of the law. While the former exonerates, the latter gives no immunity.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The defendant sureties in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   argued that the case fell into the act of law condition because even though McGuire left Connecticut of his own volition, an act of law rendered his appearance impossible due to the lawful arrest and transfer of McGuire to Maine as a result of the cooperation between authorities in New York\n   and Maine. Id., at 368. In rejecting this argument, the court stated that it considered New York and Maine \"strangers\" to the bond agreement and held that an act of law that makes it impossible for the criminal defendant to appear must derive from the protected state's action, in other words, Connecticut's action, which did not occur in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   . Id., at 373-74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The sureties in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   also argued that their obligation should be discharged because they were not made aware of McGuire's pending charge in Maine, but the Supreme Court considered the sureties at fault for McGuire's departure and also stated that it was their duty to be aware of his arrest when it occurred and to interpose their claim for custody. Their resulting loss, the court concluded, was \"due to [the sureties'] own supineness and neglect.\"\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Taintor\n   </em>\n   , supra, 83 U.S. at 373. \"The principal in the case before us, cannot be allowed to avail himself of an impossibility of performance he created; and what will not avail him cannot avail his sureties. His contract is identical with theirs. They undertook for him what he undertook for himself.\" Id., at 374.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sheriff\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6775803\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/301/617/\">\n    301 Conn. at 617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20A.3d%20808\">\n    21 A.3d 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the plaintiff in error, Flavio Bail Bonds, LLC (Flavio), executed three\n   bonds for David Sheriff, the criminal defendant, for each of his cases and Sheriff was released from custody.

Similar to the nature of the claim Afford asserts here-that the court should have applied a more holistic, equitable assessment rather than the\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   rule-Flavio argued that the\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   rule was antiquated and unduly restrictive and asked our Supreme Court to adopt a standard consistent with \"emerging jurisprudence,\" requiring a \"multifaceted examination of the circumstances rather than holding tightly to any absolute rule.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

Flavio asserted that several other jurisdictions employ a \"multifaceted\" approach permitting courts to examine a number of factors beyond the condition in the\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   rule when determining whether to discharge a surety from a bond obligation. Id., at 625,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20A.3d%20808\">\n    21 A.3d 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Our Supreme Court declined to expand the\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   rule, and in applying it, suggested that unless the state had promised to extradite a criminal defendant should he become a fugitive, the state's decision not to seek extradition was not an act of law warranting a surety's discharge from its obligation on a bond.

Afford asserts that because Garcia is an undocumented alien, absent the state extraditing him, the law prevents him from returning to the United States due to his lack of any valid immigration status that would permit his lawful reentry. Therefore, an act of law prevented Garcia from returning to the United\n   States for his scheduled court appearance, which constitutes good cause under the\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   rule excusing Afford's performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court stated that for the act of law to render the performance on a bond obligation impossible, it \"must be a law operative in the [s]tate\n   where the obligation was assumed.\"\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Taintor\n   </em>\n   , supra, 83 U.S. at 371. In\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   , the surety claimed that even though the criminal defendant, McGuire, left Connecticut on his own volition, an act of law rendered his appearance impossible when New York arrested him and transferred him to Maine for prosecution and incarceration there. Id., at371. The court stated that it considered New York and Maine \"strangers\" to the bond agreement, and held that the act of law that makes it impossible for a defendant to appear must derive from action on the part of the protected state.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Id., at 374. If Connecticut, rather than New York, had taken custody of McGuire and transferred him to Maine pursuant to its demand, the bond would be excused because an act of the state had deliberately prevented him from returning to Connecticut for his court appearance. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sheriff\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6775803\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/301/617/\">\n    301 Conn. at 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20A.3d%20808\">\n    21 A.3d 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Garcia voluntarily leaving the United States for Peru, therefore, does not meet the act of law condition under the\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   rule because Connecticut, the protected state, was not responsible for making his compliance with the bond impossible. Accordingly, this claim fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Afford's second claim is that, as part of the trial court's good cause analysis, the court should have considered the relevance of the state's indication that it would extradite Garcia.

In\n   <em>\n    Sheriff\n   </em>\n   , our Supreme Court stated: \"[E]ven if we assume that the chief state's attorney could have extradited Sheriff from Jamaica, in the absence of any promise by the chief state's attorney that he would seek extradition of Sheriff in the event that he fled, the chief state's attorney had no obligation to Flavio to extradite Sheriff from Jamaica in order to fulfill the obligation that Flavio willingly undertook.

In this case, the only indication in the record that the state represented it would extradite Garcia is the prosecutor's assertion at the October 6, 2015 hearing, after Garcia already had absconded to Peru, that \"we intend to extradite once the Peruvian authorities notify us that he is in custody.\" There is nothing in the record that shows that prior to Afford's agreement to\n   post bond on behalf of Garcia, the state promised to extradite him if he fled to another country.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The statement in\n   <em>\n    Sheriff\n   </em>\n   regarding a promise to extradite only arguably provides a basis for relief if, \"at the time bail was posted,\" the state had promised it would seek extradition if Garcia left the country and, thereafter, the state refused to extradite him.

The state argues that the second requirement could not be satisfied because all a prosecutor can do is promise to try to extradite, but can never guarantee that such request for extradition would be honored. As a result, it may be unwise for a surety to rely on such a promise when assessing the risk of flight to another country because it might be difficult to assert reasonable reliance on a promise to seek extradition as a basis for equitably estopping the state from enforcing the bond when a defendant flees the country.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
