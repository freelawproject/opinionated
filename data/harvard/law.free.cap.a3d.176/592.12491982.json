Horvath, appeals from the summary judgment rendered in favor of the defendant, the city of Hartford. On appeal, the plaintiff asserts that the trial court's judgment was in error because disputed issues of material fact exist concerning whether he was retaliated against, and later constructively discharged, by the defendant in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 31-51m as a result of his whistle-blowing activities while in the defendant's employ. In response, the defendant claims that summary judgment was appropriate because, in opposition to its motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff offered no evidence that the defendant constructively discharged him by intentionally creating an intolerable work environment compelling him to resign. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the resolution of this appeal. In 2011, the defendant employed the plaintiff as an assistant chief of police for the Hartford Police Department (department). At the time, the department's command structure was comprised of the chief of police, two deputy chiefs and three assistant chiefs. On April 11, 2011, in response to an internal complaint, the plaintiff requested an investigation into the actions of Neville Brooks, commander of the department's internal affairs division. In September, 2011, the city hired Marcum\n   LLP\n   to conduct an independent review of the operations of the internal affairs division. Following the release of the Marcum LLP report, the plaintiff sent a letter on December 1, 2011, to Daryl Roberts, the chief of police, setting forth his concerns regarding \"numerous errors, omissions and intentional misrepresentations\" contained in the Marcum LLP report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 17, 2011, the Hartford city council passed a financial resolution reducing its budget by $1,750,000, including a reduction of $300,000 in department's executive command level expenses. This budget included funding for the plaintiff's position. The cuts were accomplished, in part, by the retirement of Lester McKoy, an assistant chief of police. On May 24, 2012, James Rovella, who became the interim chief of police after Roberts retired in December, 2011, informed the plaintiff that his position as assistant chief was going to be eliminated from the budget. In the same conversation, however, Rovella assured him that \"his job was safe.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In June, 2012, the plaintiff had a series of interviews with the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, Massachusetts, for the position of chief of police and subsequently accepted the position on September 4, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The plaintiff left his employ with the department as assistant chief of police on September 21, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 14, 2013, the plaintiff filed a single count amended complaint alleging that the defendant had penalized him by constructively discharging him from his employment in violation of \u00a7 31-51m because \"he investigated and reported, verbally and in writing, Brooks' actual or suspected violations of state law, municipal ordinance, and pertinent regulations.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thereafter, the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment in which it claimed, inter alia, that there existed no genuine issue of material fact in support of the plaintiff's claim that he was constructively discharged. On April 13, 2016, the trial court issued a memorandum of decision granting the defendant's motion. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be provided as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We first set forth the applicable standard of review. \"The standards governing our review of a trial court's decision to grant a motion for summary judgment are well established.

In regard to this second claim, the plaintiff asserts that \"a reasonable jury could conclude that [the] defendant's actions amounted to a retaliatory penalty and discipline for the plaintiff['s] reporting of abuses of authority....\" In response, the defendant argues that the court correctly rendered summary judgment as to the plaintiff's retaliatory discharge claim, and that the plaintiff's second claim is outside the scope of the complaint and has been raised for the first time on appeal. In sum, the defendant claims that the plaintiff relied solely on retaliatory constructive discharge in his pleadings and, therefore, cannot now raise additional theories of recovery that are based on discipline or penalty untethered to his wrongful discharge claim. Because we agree that the plaintiff's second claim has been raised for the first time on appeal and is not framed as a distinct claim in the plaintiff's complaint, it does not warrant detailed\n   analysis. Accordingly, we discuss it briefly before turning to the wrongful discharge claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The complaint alleges that the plaintiff \"was constructively discharged on September 21, 2012.\" In three subsequent paragraphs, the complaint further repeats that the \"defendant penalized the plaintiff by discharging him....\" Nowhere in the complaint does the plaintiff frame a claim for relief on the basis of other forms of retaliation, such as \"disciplined or otherwise penalize[d],\" as described in \u00a7 31-51m (b). In short, in his complaint, he claims that he was constructively discharged as a consequence of his whistle-blowing actions. A plaintiff's claims are, of course, framed by and limited to those made in the complaint.\n   <em>\n    Mamudovski\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    BIC Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2495150\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/78/715/#p732\">\n    78 Conn.

In order to satisfy the second element of \u00a7 31-51m by way of constructive discharge, the plaintiff needs to establish that the employer intentionally created an intolerable work atmosphere that forced the employee to quit involuntarily, and that the intolerable conditions are supported by more than the employee's subjective opinion.\n   <em>\n    Brittell\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dept. of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"247087\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/247/148/#p178\">\n    247 Conn. at 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=717%20A.2d%201254\">\n    717 A.2d 1254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   It is undisputed that the plaintiff has raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding the first element of his prima facie case. As to the second element, we agree with the court that the plaintiff failed to raise, through admissible evidence in opposition to the defendant's motion for summary judgment, a genuine issue of material fact that he was constructively discharged. In support of this aspect of his claim, the plaintiff has presented evidence of what he alleges to be intolerable\n   work conditions. He asserts that work responsibilities were taken from him, and that Rovella \"began to manipulate [his] professional responsibilities, usurp [his] authority as assistant chief, and diminish [his] substantive duties.\" Specifically, this included: (1) taking away his duties in managing the police department's fleet vehicles; (2) removing him from the collective bargaining negotiating team; (3) denying his request to attend a Federal Bureau of Investigation training program; (4) approving a staffing, budget and overtime request without discussion with him, even though he chaired the overtime committee; and (5)\n   excluding him from certain meetings and initiatives, such as special events planning, a vendor outreach program, a police visibility project to improve community perception, representation in the public safety complex project, and a multiagency meeting to address violent crime in the city.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The defendant does not refute this evidence, but instead highlights that the plaintiff took on additional duties as a result of McKoy's resignation, such as the responsibilities of the assistant chief of operations in addition to his role as the assistant chief of detectives.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The defendant therefore argues that although some duties were taken from him, the addition of other duties simply rebalanced his responsibilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We agree, in principle, with the plaintiff's assertion that the accumulation of adverse conditions in the workplace can amount to intolerable conditions for purposes of assessing whether a constructive discharge has taken place.

Accordingly, regardless of whether the plaintiff thought that his position was to be eliminated and even if he was told of this probability in the context of budget discussions, the actions by the defendant are not sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to the high standard of demonstrating \"the employer's\n   <em>\n    intent\n   </em>\n   to create an intolerable environment.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    Irizarry\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lily Transportation Corp.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265439\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/266/600/#p605\">\n    266 F.Supp.3d at 605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203037782\">\n    2017 WL 3037782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *4. Moreover, given the evidence submitted by the defendant that, indeed, arrangements had been\n   made to preserve the plaintiff's position even amidst budgetary cuts, we agree with the court's conclusion that, as a matter of law, no reasonable person \"would have found the work conditions so intolerable that he would have felt compelled to resign.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203037782\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In sum, conveying to the plaintiff that his job may be at risk of elimination for budgetary reasons cannot be equated to allegations of threats of discharge from employment or termination letters such as those found in different circumstances so as to warrant a conclusion of constructive discharge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cf.\n   <em>\n    Chertkova\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Connecticut General Life Ins.

The plaintiff has not provided admissible evidence demonstrating that he was demoted, reprimanded or personally threatened with the termination of his employment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff gained the additional responsibilities of another assistant chief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff's compensation never changed during this period. Furthermore, as the trial court noted,\n   \"the fact that the plaintiff accepted a new position with a higher pay\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   he resigned significantly undermines a claim of constructive discharge.\" (Emphasis in original.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, the plaintiff has failed to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he was constructively discharged\n   as a result of his whistle-blowing actions. In order to successfully oppose summary judgment, the plaintiff must provide an evidentiary foundation to demonstrate the existence of a fact that will make a difference in the result of the case. There are no genuine issues of material fact that support his claim that the defendant intentionally created such an intolerable work environment that a reasonable person would feel forced to resign. Accordingly, the court properly rendered summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Rovella succeeded Roberts as chief of police after Roberts' retirement in 2011. We note that, in conjunction with its motion for summary judgment, the defendant submitted a transcript excerpt from Rovella's September 1, 2015 deposition, in which the following exchange occurred between Rovella and the plaintiff's counsel:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    \"Q.
