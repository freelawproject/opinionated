Lawrence, Jr., appeals from the judgment of the Superior Court dismissing his administrative appeal from the decision of the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection (commissioner) granting the application of 16 Highgate Road, LLC (Highgate), to construct a residential dock and pier. The plaintiff claims that the court improperly concluded that (1) he was not classically aggrieved by the commissioner's decision, (2) he was statutorily aggrieved under General Statutes \u00a7 22a-19 only with respect to his claim of visual degradation, (3) the commissioner's decision was supported by substantial evidence in the record and (4) the commissioner's decision complied with all applicable laws and regulations. We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The facts relevant to this appeal are not in dispute. In 2012, Highgate filed an application with the defendant, the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (department), through its office of\n   Long Island\n   Sound Programs, for a permit to construct a residential dock and pier adjacent to waterfront property known as 16 Highgate Road in Greenwich. While that application was pending, the plaintiff intervened pursuant to \u00a7 22a-19(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following an evidentiary hearing that spanned six days, Kenneth M. Collette, a hearing officer with the department, issued a proposed final decision approving the application, subject to certain modifications. The plaintiff subsequently filed twenty-six exceptions to that proposed decision and requested argument thereon. The commissioner heard arguments from interested parties on January 20, 2015. The commissioner thereafter issued a final decision, in which he determined that the proposed activity complied with all applicable statutes and regulations, and would not unreasonably pollute, impair, or destroy the public trust in the air, water or other natural resources of the state.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183, the plaintiff appealed from that decision to the Superior Court. Following a hearing, the court rendered judgment dismissing the appeal. In so doing, the court determined that\n   the plaintiff had not established that he was classically aggrieved by the decision of the commissioner. The court also emphasized, consistent with well established precedent, that standing to bring an appeal pursuant to \u00a7 22a-19 is limited to environmental issues only. See\n   <em>\n    Pond View, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Planning &amp; Zoning Commission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3713579\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/288/143/#p157\">\n    288 Conn. 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 157,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=953%20A.2d%201\">\n    953 A.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008) (\"an intervenor's standing pursuant to \u00a7 22a-19 strictly is limited to challenging only environmental issues\"). After scrutinizing the allegations of the plaintiff's complaint, the court concluded that the plaintiff lacked such statutory aggrievement in all respects, except for his claim of visual degradation. The court then reviewed the administrative record and concluded that it contained substantial evidence to support the commissioner's decision on that claim. It further concluded that the plaintiff had not demonstrated that the commissioner failed to comply with any applicable law or regulation. From that judgment, the plaintiff appealed to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Our examination of the record and briefs and our consideration of the arguments of the parties persuade us that the judgment should be affirmed. On the facts of this case, the issues properly were resolved in the court's well reasoned memorandum of decision.

The plaintiff, Robert H. Lawrence, Jr., the owner of 3 Seagate Road in Greenwich, filed this action on July 23, 2015, against the defendant, the state of Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (department), seeking review of a final decision of the commissioner, Robert J. Klee (commissioner). The commissioner approved the December, 2012 application of the intervening defendant, 16 Highgate\n   Road, LLC\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Highgate), to construct a seventy-two foot residential dock in Greenwich Cove at 16 Highgate Road in Greenwich.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The application was initially approved by Tonia Selmeski of the office of Long Island Sound Programs on September 18, 2013. (Return of Record [ROR], Pleading [Pl.] # 119.00, DEEP-24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On October 24, 2013, a petition requesting a hearing was submitted by twenty-five individuals requiring that the department hold a hearing on the application. (ROR, Pl. # 120.00, DEEP-32.) On November 22, 2013, the plaintiff sought and\n   was granted intervention status under General Statutes \u00a7 22a-19\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the Connecticut Environmental Protection Act (CEPA), General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-14 et seq. (ROR, Pl. # 123.00.) Hearings were then conducted before Kenneth M. Collette in March and April,\n   2014, and a proposed final decision approving the application with modifications was issued on October 30, 2014. (ROR, Pl. # 113.00.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Lawrence filed twenty-six exceptions to the decision on November 14, 2014, and requested oral argument; (ROR, Pl. # 125.00); which was heard by the commissioner on January 20, 2015. (ROR, Pl. # 114.00.) On June 23, 2015, the commissioner issued his final decision finding that the proposed activity would comply with all applicable statutes and regulations, and would not unreasonably pollute, impair or destroy the public trust in the air, water or other natural resources of the state. (ROR, Pl. # 113.00, Final Decision.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Lawrence filed this appeal on July 23, 2015. He alleges that the final decision allowing the construction of the pier is clearly erroneous and arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion because it violates the Tidal Wetlands Act, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-28 et seq. ; the Coastal Management Act, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-90 et seq. ; and the Structures, Dredging and Fill Act, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-359 et seq. Specifically, he alleges that the commissioner is obligated under\n   General Statutes \u00a7 22a-98 to \"assure consistency with such goals and policies in granting or denying or modifying permits under\" the Tidal Wetlands Act, the Coastal Management Act, and the Structures, Dredging and Fill Act. Section 22a-98, in relevant part, continues: \"Any person seeking a license, permit or other approval of an activity under the requirements of such regulatory programs shall demonstrate that such activity is consistent with all applicable goals and policies in section 22a-92 and that such activity incorporates all reasonable measures mitigating any adverse impacts of such actions on coastal resources ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Under this umbrella, Lawrence alleges first that the decision allowing construction\n   of the pier is inconsistent with and contrary to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-93(15)(F). The statute defines \" '[a]dverse impacts on coastal resources' \" to \"include but are not limited to ... degrading visual quality through significant alteration of the natural features of vistas and view points ....\" Second, Lawrence asserts that allowing the pier violates General Statutes \u00a7 22a-92(b), which, in relevant part, provides: \"[T]he following policies are established for federal, state and municipal agencies in carrying out their responsibilities under this chapter ... (1) Policies concerning development, facilities and uses within the coastal boundary are ... (H) to protect coastal resources by requiring, where feasible, that such boating uses and facilities ... (ii) utilize existing altered, developed or redevelopment areas ... [and] (iv) utilize ramps and dry storage rather than slips in environmentally sensitive areas ....\" Third, Lawrence asserts a violation of \u00a7 22a-30-10 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies (regulation) concerning tidal wetlands. The regulation, in relevant part, provides: \"(a) ... The commissioner shall grant, or grant with limitations or conditions a permit to conduct a proposed activity on any wetland only if it is determined\n   that the application is consistent with all applicable criteria set forth herein. (b) ... In order to make a determination that a proposed activity will preserve the wetlands of the state and not lead to their despoliation and destruction the commissioner shall, as applicable, find that: (1) There is no alternative for accomplishing the applicant's objectives which is technically feasible and would further minimize adverse impacts ....\" Lawrence asserts that the commissioner should have found that Highgate was able to utilize an existing boat launch. Finally, Lawrence alleges that construction of the pier violates \u00a7 22a-359 (a) of the Structures, Dredging and Fill Act. The statute, in relevant part, provides: \"The Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection shall regulate dredging and the erection of structures and the placement of fill, and work incidental thereto, in the tidal, coastal or navigable waters of the state waterward of the coastal jurisdiction line. Any decisions made by the commissioner pursuant to this section shall be made with ... proper regard for the rights and interests of all persons concerned.\" General Statutes \u00a7 22a-359(a). Lawrence asserts that the commissioner failed to give proper regard to restrictive covenants that applied to Highgate's and Lawrence's properties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Highgate filed an answer, and the department filed an answer and the record on October 30, 2015. On December 15, 2015, Lawrence filed his brief. The department and Highgate filed their briefs on February 5, 2015,\n   and the plaintiff filed two briefs in reply on April 1, 2015. The court heard the appeal on April 12, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The defendants contest Lawrence's standing to pursue this appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"The fundamental aspect of standing ... [is that] it focuses on the party seeking to get his complaint before [the] court and not on the issues he wishes to have adjudicated.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

(ROR, Pl. # 121.00, INT-8; Pl. # 123.00.) Lawrence filed a notice of intervention with the department; (ROR, Pl. # 123,00); in which he specifically alleged\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   that \"the\n   structures proposed in the captioned application will cause adverse impacts on coastal\n   resources, within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 22a-93(15), by: a. Increasing the hazard of coastal flooding through significant alteration of shoreline configurations of bathymetry; b. Degrading visual quality through significant alteration of natural features of vistas and viewpoints; c. Degrading or destroying essential wildlife, finfish or shellfish habitat through significant alteration of the composition, migration patterns, distribution, breeding or other population characteristics of the natural species or significant alteration of the natural components of the habitat; and/or d.

Public Act 12-101 amended \u00a7 22a-92(a)(1) so that it now, in relevant part, provides: \"[t]o ensure that the development, preservation or use of the land and water resources of the coastal area proceeds in a manner consistent with the rights of private property owners ....\" (Emphasis added.)\n   Lawrence testified that he loves the current view of the cove and does not wish it to change. (ROR, Pl. # 114.00, Tr., 4/3/14, pp. 73-74.) This court does not dispute that the cove, even with the existing houses, seawalls, docks, sailboats, and the large causeway to Elias Point, is pleasant and a natural resource that is subject to protection like all of Connecticut's coastal areas. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-90 et seq. Nevertheless, there are existing structures and development in the cove. See Coen v.

(considering overall character of area\n   in assessing impact on view). Balancing this with Highgate's common-law right to wharf as well as the statutory right under \u00a7 22a-92(a)(1), the record does not support the claim that this new dock will degrade the \"visual quality through significant alteration of the natural features of vistas and view points\" under \u00a7 22a-93(15)(F) or unreasonably impair or destroy the public trust in the natural resources of the state under \u00a7 22a-19(a)(1).

As previously stated, this case only concerns the visual impact of Highgate's proposed pier; there is no extant claim that it will unreasonably impair or destroy other natural resources. Indeed, the commissioner found that \"the record ... demonstrates that the impact of the proposed project to the tidal wetlands, the intertidal flat, wildlife and other natural resources in the area is minimal.\" (ROR, Pl. # 113.00, Final Decision, p. 6.) Further, \"the record reflects that the dock is likely to have a positive impact on the vegetation in the tidal wetlands, due in part to the planned removal of stone debris in the area as required by the permit terms, which will create an additional 600 to 700 square feet of wetlands and allow tidal vegetation to repopulate the area. In addition, the dock will provide a way of accessing the water without walking through the tidal wetlands and thus will curb the physical breakage, uprooting and trampling of vegetation in the wetlands that is currently occurring.\" (ROR, # 113.00, Final Decision, p. 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The commissioner was required to analyze the application in light of the applicable statutory provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   First, the commissioner was required to consider whether the pier constituted an adverse impact on coastal resources by \"degrading visual quality through significant alteration of the natural features of vistas and view points\" under \u00a7 22a-93(15)(F). There is no dispute that he addressed this as a factor in his final decision. (ROR, # 113.00, Final Decision, pp. 3-5.) Moreover, the record contains substantial evidence for him to find that such degradation did not exist. See Adriani v.

The commissioner recognized that the claim is subjective and, as admitted by Lawrence, that \"beauty is in the eye of the beholder.\" Nevertheless, the commissioner balanced this with the objective evidence in the record reflecting the current \"heavy developed\" character of the cove, including homes, hardened shorelines, existing docks, moorings, and boats;\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   reliance on past\n   department practices and permits; his finding that the view of the rock outcropping will only be minimally obscured; and the positive impact on the tidal wetlands.

Related to this is the required finding under the regulation\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   of no feasible alternative. Whether Highgate should appropriately forgo its right to wharf because of the association's\n   facility is not the question-the existence of the community facility does not automatically preclude the right of Highgate to construct its pier. Rather, the issue is whether the commissioner analyzed this application to construct a pier under the\n   substantial evidence standard in light of our relevant environmental statutes, regulations, and other appropriate factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The commissioner noted the salutary purpose of \u00a7 22a-92(b)(1)(H) to \" 'utilize existing altered, developed or redevelopment areas,' where feasible, is aimed at encouraging the smart development of coastal areas particularly facilities like marinas or state boat launches that are not necessarily limited to one particular upland parcel.\" (ROR, Pl. # 113.00, Final Decision, p. 6.) Yet, this goal must be balanced with the littoral owner's right to wharf and is subject to reasonable regulation. See General Statutes \u00a7 22a-92(a)(1) ; see also Port Clinton Associates v. Board of Selectmen, supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"543809\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/217/588/#p598\">\n    217 Conn. at 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=587%20A.2d%20126\">\n    587 A.2d 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Highgate's first two proposals were rejected. See footnote 2 of this memorandum of decision. While cases may exist where a structure could be modified, or perhaps even rejected, due to the existence of another facility, nothing in the statute\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   suggests that such a policy was meant to preclude a private property owner's right to wharf in the first instance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, as noted\n   by the commissioner, the express language of the regulation; see footnote 16 of this memorandum of decision; \"speaks in terms of impact minimization rather than avoidance.\" (ROR, Pl. # 113.00, Final Decision, p. 7.) The commissioner considered this statutory and regulatory framework; (ROR, Pl. # 113.00, Final Decision, pp. 5-7.); and substantial evidence supports his decision. (ROR, Pl. # 113.00, Final Decision, pp. 6, 9-11; Pl. # 114.00, Tr., 3/24/14, pp. 178-79; Tr., 3/25/14, p. 176; Tr., 3/27/14, p. 96; Pl. # 117.00, DEEP-1-DEEP-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Finally, Lawrence alleges that the commissioner violated \u00a7 22a-359 of the Structures, Dredging and Fill Act for failing to give proper regard to the restrictive covenants of the association, which state that \"no building or structure shall be erected or maintained upon the premises hereby conveyed other than one single family dwelling house with garage, if any, attached, except with the written consent of the grantor or its successors or assigns.\" The commissioner found that \"[a]bsent an express bar to construction, the mere existence of restrictive covenants that may impact a proposed project or require third party approvals does not preclude DEEP from issuing a permit.\" (ROR, Pl. # 113.00, Final Decision, p. 7.) Indeed, the commissioner noted, \"[s]ecuring a DEEP permit does not excuse the Applicant from securing other necessary approvals, and the language of the permit ... makes clear that the permittee remains obligated to obtain any other approvals required by federal, state and local law, including any\n   approval required through a deed restriction.\" (ROR, Pl. # 113.00, Final Decision, pp. 7-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \"[T]he law is well established that restrictive covenants in a deed as to [the] use of property are distinct and separate from [the] provisions of [a] zoning law and have no influence or part in the administration of [a] zoning law.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Anniello v.
