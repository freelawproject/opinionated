Handy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4149560\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/206/39/#p53\">\n    206 N.J. 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 53-54,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4149560\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/206/39/#p53\">\n    18 A.3d 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011). In this matter, a police officer pulled over a car under the belief that the vehicle was in violation of N.J.S.A. 39:3-61(a) and -66 because one of the vehicle's taillights was not operational. The trial court determined that the officer was mistaken about the law and granted defendant's motion to suppress the fruits of the motor vehicle stop. The Appellate Division reversed. The panel determined that the relevant motor vehicle statutes were ambiguous and that, applying the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Heien v. North Carolina\n   </em>\n   , 574 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12593411\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/530/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12593411\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/530/\">\n    190 L.Ed.2d 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014), the officer's stop of defendant's car constituted at most an objectively reasonable mistake of law that should be treated in the same\n   manner as a mistake of fact. Accordingly, the panel held that the officer's mistake of law did not require suppression of the motor vehicle stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We now reverse. The Appellate Division erred in concluding that the holding in\n   <em>\n    Heien\n   </em>\n   is applicable here. Because the motor vehicle statutes pertinent here are not ambiguous, we need not consider importing\n   <em>\n    Heien\n   </em>\n   into the determination of this matter. Thus, we do not address the arguments raised herein that\n   <em>\n    Heien\n   </em>\n   's mistake-of-law analysis is not reconcilable with our state constitutional jurisprudence. The officer's stop of defendant's motor vehicle was not an objectively reasonable mistake of law that gave rise to constitutional reasonable suspicion; the stop was therefore unconstitutional. We remand to the Appellate Division for its consideration of the State's alternative argument, which the panel did not reach, that the stop should be sustained based on the community caretaking doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the suppression hearing in this matter, the following facts were adduced. Officer Michael Carletta of the Mount Olive Police Department was the sole witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At about 9:00 p.m. on the evening of February 3, 2014, Officer Carletta was on motor vehicle patrol traveling southbound on Route 206. A Toyota Camry passed him traveling northbound. Looking in his rearview mirror, the officer observed that the northbound vehicle appeared to have a malfunctioning taillight. Although the vehicle had four taillights in total, two on each side, and although only one light on the rear passenger side was not illuminated, Officer Carletta believed that the vehicle was in violation of the motor vehicle code. He made a U-turn and began to follow the vehicle. After confirming that one of the vehicle's taillights was not illuminated, he executed a motor vehicle stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Officer Carletta testified that, in such situations, it is typical police practice to give the driver a warning rather than a summons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After stopping and approaching the vehicle, Officer Carletta asked the driver, defendant Ryan Sutherland, for his driver's license, motor vehicle registration, and proof of insurance. Defendant initially stated that he did not have his driver's license with him but then quickly admitted that he did not have a valid driver's license. After obtaining defendant's name and date of birth, Officer Carletta returned to his vehicle to check defendant's information with police dispatch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Upon confirming that defendant's license was in fact suspended, Officer Carletta issued defendant two summonses: driving with a suspended license in violation of N.J.S.A. 39:3-40, and failure to maintain the vehicle's \"lamps\" in violation of N.J.S.A. 39:3-66. Officer Carletta explained to defendant that he had been stopped because one of his taillights was not working and that he could no longer drive the vehicle because he had a suspended driver's license. The officer allowed defendant to leave the scene on the condition that his passenger drive the car to its intended destination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On June 2, 2014, defendant was charged in municipal court with fourth-degree operating a motor vehicle during a period of license suspension in violation of N.J.S.A. 2C:40-26. A Morris County grand jury later indicted defendant and charged him with fourth-degree operating a motor vehicle during a period of license suspension for a second or subsequent driving-while-intoxicated conviction in violation of N.J.S.A. 2C:40-26(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant filed a motion to suppress the traffic stop and to dismiss the indictment,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   arguing that the traffic stop constituted\n   an unreasonable seizure because his vehicle had three operable taillights, in compliance with the requirements of N.J.S.A. 39:3-61(a) and -66. The State countered that the stop was lawful because the malfunctioning taillight provided Officer Carletta with reasonable suspicion to stop the vehicle and because the stop was lawful under the \"community caretaking\" function by which police officers engage in protecting public safety. Officer Carletta testified at the hearing that he had\n   stopped the vehicle both because he believed that any malfunctioning taillight constituted a violation of the statute and because he was engaging in community caretaking by letting defendant know that his vehicle was not in proper working order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress evidence resulting from the motor vehicle stop, but the court denied his motion to dismiss the indictment on the grounds of faulty instructions provided to the grand jury. On the motor vehicle stop, the trial court agreed with defendant that Officer Carletta's understanding of the maintenance-of-lamps statute had been \"incorrect\" and that defendant had not violated the statute because he had at least one functioning taillight on each side of the vehicle.

Specifically, he argues that\n   <em>\n    Puzio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"621200\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/379/378/\">\n    379 N.J. Super. at 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"621200\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/379/378/\">\n    878 A.2d 857\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , correctly held that a traffic stop based on an incorrect interpretation of law can never be objectively reasonable. That holding, defendant argues, is a natural extension of this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Novembrino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1353504\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/105/95/\">\n    105 N.J. 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=519%20A.2d%20820\">\n    519 A.2d 820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987), which held that our State Constitution does not contemplate good faith mistakes by law enforcement as an exception to the exclusionary rule. Defendant also contends that the statutory provisions at issue here were plain and unambiguous and did not apply to his vehicle, undermining any basis for reasonable suspicion. In essence, defendant's argument challenges Officer Carletta's interpretation of those provisions as not reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The State argues that the Appellate Division correctly held that Officer Carletta's belief that defendant was in violation of the motor vehicle code was objectively reasonable and provided him with reasonable suspicion to stop defendant's vehicle. Relying on\n   <em>\n    Heien\n   </em>\n   , the State posits that just as we have held that reasonable mistakes of fact can pass constitutional scrutiny, so too should we hold that reasonable mistakes of law do not run afoul of our constitution. Such a result is not inconsistent with\n   <em>\n    Puzio\n   </em>\n   , the State argues, because\n   <em>\n    Puzio\n   </em>\n   involved an objectively unreasonable mistake of law, whereas here, Officer Carletta was forced to interpret a confusing and outdated set of statutes ambiguous enough to be open to differing and equally reasonable interpretations. Additionally, the State maintains that that it preserved its argument that Officer Carletta had lawful authority to stop defendant's vehicle based on the community caretaking doctrine, which provides police\n   with the power to ensure the safety and welfare of the public independent of their law enforcement objectives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Amicus curiae ACLU-NJ argues that the statutes at issue here are not ambiguous and that the rule of lenity requires strict construction of those statutes in defendant's favor. ACLU-NJ further argues that a stop based on a police officer's misunderstanding or ignorance of the law can and should be differentiated from mistakes of fact, and that such ignorance or misunderstanding of the law must always be unreasonable and thus unconstitutional under our Article I, Paragraph 7 jurisprudence. Like defendant, ACLU-NJ maintains that that conclusion flows naturally from state constitutional case law, most specifically from\n   <em>\n    Novembrino\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Heien\n   </em>\n   , the ACLU-NJ argues, is inconsistent with that jurisprudence and thus should not be adopted by this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Under previous case law in this state, a police officer's objectively reasonable mistake of fact does not render a search or arrest unconstitutional.

Additionally, N.J.S.A. 39:3-66 mandates that the lamps \"required by this article\" must be kept in good working order. Thus, if there is only the minimum one taillight on each side of a vehicle and either of those taillights is not working, an officer can lawfully stop the vehicle and issue a citation for failure to maintain lamps. When a vehicle has more than the minimum of two rear taillights,\n   for example the vehicle has two taillights on each side, an officer can lawfully stop the vehicle when one side's taillights are both out, even though the vehicle has two or more taillights illuminated on the other side. In other words, the statutes require one working taillight on each side of a vehicle. Thus, if a vehicle has two taillights on each side of the vehicle-more than the law requires-and one of those multiple taillights on one side is not working, a violation of N.J.S.A. 39:3-61(a) and -66, as was assumed and charged here, has not occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   We find the language unambiguous and therefore need not resort to legislative history. Were that history to be examined on the relevant question, we would note, as the State points out, that the Legislature did at one point begin consideration of an amendment; that amendment would have worked a different interpretation of existing law as we read it, and as it was applied in a prior unpublished decision that received legislative attention. As originally introduced at the outset of the 2012 Legislative Session, Assembly Bill 354 would have amended N.J.S.A. 39:3-66 and N.J.S.A. 39:3-61 to establish that \"an equipment violation [will be found] if any lighting device installed on a vehicle is not in working order.\" Those proposed amendments were never adopted by the Legislature, as the Appellate Division noted in its opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    Sutherland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6793401\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/445/358/\">\n    445 N.J.

We do not ascribe much weight to legislative inaction but note merely that there has been no legislation to alter prior application of the pertinent statutes.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3678190\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/197/325/#p335\">\n    197 N.J. 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 335,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3678190\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/197/325/#p335\">\n    963 A.2d 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Finally, we reject the argument that N.J.S.A. 39:3-48, which addresses visibility specifications for vehicle lights, can inject ambiguity into the clear wording of the statutes at issue here. Nor does the permissive repair provision in N.J.S.A. 39:3-61(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   ) -which does not have applicability in the present situation or in most modern malfunctioning-taillight circumstances-convert the interpretative question before us into one that rises to the level of difficulty envisioned as the \"rare\" case of an objectively reasonable misunderstanding of the law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heien\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12593411\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/530/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that such cases must necessarily involve \"very hard question[s] of statutory interpretation\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Putting the statutes in question to rigorous analysis, we fail to find them unclear, as the State suggests. We find that the officer's erroneous application of the functioning taillight requirement was not an objectively reasonable mistake of law. This case does not present a basis for considering the application of\n   <em>\n    Heien\n   </em>\n   and the Appellate Division erred in reaching that determination based on the error here. Simply put, this was not a good stop. Even\n   <em>\n    Heien\n   </em>\n   could not save it, were we ever to consider adopting such an approach for the truly rare case that rose to the level of an objectively reasonable mistake of law. But this was not that case. The judgment of the Appellate Division, premised on an application of\n   <em>\n    Heien\n   </em>\n   to the stop in this matter, is reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   That, however, does not end the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The State also asserted community caretaking as an alternative basis to support the stop.
