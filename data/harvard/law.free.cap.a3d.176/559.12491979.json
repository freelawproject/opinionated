Following that denial, the court granted his petition for certification to appeal. On appeal, the petitioner claims that the habeas court erred when it concluded that (1) his state and federal constitutional due process rights were not violated by the state's suppression of material exculpatory evidence concerning agreements or understandings that it allegedly had with two of its witnesses, (2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   the state did not violate his state and federal constitutional rights to due process by knowingly presenting, and failing to correct, the false testimony from those witnesses, and (3) he was not denied his state and federal constitutional rights to the effective assistance of counsel when his trial counsel failed to properly cross-examine those witnesses regarding their alleged agreements or understandings with the state. Because we conclude that the petitioner failed to prove that the agreements or understandings were not disclosed, we are unpersuaded by the petitioner's first and second claims. We are also unpersuaded by the petitioner's third claim because, even if it is assumed that his trial counsel provided constitutionally deficient representation, the petitioner failed to prove that he was prejudiced. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the habeas court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant. In connection with the murder of Darrell Wattley, the state charged the petitioner and his codefendants, Anthony Booth and Daniel Brown, each with one count of murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a, one count of felony murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c, and one count of conspiracy to commit murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 (a) and 53a-54a.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The factual backdrop underlying the charges is set forth in our Supreme Court's decision and need not be repeated in full for this appeal.

Wattley walked toward the north end of the building, where Brown and [the petitioner] were waiting. Smith and Booth then entered the building on the south side and began to ascend the stairs. When Smith and Booth reached the third floor, where Valentin's apartment was located, they heard gunshots below. Smith and Booth then ran to exit the building. As they descended the stairs, they saw Wattley lying face down in the second floor hallway with blood everywhere. Booth then stabbed Wattley a couple of times before Smith and Booth fled the building.\" Id., at 614-15,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=737%20A.2d%20404\">\n    737 A.2d 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In his amended petition (present petition), he first alleged that the state violated his right to due process by failing to disclose material exculpatory evidence. Specifically, he alleged that the state told Smith and Valentin that, in exchange for their testimony, it would assist in (1) reducing their bonds and (2) disposing of their charges in a manner favorable to them, and that it failed to disclose this information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also alleged\n   that the state\n   violated his right to due process when the prosecutor failed to correct the false testimony of Smith and Valentin, who both testified at the consolidated trial that the state had not offered them \"consideration\" in exchange for their testimony. Additionally, he alleged that Cocheo's failure to adequately impeach Valentin and Smith deprived him of his right to the effective assistance of trial counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The respondent, the Commissioner of Correction, filed his return on January 12, 2016, denying the material allegations of the present petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 23, 2016, the habeas court denied the present petition in a written decision. It made several relevant findings of fact, including: \"(a) The petitioner has failed to demonstrate that underlying trial counsel (Cocheo) was unaware of the existence of an agreement between Smith and Valentin and the prosecuting authority to bring their cooperation to the attention of the judicial authority posttrial. The evidence demonstrated that at least one other defense attorney in the consolidated trial was made aware of the agreement; (b) The petitioner has failed to demonstrate that the underlying\n   trial testimony of Smith and Valentin was 'false' as suggested by the petitioner, as opposed to, for example, their uncertainty as to the likely posttrial sentencing scenario. The nature and circumstances of Smith and Valentin's 'agreements' were thoroughly explored and dissected on both direct and cross-examination. There is no reasonable probability that the jury was misled in this regard; (c) Nothing about the nature of the agreements or their disclosure was violative of\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Giglio\n   </em>\n   [v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11721534\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/150/\">\n    405 U.S. 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11721534\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/150/\">\n    92 S.Ct. 763\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11721534\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/150/\">\n    31 L.Ed. 2d 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1972) ]\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; and (d) The petitioner has failed to demonstrate, as was the case in the first habeas trial, that Attorney Cocheo was deficient in any regard, including cross-examining Smith and Valentin.\" (Footnotes added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The petitioner filed a motion for articulation, which the habeas court denied on September 23, 2016. He did not seek review of that denial. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 66-5 and 66-7. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"In evaluating the merits of the underlying claims on which the petitioner relies in the present appeal, we observe that [when] the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, [the reviewing court] must determine whether they are legally and logically correct ... and whether they find support in the facts that appear in the record....

Because the issues presented in this appeal involve mixed questions of law and fact, our review is plenary. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    George M.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4142787\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/290/653/#p659\">\n    290 Conn. 653\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 659,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=966%20A.2d%20179\">\n    966 A.2d 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We begin with the petitioner's claim that the state failed to disclose the \"consideration\" that it had allegedly offered Valentin and Smith in exchange for their testimony. We understand his claim to be supported by two separate arguments. First, he appears to argue that express agreements existed between the state and the witnesses to bring their cooperation to the attention of the sentencing court, and that the state failed to disclose them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second,\n   he appears to argue that the state failed\n   to disclose impeachment evidence relating to how the state assisted in reducing the witnesses' bonds. The respondent argues that the record demonstrates that the state had disclosed the existence and terms of any agreement between the state and the witnesses. Additionally, the respondent argues that any statements\n   made during the bond hearings for Valentin and Smith, which form the basis of the petitioner's claim, \"were public proceedings, open to anyone with interest, and transcripts were presumably available upon request.\" We agree with the respondent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant. On September 13, 1995, Valentin testified during a probable cause hearing for Booth that implicated Booth in Wattley's murder. During Valentin's bond hearing on October 5, 1995, Bernard Steadman, her attorney, represented: \"I have discussed this matter with the state and they would-my understanding is that there would be no objection to her moving out of state, should she be released on a bond, and provided that she maintain contact with-to or with their office either through me or directly.\" Steadman asked the court to consider releasing Valentin on a promise to appear and allowing her to travel to New Jersey given her cooperation with the state and because Wattley's murder appeared to be gang related. Paul E. Murray, the supervisory assistant state's attorney (prosecutor),\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   informed the court: \"I did indicate to [Steadman], Your Honor, that I would bring to the court's attention [Valentin's] cooperation, and I think I've done that.\" The prosecutor also informed the court that he had spoken with Valentin's mother about Valentin going to New Jersey and that \"both [Valentin] and her mother have agreed ... to keep the state apprised as to her location and how she can be reached ....\" In the event that she did not keep the state apprised of her location, the prosecutor stated that \"[the state] will find her and she will have forfeited whatever benefits she has gained from her cooperation to this point.\" He also stated: \"I'm not sure whether a promise to appear is the appropriate\n   thing, but I think certainly a substantial reduction in her bond is appropriate.\" Thereafter, the prosecutor stated that he would not object to a written promise to appear and informed the court: \"I think if I were in your position, I would not be averse to a written promise to appear. I'm trying to be careful as to-as to the record I'm making.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After considering, inter alia, the \"cooperative aspects of this matter,\" the court,\n   <em>\n    Purtill, J.\n   </em>\n   , reduced Valentin's bond from $100,000 to a written promise to appear and permitted her to reside in New Jersey. Immediately following that decision, the following colloquy took place in open court:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: ... For the record, I would indicate I do not disagree at all with the court's decision. I was trying to be careful with the record because of obvious cross-examination effect. In consideration, I want the record to be clear that\n   <em>\n    the only representations made to\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Valentin\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    were that any cooperation would be brought to the attention of the sentencing court. There was no quid pro quo for a specific bond recommendation\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"[Steadman]: That is true, Your Honor.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On March 14, 1996, during a consolidated probable cause hearing for Brown and the petitioner, Smith provided testimony that implicated Brown and the petitioner in Wattley's murder. The petitioner and Cocheo attended this hearing, and so did Donovan, Brown's lawyer. At the beginning of Smith's testimony, the following examination took place in open court:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: And you are in fact charged with murder, felony murder, and conspiracy to commit murder with respect to the case that we are going to talk about, is that right?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"[Smith]: Yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: And is it fair to say that\n   <em>\n    other than bringing your cooperation to the attention of the sentencing court\n   </em>\n   , you haven't been promised anything in return for your testimony?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"[Smith]: No.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: You say 'no.' That is the truth, isn't it?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"[Smith]: That's the truth.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On May 3, 1996, approximately two months after Smith testified at the consolidated probable cause hearing, the court,\n   <em>\n    Parker, J.\n   </em>\n   , addressed Smith's motion for modification of his bond. The state did not object to the motion. Counsel for Smith represented that the reasons for requesting a bond modification were that Smith's life had been threatened and he had cooperated with the state. Thereafter, the court reduced Smith's bond from $500,000 to $100,000 and permitted him to travel throughout the continental United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On May 10, 1996, the court,\n   <em>\n    Purtill, J.\n   </em>\n   , amended the terms of Smith's bond, making it a $100,000 nonsurety bond with a nominal real estate bond. During this hearing, the prosecutor stated that the state had been in contact with a parole officer in Alabama, who agreed to arrange weekly reporting with Smith if he were allowed to reside there. The court asked that the state \"reduce that condition to writing and give a copy to ... Smith.\" Smith was then permitted to be released on bond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   At his habeas trial on the present petition, the petitioner called Donovan, trial defense counsel for Brown, and Sturman, trial defense counsel for Booth, to testify. Many of the questions that the petitioner asked on direct examination related to whether Donovan or Sturman had seen the bond hearing transcripts for Valentin and\n   Smith, and whether they would have impeached Valentin and Smith with the information contained in those transcripts. Specifically, the petitioner asked Donovan and Sturman whether they would have impeached Valentin and Smith regarding the state's promise to bring their cooperation to the attention of the sentencing judge and whether they would have impeached those witnesses with the \"connection\" between their cooperation and their reduced bonds. Donovan and Sturman both testified that they would have used the testimony from those transcripts to impeach Valentin and Smith. And neither Donovan nor Sturman recalled seeing the bond modification hearing transcripts prior to testifying at the habeas trial on the present petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Donovan also testified that, on four or five occasions, \"[the prosecutor] told me ... that the only promise that had been [made] to [Valentin and Smith] is [that] their cooperation would be brought to the attention of the judge.\" On the basis of his extensive experience dealing with the New London County Office of the State's Attorney, he also testified that the general procedure was not to offer specific \"deals.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Contrary to Donovan's testimony, Sturman testified that, although he knew that Valentin had been released on a reduced bond, he was never informed that the state had offered any promises to either Valentin or Smith in exchange for their cooperation. He echoed Donovan's testimony, however, that the standard procedure in New London \"was that no specific deals were made between a cooperating witness and the prosecution.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The respondent did not call any witnesses or present any evidence beyond cross-examination of Donovan and Sturman. During his argument to the habeas court, the petitioner focused on the contents of the bond hearing transcripts in support of his\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim, noting\n   that Donovan and Sturman \"had never seen these proceedings. They didn't know this information [contained in the witnesses' bond hearing transcripts].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \"The defendant has a right to the disclosure of exculpatory evidence under the due process clauses of both the United States constitution and the Connecticut constitution....

First, he contends that express agreements existed between the state and Valentin and Smith to bring\n   their cooperation to the attention of the sentencing court, and that the state failed to disclose them. Second, the petitioner argues that the state failed to disclose impeachment evidence relating to how the state assisted in reducing the bonds for Valentin and Smith. We reject each argument and address them in turn.\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The petitioner first argues that express agreements existed between the state and the witnesses to bring their cooperation to the attention of the sentencing court, and that the state failed to disclose them. We agree that the state had express agreements with Valentin and Smith to bring their cooperation to the attention of the sentencing court, but disagree that the state failed to disclose them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The habeas court found: \"The petitioner has failed to demonstrate that underlying trial counsel (Cocheo) was unaware of the existence of an agreement between Smith and Valentin and the prosecuting authority to bring their cooperation to the attention of the judicial authority posttrial. The evidence demonstrated that at least one other defense attorney in the consolidated trial was made aware of the agreement.\" This finding is relevant in two material respects. First, it indicates that the habeas court found that agreements did, in fact, exist, and that they were limited to \"bring[ing] [Valentin's and Smith's] cooperation to the attention of the judicial authority posttrial.\" Second, the court's finding indicates that another defense attorney was aware of these agreements that the state had with Valentin and Smith and that the petitioner failed to prove that Cocheo was unware of such agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On the basis of our review of the record, we conclude that the habeas court's finding that agreements existed between the state and the cooperating witnesses, and that the agreements were limited to bringing their cooperation to the attention of the judicial authority posttrial, was not clearly erroneous. The prosecutor's statements during Valentin's bond hearing on October 5, 1995, indicate that an agreement existed with Valentin. The prosecutor's direct examination of Smith during the petitioner's consolidated probable cause hearing on March 14, 1996, which Cocheo and the petitioner attended, also indicates that the state had an agreement with Smith. During Valentin's bond hearing, Valentin's attorney confirmed that the agreement with Valentin\n   was limited to bringing her cooperation to the attention of the sentencing authority and that it did not include a quid pro quo for a specific bond recommendation. Additionally, Donovan testified that the prosecutor informed him on multiple occasions that agreements existed, but that the only promise was to bring the cooperation of Valentin and Smith to the attention of the court. Because this evidence supports the habeas court's finding that the state had limited agreements to bring the cooperation of Valentin and Smith to the attention of the court posttrial, we conclude that the habeas court's finding was not clearly erroneous.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The habeas court's finding also reflects that the state disclosed the agreements. During the habeas trial, Donovan admitted to knowing about the agreements between the state and the witnesses. Cocheo and the petitioner attended the petitioner's consolidated probable cause hearing when the prosecutor asked Smith, in open court, whether the state had promised him anything other than bringing his cooperation to the attention of the sentencing court. This evidence supports the habeas court's finding that the state disclosed the agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \"Evidence known to the defendant or his counsel, or that is disclosed, even if during trial, is not considered suppressed as that term is used in\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   .\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Hines\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485004\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/430/#p726\">\n    164 Conn.

During his direct examination of Valentin, the prosecutor questioned her about her pending charge of accessory to assault in the first degree in connection with Wattley's murder. He specifically asked her whether she had testified at a \"preliminary hearing\" and whether, subsequent to testifying, her bond was reduced to a promise to appear. She agreed that her bond was reduced after she testified at that hearing. She further testified that she hoped that her testimony against the petitioner and his codefendants would help her case. Additionally, Donovan, Sturman, and Cocheo each cross-examined her about the circumstances surrounding her bond reduction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In response to the prosecutor's questions, Smith admitted that he faced criminal charges in connection with Wattley's murder, namely, murder, conspiracy to commit murder, and felony murder. He testified that he hoped that he would not go to jail and that his testimony would show \"that [he] had nothing to do with this.\" Smith further agreed with the prosecutor that his bond was reduced after testifying\n   at the consolidated probable cause hearing for Brown and the petitioner,\n   that he returned to Alabama, and that the state paid for his flight, hotel, and food while he was in Connecticut for the petitioner's trial.

During the consolidated trial, Valentin and Smith both testified, in substance, that they hoped that their cooperative testimony would be taken into account with regard to their pending charges. Valentin and Smith also agreed with the prosecutor that their bonds were reduced following their testimony at the probable cause hearings for Booth, Brown, and the petitioner. And Cocheo and codefense counsel thoroughly explored the circumstances surrounding the bond reductions for both witnesses. Questioning Valentin and Smith about the contents of the transcripts, therefore, would have provided the jury with little additional information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The court also informed the jurors that those witnesses who admitted to participating in the criminal conduct charged by the state may be looking for favorable treatment and \"may have such an interest in the outcome of this case that his or her testimony may be colored by that fact.\" This instruction reminded the jurors of Valentin's and Smith's potential biases, and\n   jurors are presumed to follow the court's instructions.

Cocheo argued: \"[Valentin] said, I had no idea at all I was going to be released. I had no idea, hadn't thought about it, hadn't talked about it at all. I ask you, is that credible? Is that credible? All she says is that she hopes her testimony will help her case. We know it helped so far; she's not in jail anymore.\" Sturman argued during his closing, \"don't you think that [Smith's] testimony is flavored by his expectation of what's going to happen if he continues to play ball?\" Such closing remarks urged the jury to discredit Valentin's and Smith's testimony based on their reduced bonds and their cooperation with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   We are not persuaded that there is a reasonable probability that, had Cocheo impeached Valentin or Smith with either the probable cause hearing transcripts or their respective bond hearing transcripts, the outcome of the petitioner's trial would have been different. The jury knew of the\n   substantive terms of the witnesses' agreements with the state, could have reasonably inferred a connection between their cooperation and their reduced bonds, and was fully informed that the witnesses might have potential biases against the petitioner. Under the circumstances of the present case, we are confident that the outcome of the petitioner's trial would not have been different if Cocheo specifically impeached Valentin and Smith with the relevant transcripts. The habeas court, therefore, properly concluded that the petitioner was not denied the effective assistance of counsel at his criminal trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Although the petitioner claims that his rights under article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 9, of the constitution of Connecticut were violated, he has failed to provide an independent analysis under our state constitution.

The following colloquy took place between the prosecutor, Paul E. Murray, defense counsel for Smith, Anthony Basilica, and the court in connection with the prosecutor providing the factual basis for Smith pleading guilty to manslaughter in the second degree:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    \"[The Prosecutor]: We recognize and have recognized from the beginning the value of [Smith's] cooperation. It has been the state's position that with respect to ... Booth, there was sufficient evidence and all probability to convict ... Booth of murder and conspiracy to commit murder without the assistance of [Smith] because ... Booth had been injudicious in his comments and had made statements in the presence of police officers, among other things, that clearly showed his involvement. With respect, however, to ... Gomez and ... Brown, the state would have had a difficult, if not impossible, case without the assistance of [Smith]. It was in fact [Smith's] cooperation that led to their arrest. He testified at their probable cause hearing, and he testified extensively at the trial....\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    \"\n    <em>\n     Early in the proceedings, after the trial of ... Booth, Brown, and Gomez, as long ago as when Judge Purtill was ... still the presiding judge in this judicial district on the criminal side, we had had discussions about the disposition in this case, and the state has always offered a plea to a manslaughter charge. And the state has always offered to agree to a recommendation of the state of a ten year sentence to be served with\n    </em>\n    [\n    <em>\n     Smith\n    </em>\n    ]\n    <em>\n     reserving the right to argue for less. Again, as long ago as when Judge Purtill was presiding and Judge Purtill had heard the testimony of\n    </em>\n    [\n    <em>\n     Smith\n    </em>\n    ]\n    <em>\n     at the probable cause hearing, Judge Purtill had indicated his inclination to impose a substantially lesser sentence than the ten years that the state was recommending. We have been aware of that from the beginning.\n    </em>\n    And I know that this court has indicated a sentence of, I believe, [fifteen] months....\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    \"So, that is the basis on which this plea is entered, and factual basis on which the charges are brought.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    \"The Court: Thank you.

It is unclear on this record, however, as to precisely when that agreement or understanding might have existed. The petitioner did not call the prosecutor or Smith to testify during his habeas trial and, therefore, we are left to speculate as to when such an agreement or understanding might have existed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Murray represented the state at the petitioner's consolidated criminal trial. He also represented the state in connection with the criminal proceedings against Valentin and Smith.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    The habeas court concluded that no agreements existed between Valentin and Smith, on the one hand, and the state, on the other, insofar as there was no specific agreement as to what sentence the state would recommend. On the basis of our review of the record, that conclusion is amply supported by the record. But that conclusion is incorrect, however, insofar as it ignores the fact that the state\n    <em>\n     had agreed\n    </em>\n    to bring the cooperation of Valentin and Smith to the attention of the sentencing court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    We note that the habeas court did not explicitly find that the state disclosed or otherwise did not suppress the impeachment evidence relating to how the state allegedly assisted Valentin and Smith in reducing their bonds. The habeas court's memorandum of decision simply concludes that \"[n]othing about the nature of the agreements or their disclosure was violative of\n    <em>\n     Brady\n    </em>\n    or\n    <em>\n     Giglio\n    </em>\n    .\" On the basis of the evidence before it, including the transcripts from the respective bond hearings for both witnesses, it is implicit in the habeas court's conclusion that the petitioner failed to prove that the state did not disclose or otherwise suppressed this impeachment evidence.
