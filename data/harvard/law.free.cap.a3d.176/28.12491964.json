Garfield accepting the presidential nomination (July 12, 1880), The American Presidency Project, available at http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=76221 (last visited January 17, 2018). In the present case, we acknowledge that the plaintiffs have painted a vivid picture of an imperfect public educational system in this state that is straining to serve many students who, because their basic needs for, among other things, adequate parenting, financial resources, housing, nutrition and care for their physical and psychological health are not being met, cannot take advantage of the educational opportunities that the state is offering.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We are highly\n   sympathetic to the plight\n   of these struggling students. Indeed, we join our voice to the voices of those who urge the state to do all that it reasonably can to ensure not only that all children in this state have the bare opportunity to receive the minimally adequate education required by article eighth, \u00a7 1, of the Connecticut constitution,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   but also that the neediest children have the support that they need to actually take advantage of that opportunity. It is not the function of the courts, however, to create educational policy or to attempt by judicial fiat to eliminate all of the societal deficiencies that continue to frustrate the state's educational efforts. Rather, the function of the courts is to determine whether the narrow and specific criteria for a minimally adequate educational system under our state constitution have been satisfied. Once a determination of minimal adequacy has been made, courts simply are not in a position to determine whether schools in poorer districts would be better off expending scarce additional resources on more teachers, more computers, more books, more technical staff, more meals, more guidance counselors, more health care, more English instruction, greater preschool availability, or some other resource. Such judgments are quintessentially legislative in nature. Because we conclude that the trial court was correct in its initial\n   determination that the plaintiffs failed to establish that the state's educational offerings are not minimally adequate under article eighth, \u00a7 1, and in its determination that the state has not violated their equal protection rights under the state constitution, the plaintiffs cannot prevail on their claims that the state has not provided them with a suitable and substantially equal educational opportunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The individual plaintiffs\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the named plaintiff, the Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc. (Coalition), brought this action seeking, among other things, a declaratory judgment that the defendants, various state officials and members of the State Board of Education,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   failed to provide suitable and substantially\n   equal educational opportunities to the individual plaintiffs in violation of article eighth, \u00a7 1, and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 20, of the Connecticut constitution, as amended by articles five and twenty-one of the amendments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Applying the controlling legal standard, as set\n   forth in\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4303959\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/295/240/#p342\">\n    295 Conn. 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 342-43,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=990%20A.2d%20206\">\n    990 A.2d 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) (\n   <em>\n    Palmer, J.\n   </em>\n   , concurring in the judgment), the trial court held that the plaintiffs have not established that the state has failed to provide children in any school district in this state with minimally adequate teachers, educational facilities and instrumentalities, as required by article eighth, \u00a7 1. In addition, the court concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to establish a violation of the equal protection provisions of the state constitution, article first, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 20. The trial court then proceeded to apply, however, a new legal standard that is not supported by our precedent, pursuant to which that court considered numerous educational policies and practices that are not part of the controlling standard, and held that the state's educational policies and spending practices violate article eighth, \u00a7 1, because they are not \"rationally, substantially and verifiably connected to creating educational opportunities for children.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The defendants appeal from the trial court's decision that they have violated article eighth, \u00a7 1, and the plaintiffs cross appeal from the trial court's rulings that they did not establish that the state has failed to provide minimally adequate educational opportunities to the children in any school district in the state and have not violated the plaintiffs' equal protection rights under the state constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude that the trial court\n   properly found that the plaintiffs have failed to present sufficient evidence that the state is not providing children in this state with minimally adequate educational resources that satisfy the requirements of article eighth, \u00a7 1. We further conclude that, having made this determination, the trial court should have held that the defendants have not violated that constitutional provision, and it should not have gone on to apply a new constitutional test. Finally, we conclude that the trial court properly found that the plaintiffs failed to establish that the state has violated the equal protection provisions of the state constitution. We therefore conclude that the plaintiffs have failed to establish that the defendants have violated the plaintiffs' rights under article eighth, \u00a7 1, and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 20. Accordingly, we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the trial court.\n   The record reveals the following procedural history and facts that either were found by the trial court or are undisputed. In 2005, the plaintiffs filed a complaint alleging, among other things, that the defendants had violated article eighth, \u00a7 1, and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 20, of the state constitution by \"failing to maintain a public school system that provides [them] with suitable and substantially equal educational opportunities ....\" Thereafter, the defendants filed a motion to strike certain portions of the complaint, claiming that these state constitutional provisions do not confer a right to \" 'suitable' \" educational opportunities and do not \"guarantee equality or parity of educational achievement or results.\" The trial court concluded that the plaintiffs' claims were justiciable, but that article eighth, \u00a7 1, did not guarantee a right to a suitable public education. Accordingly, the trial court granted the defendants' motion to strike the portions of the plaintiffs' complaint making that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Thereafter, the Chief Justice granted the plaintiffs' application for certification to appeal to this court pursuant\n   to General Statutes \u00a7 52-265a. See\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rell\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4303959\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/295/240/#p342\">\n    295 Conn. at 243-44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=990%20A.2d%20206\">\n    990 A.2d 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Parent members still did not have the right to vote,\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   but they\n   did have the right to participate in general membership meetings. The bylaws also provided that the powers of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   members of the Coalition \"include, but are not limited to, the power to initiate and pursue litigation, to hire experts and other staff, and to make spending decisions.\" In addition, the bylaws provided that two parent members would be members of the Coalition's steering committee, which, among other duties, had the responsibility to oversee the Coalition's routine business, to \"steer policies and promote strategies aimed at ensuring progress toward achieving the goals and objectives\" of the Coalition, to \"provide ongoing direction, advice, and support to [a]gents of the [c]orporation,\" and to \"modify the budget as is reasonable and necessary ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The defendants contend that the parents were not true members of the Coalition because the 2005 version of the Coalition's bylaws \"gave the power to initiate and pursue litigation to a board over which the parent members had no voice whatsoever\" because they lacked voting rights. The defendants also contend that, despite the provisions of the 2013 bylaws allowing parent members to belong to the Coalition's steering committee and to have the same powers as other members \"to initiate and pursue litigation, to hire experts and other staff, and to make spending decisions,\" these powers were illusory because the parent members still had no right to vote.

Indeed, we cannot perceive why the parent members would, by maintaining their membership status, allow the Coalition to use them as \"pawns ... in an attempt to provide standing,\" as the defendants claim, if the Coalition was not representing their views or protecting their interests as they perceive them. We conclude, therefore, that the fact that the parent members lack voting rights does not defeat the Coalition's associational standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The defendants also claim, however, that, even if the parent members are now actual members of the Coalition for purposes of the first prong of the\n   <em>\n    Worrell\n   </em>\n   test, because the Coalition had no parent members when this action was initiated in 2005 the Coalition lacked standing at that time, and a subject matter jurisdictional defect that existed when the complaint was filed cannot be cured by a subsequent amendment. The\n   following additional procedural history is relevant to our resolution of this claim. After the plaintiffs filed their original complaint in 2005, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Coalition's claims for lack of standing under\n   <em>\n    Worrell.\n   </em>\n   The trial court,\n   <em>\n    Shortall, J.\n   </em>\n   , granted the motion. In his memorandum of decision, Judge Shortall noted that, according to an affidavit filed by counsel for the Coalition, and contrary to the allegations of the original complaint, the Coalition had no parent members when the complaint was filed. Although the plaintiffs had filed an amended complaint alleging that the Coalition now had parent members, and submitted an affidavit to that effect, the amended complaint did not allege that the parent members were \"parents of students in the public schools of Connecticut.\" Accordingly, the court concluded that the Coalition did not meet the first prong of the\n   <em>\n    Worrell\n   </em>\n   test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Thereafter, the plaintiffs sought leave to file a second amended complaint in order to cure the standing deficiency by including an allegation that the Coalition's parent\n   members were parents of students in the Connecticut public schools. The trial court granted the request for leave to amend over the objection of the defendants. As we have previously explained in this opinion, the trial court subsequently granted the defendants' motion to strike portions of the second amended complaint, and the plaintiffs appealed from that ruling to this court pursuant to \u00a7 52-265a. After this court reversed the decision of the trial court and remanded the case for further proceedings, the plaintiffs were granted leave to file a third amended complaint and defendants filed another motion to dismiss the Coalition's claims for lack of standing. The trial court,\n   <em>\n    Dubay, J.\n   </em>\n   , denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The defendants claim that Judge Dubay improperly denied their motion to dismiss the Coalition's claims because, at the time that the original complaint was\n   filed, the Coalition had no parent members who would have had standing to bring this action in their own right, and a jurisdictional defect cannot be cured retroactively.

If the trial court had rendered a judgment of dismissal in those cases, the plaintiffs would not have been permitted to cure the jurisdictional defects with subsequent pleadings because there no longer would have been any pending action in which to file them. In contrast, the original complaint in the present case was not dismissed when the trial court initially determined that the Coalition lacked standing because the individual plaintiffs named in the original complaint still had standing as parents of students in Connecticut schools. Accordingly, the sole effect of dismissing the Coalition's claims was to remove the Coalition as a plaintiff. When the Coalition subsequently gained associational standing to raise the claims, however, we can perceive no reason why it would not have been permitted to join the action as a plaintiff pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 9-3, assuming, of course, that it satisfied all prongs of the\n   <em>\n    Worrell\n   </em>\n   test.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude, therefore, that it would elevate form over substance to hold that the trial court improperly allowed the plaintiffs to cure the jurisdictional defect with respect to the Coalition's claims by amending the complaint. The defendants have not explained how allowing the plaintiffs to amend their complaint, instead of requiring the Coalition to file a motion to join the action as a plaintiff, could have allowed the plaintiffs to reap any procedural advantage or caused any detriment to the defendants. Accordingly, we reject the defendants' claim that the Coalition lacks associational standing under the first prong of\n   <em>\n    Worrell\n   </em>\n   because none of its members had standing to bring this action in their own right when the original complaint was filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Second Prong of the\n   <em>\n    Worrell\n   </em>\n   Test\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The defendants also claim that the Coalition fails the second prong of the\n   <em>\n    Worrell\n   </em>\n   associational standing test, i.e., that \"the interests [that the Coalition] seeks to protect are germane to the organization's purpose\";\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Assn. of Health Care Facilities, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Worrell\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"535638\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/199/609/#p616\">\n    199 Conn. at 616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=508%20A.2d%20743\">\n    508 A.2d 743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; because \"its membership is irremediably riddled with inherent conflicts regarding educational policy issues germane to this case.\" Specifically,\n   the defendants claim that the Coalition's membership includes, among others, municipalities and local school boards with diverse locations and demographics, teachers' unions and parents. The defendants contend that, although all members might agree on one\n   point-the need for the state to put more money into the educational system-they would not agree on how the money should be distributed. The defendants point out that potential changes in funding that would benefit one school district might harm another district. The defendants also point out that one member of the Coalition, the Connecticut Association of Public School Superintendents, is opposed to laws governing binding arbitration for teacher pay. According to the defendants, this position is squarely at odds with the interests of the two teachers' unions that are members of the Coalition. As another example, the defendants point out that one member of the Coalition, the city of Bridgeport, has taken the position through the testimony of its superintendent of schools that teacher termination laws and due process requirements should be changed to make it easier to terminate ineffective administrators and teachers, a position with which the teachers' unions also would disagree. We conclude that these potential conflicts do not deprive the Coalition of associational standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As noted by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, courts \"have not been uniform in their approach to the presence of conflicts of interest in an association seeking standing.\"\n   <em>\n    Retired Chicago Police Assn.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Chicago\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10512190\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/7/584/#p603\">\n    7 F.3d 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 603 (7th Cir. 1993).

Nevertheless, the court concluded that the potential for\n   a conflict of interest was outweighed by the benefits provided by associational standing, namely, that many associations have \"a [preexisting] reservoir of expertise and capital\" upon which its members can draw and that associations provide people with \"an effective vehicle for vindicating interests that they share with others.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207298\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/274/#p290\">\n    Id., at 289-90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207298\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/274/#p290\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Although the defendants' claim highlights the immense complexity of the state's educational system and the wide variety of interests that the state must consider when formulating educational policies-circumstances that certainly support the notion that courts have very limited institutional competence to craft educational remedies for the types of claims raised in the present case and, therefore, must be extremely cautious when inserting themselves into this area-we conclude that the conflicts of interests among the Coalition's members are not so profound as to deprive the Coalition of associational standing. There is no evidence that a majority of the Coalition's members disagrees with the Coalition's claim that the defendants have deprived students in the state's poorer school districts with a suitable and substantially equal educational opportunity in violation of article eighth, \u00a7 1, and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 20; the Coalition's primary litigation goal is not directly at odds with the interests of part of its membership; no members objected to the Coalition initiating this action; no member of the Coalition has expressed the belief that the relief sought by the plaintiffs in this action would not be generally beneficial to the state's educational system; there is no evidence that any member has challenged or intends to challenge the Coalition's claims in this litigation in\n   court;\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   there is no evidence that the Coalition is operating for the purposes other than those stated in its bylaws;\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   and there is no claim that the\n   Coalition brought this litigation without first informing its members or following the procedures in its own bylaws. In the absence of any such evidence, any harm resulting to any member of the Coalition as the result of this litigation would be simply \"part of the cost of obtaining the benefits of the association.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Retired Chicago Police Assn.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Chicago\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10512190\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/7/584/#p603\">\n    7 F.3d at 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For example, if a court concludes that the state's educational system satisfies the\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   criteria, the fact that the state spends large sums of money on special education that, in the court's personal view, would be better spent on hiring teachers for regular classrooms is no more relevant than the fact that the state spends large sums of money on its Medicaid program or on road construction.

Indeed, the plaintiffs ultimately contend in their reply brief to this court that the conclusion that the trial court drew from the evidence should not have been that the state's graduation\n   standards, teacher evaluation and compensation schemes, and spending on special education are irrational, but that \"many districts with high needs populations are not receiving adequate resources to provide an adequate educational opportunity to many of their students.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the plaintiffs appear to concede that, to the extent that Justice Palmer's concurring opinion in\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , contained a reasonableness component, that component is part and parcel of the constitutional standard for determining the minimal adequacy of the state's educational offerings and not a separate rationality test applicable to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   educational policies and programs, even when the\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   criteria have been satisfied. Accordingly, we agree with the defendants that, having found that the educational resources provided by the state reasonably meet the minimal needs of the state's students-that is, the state's educational offerings, even in the poorest school districts, are sufficient to enable students who take advantage of them to become functional members of society-and that the\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   criteria were therefore met, the trial court should have concluded that the state's educational system satisfies article eighth, \u00a7 1, and it should not have gone on to apply a constitutional standard of its own devising. By doing so, not only did the trial court fail to defer to the legislature, it also usurped the legislative responsibility to determine how additional funding, beyond the constitutionally required minimum, should be allocated and how to craft educational policies that, in its view, best balance the wide variety of interests at issue.

Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court initially applied the proper standard when it concluded that the state's educational offerings satisfy the minimal constitutional standard set forth in Justice Palmer's\n   concurring opinion in\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Finally, to the extent that the plaintiffs contend that, even if the Campaign II standard does not apply, the trial court failed to apply the\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   criteria properly because it did not consider whether the state's educational offerings\n   <em>\n    reasonably\n   </em>\n   address the minimal educational needs of the state's children, we disagree. As we have explained, it is implicit in the\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   standard that the educational\n   opportunities offered by the state must be sufficient to enable a student who takes advantage of them to attain a level of knowledge of reading, writing, mathematics, science, and social studies that will, in turn, enable the student to perform the basic functions of an adult in our society.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   See footnote 25 of this opinion. There simply is no sense in which a teacher providing instruction pursuant to a particular curriculum under particular classroom conditions could be considered a minimally adequate educational opportunity if the teacher, the curriculum or the conditions were not sufficient to enable a student who attends to the instruction to obtain a minimally adequate education. In turn, there is no sense in which an education can be considered minimally adequate if a person who has acquired that level of education is unable to perform the basic functions of an adult. Accordingly, the trial court's finding that the state's educational offerings satisfy the\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   criteria for a minimally adequate educational opportunity necessarily encompassed a finding that those educational offerings reasonably address the minimal educational needs of the state's children.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   The dissent disagrees, and would conclude that the trial court improperly applied the\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   criteria.

With respect to the dissent's claim that satisfaction of the\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   criteria is necessary, but not sufficient, to establish a constitutionally\n   adequate educational\n   opportunity, Justice Palmer could not have been clearer in his concurring opinion in\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , that the constitutional standard to be applied by the courts should not be broad and vague, but must be narrow and specific.

In my view, the broader the standard, the more vague it is likely to be. In addition, the broader the standard, the more difficult it will be for the parties and the court to understand and apply it. I also disagree with the plurality's suggestion that a broad standard is beneficial because it may be 'refined and developed further' at trial. Although some constitutional standards must be defined in broad terms because of the applicability to a vast number of fact patterns, this is not such a case; for purposes of a case like the present one, in which it is critically important to give as much guidance to the court and the parties as possible, the more clearly defined the standard, the better.\"). The dissent's claim in the present case is entirely inconsistent with these principles; a standard that fails to specify all of the criteria that must be met in order to establish that the state's educational offerings meet the constitutional minimum is neither narrow nor specific. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly determined that, if the\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   criteria are satisfied, the state's educational offerings are not constitutionally inadequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   With respect to the dissent's claim that the trial court failed to consider whether the state's educational offerings are \"designed to address the basic educational needs of at risk learners in underprivileged communities,\" the dissent has failed to explain why the courts must make this determination when it agrees that they are barred from requiring the state either \"to overcome\n   every serious social and personal disadvantage that students bring with them to school\";\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rell\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4303959\" index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/295/240/#p342\">\n    295 Conn. at 344-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=990%20A.2d%20206\">\n    990 A.2d 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Palmer, J.\n   </em>\n   , concurring in the judgment); or to guarantee good educational outcomes.

As Justice Palmer repeatedly emphasized in\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , courts have little institutional competence to make the determination as to which disadvantaging conditions are the most serious or how and to what extent those conditions should be alleviated by the state. See footnote 26 of this opinion. Moreover, it is difficult to imagine a broader or vaguer standard than whether the state's educational offerings are \"designed to address the basic educational needs of at risk learners in underprivileged communities.\" We conclude, therefore, that this standard is not encompassed by the narrow and specific\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   criteria.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In any event, even if this were the proper standard, the trial court\n   <em>\n    expressly found\n   </em>\n   that there are numerous state and federal programs that are designed to provide needy students with \"breakfast, lunch, and many times food to take home,\" even during the summer months when school is not in session, to provide parental education, to address the needs of homeless\n   students, to prevent sexually transmitted diseases, to address the needs of students who are parents as well as pregnant students, and to provide mental health programs. The\n   court concluded that the existence of these programs shows that \"the state is devoting to needy schools a great deal more in resources than is required by the modest standard [set forth in\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   ].\" As we conclude in part III of this opinion, we see nothing in the record that would compel a different conclusion, and the dissent provides no guidance on the nature or quantity of the additional resources that the state would be required to devote to needy students in order to meet the dissent's new standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The dissent also claims that the trial court stripped \"rationality review\" from its analysis pursuant to Campaign I\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   For the reasons that we have already explained, we disagree. We further disagree with the dissent's claim that \"there is no indication that the court considered any of [the specific factual findings that the plaintiffs rely on] ....\" We decline to presume that the trial court made 1060 specific factual findings, filling 157 single-spaced pages, only to then conclude that the findings were completely irrelevant to its legal analysis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   We also disagree with the dissent's contention that the trial court improperly applied the\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   criteria on a statewide basis instead of determining on a school by school or school district by school district basis whether the state's educational offerings are constitutionally adequate. As we have already explained at length, the trial court made copious factual findings regarding conditions in specific schools and school districts and expressly found that the state is meeting its\n   constitutional obligations in the poorest and neediest schools.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Finally, the dissent contends that, in applying the constitutional standard, the trial court was required \"first [to determine] whether students have in fact been unable to obtain a minimally adequate education\" and then to consider whether any poor educational outcomes that the court discovered were \" 'the result of specific deficient educational inputs, or [have been] caused by factors not attributable to, or capable of remediation by, state action or omission ....' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is yet another variation on the theme that the trial court was\n   required to consider educational outcomes as part of its\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   analysis, a theme that is completely discordant with the overall tenor of Justice Palmer's concurring opinion in\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , in which he emphasized that the trial court's focus must be on\n   <em>\n    inputs.\n   </em>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rell\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4303959\" index=\"257\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/295/240/#p342\">\n    295 Conn. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   345 n.19,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"258\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=990%20A.2d%20206\">\n    990 A.2d 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Palmer, J.\n   </em>\n   , concurring\n   in the judgment). If the court determines that educational\n   <em>\n    inputs\n   </em>\n   are minimally adequate to enable a student who takes advantage of them to perform the basic functions of an adult, it necessarily follows that poor outcomes must be caused by disadvantaging factors for which the court has no authority to order a remedy under the guise of enforcing the educational guarantee embodied in article eighth, \u00a7 1. That is the very rationale for limiting the trial court's consideration to inputs. Indeed, even the plurality opinion in\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , on which the dissent relies instead of Justice Palmer's controlling opinion, expressly recognized that article eighth, \u00a7 1, \"is not a panacea for all of the social ills that contribute to many of the achievement deficiencies identified by the plaintiffs\";\n   <extracted-citation index=\"259\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=990%20A.2d%20206\">\n    id., at 320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"260\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=990%20A.2d%20206\">\n    990 A.2d 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (plurality opinion); and declined to take any stand on the question of the extent to which the trial court could consider outputs, if at all.

Accordingly, we emphatically reject the dissent's suggestion that the \"evaluation of educational outputs will, in many instances, be a fundamental and necessary starting point in evaluating claims brought under article eighth, \u00a7 1,\" and that \"outcomes provide the clearest evidence of whether Connecticut's students are in fact receiving a minimally adequate education.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In short, the dissent has adopted a new constitutional standard that is far broader and vaguer than the\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   criteria that Justice Palmer adopted in his concurring opinion in\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , which is controlling. This new constitutional standard is entirely inconsistent with Justice Palmer's conclusions that the criteria for determining whether the state's schools are minimally adequate must be narrow and specific, that the courts must defer to the educational policy choices of the political branches, that the state is not constitutionally\n   required to overcome all disadvantages that students bring with them to school and that courts have little institutional competence to address the intractable and complex questions that arise in the area of educational policy. We believe that, to the contrary, because the role of the court is to apply the precedent on which the parties and the trial court reasonably relied, the narrow and specific\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   criteria that Justice Palmer outlined in his concurring opinion in\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , provide the correct constitutional standard, and we conclude that the trial court properly applied that standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   PLAINTIFFS' CLAIM THAT THE TRIAL COURT IMPROPERLY CONCLUDED THAT THE EVIDENCE DID NOT SUPPORT THEIR CLAIM THAT THE\n   <em>\n    CAMPAIGN I\n   </em>\n   CRITERIA WERE NOT SATISFIED\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The plaintiffs next claim that the trial court improperly concluded that the state has not violated article eighth, \u00a7 1, by failing to provide educational resources that comply with the\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   criteria adopted by Justice Palmer in his concurring opinion in\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rell\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4303959\" index=\"263\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/295/240/#p342\">\n    295 Conn. at 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"264\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=990%20A.2d%20206\">\n    990 A.2d 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, the plaintiffs contend that the trial court's conclusion that the\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   criteria have been satisfied cannot be reconciled with the trial court's findings that the school districts with the neediest students have fewer experienced teachers than other districts, shortages of specialist teachers, interventionists and counselors, inadequate classroom facilities, and insufficient quantities of educational technologies and instructional resources. In addition, they claim, the court's conclusion was contradicted by its findings that large numbers of students in poverty and students in high needs districts are not achieving, or even approaching, appropriate educational\n   outcomes as measured by standardized test scores, that classrooms in high needs districts \"often\" have significantly more students per class than other schools, that high needs districts are unable to provide sufficient \"socioemotional and related support services,\" such as guidance counselors, psychologists, social workers and special education teachers, to their students, and that preschool opportunities are unavailable for large numbers of low income students.

In addition, the plaintiffs contend, the undisputed evidence showed that the ratio of education spending in the ninety-fifth percentile town ranked by \"equalized net grand list per capita,\" Cornwall, to education spending in the fifth percentile town, West Haven, was $25,718 to $12,157, or 2.12, much worse than the same ratio for any year considered by the court in\n   <em>\n    Horton II.\n   </em>\n   See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"293\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=486%20A.2d%201099\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (highest ratio from 1973 through 1984 was 1.87 and lowest was 1.68). Because the court in\n   <em>\n    Horton II\n   </em>\n   concluded that the plaintiffs had established more than de minimis disparities in educational spending sufficient to satisfy the first part of the constitutional standard, the plaintiffs contend, they also necessarily satisfied the first part.\n   We are not persuaded. The plaintiffs in the present case are not claiming, as the plaintiffs did in\n   <em>\n    Horton I\n   </em>\n   , that the state has discriminated against property poor towns by requiring all towns to fund education primarily with local property taxes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, they are claiming that\n   the state is discriminating against schools with high numbers of poor and needy students by failing to ensure that such schools have funding that is substantially equal to the funding provided to other schools.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus,\n   to make a prima facie case under article first, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 20, the plaintiffs must show that disparities in educational funding between towns with large numbers of poor and needy students and schools with small numbers of such students are more than de minimis. Contrary to the plaintiffs' contention, this claim is not supported by the evidence showing that the ratio between the highest spending town and the lowest spending town is 2.30 and that the ratio of educational spending in the ninety-fifth percentile town ranked by \"equalized net grand list per capita\" to the educational spending in the fifth percentile town was 2.12 because the plaintiffs have not established that these particular school districts reasonably may be treated as proxies\n   for the school districts with the least and the most numbers of poor and needy students.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   The only evidence that the plaintiffs have cited that\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   shed light on the question of whether there are more than de minimis disparities in funding between schools serving large numbers of poor and needy students and other schools tends to undermine their claim. For example, they have cited undisputed evidence that shows that, in 2013, of the towns having student enrollments greater than 1000,\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   total education spending per pupil in the wealthiest decile as measured by \"equalized net grand list per capita\" was, on average, $15,713.61, compared to an average of $13,416.29 in the poorest decile.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   This spending ratio is 1.17, a figure that is significantly lower than any of the figures that the court in\n   <em>\n    Horton II\n   </em>\n   cited as prima facie evidence of more than de minimis disparities. Other undisputed evidence shows that, in the same year, the state provided funding of nearly $9500 per student to schools in the poorest\n   decile of school districts with at least 1000 students, compared to less than $1200 per pupil in the wealthiest decile, a ratio of approximately eight to one.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the trial court observed, it is difficult to see how this evidence supports the plaintiffs' claim that the state is discriminating\n   <em>\n    against\n   </em>\n   its poorest and neediest students.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   We conclude, however, that we need not determine whether the plaintiffs have established a prima facie showing of more\n   than de minimis disparities because, even if they have, we conclude that the defendants have satisfied the second and third parts of\n   <em>\n    Horton II\n   </em>\n   , requiring them to prove that disparities in education spending are justified by a legitimate state policy and are not so great as to be unconstitutional. See\n   <em>\n    Horton II\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"689222\" index=\"294\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/195/24/#p38\">\n    195 Conn. at 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"295\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=486%20A.2d%201099\">\n    486 A.2d 1099\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . With respect to the second part, the legitimate state policies that this court approved in\n   <em>\n    Horton II\n   </em>\n   were that the state's funding program \"would provide sufficient overall expenditures for public\n   school education ... and a proper balance between state and local contributions thereto.\" Id., at 39-40,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"296\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=486%20A.2d%201099\">\n    486 A.2d 1099\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We have concluded in the present case that the trial court properly found that the state is providing a minimally adequate educational opportunity in all school districts according to the\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   criteria. Thus, the state is providing \"sufficient overall expenditures for public education ....\" Id., at 39,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"298\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=486%20A.2d%201099\">\n    486 A.2d 1099\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In addition, the trial court found that the state is contributing significantly more funds to the neediest school districts than to the least needy, a finding that is also supported by the evidence. Under these circumstances, we do not believe that the fact that the wealthier school districts spend more per pupil on education than the poorer school districts by supplementing educational funds provided by the state with funds derived from local property taxes renders the funding scheme unconstitutional. Indeed, the court in\n   <em>\n    Horton II\n   </em>\n   found that the policy in favor of preserving \"local choice\" justified far greater disparities in per student spending than the disparity in per student spending that has been established in the present case between the towns in the wealthiest decile and those in the poorest decile. Id., at 40,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"299\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=486%20A.2d%201099\">\n    486 A.2d 1099\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The plaintiffs contend, however, that this court rejected the maintenance of local control of schools as a legitimate public policy that would justify disparities in education spending in\n   <em>\n    Horton I\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"507234\" index=\"300\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/172/615/#p646\">\n    172 Conn. at 638, 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"301\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=376%20A.2d%20359\">\n    376 A.2d 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , when this court recounted with approval the trial court's finding that, \"although local control of public schools is a legitimate state objective, since local control of education need not be diminished if the ability of towns to finance education is equalized, the local control objective is not a rational basis for retention of\n   the present financing system ....\" In\n   <em>\n    Horton II\n   </em>\n   , however, we clarified this statement when we held that, if the state provides significant equalizing funds to poorer towns, the state need not place limits on what wealthier towns may spend on education, thereby retaining room for local control. See\n   <em>\n    Horton II\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"689222\" index=\"302\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/195/24/#p38\">\n    195 Conn. at 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"303\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=486%20A.2d%201099\">\n    486 A.2d 1099\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We express no opinion on whether allowing wealthier towns to supplement education spending through local property taxes is the best education policy. We do conclude, however, that such a policy is not unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Under the third part of\n   <em>\n    Horton II\n   </em>\n   , the state must prove that the effect of the state's education funding system is \"to narrow significantly disparities in the ability of local communities to finance local education and to increase significantly the state's share of overall educational costs for public schools.\" (Footnote omitted.) Id., at 40,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"304\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=376%20A.2d%20359\">\n    376 A.2d 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Again, this part is satisfied by the trial court's finding that the state's education spending is \"tilt[ed]\" strongly in favor of needier school districts, a finding that was supported by the undisputed evidence showing that, in 2013, there was a strong inverse correlation between\n   the wealth of a school district and the amount of state aid that it received. Although neither the plaintiffs nor the defendants have directed us to any evidence that is probative on the issue of whether the state's share of overall education funding has increased significantly from some benchmark date, the trial court expressly found that \"the state has not violated the constitution by devoting an overall inadequate level of resources to the schools,\" and the plaintiffs have not directly challenged that finding on appeal. Rather, they have relied on disparities in educational funding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Although the plaintiffs have convincingly demonstrated that in this state there is a gap in educational achievement between the poorest and neediest students and their more fortunate peers, disparities in educational\n   achievement, standing alone, do not constitute proof that our state constitution's equal protection provisions have been violated. The plaintiffs have not shown that this gap is the result of the state's unlawful discrimination against poor and needy students in its provision of educational resources as opposed to the complex web of disadvantaging societal conditions over which the schools have no control. Indeed, the trial court found that the state is providing significantly more educational resources to schools with large numbers of poor and needy students than to other schools. We conclude, therefore, that the plaintiffs have failed to establish that the defendants have violated article eighth, \u00a7 1, and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 20, by failing to provide a minimally adequate and substantially equal educational opportunity to all students in this state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The judgment is reversed with respect to the trial court's determination that the defendants are violating article eighth, \u00a7 1, of the Connecticut constitution and the case is remanded to that court with direction to render judgment for the defendants on that claim; the judgment is affirmed with respect to the trial court's determination that the defendants are providing a substantially equal educational opportunity under article first, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 20, of the Connecticut constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   In this opinion EVELEIGH, VERTEFEUILLE and ALVORD, Js., concurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   PALMER, J., with whom ROBINSON and SHELDON, Js., Concurring and Dissenting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   \"[A] sound education is the 'very foundation of good citizenship.

As an initial matter, I agree, for the reasons articulated in the majority opinion, that both the individual plaintiffs\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the named plaintiff, the Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc., have standing to pursue the present action. I also agree with the majority's analysis of the equal protection issue and with its conclusion that the trial court correctly determined that there was no equal protection violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Turning to the principal substantive question-whether the state has satisfied its obligation to provide underprivileged children with minimally adequate educational opportunities as required by article eighth, \u00a7 1, of the Connecticut constitution-I agree with the majority's threshold determination that my articulation of the\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   test in\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4303959\" index=\"310\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/295/240/#p342\">\n    295 Conn. 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 342,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"311\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=990%20A.2d%20206\">\n    990 A.2d 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) (\n   <em>\n    Palmer, J.\n   </em>\n   , concurring in the judgment), represents the controlling legal standard. Furthermore, I largely agree with the way in which the majority characterizes my position in\n   <em>\n    Rell\n   </em>\n   , both in terms of how I articulated the\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   test and the extent to which my views differed from those of the plurality. First, the majority properly recognizes that whether the state has satisfied its obligation to afford minimally adequate educational opportunities may be evaluated on a district-by-district basis, and even at the level of individual schools;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the question is not merely whether Connecticut residents, in the aggregate, receive adequate schooling.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   See, e.g., footnote 15 of the majority opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Second, I agree with the majority that, when we consider whether the various\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   factors have been satisfied, we do not do so in a vacuum, divorced from the goals and purposes of a minimally adequate education. Instead, the state's compliance with its constitutional mandates must be evaluated in light of\n   whether the specific educational facilities, instrumentalities, curricula, and personnel; see part I B of this opinion; that the state provides are rationally calculated to allow a student who takes advantage of them to become a functional member of society. As the majority explains, \"[i]t is implicit in the\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   criteria ... that the educational opportunities offered by the state must be sufficient to enable a student who takes advantage of them to attain a level of knowledge of reading, writing, mathematics, science, and social studies that will enable the student to perform\n   the basic functions of an employable adult in our society, such as reading newspapers, tax forms and other basic texts, writing a basic letter, preparing a household budget, buying groceries, operating cars and household appliances, serving on a jury and voting.\" Footnote 25 of the majority opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Third, the majority properly emphasizes that judicial review of the state's education policies and spending priorities under article eighth, \u00a7 1, should be highly deferential, as such considerations are quintessentially legislative in nature. As I explained in\n   <em>\n    Rell\n   </em>\n   , \"the plaintiffs will not be able to prevail on their claims unless they are able to establish that what the state has done to discharge its obligations under article eighth, \u00a7 1, is so lacking as to be unreasonable by any fair or objective standard.\"\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rell\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4303959\" index=\"312\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/295/240/#p342\">\n    295 Conn. at 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"313\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=990%20A.2d%20206\">\n    990 A.2d 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Palmer, J.\n   </em>\n   , concurring in the judgment); see\n   <extracted-citation index=\"314\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=990%20A.2d%20206\">\n    id., at 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"315\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=990%20A.2d%20206\">\n    990 A.2d 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Palmer, J.\n   </em>\n   , concurring in the judgment) (plaintiffs must demonstrate that education \"reasonably cannot be considered sufficient by any fair measure\"); see also\n   <extracted-citation index=\"316\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=990%20A.2d%20206\">\n    id., at 335-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"317\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=990%20A.2d%20206\">\n    990 A.2d 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Palmer, J.\n   </em>\n   , concurring in the judgment) (explaining reasons why \"[s]pecial deference\" to legislature is warranted in matters of educational policy and funding).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Fourth, the majority recognizes that the scope of my disagreement with the plurality in\n   <em>\n    Rell\n   </em>\n   was quite\n   narrow. See footnote 46 of the majority opinion. My primary concern in\n   <em>\n    Rell\n   </em>\n   was that certain language in the plurality opinion could be construed to mean that article eighth, \u00a7 1, requires that the state\n   <em>\n    guarantee\n   </em>\n   that each student will receive a minimally adequate education.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   I concluded, by contrast, that the state constitution only guarantees each student the\n   <em>\n    opportunity\n   </em>\n   to obtain such an education. As the majority puts it, \"the state's offerings [must be] sufficient to enable a student who takes advantage of them to become a functional member of society.\" Text accompanying footnote 25 of the majority opinion. Requiring that each student actually be adequately educated would place an unreasonable burden on the state, insofar as schools \"cannot be constitutionally required to overcome every serious social and personal disadvantage that students bring with them to school, and that seriously hinder[s] the academic achievement of those students.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rell\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4303959\" index=\"318\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/295/240/#p342\">\n    295 Conn. at 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"319\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=990%20A.2d%20206\">\n    990 A.2d 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Palmer, J.\n   </em>\n   , concurring in the judgment); see also\n   <extracted-citation index=\"320\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=990%20A.2d%20206\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (because students' failure to achieve goals of constitutionally mandated education may be caused by factors not capable of remediation by state action, article eighth, \u00a7 1, \"is not a panacea for all of the social ills\" that contribute to achievement deficiencies of\n   underprivileged students [internal quotation\n   marks omitted] ). Beyond that, however, my understanding of the\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   test was not-and is not-substantively different from the standard that the plurality articulated in\n   <em>\n    Rell.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Finally, as I discuss more fully in part II B of this opinion, I agree with the majority that the trial court exceeded its mandate and failed to apply the proper standard of review in the second half (parts 5 through 8) of its memorandum of decision, in which it scrutinized the rationality of the state's various educational policies, procedures, and spending priorities. In the remainder of this opinion, I explain in what respects I do\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   agree with the majority opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Before I explain in what respects I think that both the trial court and the majority have gone astray, it will be helpful briefly to review the\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   test and to set forth with greater precision certain aspects of that test that could perhaps have been stated more directly in my concurrence in\n   <em>\n    Rell.\n   </em>\n   At the most basic level,\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   stands for the proposition that, to afford students the opportunity to obtain a minimally adequate education, the state must ensure the presence of certain core or essential components: \"Children are entitled to minimally adequate physical facilities and\n   classrooms which provide enough light, space, heat, and air to permit children to learn. [Facilities]. Children should have access to minimally adequate instrumentalities of learning such as desks, chairs, pencils, and reasonably current textbooks. [Instrumentalities]. Children are also entitled to minimally adequate teaching of reasonably up-to-date basic curricula such as reading, writing, mathematics, science, and social studies [curricula], by sufficient personnel adequately trained to teach those subject areas.

As I observed in\n   <em>\n    Rell\n   </em>\n   , for example, \"[i]t goes without saying that a safe and secure environment also is an essential element of a constitutionally adequate education.\"\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rell\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4303959\" index=\"324\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/295/240/#p342\">\n    295 Conn. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   342 n.15,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"325\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=990%20A.2d%20206\">\n    990 A.2d 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Palmer, J.\n   </em>\n   , concurring in the judgment). By the same token, in\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   , the New York Court of Appeals suggested that school transportation is necessary to ensure that students attend school a minimum number of days and thus receive a sound education. See\n   <em>\n    Campaign for Fiscal Equity, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4436656\" index=\"326\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/86/307/#p317\">\n    86 N.Y.2d at 316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4436656\" index=\"327\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/86/307/#p317\">\n    631 N.Y.S.2d 565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4436656\" index=\"328\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/86/307/#p317\">\n    655 N.E.2d 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ensuring that students have access to sustenance of some sort during the school day is almost certainly of the same ilk. The point, which I think is beyond cavil, is that it is not enough to satisfy constitutional requirements for the state simply to set up and equip school buildings and then hire teachers to teach therein. Reasonable\n   efforts must be made to ensure that those students who would avail themselves of the educational opportunity have a means of getting themselves to school and, once there, are not so preoccupied by hunger, fear for their personal safety, or other serious distractions as to render learning effectively impossible. See\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rell\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4303959\" index=\"329\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/295/240/#p342\">\n    295 Conn. at 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"330\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=990%20A.2d%20206\">\n    990 A.2d 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (plurality opinion) (\"[t]o satisfy this standard, the state, through the local school districts, must provide students with an objectively meaningful opportunity to receive the benefits of this constitutional right\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   It also bears emphasizing that the provision of books, teachers, buildings, and the like is not an end in itself, but all to the purpose of giving students the opportunity to obtain a minimally adequate modern education. What constitutes a minimally adequate education is, within reasonable limits, to be left to the discretion of the legislature. See, e.g.,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"331\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=990%20A.2d%20206\">\n    id., at 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"332\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=990%20A.2d%20206\">\n    990 A.2d 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Palmer, J.\n   </em>\n   , concurring in the judgment). Viewed in the broadest terms, such an education is one \"suitable to give [its students] the opportunity to be responsible citizens able to participate fully in democratic institutions, such as jury service and voting, and to prepare them to progress to institutions of higher education, or to attain productive employment and otherwise to contribute to the state's economy.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"333\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=990%20A.2d%20206\">\n    Id., at 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"334\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=990%20A.2d%20206\">\n    990 A.2d 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (plurality opinion). On a more practical level, the state has established various benchmarks, including standardized test scores, that, when taken together, help to inform our understanding of what a student who has received a minimally adequate education can be expected to know. What article eighth, \u00a7 1, requires, then, is that the state establish and maintain free public schools the core elements of which are reasonably calculated to deliver a minimally adequate\n   education, as so defined, to all those students who would take advantage of the opportunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   3\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   It follows from these principles that the state, in designing an educational system and delivering educational services, must make at least some reasonable effort to account for the distinct learning challenges that confront many of our state's least fortunate children. Although it may be assumed that many if not most of the students in Connecticut's more affluent towns have had their basic needs satisfied and arrive at school ready to learn, the same cannot be said for children who have spent their entire lives in poverty. Residents of our poorest communities, even those hungry to learn, may have to overcome a host of obstacles before they are able to attend to fractions and Fitzgerald. These run the gamut from homelessness, malnutrition, and illness, to violence in the home and in the community, to the pervasive and pernicious effects of racism. Some students struggle to learn in a non-native tongue; others wrestle with undiagnosed disabilities, whether physical, academic, or emotional/psychological.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   As I acknowledged in\n   <em>\n    Rell\n   </em>\n   , article eighth, \u00a7 1, is not a panacea for all of society's ills, and the state cannot be expected\n   to \"overcome every serious social and personal disadvantage that students bring with them to school ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"335\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=990%20A.2d%20206\">\n    Id., at 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"336\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=990%20A.2d%20206\">\n    990 A.2d 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Palmer, J.\n   </em>\n   , concurring in the judgment).

As a consequence ... Connecticut has an educational underclass that is being educated in a system [that] sets them up for economic, social, and intellectual failure.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rell\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4303959\" index=\"344\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/295/240/#p342\">\n    295 Conn. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   346 n.20,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"345\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=990%20A.2d%20206\">\n    990 A.2d 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Palmer, J.\n   </em>\n   , concurring in the judgment). There should be no doubt, then, that the\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   test, as articulated and applied in my concurrence in\n   <em>\n    Rell\n   </em>\n   , requires not only that the state provide the essential components of a minimally adequate education, including facilities, instrumentalities, curricula, and personnel, but also that some reasonable effort be made to ensure that those modalities are designed to address the basic educational needs of at risk learners in underprivileged communities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   The majority correctly notes that elementary and secondary schools are not the only source of support services, and that the state may choose to address the social, economic, and mental and physical health needs of underprivileged students through other state agencies, preschools, and other programs. See footnote 41 of the majority opinion. It is important to bear in mind, however, that article eighth, \u00a7 1, requires that the\n   <em>\n    state\n   </em>\n   , not the schools, provide students with the opportunity to obtain a minimally adequate education. If the plaintiffs\n   were able to establish that (1) such needs can be met through reasonable interventions, (2) the schools are not meeting such needs, and (3) the failure to meet such needs is denying high needs children the opportunity to receive a minimally adequate education, then the state must prove that it is addressing such needs outside of the school environment. In other words, the fact that the state has the discretion to address educational impediments through nonschool agencies does not relieve the state of its ultimate constitutional responsibility to ensure adequate educational opportunities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   In order to understand how this constitutional standard applies in practice, it will be helpful to briefly review where and how the trial court went astray.

The first component is adequate funding. In the first half (parts 3 and 4) of its memorandum of decision, the trial court evaluated aggregate state funding of facilities, equipment, teachers, and curricula, and assessed whether those expenditures were constitutionally sufficient. The trial court reviewed the state's educational expenditures according to a highly deferential standard, as prescribed in my concurrence in\n   <em>\n    Rell\n   </em>\n   , proceeding according to the principle that \"any constitutional standard the courts set for overall spending levels must be modest.\" The court evaluated whether overall state educational spending levels exceed the bare constitutional minimum, bearing in mind that, to find a violation, it had to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the resources that the state dedicates to education are \"unreasonable by any fair or objective standard ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Assessing the trial evidence according to this standard, the court concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate that the state's aggregate educational expenditures are constitutionally insufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   In this first portion of its analysis, the trial court also specifically concluded that the state has spent more than the constitutional minimum-whatever that sum might be-on new school building projects. It noted that the state (1) allocated $1 billion per year to spending on school buildings, (2) increased such spending over the course of the prior decade, and (3) approved and helped to fund more or less every new building project proposed by poor school districts such as those in the cities of Bridgeport and Hartford. The court further concluded that, when judged by a \"minimal standard,\" there was no evidence that there was a \"statewide failure\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   to provide schools with adequate resources to train their teachers, to acquire reasonably current books and other suitable equipment and facilities, or to deploy interventionists, teacher coaches, and technical support staff. In addition, the court discussed the various financial resources that are available to help the lowest performing districts invest in areas such as school improvements, student meals, after-school programs, and services for homeless and pregnant students, young parents, and individuals with mental health needs. Although the court's primary focus in this section of its decision was on financial resources, the court did also briefly observe that Connecticut's children are taught by minimally adequate teachers and provided with reasonably up-to-date basic curricula, and also that there was no evidence that the state's schools, when considered in the aggregate, lack enough light, space, heat, air, desks, chairs, pencils, or textbooks to permit children to learn. On the basis of these findings and conclusions, the court ultimately concluded that the\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   test that this court adopted in\n   <em>\n    Rell\n   </em>\n   had been satisfied and that the plaintiffs had failed to establish a constitutional violation in that respect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   The second portion of the trial court's analysis involved a more wide ranging review of the state's specific\n   educational policies, procedures, and priorities. In parts 5 through 8 of its decision, the trial court scrutinized everything from the amount of money spent on educating severely disabled students to the formula for teacher compensation set forth in individual school districts' collective bargaining agreements; from social promotion policies to the role that pork-barrel politics play in deciding which school construction projects will be authorized. The court appears to have concluded that its assessment of the rationality of these various policies and priorities was subject to a heightened standard of review rather than the highly deferential standard that I articulated in my concurrence in\n   <em>\n    Rell\n   </em>\n   and that the trial court itself applied in parts 3 and 4 of its decision when it assessed the state's aggregate spending in accordance with the four\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   factors. Specifically, the court proceeded on the assumption that not only specific educational policies and priorities but also the \"first principles\" that underlie them must be \"rationally, substantially, and verifiably\" related to teaching.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   In analyzing the plaintiffs' claims under article eighth, \u00a7 1, in this manner, the trial court failed to properly apply the\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   test in several respects. First, and most fundamentally, the court should not have treated educational funding and educational policy as distinct legal issues, subject to different legal standards. Rather, the proper approach was to evaluate whether the state's comprehensive system for delivering educational services-including financial and other resources, policies, and procedures-is rationally designed to ensure that each student will have the opportunity to obtain a minimally adequate education.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   In this respect, I agree with the majority insofar as it holds that the trial court, having once concluded that the\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   test was satisfied, should not have\n   proceeded to assess the rationality of the state's various education policies. There is no rationality test above and beyond the\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   standards. Rather, the rationality test is part and parcel of Campaign I\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   What the majority fails to recognize, however, is that the trial court improperly stripped out this rationality review from its\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   analysis and thus fundamentally\n   misapplied that test. As I set forth in greater detail in part III of this opinion, it is clear that the trial court ultimately concluded that schools in many of our state's less affluent cities and towns are \"utterly failing ....\" The court found that underprivileged students attend schools staffed by inexperienced and unqualified teachers. It determined that some cities and towns routinely ignore or under identify students with learning disabilities, and that guidance, counseling, and early intervention resources are woefully inadequate. It observed how the elimination of school bus services in Bridgeport requires some high school students to switch multiple transit buses just to make it to school in the morning. It concluded that many impoverished students, and many racial minorities, reach adulthood without having achieved even basic literacy and numeracy skills, and suggested that dedicating additional resources to programs such as high quality preschool could improve high school success rates. Many of these findings would, presumably, be highly relevant to the question of whether the state is affording minimally adequate educational opportunities to all of its students.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   And yet there is no indication that the court considered any of these findings in parts 3 and 4 of its decision before it concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate that the state does not provide minimally adequate facilities, instrumentalities, curricula, and personnel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the court made a few references to \"anecdotal evidence\" of physical deficiencies in some schools and of teachers having to purchase their own supplies, it appears to have proceeded on the assumption that the\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   test is concerned largely, if not exclusively, with financial matters-whether the state is spending large sums on education, in the aggregate, and is helping cities and towns to build new schools and to pay for support services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, the court appears to have believed that it was not free to consider most of the potentially relevant evidence before it when it was conducting its constitutional analysis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   I fail to understand\n   how that could not constitute reversible error. See part III of this opinion.\n   A second problem with the trial court's\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   analysis is that the court appears to have been operating under the mistaken belief that the four\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   factors are to be assessed solely at the statewide level, rather than with regard to specific districts and schools. In the course of its analysis, the court made numerous statements suggesting that it felt constrained to evaluate the state's educational spending, and compliance with the\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   requirements more generally, solely in the aggregate. The court began by noting, in the context of discussing its standard of review, that \"the judiciary is constitutionally unfit to set the\n   <em>\n    total amount\n   </em>\n   of money the state has to spend on schools.\" (Emphasis added.) \"Thus, if the court weren't limited by the minimal elements listed in [\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   ], it would still reject an expansive view of its power to set\n   <em>\n    overall\n   </em>\n   state educational spending levels.\" (Emphasis added.) Turning to the first\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   factor, namely, facilities, the court began and more or less ended its analysis with the observation that the state spends $1 billion per year on school buildings. The court proceeded to emphasize that the state has committed $378 million for new projects in Bridgeport alone and briefly alluded to \"anecdotal evidence of physical deficiencies in some schools ....\" Nonetheless, it dismissed such concerns not by concluding that each such deficiency failed to reach the level of a constitutional violation but, instead, by explaining that the record contained\n   \"nothing to suggest a\n   <em>\n    statewide\n   </em>\n   failure to provide adequate facilities ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   The court's analysis of the other\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   factors likewise suggests that the court was concerned only with whether the plaintiffs could establish systemic, statewide failures to provide minimally adequate educational opportunities. With regard to instrumentalities, the court reasoned: \"[T]here is no proof of a\n   <em>\n    statewide\n   </em>\n   problem caused by the state sending school districts too little money.... There are certainly some hardships with computers and significant disparities in computer access, but against a minimal standard the plaintiffs have not proved ... that there is a\n   <em>\n    systemic\n   </em>\n   problem that should spark a constitutional crisis and an order to spend more on school supplies.\" (Emphasis added.) The court's analysis of the state's educational personnel was in the same vein: \"No one suggests that teaching in Connecticut is\n   <em>\n    broadly incompetent.\n   </em>\n   The claim is that opportunities for good teaching are not being rationally marshaled in favor of needy kids. Judged against a low minimum\n   <em>\n    and judged as a system\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs have plainly not met their burden ....\" (Emphasis added.) True, the court proceeded to consider whether the state dedicates enough resources to \"needy schools,\" concluding that it does. Even\n   there, however, the court considered such spending only in the aggregate. The theory seemed to be that, if the state budget contains a sizable line item for needy school support, then the constitutional requirement is necessarily satisfied. No consideration was given to whether there are\n   <em>\n    particular\n   </em>\n   schools in which spending on\n   <em>\n    particular\n   </em>\n   academic programs or needs is insufficient to\n   provide the students who attend those schools with minimally adequate educational opportunities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   The trial court made other, different missteps in the second half of its decision. In that section of the analysis, the court properly considered the specific quality of education afforded to students in individual school districts such as Bridgeport, specifically, whether schools receive adequate financial support to hire and retain essential support staff, whether students are provided with adequate transportation, whether they are able to master basic literacy skills, and how they perform on standardized assessment tests and based on other measures of high school achievement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   But, here, the court applied a standard of review-requiring that the state's educational policies and priorities be reasonably, substantially, and verifiably related to teaching-that finds no support in\n   <em>\n    Rell\n   </em>\n   and that had the practical effect of shifting to the state the burden of proving that every aspect of its educational system complies with article eighth, \u00a7 1, by requiring that all of the state's \"efforts\" be \"verifiable enough to be measured ....\" Having adopted this novel standard of review, the trial court proceeded to identify various, purported irrationalities in the system that required the court to choose sides on philosophical questions that are hotly contested by educators and academics, some\n   of which the plaintiffs had not even challenged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   All of this ran afoul of my warning in\n   <em>\n    Rell\n   </em>\n   that \"[t]he very complexity of the problems of financing and managing a statewide public school system suggests that there will be more than one constitutionally permissible method of solving them, and that, within the limits of rationality, the legislature's efforts to tackle the problems should be entitled to respect.... In such circumstances, the judiciary is well advised to refrain from imposing on the [state] inflexible constitutional restraints ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rell\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4303959\" index=\"346\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/295/240/#p342\">\n    295 Conn. at 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"347\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=990%20A.2d%20206\">\n    990 A.2d 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Palmer, J.\n   </em>\n   , concurring in the\n   judgment); see also\n   <extracted-citation index=\"348\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=990%20A.2d%20206\">\n    id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 344 n.18,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"349\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=990%20A.2d%20206\">\n    990 A.2d 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Palmer, J.\n   </em>\n   , concurring in the judgment) (\"[I]t is one thing for a court to determine whether the legislature has acted rationally in fulfilling its obligation under article eighth, \u00a7 1, and something entirely different for a court to decide which of two positions concerning the specific parameters of a minimally adequate education in practice ... is the better position....

It should have performed a single legal analysis, applying the\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   test, as articulated in my concurrence in\n   <em>\n    Rell\n   </em>\n   , to the specific educational failings that the plaintiffs allege exist in specific schools and school districts.

And it should have made these determinations in light of the \"special needs of ... particular local school system[s],\" as defined in Justice Borden's dissent in\n   <em>\n    Sheff\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    O'Neill\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1197803\" index=\"350\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/238/1/#p143\">\n    238 Conn. at 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"351\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=678%20A.2d%201267\">\n    678 A.2d 1267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   My disagreement with the majority over the controlling legal standard compels me to part ways with respect to the appropriate resolution of this appeal. The majority concludes that the trial court (1) applied the correct legal standard in parts 3 and 4 of its decision, and (2) properly determined that the plaintiffs had failed to establish that Connecticut's schools have delivered less than a minimally adequate education. For this reason, the majority would simply reverse the judgment of the trial court-because it exceeded its mandate in parts 5 through 8 of its decision-with direction to render judgment for the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   The plaintiffs argue that they are entitled to an opportunity to prevail at a new trial under the\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   standard, as properly applied. They emphasize, and the majority acknowledges, that the trial court found, among other things, that (1) the Bridgeport public schools have been forced to cut key support personnel and even school bus service at the same time as some wealthier districts have received an influx of new state funds; see footnote 1 of the majority opinion; (2) other high needs schools have inadequate classroom facilities and shortages of experienced teachers, specialists, interventionists, and counselors, (3) large numbers of high needs students are not even approaching appropriate\n   educational outcomes, (4) preschool opportunities are unavailable for large numbers of low income students, despite their proven link to improved educational outcomes, and (5) the state has provided inadequate socioemotional and related support services for high needs students. Indeed, the majority readily acknowledges that \"the plaintiffs have convincingly demonstrated that in this state there is a gap in educational achievement between the poorest and neediest students and their more fortunate peers ....\" Nevertheless, it is the view of the majority that such findings are simply irrelevant under the \"narrow\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   criteria.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Text accompanying\n   footnote 41 of the majority opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   I disagree. As I explained in part II B of this opinion, I believe that the trial court misapplied\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   in several respects. \"We have often stated that a party is generally entitled to a new trial when, on appeal, a different legal standard is determined to be required, unless we conclude that, based on the evidence, a new trial would be pointless.\"\n   <em>\n    McDermott\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"352\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=316%20Conn.%20601\">\n    316 Conn. 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 611,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"353\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=113%20A.3d%20419\">\n    113 A.3d 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) ; see, e.g., id., at 12,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"354\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=113%20A.3d%20419\">\n    113 A.3d 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that Appellate Court, having concluded that trial court applied wrong legal standard, should have remanded case for new trial rather than directing judgment); see also\n   <em>\n    In re Joseph W.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"355\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=305%20Conn.%20633\">\n    305 Conn. 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 648,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"356\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20A.3d%2059\">\n    46 A.3d 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) (citing cases). Having reviewed the trial record in the present case, I cannot conclude that a new trial under the correct legal standard would be pointless. Rather, the trial court's factual findings indicate that\n   some of our state's most disadvantaged students may not be receiving a minimally adequate education, which is their constitutional right. The evidence that, according to the plaintiffs, warrants a new trial falls into three broad categories: (1) academic outcomes; (2) educational inputs; and (3) educational policies. I briefly consider each in turn.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   I agree with the majority that the trial court's\n   <em>\n    primary\n   </em>\n   focus in evaluating whether the state has complied with its constitutional obligations should be on the adequacy of educational inputs, rather than on students' level of academic achievement. As I explained in\n   <em>\n    Rell\n   </em>\n   , \"student achievement may be affected by [too] many factors outside the state's control\" for the state to be able to guarantee academic outcomes.\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rell\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4303959\" index=\"357\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/295/240/#p342\">\n    295 Conn. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   345 n.19,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"358\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=990%20A.2d%20206\">\n    990 A.2d 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Palmer, J.\n   </em>\n   , concurring in the judgment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   I have never suggested, however, that educational outcomes are uninformative or irrelevant to the constitutional analysis. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"359\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=990%20A.2d%20206\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"I do not suggest that educational 'outputs' are never relevant to the determination of whether the state has complied with the requirements of article eighth, \u00a7 1\"). I agree with the majority, for example, that the fact that high needs students in one school or district have experienced some measure of academic success while students with a similar demographic profile in another school or district have failed, in the aggregate, to demonstrate even minimal progress may indicate that the latter have not been afforded\n   minimally adequate educational opportunities. See footnote 32 of the majority opinion. At the very least, it suggests that closer scrutiny is warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   More fundamentally, evaluation of educational outputs will, in many instances, be a fundamental and necessary starting point in evaluating claims brought under article eighth, \u00a7 1. This is because outcomes provide the clearest evidence of\n   whether Connecticut's students are in fact receiving a minimally adequate education. Although one can imagine extreme cases in which the failure to achieve educational objectives may be presumed,\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   challenges such as those brought by the plaintiffs in the present case are most reasonably resolved by first determining whether students have in fact been unable to obtain a minimally adequate education, as defined by the state. If the plaintiffs can establish such a deficiency, then the trial court must determine whether \"the failure of students to achieve the goals of a constitutionally mandated education [are] the result of specific deficient educational inputs, or [have been] caused by factors not attributable to, or capable of remediation by, state action or omission ....\"\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rell\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4303959\" index=\"360\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/295/240/#p342\">\n    295 Conn. at 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"361\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=990%20A.2d%20206\">\n    990 A.2d 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (plurality opinion).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   In the present case, the trial court found that a number of the state's schools are \"utterly failing\" and that one third of high school students in poorer communities such as Bridgeport, Windham, and New Britain fail to reach even the most basic levels in math and reading. In the trial court's words, \"[n]ot reaching the most basic level means they [do not] have even limited ability to read and respond to grade level material. There can be\n   no serious talk of these children having reached the goals set for them.\" The trial court made numerous specific findings regarding the failure of different underprivileged student populations to achieve minimal academic success according to various objective benchmarks established by the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   With respect to economically disadvantaged students, the court found, among other things, that Connecticut's fourth and eighth grade students who qualify for free and reduced lunch services rank among the lowest in the nation on National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) math assessments. Between 80 and 90 percent of the state's poor students failed to reach the minimum standards for high school reading as assessed by Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (SBAC) tests. More than 70 percent of the impoverished students entering the state's higher education system lack basic literacy and numeracy skills.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   The court also found that success rates for economically disadvantaged students vary dramatically between school districts, which suggests that differing academic outcomes may arise from differing inputs and educational strategies rather than any intractable barriers to learning created by poverty. On the 2015 SBAC mathematics test, for example, only 9.1 percent of Bridgeport students and 11 percent of New Britain students who qualified for free or reduced lunch performed at level 3 or above, whereas over 40 percent of students who qualified for free and reduced lunch reached that level in towns such as Darien, Ridgefield, and Weston. At the other end of the spectrum, approximately two thirds of students eligible for free and reduced lunch in Bridgeport and New Britain performed only at level 1, more than twice the rate as in Darien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   More generally, the trial court's findings highlight the dramatic differences in educational outcomes between\n   the state's more affluent and less affluent communities. The court found that students in\n   struggling elementary schools in poor communities are not acquiring basic reading, writing, and math skills, and that virtually none of the students in many inner-city schools has the skills needed to progress beyond third grade. On the 2013 Connecticut Academic Performance Test (CAPT) mathematics assessment, over 38 percent of students in New Britain, over 41 percent of students in Bridgeport, and nearly one half of all Windham students scored in the \"Below Basic\" range. In more affluent towns such as Westport and Weston, by contrast, the number of students scoring in the \"Below Basic\" range was negligible. Similar disparities were observed on the CAPT reading and science assessments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   With respect to the secondary level, out of 1177 students attending Bridgeport's Bassick High School in 2013, only 6 percent even attempted to take an advanced placement (AP) exam, and, of those who did, only 3 students earned a qualifying score, which indicates an ability to complete college level work. By contrast, approximately one fourth of all students at Darien High School took AP exams and almost all earned qualifying scores. No more than 15 percent of high school graduates in Bridgeport, Hartford, New Haven, and Waterbury were deemed to be college and career ready. As judged by Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test (PSAT) scores, less than 2 percent of students in Bridgeport were on track to be college and career ready.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   The court also made specific findings with respect to the academic success of students who are not native English speakers or are racial minorities. As of 2012-2013, for example, the school districts of Bridgeport, Danbury, East Hartford, Hartford, Meriden, New Britain, New Haven, New London, Norwalk, Norwich, Stamford and Waterbury all had failed to meet Annual Measurable Achievement Objectives (AMAO) performance\n   targets for English as a Second Language students for the previous ten years. This means that English language learning students do not have the language or vocabulary skills needed to pass a language proficiency test. On the 2013 CAPT mathematics assessment, nearly 50 percent of all African-American students scored in the \"Below Proficient\" range versus 10.6 percent of white students.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ultimately, on the basis of such findings, the trial court concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that, \"for thousands of Connecticut students there is no elementary education, and without an elementary education there is no secondary education.\" (Emphasis omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   There is little dispute that educational inputs represent the most important consideration in assessing whether the state has satisfied its constitutional obligation to ensure that Connecticut residents have a reasonable opportunity to obtain a minimally adequate education. If students in each school have access to adequate facilities, equipment, teachers, and curricula, as well as other essentials such as transportation and security, then a presumption arises that they have been afforded this opportunity. By contrast, the failure to provide these basic essentials supports a conclusion that the state has failed to meet its obligations under article eighth, \u00a7 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   In the present case, notwithstanding its conclusion that the four\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   factors have been satisfied and that the state\n   invests heavily in the lowest performing and highest needs schools, the trial court clearly was of the view that academic inputs in our state's most disadvantaged communities are not reasonably calibrated to achieve minimally adequate academic\n   outcomes. With respect to staffing levels, for example, the court emphasized that schools with higher percentages of low income and minority students are forced to hire inexperienced and unqualified teachers and administrators at higher rates, and that more than one half of the professional staff in such schools depart, on average, within five years. Moreover, although wage premiums are often required to attract teachers to high poverty and high minority school districts and thereby improve student achievement, state educational funds have flowed in the opposite direction. Although educator salaries in the state's poorest communities are significantly lower than the state average, wealthy school districts have been allowed \"to raid money desperately needed by poor towns ....\" For instance, the state recently cut educational aid to the poorest school districts by over $5.3 million, forcing districts such as Bridgeport to cut essential staff, including guidance counselors and special education paraprofessionals, while simultaneously increasing aid to many comparatively wealthy towns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Schools in low income, high poverty districts already had significantly fewer counselors and academic support staff per student, despite demonstrably greater needs. Among the court's many specific findings in this regard: Bridgeport's Bassick High School has only 4 full-time guidance counselors for nearly 1200 students and New London has only 3 to serve over 900 students. Windham has only 4 full-time school psychologists serving a population of almost 3200 students; the student to psychologist ratio is far lower in more affluent towns such as Greenwich and Westport, even though those towns have a lower percentage of students with disabilities. Waltersville School in Bridgeport, which has a student population of approximately 600 ranging from prekindergarten to eighth grade, has only one literacy coach, one guidance counselor, and no social workers\n   available to meet the socioemotional needs of students who do not have individual education plans. Roosevelt School and Bryant Elementary School in Bridgeport suffer from similar staffing shortages. Ultimately, the court found that inadequate staffing levels meant that schools in certain less affluent school districts were unable to satisfy their legal requirements to meet the needs of special education students.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   Turning to East Hartford, the trial court found that economically disadvantaged school district has only one translator, who speaks Spanish, even though the district's students collectively speak 50 different languages; has 4 or 5 elementary schools that do not have a social worker; has only 1 social worker for 400 ninth grade students, which is insufficient to meet their varied socioemotional needs; has only 1 high school reading intervention teacher, which leaves many students who are far below grade level unable to access reading support services; and employs only 1 high school psychologist who, despite working 70 to 90 hours per week, is unable to meet the needs of the district's 1700 high school students.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Some of the court's findings in this respect were so dramatic that it is questionable whether the\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   factors are being satisfied even under the narrowest reading of that case. For example, there are no reading teachers or reading interventionists to provide necessary literacy interventions in Bridgeport's comprehensive high schools. During the 2015-2016 school year, New London High School\n   filled a Spanish language instruction position with a substitute teacher who could not even speak or read that language. New Britain has no significant programs for homeless students, despite having approximately 500 homeless students in the district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   The court also found that, while there is widespread agreement that high quality preschool is perhaps the\n   single most effective tool for narrowing achievement gaps and preparing underprivileged students for success at the primary and secondary levels, a great number of children in Connecticut do not participate in preschool programs, and not all children who live in poverty have access to affordable programs. The court also found that insufficient funding was a significant impediment to broader access. Although there is no express constitutional requirement that the state provide free preschool programs, the state is required to take reasonable steps to ensure that students are able to learn, with an eye toward all of the available tools and their proven effectiveness. See part I B 3 of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Finally, with respect to transportation and facilities, the trial court found that Bridgeport no longer provides school bus service to the comprehensive high schools, forcing students to transfer between multiple public transit buses to get to school in the morning. Some Bridgeport schools also have unreliable boilers, and ceilings fell in one building. In light of these findings, the trial court's ultimate conclusion appears to be that our \"constitution's promise of a free elementary school education\" could be realized if additional resources were marshaled in support of \"drastic interventions\" for the most troubled school districts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Finally, the trial court identified various policies and procedures that, in its view, the state could modify in order to improve educational outcomes for underprivileged students. Indeed, the court went so far as to conclude that \"many of our most important [educational] policies are so befuddled or misdirected as to be irrational.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   As I explained in part II B of this opinion, I agree with the majority that the trial court generally overstepped its authority in parts 5 through 8 of its decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   Some of its policy prescriptions and related findings fail to afford sufficient deference to the political branches and to school administrators, taking sides in ongoing debates among educational experts or requiring that the state adopt or reject one among many facially reasonable approaches. In other instances, the court invalidates certain educational policies without making the necessary predicate finding that those policies have resulted in the state's failure to afford minimally adequate educational opportunities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   That is not to say, however, that policy questions fall completely beyond the legitimate ambit of the court's authority to review alleged violations of article eighth, \u00a7 1, or that a violation of that provision might not result from policy choices rather than from inadequate resourcing. This idea is implicit in\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   , which requires that schools adopt modern, age appropriate educational curricula. The majority concedes as much when it recognizes that \"if the plaintiffs had shown that the state was providing elementary school students with books and curricula only intended for advanced college students, a court could conclude that the state was not reasonably meeting the minimal educational needs of these students ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   The majority fails, however, to follow this hypothetical to its logical conclusion. If the constitution is violated when schools do not provide students with\n   learning materials reasonably suited to their level of cognitive development, why is it not also offended if, for example, a school fails to provide instruction or instructional materials that are comprehensible to a substantial subpopulation of students whose primary language is not English? At a minimum, it would seem that public schools must supply adequate professional staff to screen for and identify students who have serious impediments to learning and to refer them for appropriate services. In the present case, the trial court\n   found, among other things, that some poor school districts consistently ignore or under identify students with special educational needs and, therefore, fail to provide them with appropriate support services. In the face of such findings, I am unable to conclude that, if the plaintiffs were afforded the opportunity to prove their allegations under the correct legal standard, it is impossible that they could demonstrate that their right to a minimally adequate education has been violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   The state's duty to act rationally in developing and implementing a system for affording all students the opportunity to receive a minimally adequate education is not a duty disconnected from reality but a duty that must be exercised with a clear-eyed view of its essential purpose and a commitment to dealing with those circumstances of modern life that tend to frustrate that purpose. It is not enough to seek success in some places, for some children. Our schools must carry on in the faith that all students can learn, and our state must aspire to no less. Although the ultimate measure of an adequate educational opportunity for purposes of article eighth, \u00a7 1, cannot be educational outputs, the educational system must be reasonably designed to achieve results in every district and neighborhood. Our state constitution simply will not allow us to leave our neediest children behind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   Because the plaintiffs were not afforded the opportunity to prove their case according to the correct legal standard, and because there is reason to believe that the trial court may have found one or more violations of\n   <em>\n    Campaign I\n   </em>\n   if that test had been applied properly, I dissent from that portion of the majority opinion that directs judgment for the defendants. Instead, I would remand the case for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-191\">\n    For example, the trial court found that, in Bridgeport, school \"[a]dministrators, clerks, guidance counselors and technicians are being shed. Kindergarten and special education paraprofessionals are being let go. Some schools have no extras like music and athletics left to cut. The school year is to be shortened. Class sizes are increasing in many places to twenty-nine children per room-rooms where teachers might have a class with one third requiring special education, many of them speaking limited English, and almost all of them working considerably below grade level. Many of these children get their only meals at school. They don't have two parents at home. Sometimes, they have no homes at all. They bounce from place to place and from school to school as the system struggles to find some way to teach them.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-192\">\n    \"For almost all students, there will be no high school buses in Bridgeport.

As we have also explained, Justice Palmer expressly rejected this portion of the plurality's constitutional standard; see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"471\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=990%20A.2d%20206\">\n     id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n    at 345 n.19,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"472\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=990%20A.2d%20206\">\n     990 A.2d 206\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\n    <em>\n     Palmer J.\n    </em>\n    , concurring in the judgment); in favor of a standard that focused on educational\n    <em>\n     inputs\n    </em>\n    , specifically, the\n    <em>\n     Campaign I\n    </em>\n    criteria.

We conclude, therefore, that the fact that the state is not providing funds to schools with large numbers of poor and needy students in an amount that would allow those students to achieve the same educational level as other students does not constitute prima facie evidence of unconstitutional disparities in funding.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"47\">\n   <p id=\"p-243\">\n    We note, for example, that the evidence shows that, in 2013, the town that was ranked last out of 169 towns in per student expenditures, namely, Ellington, was ranked 114th in wealth as measured by \"equalized net grand list per capita.\" Similarly, a number of towns that ranked very low in wealth ranked relatively high in student expenditures. For example, Hartford, Bridgeport, and New Haven, which ranked, respectively, 165th, 164th and 163rd out of 169 towns in wealth, ranked 19th, 114th and 31st, respectively, in per student spending. Although we draw no definitive conclusions from this evidence, it certainly does not seem to\n    <em>\n     support\n    </em>\n    the inference that per student expenditures are directly correlated to the number of poor and needy students in a town.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"48\">\n   <p id=\"p-244\">\n    The defendants' expert witness, Michael Wolkoff, explained in his expert report that he limited his analysis to school districts with enrollments greater than 1000 because \"[s]maller school districts have the potential to influence the results as they are most likely to have their per pupil expenditure totals elevated due to diseconomies of scale.\" He also indicated, however, that his \"analyses for districts with enrollments greater than 1000 are very similar to those that [he] found using all districts ....\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"49\">\n   <p id=\"p-245\">\n    Other evidence shows a similar discrepancy between per pupil spending in the neediest and the least needy decile of school districts as measured by the number of students receiving a free lunch.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"50\">\n   <p id=\"p-246\">\n    Other evidence shows a similar discrepancy in the aid provided to the school districts with the largest percentage of needy students and school districts with the smallest percentage of such students, as measured by the percentage of students receiving a free lunch.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-247\">\n    The trial court noted that in 2016, in the face of \"a bone crushing fiscal crisis,\" the state cut education funds to fourteen of the neediest school districts by approximately $5.3 million at the same time that it increased funds to twenty-two comparatively wealthy school districts by approximately $5.2 million. Such anecdotal evidence, however, does not compel the conclusion that, contrary to the trial court's finding, there are systematic and ongoing disparities in the education funds that the state provides to needy districts as compared to wealthier districts, especially in light of the trial court's finding that, since 2012, the state had funneled \"over $400 million in new money\" into the state's thirty lowest performing schools. Indeed, we take judicial notice that, in 2017, the legislature adopted a budget that cut primary state grants to public schools by $30 million overall, but shielded the thirty Alliance Districts from any cuts.

It was charged with divining a governing legal standard from the area of overlap between two less than crystal clear opinions in\n    <em>\n     Rell\n    </em>\n    and then applying that standard, with virtually no guiding precedent, to an enormous and complex factual record covering a field-education-that accounts for a significant share of all public expenditures.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-256\">\n    There also is no indication that the trial court even considered whether school security, transportation, and other essentials are minimally adequate before concluding that the plaintiffs had failed to establish a violation under Campaign I\n    <em>\n     .\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-257\">\n    The trial court appears to have read my concurrence in\n    <em>\n     Rell\n    </em>\n    to mean that\n    <em>\n     Campaign I\n    </em>\n    was concerned principally with questions of financial resources. The court stated, for example, that \"Justice Palmer appeared to view [\n    <em>\n     Campaign I\n    </em>\n    ] as enough to consider\n    <em>\n     about resources\n    </em>\n    ....\" (Emphasis added.) The court also referenced my concurrence in support of its conclusion that, \"[b]eyond a bare minimum, the judiciary is constitutionally unfit to set the total amount of money the state has to spend on schools.\" I do not believe, and I do not understand the majority to believe, that my concurrence in\n    <em>\n     Rell\n    </em>\n    supports such an interpretation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-258\">\n    The majority contends that we must assume that the trial court considered all of its 1060 specific factual findings in conducting the\n    <em>\n     Campaign I\n    </em>\n    analysis in parts 3 and 4 of its decision, and that it is implicit in the trial court's factual findings that this reasonableness standard was met. This reading of the trial court's decision, however, is demonstrably wrong. It defies logic to think that the trial court, which waited to expressly evaluate these findings and described the state's educational failings at great length in the second half of its decision, already had considered all of them sub silentio in the context of its\n    <em>\n     Campaign I\n    </em>\n    analysis but concluded that not even one of its hundreds of troubling findings regarding deficiencies in the schools warranted mention or discussion therein. That would be a truly bizarre way to craft a judicial decision, and there is simply no indication that the court did so. Rather, it is readily apparent that the court misread\n    <em>\n     Rell\n    </em>\n    and felt constrained not to consider in the context of\n    <em>\n     Campaign I\n    </em>\n    either its conclusion that many of Connecticut's schools are \"utterly failing\" or the myriad factual findings that supported that conclusion. If there were any doubt as to whether the court factored its findings into its\n    <em>\n     Campaign I\n    </em>\n    analysis, then this court should order an articulation. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-259\">\n    For the same reason, the majority's reliance on the assumption that the court found that \"the state's educational offerings, even in the poorest school districts, are sufficient to enable students who take advantage of them to become functional members of society\" is misplaced. There is no indication whatsoever in the trial court's memorandum of decision that the trial court ever made such a finding, and the majority is unable to point to any language to support its reading of the court's decision.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-260\">\n    The court also noted that facility issues in the town of Windham and the city of New London were \"already on the state's list to be fixed and fixed mostly with state money.\" It is unclear how this observation factored into the court's\n    <em>\n     Campaign I\n    </em>\n    analysis.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-261\">\n    That the court considered educational adequacy only from an aggregate standpoint in the first half of its decision becomes clear in the second half, when the court turns its attention to the problems facing individual school districts, explains the \"flaw of averages,\" and concludes that the state is not allocating sufficient funds to its poorer cities. The court states, for example, that \"[t]he children in most Connecticut towns do well on tests and some do extremely well, pulling up the average to impressive heights. But viewed individually, the state of education in some towns is alarming.\" The court ultimately concluded: \"But if the egregious gaps between rich and poor school districts in this state don't require more overall state spending, they at least cry out for coherently calibrated state spending.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-262\">\n    The court concluded, for example, that a different method of evaluating and compensating teachers would be preferable, social promotion should be curtailed, and fewer resources should be spent educating severely disabled children. These are matters over which administrators reasonably may disagree with teachers, parents with students, and legislators with taxpayers. The irrationality of one position or the other would have to be far more conspicuous for a court to be justified in resolving the debate by judicial fiat.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-263\">\n    The majority relies in this respect on the circular argument that, because the\n    <em>\n     Campaign I\n    </em>\n    test encompasses certain considerations, and because the trial court purported to apply\n    <em>\n     Campaign I\n    </em>\n    , the court must have taken those considerations into account and found them to be satisfied. The obvious flaw in this reasoning is that, if the court misunderstood and misapplied\n    <em>\n     Campaign I\n    </em>\n    , as I have demonstrated in part II B of this opinion, then there is no reason to assume consequences that would flow from the court's proper application of the test.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-264\">\n    What follows should not be taken either as a determination that the plaintiffs have established a constitutional violation or as a comprehensive canvass of the constitutionally relevant evidence that was presented at trial.
