On appeal, the defendant argues that (1) out-of-court statements of a coconspirator that the trial court admitted\n   into evidence constituted inadmissible hearsay and violated the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment to the United States constitution, and (2) that the state's use of cell site location information violated article first, \u00a7 7, of the constitution of Connecticut. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On January 28, 2008, at approximately 9:50 a.m.,\n   the defendant's neighbor called 911 to report a fire at the defendant's residence. The neighbor saw the flames through a window in front of the defendant's home. No one was home at the time the neighbor called 911, and the defendant was the last person to have been in the house before the fire. The fire destroyed the defendant's home. After firefighters extinguished the flames, state and local fire marshals began examining the circumstances of the fire, as well as the defendant's behavior. Lengthy police and insurance company investigations ensued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The police and insurance company investigations revealed the following details of the defendant's personal life and financial situation at the time of the fire. The defendant was unemployed and her husband, Joao Azevedo, owned a small flooring business, which was the family's sole source of income. Azevedo's business was failing, however, due to his opioid addiction. On the day of the fire, the defendant's husband was set to be released from an inpatient treatment program for his opioid addiction. At the time of the fire, the defendant and her husband were making late payments to various creditors and had trouble paying for necessities such as home heating oil, health insurance, and property insurance premiums. Additionally, the defendant and her husband had federal and state tax liens of nearly $145,000 filed against their home as a result of unpaid income taxes. Two weeks prior to the fire, Norwalk police arrested the defendant's husband on a charge of writing a bad check to a supplier for more than $25,000 worth of hardwood flooring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 10, 2008, eighteen days prior to the fire, the defendant called her local insurance agent to inquire about the status and expiration date of her homeowner's insurance policy. Although the defendant's insurance carrier had threatened cancellation due to late payments, the policy was in effect on the date of the\n   fire. Additionally, days prior to the fire, the defendant and coconspirator Diniz Depina removed items from the defendant's home such as furniture, jewelry, and personal documents. After the fire, the defendant filed a claim with her insurance company for payment of $1,235,087.45 in losses caused by the fire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Due to the suspicious circumstances surrounding the fire, the defendant's insurance company hired investigator Robert Corry, who conducted a detailed cause and origin investigation. After completing his investigation, Corry reached the conclusion that the fire at the defendant's home had been intentionally set.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 5, 2015, the state charged the defendant in an amended information with arson in the first degree; conspiracy to commit arson in the first degree; attempt to commit insurance fraud; conspiracy to commit insurance fraud; attempt to commit larceny in the first degree; and conspiracy to commit larceny in the first degree. On March 6, 2015, a jury found the defendant guilty of all charges. On April 24, 2015, the court sentenced the defendant to a total effective sentence of ten years of imprisonment, execution suspended after four years, and three years of probation. This appeal followed. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On appeal, the defendant argues that the admission of certain statements made by Depina constituted inadmissible hearsay and violated the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment to the United States constitution. The statements at issue are Depina's statements to Corry; Depina's deposition testimony, which echoes his statements to Corry; and Depina's statements to Laura Azevedo Rasuk and Johanna Angelo, both of whom are family friends and Bridgeport police officers. The state responds that Depina's statements to Corry\n   and Depina's deposition testimony were admissible as statements of a coconspirator in furtherance of a conspiracy under \u00a7 8-3 (1) (D) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence. The state further argues, with respect to Depina's statements to Rasuk and Angelo, that the defendant waived her right to claim a confrontation clause violation under\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    541 U.S. 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    158 L.Ed.2d 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004), and that the statements were properly admitted as dual inculpatory statements.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant in part to our decision. In the course of his investigation on behalf of the defendant's insurance company, Corry interviewed Depina. Depina also gave a deposition during the course of the civil litigation stemming from the defendant's insurance claim after the fire. Depina told Corry, and testified in his deposition, that the defendant called him at approximately 9 a.m. on the morning of the fire. Depina testified that the defendant then stopped by his house after visiting her husband at Griffin Hospital, which was close to Depina's house. Depina told Corry that the defendant was at his house because he was borrowing money from her. He stated, as well, that the defendant had stopped by to drop off money so he could purchase food for a party the defendant was throwing to welcome her husband home from the hospital. The defendant remained at Depina's residence for approximately fifteen minutes. The next communication between Depina and the defendant occurred when she called him and exclaimed that her house was on fire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Initially, the trial court admitted Depina's statements to Corry for the limited purpose of showing only that the statements were \"in fact, made by Mr. Depina to this witness, Mr. Corry.\" The court gave the jury a limiting instruction to that effect. Later, the court found from the introduction of additional evidence, that the state had established the existence of a conspiracy between Depina and the defendant by a fair preponderance of the evidence. On that basis, the court removed the limiting instruction and admitted Depina's statements to Corry\n   for their substantive use under \u00a7 8-3 (1) (D) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence. The court also admitted Depina's deposition transcript into evidence for its substantive use pursuant to the same section of the code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In assessing the propriety of the court's decision to permit into evidence Depina's statements to Corry and Depina's deposition testimony, we first must determine whether the statements and deposition testimony were testimonial in nature. This is a question of law over which our review is plenary. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3963702\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/289/598/#p618\">\n    289 Conn. at 618-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=960%20A.2d%20993\">\n    960 A.2d 993\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The defendant argues that both the statements to Corry and the deposition testimony are testimonial in nature. The state argues, on the other hand, that the court properly admitted Depina's statements to Corry and deposition testimony as verbal acts in furtherance of a conspiracy and that, because the statements were not admitted for the truth of their contents, they cannot be considered testimonial in nature. We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"In Connecticut, an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the\n   matter asserted is hearsay. ...

The record belies this claim, however. Although the court subsequently admitted Depina's statements to Corry and Depina's deposition testimony for their substantive use, the statements were not admitted to prove their contents. Rather, the state sought to admit these statements as verbal acts. Indeed, the state expressly stated its position that the statements were false, but that they evidenced a false interlocking alibi between the defendant and Depina.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, they were, in short, verbal acts\n   in furtherance of a conspiracy. The matters asserted by the statements at issue here were that the defendant had gone to Depina's house to give him money after visiting her husband in the hospital. The state's position was that these statements were false and were made as part of a continuing conspiracy. Accordingly, because the statements made in furtherance of the conspiracy were not admitted for the truth of the matters asserted therein, the defendant's claim under the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment to the\n   United States constitution must fail with respect to Depina's statements to Corry and his deposition testimony.

Thus, it was not clearly erroneous for the court to conclude that the state had proven the existence of a conspiracy between the defendant and Depina by a fair preponderance of the evidence, so as to then permit the jury to consider Depina's statements to Corry and deposition testimony as evidence of the continuing conspiracy. The extrinsic evidence that the state presented to demonstrate the existence of the conspiracy included a transcript of the defendant's interview with Corry, in which she detailed her activities on the morning of the fire. The state also produced the defendant's cell phone\n   records, which contradicted the timing and locations that the defendant described in her interview with Corry. In addition, the state produced Depina's cell phone records, which contradicted the timing he described in his interview with Corry and in his deposition regarding his communications with the defendant on the morning of the fire.

This standard is substantially lower than the \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" standard required to convict a criminal defendant. On the basis of the evidence that the state presented, it was not clearly erroneous for the court to find the existence of a conspiracy by a fair preponderance of the evidence. Accordingly, the trial court properly interpreted Depina's statements to Corry and Depina's deposition testimony as statements of a coconspirator in furtherance of a conspiracy under \u00a7 8-3 (1) (D) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence, and admitted them as further evidence of the conspiracy between Depina and the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Depina's Statements to Rasuk and Angelo\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Turning next to Depina's statements to Rasuk and Angelo, the defendant relies on\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    541 U.S. at 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , to support her argument that admission of these statements violated her right to confrontation under the sixth amendment to the United States constitution. The defendant also claims that the\n   court abused its discretion by admitting the statements as dual inculpatory statements. The state's response is threefold: that the defendant waived any\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   claim at trial; that, even if\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   was not waived, the statements were not testimonial and, thus, their admission into evidence was not proscribed by\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   ; and, finally, even if the court incorrectly admitted Depina's statements to Rasuk and Angelo, the court's error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in light of the strength of\n   the properly admitted evidence of the conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to this portion of our opinion. The state called Angelo to testify about statements that Depina made to her and Rasuk. At the time of her testimony, Angelo had been a Bridgeport police officer for thirteen years. On December 19, 2010, Angelo was at the home of Rasuk, a friend and fellow Bridgeport police officer. Rasuk is also the defendant's sister-in-law. Rasuk was hosting a reception at her home following a memorial service for the defendant's husband, who had died a couple of days prior. Depina was present at the memorial reception, and at one point during the evening asked to speak to Rasuk in private. Angelo was present during the conversation, along with Depina's girlfriend, Carla Silva. Depina stated that he wanted to speak to the group \"with regards to the Monroe residence being set on fire by [the defendant].\" He told the group that the defendant was responsible for setting the house on fire, and made statements regarding his communications with the defendant before and after the morning of the fire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Depina explained that several days prior to the fire, numerous items were removed from the defendant's home. These items included jewelry, furniture, family pictures, and other personal items. Depina stated that he was present while the items were being removed\n   and videotaped the items being removed. Additionally, he stated that prior to the fire, he warned the defendant against setting the fire. He also told the group that on the morning of the fire, the defendant called him and stated that \"it was done,\" meaning that the fire had been set. Depina detailed that the defendant had \"lit a match in the stove and also she had lit a sheet in the chimney.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   While speaking to the group, Depina stated that he wanted to see the defendant's husband get the insurance money from the fire. He also explained \"that if he had to, he would go to the police. And that if he had to go to jail, he would go to jail ....\" Finally, Depina stated \"just to leave his girlfriend [Silva] out of everything.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Prior to Angelo's testimony in front of the jury, the court heard arguments on the admissibility of Depina's statements to Rasuk and Angelo. The state argued that Depina's statements should be admitted as dual inculpatory statements under \u00a7 8-6 (4) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence. Defense counsel responded that Depina's statements were not admissible as dual inculpatory statements because they were not against Depina's penal interest and did not meet the second prong of\n   <em>\n    Ohio\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1787607\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/448/56/\">\n    448 U.S. 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1787607\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/448/56/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 2531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1787607\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/448/56/\">\n    65 L.Ed.2d 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980), overruled in part on other grounds by\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    541 U.S. 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 68,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    158 L.Ed.2d 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, defense counsel stated that \"[t]his is not a\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   issue.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court\n   determined that Depina's\n   statements to Rasuk and Angelo were admissible as dual inculpatory statements, and that admission of the statements satisfied the second prong of\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Before discussing the state's claim that the defendant waived reliance on\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    541 U.S. at 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we turn to the question of whether Depina's statements to Rasuk and Angelo reasonably can be characterized as inculpating both himself and the defendant pursuant to \u00a7 8-6 (4) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence. \"To the extent a trial court's admission of evidence is based on an interpretation of the [Connecticut] Code of Evidence, our standard of review is plenary.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4185572\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/121/775/#p780\">\n    121 Conn.

Depina asked Rasuk if he could speak to her in private, away from the other guests who were attending the memorial reception for the defendant's husband. Rasuk, Angelo, Silva, and Depina then gathered in the\n   hallway of Rasuk's home, away from the other guests. Depina stated that the defendant was responsible for setting her house on fire and detailed how the defendant set the fire that destroyed her home. Depina explained that he knew this information because he was in contact with the defendant on the day of, as well as the days prior to, the fire. He also explained that he was present while items were being removed from the defendant's home prior to the fire and that there was a video of the items being removed. Regarding the consequence of his admissions, Depina stated \"that he knew that what he was telling [the group] would possibly have him arrested, and that he ... doesn't care, he would go to the police [and] if he had to be arrested, he would be arrested.\" Depina also stated that \"if he had to go to jail, he would go to jail,\" and \"to keep his girlfriend out of this, and that if he had to go to the police, he would go to the police.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The foregoing demonstrate that Depina \"reasonably understood that his statements\" to Rasuk and Angelo \"were against his penal interest.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Camacho\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3951866\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/282/328/#p347\">\n    282 Conn. at 361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=924%20A.2d%2099\">\n    924 A.2d 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Depina similarly understood the legal implications of his statements, as he indicated that he knew his statements could result in his being arrested, and that, if necessary, he would go to the police and go to jail. Like Henry's statements in\n   <em>\n    Camacho\n   </em>\n   , Depina's statements here were not blame-shifting, as the statements exposed him to liability for the same crimes for which the defendant\n   was charged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   See id., at 360-61,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=924%20A.2d%2099\">\n    924 A.2d 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   It is undisputed that Depina was unavailable to testify at the defendant's trial, as he would have invoked his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination if\n   called to testify. Additionally, Depina's statements to Rasuk and Angelo present sufficient indicia of reliability. As noted in the preceding paragraphs, Depina asked to speak to Rasuk and Angelo in private. Depina made this request during a memorial reception that Rasuk was hosting following the death of the defendant's husband. The statements were against Depina's penal interest as they implicated Depina in the conspiracy to commit insurance fraud. Although the statements were made three years after the fire, taking all the relevant factors into consideration, we conclude that the court properly characterized Depina's statements to Rasuk and Angelo as dual inculpatory statements under \u00a7 8-6 (4) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3963702\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/289/598/#p618\">\n    289 Conn. at 631-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=960%20A.2d%20993\">\n    960 A.2d 993\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   We acknowledge that whether counsel's statement that \"[t]his is not a\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   issue\" waived the defendant's claim under\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   presents a close question. If counsel's statement did not waive the\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   claim, whether Depina's statements to Rasuk and Angelo were testimonial for\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   purposes presents another close question of law. As to waiver, it is apparent that the court was mindful, before trial, of the potential\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   implications surrounding Depina's statements to Rasuk and Angelo; see footnote 3 of this opinion; but at trial, counsel expressly disclaimed\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   on this issue. We are also mindful, too, that decisional law regarding the contours of waiver is evolving.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Regarding whether Depina's statements were testimonial, it is apparent from the record that Depina perceived that his statements to the police officers could subsequently be used against him. Reciprocally, it is evident that the officers did not interrogate Depina or otherwise question him in any way, behavior that\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   expressly found rendered a person's statements testimonial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   From the record, however, it is abundantly clear that whether or not the court erroneously admitted evidence of this conversation between Depina and the Bridgeport police officers as dual inculpatory statements, there was an abundance of admissible evidence adduced at trial to render this mistake, if any, harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, the jury heard evidence about the defendant's\n   deteriorating financial situation. Specifically, there was evidence that the\n   defendant and her husband were late making payments to creditors, they had state and federal tax liens of nearly $145,000 filed against their home, they could not pay for necessities such as home heating oil, and the defendant's husband's business was failing because of his opioid addiction. This evidence provided a strong motive for the defendant to burn down her house to obtain the insurance proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Moreover, the jury heard that the defendant contacted her insurance carrier days before the fire to inquire about whether her homeowner's insurance policy was still active. Additionally, Corry testified that \"after ruling all of [the] other potential sources of ignition out, that this was an intentionally set fire.\" Corry also testified that the defendant claimed she had valuable jewelry in her bedroom, but that after an extensive search of the bedroom, he never located the valuable jewelry. From this evidence, the jury could infer that the valuable jewelry was removed from the home prior to the fire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The state presented the transcript of the defendant's interview with Corry, as well as a recording of Depina's interview with Corry and Depina's deposition testimony. In these exhibits, the defendant and Depina detailed their activities on the morning of the fire. The state then presented cell site location information evidence, which contradicted the times and locations that the defendant and Depina told Corry and the police. The state used this evidence of a false interlocking alibi to establish the existence of a conspiracy between the defendant and Depina. Taken together, the substantial\n   amount of admissible evidence supporting the defendant's conviction renders any mistake by the trial court, if any, harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

The state maintains that the record is inadequate for review of this claim, and that if reviewed, the defendant has not shown state action to establish a violation under article first, \u00a7 7. We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to the defendant's second claim. On February 4, 2015, the state presented the testimony of Ryan Harger, a representative of Sprint Corporation (Sprint). The defendant and her husband were customers of Sprint. The state, through Harger, introduced the defendant's Sprint phone records (records) from January, 2008. Harger explained that Sprint often receives court orders or subpoenas from law enforcement agencies ordering Sprint to produce phone records. Although Harger stated that Sprint produced the defendant's records pursuant to a subpoena, he did not testify from what agency Sprint received the subpoena.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The state then called Deputy United States Marshal James Masterson. Masterson testified that he had\n   reviewed the records from the morning of the fire and analyzed the defendant's movements on that morning. Masterson explained that, even though the defendant stated that she left her house at approximately 9 a.m. on the morning of the fire, she made a phone call to Depina at 9:36:14 a.m. that began and ended on the same cell towers as the defendant's previous calls from home. Additionally, the defendant received a phone call from her security system with ADT Security Services, Inc., at 9:39:47 a.m., which also began and ended on the same towers as the defendant's previous calls from home. It was not until the defendant received a phone call at approximately 9:50 a.m. that her phone accessed a cell tower other than the ones typically accessed when the defendant made a call from home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Moreover, Masterson opined that, by 9:56 a.m. on the morning of the fire, the defendant's phone had not arrived in Ansonia or connected to any cell tower in Ansonia. He testified that at 10:45 a.m., the defendant received a phone call that connected to a cell tower near Depina's home. Masterson explained that, at 10:52 a.m., the defendant received a phone call that connected to a cell tower near Griffin Hospital. At about 11:22 a.m., the defendant's phone accessed a cell tower typically accessed from the defendant's home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The defendant argues that the court improperly admitted the cell site location information evidence that the state presented because admission of the cell site location information violated her rights under article first, \u00a7 7, of the constitution of Connecticut. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \"[I]f an [evidentiary] impropriety is of constitutional proportions, the state bears the burden of proving that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. ... We recognize, of course, that a violation of constitutional magnitude may be established even though\n   there has not been a complete abridgement or deprivation of the right. A constitutional violation may result, therefore, when a constitutional right has been impermissibly burdened or impaired by virtue of state action that unnecessarily chills or penalizes the free exercise of the right.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489371\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/120/#p348\">\n    171 Conn.
