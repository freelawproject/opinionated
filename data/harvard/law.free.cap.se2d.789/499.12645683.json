After careful review, we vacate the order and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Hatcher and Matthews were married in 1998 and divorced in 2009. Following their\n   divorce, the Circuit Court of Fairfax County, Virginia entered an order captioned \"Final Custody Order\" (the \"Virginia Order\") on 10 December 2010 giving Matthews sole legal custody and primary physical custody of their children and specifying regular visitation periods for Hatcher.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The order was registered in North Carolina on 22 July 2011.\n   Upon Matthews' 26 August 2011 motion filed in Guilford County District Court for an emergency\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   custody order, the trial court entered an emergency custody order on 30 August 2011 and then a temporary custody order on 23 November 2011, adjusting Hatcher's visitation pending a new custody hearing. On 20 April 2012, Hatcher filed a motion to modify custody. In his motion, he provided factual allegations in support of his assertion that Matthews had \"done everything in her power to completely alienate any form of a relationship between [him] and the minor children[.]\" He also claimed that because no final custody order had ever been entered in the case he was not required to show a substantial change in circumstances in order to modify custody. However, he contended that even assuming such a finding was, in fact, necessary, Matthews' recent conduct constituted a substantial change in circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After the issuance of two temporary orders by the trial court, a hearing was held beginning 29 January 2015 before the Honorable Michelle Fletcher in Guilford County District Court. At the hearing, the trial court heard testimony from each of the parties and admitted into evidence a child custody evaluation that had been conducted at the court's direction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The trial court issued a new custody order on 27 April 2015, which (1) gave the parties joint legal custody of the children; (2) determined that it was \"in the best interests of the minor children that their primary [physical] custody remain with [Matthews]\"; and (3) adjusted Hatcher's visitation rights with the children. Hatcher filed a timely notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On appeal, Hatcher argues that the trial court erred in awarding primary physical custody to Matthews because (1) its findings of facts did not support its legal conclusion that the best interests of the children would be served by Matthews retaining primary physical custody; and (2) at least one of its findings of fact was not supported by competent evidence in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"When reviewing a trial court's decision to grant or deny a motion for the modification of an existing child custody order, the appellate courts must examine the trial court's findings of fact to determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Shipman v.

Based on the factors set out above, we conclude that the Virginia Order was a permanent custody order as it (1) was not entered into without prejudice to either party; (2) did not state a reconvening time; and (3) determined all of the issues, including legal and physical custody and ongoing visitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Thus, because the Virginia Order was a permanent custody order, the trial court was required to engage in a two-step analysis in addressing Hatcher's motion to modify custody. First, the court had to determine whether a substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the children had occurred. If-and only if-the trial court expressly found such a change in circumstances was it then permitted to determine whether a modification of custody would be in the best interests of the children.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    West v.

As such, \"the trial court commits reversible error by modifying child custody absent any finding of substantial change of circumstances affecting the welfare of the child.\"\n   <em>\n    Cox v.

The court's 27 April 2015 order contains no findings regarding a change in circumstances and instead proceeds straight into a best interests analysis. Moreover, the trial court's order, without explanation, purported to change the children's legal custody-which the Virginia Order had vested solely with Matthews-to joint legal custody between Matthews and Hatcher.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In his brief to this Court, Hatcher acknowledges that the trial court would have been required to find a substantial change in circumstances before modifying custody and that its order did not expressly do so. He argues, however, that\n   <em>\n    Raynor v.
