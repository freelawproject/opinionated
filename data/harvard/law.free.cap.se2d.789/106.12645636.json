The front of his vehicle struck the right side of the victim's vehicle, causing it to \"veer to the left, cross over [a] concrete median[,] and enter [the southbound] lanes.\" The impact occurred at a right angle, with Galdamez traveling west and the victim traveling north. The police report showed that the collision caused an estimated $4,000 in damage to the front of Galdamez's vehicle and $2,000 in damage to the right side of the victim's vehicle. Galdamez did not stop. He returned to the scene of the accident before the police arrived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Galdamez was charged with felony hit and run, a Class 5 felony with a maximum sentence of 10 years' imprisonment, Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-10(e), 46.2-894, and driving while intoxicated (\"DWI\"), Code \u00a7 18.2-266.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Galdamez, a native of El Salvador, told his attorney that his priority was not to lose his immigration status in the United States. Galdamez's attorney negotiated a plea agreement\n   with the prosecutor that involved reducing the felony hit-and-run charge to a misdemeanor hit-and-run charge, a Class 1 misdemeanor with a maximum sentence of 12 months in jail, Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-11(a), 46.2-894. The plea agreement included a stipulated sentence of 180 days of incarceration with 170 days suspended on the hit and run conviction and 90 days, suspended, on the DWI conviction. Galdamez accepted the plea agreement and did not appeal.\n   In December 2013, the United States Department of Homeland Security notified Galdamez that his Temporary Protected Status (\"TPS\") would be revoked as a result of his criminal convictions. Under federal immigration regulations, a noncitizen forfeits his TPS after a conviction of either one or more felonies or two or more misdemeanors. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20244.14\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 244.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), 244.4(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   HABEAS CORPUS PROCEEDING\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Galdamez instituted this proceeding by filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus asking for an evidentiary hearing. He alleged that his prior counsel had given him erroneous advice about the effect of his plea agreement on his immigration status and, had he been given accurate information, he would have rejected the plea agreement and gone to trial on the felony hit and run and DWI charges. In addition, he alleged that he had defenses he had discussed with counsel, such as returning to the scene of the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In his affidavit, Galdamez stated a number of reasons why remaining in this country was his priority, including that he is married and has a young child who is a citizen of the United States and for whom he is the sole financial support, all his extended family lives in the United States and, if deported, he would have no place to stay, no family to assist him, few financial opportunities and be subject to the rampant gang crime existing in El Salvador. Galdamez also stated in his affidavit that he spoke with his trial counsel regarding his defenses to the charges \"including the fact that he never intended not to stop\" and that he was present at the scene of the accident when the police arrived there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Director moved to dismiss the petition, arguing that Galdamez had \"no viable defenses\" to the hit and run charge because he fled from the scene. Therefore, the Director concluded, it would have been irrational for Galdamez to proceed to trial knowing he certainly would face the same immigration consequences and a longer prison term than if he accepted the plea agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The habeas court entered an order granting Galdamez an evidentiary hearing and denying the Director's motion for reconsideration. In its opinion letter granting the evidentiary hearing, the habeas court determined that if Galdamez's allegations regarding his counsel's erroneous advice were true, the performance prong of Strickland would be satisfied. The habeas court also concluded that Galdamez stated a colorable claim of prejudice under Strickland based on his desire to\n   protect his immigration status and, although he \"initially fled the scene of the accident,\" Galdamez alleged \"a viable defense\" to the hit and run charge and \"[i]t is possible that the fact finder, under the totality of the circumstances, would have acquitted Mr. Galdamez of the hit and run charge.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The evidence produced at the evidentiary hearing established that Galdamez had been in this country for 15 years. He had TPS, which allowed him to legally work in this country, enroll in Social Security, and obtain a driver's license and medical insurance. He had maintained a full-time job as a painter for six years and had no other criminal record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Galdamez testified that he did not know he was in an accident until he arrived at his destination, that when he \"got out of the car\" he realized he had hit something, that he \"return[ed] immediately after\" he realized that his car had been damaged, that he was gone from the scene for approximately 12 to 15 minutes and returned to the scene before the police arrived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Galdamez testified that he wanted to protect his immigration status and remain in the United States because his wife and young daughter are here, that he is the sole financial support for his daughter, all his extended family is in the United States, that he would have no financial opportunities in El Salvador\n   and he did not want to return to El Salvador because of the gangs and corruption and he feared for his safety. He also testified, consistent with his allegations, that he told his prior counsel that his \"priority was not to lose his TPS status\" and \"to stay with his daughter and family\" and that his prior counsel had advised him that his immigration status would not be adversely affected should Galdamez accept the plea agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The habeas court found Galdamez to be credible and ruled that his prior attorney had given Galdamez erroneous advice regarding the plea agreement's impact on Galdamez's immigration status and that, had Galdamez been properly advised, he would have rejected the plea agreement and gone to trial. The habeas court also stated that it was \"possible that the fact finder, under the totality of the circumstances, would have acquitted Mr. Galdamez of the hit and run charge.\" The habeas court concluded that if Galdamez had been properly advised, his decision to reject the plea agreement and go to trial would have been a rational decision, thereby satisfying the performance and prejudice prongs of Strickland . The habeas court granted the writ and vacated Galdamez's convictions, and remanded the case for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Director filed this appeal in which he challenges only the habeas court's holding that Galdamez satisfied the prejudice prong of Strickland .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   To satisfy Strickland's prejudice prong in circumstances involving counsel's deficient performance in conjunction with plea agreements, a defendant must show a reasonable probability that but for counsel's erroneous advice, the defendant would have rejected the plea agreement and proceeded to trial and that such a choice would be rational under the circumstances.

In extending the Sixth Amendment protection of effective assistance of counsel to instances in which the plea agreement could impact a noncitizen's immigration status including possible deportation, the United States Supreme Court remarked that maintaining one's right to remain in this country \"may be more important to the client than any potential jail sentence.\" Padilla v.

Thus in such cases, the significance of the immigration consequences of a plea agreement to the defendant is a legitimate part of the circumstances to be considered in the prejudice analysis, particularly whether the decision to reject a proposed plea agreement and proceed to trial is rational.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Director contends that Code \u00a7 46.2-894, the hit and run statute, is violated if the driver involved in an accident resulting in property damage does not \"immediately\" stop at the scene of the accident. Because Galdamez admits he did not \"immediately\" stop at the scene of the accident, \"as a matter of law, [Galdamez] would have been convicted had he gone to trial.\" Therefore, the Director contends a decision to reject the plea agreement could not, under these circumstances, be rational as a matter of law and, therefore, the habeas court erred in finding that Galdamez satisfied the prejudice prong of Strickland . We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The evidence before the habeas court, including the testimony of Galdamez, demonstrates that there were a number of factual issues that could have been contested or tested had the case gone to trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    *\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the Director acknowledges in his brief to this Court, the hit and run\n   statute has four elements, each of which must be established by the Commonwealth beyond a reasonable doubt to secure a conviction. To convict a defendant of a violation of that statute the jury or fact-finder must find: (1) that the defendant was the driver of a vehicle that he knew was involved in an accident; and (2) that the accident caused property damage or bodily injury; and (3) that the defendant knew or should have known that property\n   was damaged by the accident; and (4) that the defendant failed to do any of the following: (a) stop immediately, (b) render reasonably necessary assistance, or (c) report his identification information to law enforcement or the other person involved in the accident.

In that case, the defendant, a bus driver, was convicted of violating the hit and run statute under former Code \u00a7 2154(104) (now Code \u00a7 46.2-894 ). A person lying next to a motorbike with a flat tire with his body extended into the roadway was run over by a bus the defendant was driving. The defendant did not stop, but continued his route, discharged his passengers, returned the bus to the station and went home. An investigation led the police to the bus station where they discovered hair and blood on the bus tire, which led to a warrant for the bus driver's arrest that the police executed at the driver's home several hours after the accident occurred. Herchenbach appealed\n   his conviction and argued to this Court that the Commonwealth failed to prove that he knew his bus had been involved in an accident. This Court held that the conceded facts, that the body was lying in the roadway and testimony of witnesses that the bus drove over the person's head were \"not sufficient to establish one essential element of the offense, to-wit, that the accused knew his bus had struck [the] decedent.\" Id. at 221,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20S.E.2d%20328\">\n    38 S.E.2d at 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Commonwealth , Record No. 0982-99-3, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 317, at *13-14 (May 2, 2000) (unpublished) (same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Galdamez, in his affidavit, his testimony at the evidentiary hearing, and his counsel's argument before this Court, contended that Galdamez did not know that he was in an accident until he arrived at his destination. In his affidavit Galdamez stated he \"never had the intent to fail to stop.\" At trial he testified that when he arrived at his friend's house and \"got out of the car, [he] realized that well, I [had] to [have] hit something. It had [to have] been something more serious than I thought and I returned immediately to the scene\" and that he returned \"immediately after [he] realized that [his] car had been damaged.\" The schematic of the incident as reflected on the police report in the record shows that Galdamez proceeded with a left turn and the other vehicle proceeded in the opposite direction, which could have made it possible that Galdamez did not see the path of the other car. There is evidence to support the conclusion that whether Galdamez \"knew or should have known\" that he was involved in an accident was an issue of fact to be resolved by the fact-finder at trial-an opportunity Galdamez was denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Similarly, the dollar amount of damage to the vehicles was the estimate of the police officer. There were no photographs of the vehicles and no opportunity to test the actual extent and cost of the damage inflicted. The estimates of damage, although in the thousands of dollars, are not conclusive regarding the damage that resulted. It is possible, given the expense of car repairs generally, that the damage was not particularly extensive, despite the estimated costs of car repairs. The police officer's estimated damage amount is insufficient in this context to decide, as a matter of law, that the damage was significant enough to demonstrate that Galdamez's testimony that he was not aware of the\n   incident until he exited the car was inherently\n   incredible. At trial, that would be a fact issue for the fact-finder to determine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We do not dispute that the hit and run statute requires a defendant to stop \"immediately.\" However, that requirement is predicated on the defendant knowing he was involved in an accident that he knew or should have known involved personal injury or property damage. Galdamez's concession that he did not stop \"immediately\" at the scene of the accident but proceeded to a friend's house before he returned to the scene, is not a concession that he knew he was in an accident causing personal injury or property damage. The Director's contention that Galdamez had no legally viable defense to the hit and run charge because he did not stop \"immediately\" at the scene is based on a limited slice of evidence and ignores the elements of proof that the Commonwealth would have to prove at trial under the statute as well as Herchenbach and its progeny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Where, as here, there has been an evidentiary hearing in a habeas corpus case, the habeas court's factual findings are entitled to deference and are binding on this Court unless those findings are plainly wrong or without evidence to support them.

Our review of the record demonstrates that it supports those findings: Galdamez demonstrated that he had a strong desire to and a basis for wishing to maintain his immigration status and remain in this country, a position he conveyed to his prior attorney prior to accepting the plea agreement. His evidence supported a finding that, if properly advised, Galdamez would have\n   rejected the plea agreement and proceeded to trial. The evidence further supported a finding that a fact-finder could have found him not guilty of the hit and run offense. The record therefore supports the judgment of the trial court that a decision by Galdamez to reject the plea agreement and proceed to trial would have been a rational decision. The judgment of the habeas court is not plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Accordingly, the judgment of the habeas court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Affirmed .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   JUSTICE KELSEY, with whom CHIEF JUSTICE LEMONS and JUSTICE McCLANAHAN join, dissenting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Daniel Galdamez, a drunk driver, T-boned the victim's vehicle and caused it to veer to the left, cross over a concrete median, and enter lanes of oncoming traffic. The wreck produced an estimated $4,000 in damages to his vehicle and $2,000 in damages to the victim's vehicle. Instead of stopping to see if the victim was injured, Galdamez fled the scene of the accident and drove to a friend's house where, by his own testimony, he consumed alcohol. About fifteen minutes later, his friend drove him back to the accident scene where he was later arrested. The arresting police officer described him as \"obviously drunk.\" J.A. at 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The majority concludes that a reasonable jury \"could have found [Galdamez] not guilty of the hit and run offense.\" Ante at 111. A jury could come to such a conclusion, the majority reasons, by finding that \"Galdamez did not know that he was in an accident\" until after he got to his friend's house. Ante at 110. I respectfully disagree. A rational jury could not come to that conclusion because it simply defies common sense. The only way Galdamez could have been unaware that he had\n   collided with another vehicle would be because he was too drunk to appreciate the obvious-and that supposition, even if true, would not exonerate him as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Unlike the typical civil case, a habeas court may consider any \"recorded matters,\" including records from the prior criminal trial that resulted in the challenged conviction. See Code \u00a7 8.01-654(B)(4).

The plea agreement included a stipulated sentence of ten days of\n   incarceration on the hit-and-run conviction (180 days with 170 suspended) and no active incarceration at all for the DWI conviction (90 days fully suspended). After Galdamez accepted the deal, the general district court approved the plea agreement, convicted Galdamez for the two misdemeanors, and imposed the agreed-upon sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In December 2013, the United States Department of Homeland Security notified Galdamez, a citizen of El Salvador, that his Temporary Protected Status (\"TPS\") would be revoked as a result\n   of his criminal convictions. Under federal immigration regulations, a noncitizen forfeits his TPS after a conviction of either\n   <em>\n    one\n   </em>\n   or more felonies or\n   <em>\n    two\n   </em>\n   or more misdemeanors.

According to Galdamez, counsel had allegedly told him that convictions of two misdemeanors arising out of the same incident would not trigger the forfeiture of his TPS. Had he known this advice was inaccurate, Galdamez claimed, he would have rejected the plea agreement and gone to trial on the felony hit-and-run charge and the misdemeanor DWI charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   It would have made sense for him to go to trial, Galdamez argued, because he believed that he had a viable defense to the DWI charge as his \"post-driving alcohol consumption,\" J.A. at 21, would explain his blood alcohol content upon his arrest. In addition, Galdamez believed that he could assert a viable defense to the felony hit-and-run charge because, after he had hit the victim's vehicle and had fled the accident scene, he returned about fifteen minutes later.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20244.14\">\n    Id. at 129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   At the habeas evidentiary hearing, scheduled by the court to resolve \"the factual dispute about the specific advice [that Galdamez had] received,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20244.14\">\n    id. at 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Galdamez's former counsel testified that he had represented hundreds of noncitizens in the criminal courts and understood his obligation to provide advice on the effect of plea agreements on an accused's immigration status.

Galdamez does not contest that finding on appeal. The habeas court, however, held that under Code \u00a7 46.2-894, Galdamez had \"a very valid defense to the felony hit and run\" because, after fleeing from the scene of the accident, he \"returned\" approximately fifteen minutes later, J.A. at 164-65, in enough time to make his \"presence known\" to the police arriving thereafter on the scene,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653936\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/111/#p122\">\n    id. at 171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On that basis alone, the court concluded that Galdamez had a legally rational reason to reject the guilty plea, assert his \"very valid\" defense at the felony trial, and seek an acquittal that would save him from the threat of deportation.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653936\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/111/#p122\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   My problem with this reasoning is simple: There is no such defense under Virginia law. Code \u00a7 46.2-894 is a hit-and-run statute, not a hit-run-and-never-return statute. It states that a driver of a vehicle \"shall\n   <em>\n    immediately\n   </em>\n   stop as close to the scene of the accident as possible\" if the accident involves any damage, personal injury, or death. Code \u00a7 46.2-894 (emphasis added). There are several purposes for this compulsory duty, not the least of which is to determine whether the other driver or his passengers need immediate medical assistance. If so, the statute requires the driver to \"render reasonable assistance to any person injured in such accident, including taking such injured person to a physician, surgeon, or hospital if it is apparent that medical treatment is necessary or is requested by the injured person.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653936\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/111/#p122\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The statute recognizes that there may be times when the driver, \"because of injuries sustained in the accident,\" is effectively \"prevented\" from immediately stopping at the accident scene and offering assistance.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653936\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/111/#p122\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   In that scenario, the driver must report the accident \"as soon as reasonably possible\" to law enforcement and \"make a reasonable effort to locate\" the persons and vehicles involved in the accident.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653936\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/111/#p122\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Nothing in the statute, however, authorizes the driver to flee the accident scene so that he can talk the matter over at a friend's house-so long as he gets back to the accident scene in enough time to get arrested. By his own admission, this is exactly what Galdamez believed to be his defense to the felony hit-and-run charge. Ironically, he held to this view even while asserting that, at\n   some point after the accident but before being arrested, he engaged in \"post-driving alcohol consumption.\" J.A. at 21 (affidavit), 126 (reaffirming his affidavit). Under his interpretation of Code \u00a7 46.2-894, Galdamez apparently believed that he had a legal right to go to a friend's home for a drink before deciding whether to return to the accident scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   I find Galdamez's proffered defense to be intrinsically flawed. The statutory command to \"immediately stop\" means to stop\n   <em>\n    immediately\n   </em>\n   . Code \u00a7 46.2-894. The only statutory excuse for not stopping immediately is when \"injuries sustained in the accident\" render stopping to be medically ill-advised or physically impossible.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653936\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/111/#p122\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Nothing in Code \u00a7 46.2-894, or in any authoritative judicial\n   interpretation of it, supports the legal viability of this proffered defense. The habeas court, therefore, erred in accepting it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Recognizing the weakness of his view of the hit-and-run statute, Galdamez falls back on the argument that it does not really matter whether his defense was legally viable because the jury might have accepted it anyway. And if the jury did, Galdamez points out, double-jeopardy principles would render the acquittal verdict invulnerable to attack. I do not deny this hypothetical possibility but, nevertheless, cannot endorse it. Jury ification is a reality, but it is not a variable that any court should factor into the prejudice standard for habeas cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The prejudice analysis \"must exclude the possibility of arbitrariness, whimsy, caprice, 'ification,' and the like.\" Strickland ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. at 695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Even if there is a possibility that a jury would have reached a different outcome ..., the prejudice inquiry does not allow the defendant to 'receive a windfall as a result of the application of an incorrect legal principle or a defense strategy outside the law.' \" Ortiz-Graulau ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5899479\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/756/12/#p20\">\n    756 F.3d at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting Lafler , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188541\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/156/#p1387\">\n    132 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1387 ).

The majority finds this thesis persuasive. I do not. Galdamez raised this point for the first time at the habeas evidentiary hearing. Id. at 128. His habeas petition did not assert this theory, nor did his affidavit in support of the petition. See id. at 1-12, 21-23. His counsel conspicuously chose not to mention it during oral argument before the habeas court. See id. at 158-61. Even so, upon this premise, the majority apparently views the assertion that Galdamez fled the scene of the accident to be inconsequential because it was contradicted by the implicit factual findings of the habeas court following the evidentiary hearing. I find this inference doubtful at best.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   As noted earlier, the habeas court granted the evidentiary hearing, as its letter opinion stated, to resolve \"the\n   <em>\n    factual dispute about the specific advice\n   </em>\n   \" that Galdamez alleged he had received from his former counsel. Id. at 68 (emphasis added). The court limited the evidentiary hearing to the ineffective assistance issue because of the court's erroneous view that prejudice would necessarily follow: \"\n   <em>\n    If\n   </em>\n   Mr. Galdamez had been properly advised,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   the court said in its letter opinion, \"his decision to reject the plea agreement and go to trial would have been rational.\" Id. (emphasis added). I thus reject the unstated assumption in the majority opinion that the facts found in habeas court's letter opinion should be disregarded on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The letter opinion stated that the \"record in this case reve[a]ls the following facts.\" Id. at 62.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   One of the facts recited is that \"Galdamez initially\n   <em>\n    fled\n   </em>\n   the scene of the accident.\" Id. at 63 (emphasis added). One does not\n   <em>\n    flee\n   </em>\n   something he is unaware of. No one would say, for example, the mouse fled the cat but was unaware of the cat. The very act of fleeing implies some fearful knowledge of the thing from which Galdamez fled. It would be illogical to assume, therefore, that the habeas court implicitly found Galdamez was unaware of the accident after expressly finding that he \"fled the scene of the accident.\" Id.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   To be sure, the habeas court's reasoning-that Galdamez had a valid defense to the felony hit-and-run charge because he returned to the scene of the accident before the police arrived-necessarily\n   presupposed the court's earlier finding that he initially fled the scene of an accident involving vehicular damage. The entire discussion of any such \"defense\" would be logically and legally irrelevant if Galdamez did not know at the time he struck the other vehicle that damage of some degree had occurred to one of the two vehicles. If he truly had no basis for knowing that fact, he would have had no duty at all to stop at the accident scene, and,\n   <em>\n    a fortiori\n   </em>\n   , he would have had no duty to return to the scene after innocently driving away from it.

The report further estimated that $4,000 in damage occurred to the front of Galdamez's vehicle and $2,000 in damage to the entire right side of the victim's vehicle. Id. at 54, 57. The collision had enough force to cause the victim's vehicle to veer into and over a concrete median, leaving it stranded in a lane facing oncoming traffic. Id. at 57. Galdamez returned to the accident scene not because of any post-accident discovery on his part, but because he was \"persuaded by a friend to return to the scene.\" Id. At no point did the habeas court ever retract these findings, and I find it entirely implausible that the habeas court could have done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Finally, the habeas court quoted the arresting officer's description of Galdamez as \"obviously drunk.\" Id. at 63. Finding this description persuasive, the court specifically held Galdamez had no defense to the DWI charge. See id. at 167. I agree.

In that case, Galdamez contends that we jettisoned the traditional prejudice standard for a far more permissive standard recognizing that the subjective desire to avoid a negative immigration consequence was\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   a sufficiently valid basis upon which to find prejudice even if, objectively speaking, there was no legally viable reason to believe that going to trial might actually avoid that consequence. I disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In Zemene , a defendant was charged with attempting to shoplift $33 worth of beer. Pursuant to a plea agreement, he pleaded guilty to a petit larceny conviction in exchange for a fully suspended twelve-month sentence. The defendant, a lawful noncitizen, learned after his conviction that a theft conviction carrying a sentence of \"at least 1 year\" (even one fully suspended) would subject him to immigration removal proceedings.

He filed a habeas petition claiming his counsel never gave him any advice about the possible immigration consequence of the plea agreement. Id. at 308-09,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=768%20S.E.2d%20684\">\n    768 S.E.2d at 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Had he known a sentence of only\n   <em>\n    one day less\n   </em>\n   than the sentence in his plea agreement would have eliminated\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   risk of removal, the defendant argued that he would have rejected the plea bargain and gone to trial. Id. at 309,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=768%20S.E.2d%20684\">\n    768 S.E.2d at 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The defendant in Zemene did not claim that he had any viable legal defense to the petit larceny. Instead, he argued that he had a factually viable basis to challenge the imposition of the maximum\n   twelve-month sentence-and it was the sentence, not the conviction itself, that mattered for purposes of his immigration status. Id. at 315,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=768%20S.E.2d%20684\">\n    768 S.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   691\n   . We agreed. In this context, it was irrelevant whether the defendant could show a plausible \"likelihood of acquittal at trial.\" Id. at 316,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=768%20S.E.2d%20684\">\n    768 S.E.2d at 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . His adverse immigration consequence could be wholly avoided with far less of a showing. All Zemene needed to show was what he clearly did show: He could have avoided any risk of removal altogether \"if he obtained a sentence of even a single day less than the maximum.\" Id. at 317,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=768%20S.E.2d%20684\">\n    768 S.E.2d at 692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The situation in Zemene is not at all like the one that Galdamez faced. In Zemene , the defendant had a factually viable basis to challenge the imposition of the maximum punishment, and that\n   <em>\n    alone\n   </em>\n   would have eliminated the risk to his immigration status. In Galdamez's case, he had no legally viable defense to an incontestable charge of hit-and-run, and\n   <em>\n    only a complete acquittal\n   </em>\n   -nothing less-would have eliminated the negative consequence for his immigration status. In both cases, Zemene and the present case, the prejudice standard is objectively consistent. Its application differed because the circumstances differed-a factually viable challenge to the imposition of maximum punishment was dispositive in one case, and a legally meritless defense to criminal liability is dispositive in the other. I thus reject Galdamez's argument that our reasoning in any way repudiates Zemene .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   In sum, I agree with the habeas court that the prejudice standard did not require Galdamez to show a likelihood of an acquittal or anything close to that. Even so, at a minimum, Galdamez had to proffer a factually and legally valid basis for believing-from the objective perspective of a reasonable defendant-that his theory of defense could have led to an acquittal. The habeas court held that he did. I disagree. Galdamez's hope of an acquittal on the hit-and-run charge rested entirely on a defense that does not exist under Virginia law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Without that defense, his remaining optimism could only arise from the possibility of jury ification, the idiosyncrasies of a trial judge, or some other similar jurisprudential aberration. Settled principles of habeas law preclude that approach. Accepting an\n   anything-could-happen hypothesis would eliminate-not satisfy-the prejudice requirement. I appreciate that the majority does not adopt this erroneous view of habeas law. The majority's attempt to sideline it on factual grounds, however, is entirely unpersuasive. I thus respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    We review the record in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, Galdamez, according him the benefit of all reasonable inferences deducible therefrom in determining whether the circuit court was wrong as a matter of law in concluding that Galdamez had a valid defense.
