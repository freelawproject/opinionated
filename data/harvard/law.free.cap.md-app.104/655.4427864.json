He was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole on the murder charge and to five years imprisonment, concurrent, on the handgun charge. He presents five questions on appeal, of which we need consider only one:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALft\">Did the circuit court err by refusing to give a requested jury instruction?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-12\">We find that the court erred and shall remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-13\">\n<em>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ANA\">In the early morning hours of March 12,1993, appellant saw Dino J. Fanucci at Killian\u2019s Bar in Rising Sun. He held a gun <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>to Fanucci\u2019s head and said \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have said what you said.\u201d Fanucci responded \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything. Cool it.\u201d Appellant then shot and killed Fanucci. He was arrested later that morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">On September 1, 1998, a plea of not criminally responsible by reason of insanity was entered on appellant\u2019s behalf, following which the court ordered the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to conduct a preliminary examination of appellant. The doctor who examined appellant on an outpatient basis under that order advised the court that appellant \u201cmay meet the legal test for being found not criminally responsible\u201d and recommended that appellant be fully evaluated on an inpatient basis at the Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center (Perkins). Dr. E. Cameron Ritchie, fellow in forensic psychiatry at Perkins, and Dr. Michael G. Sweda, staff psychologist at Perkins, reported to the court on December 23, 1993, that, in their opinion, appellant suffered from delusional disorder, persecutory type, and was not criminally responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The State then moved to have appellant examined by Dr. Michael K. Spodak, a private forensic psychiatrist, as to criminal responsibility. Over objection, the court granted the motion. Dr. Spodak\u2019s opinion was that, while appellant did suffer from delusional (paranoid) disorder, persecutory type, he did not lack substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or conform his conduct to the requirement of law and thus did not meet the legal requirements for being found not criminally responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">In addition to Drs. Ritchie and Sweda,- Dr. Sheri Bellow, a psychologist in private practice and former director of admissions at Perkins, and Dr. Stephen W. Siebert, a psychiatrist in private practice and former Acting Superintendent of Perkins, testified for the defense. All four testified that they had examined appellant and found him not criminally responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">Dr. Spodak testified in rebuttal that he agreed with the other witnesses that appellant suffered from the persecutory type of delusional (paranoid) disorder, that he was delusional at the time of the shooting, and that he was not feigning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>mental illness. He testified further, however, that, in his opinion, appellant was criminally responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">The jury found that appellant was criminally responsible and, as noted above, that he was guilty of murder and of use of a handgun in a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">\n<em>The Requested Jury Instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">At the close of evidence, appellant\u2019s trial counsel, citing <em>Johnson v. State, </em>292 Md. 405, 439 A.2d 542 (1982), asked the court to instruct the jury that \u201c[t]he psychologist and psychiatrist at Clifton T. Perkins are deemed to be impartial experts and not of the defense or state.\u201d The following exchange ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: I am not going to give them that. You [apparently addressing the State\u2019s Attorney] want me to? [STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-9\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: I am offering that. That\u2019s repeated through the Court of Appeals decision. [STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Judge, that\u2019s probably dicta because it\u2019s not material to the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-10\">THE COURT: All right, if you object I won\u2019t do it. What they usually do is say they are deemed independent when somebody else wants a private psychiatrist, is how it usually goes. They are on your side. You are beyond that point. [COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: Perkins on my side? THE COURT: That will hurt you if you say they are independent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-11\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: Perkins is on my side, yes, they certainly are.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-12\">At the conclusion of the instructions, appellant renewed his request, and it was again denied. He argues now that the court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-13\">Md.Rule 4r-325(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>\u201cThe court may, and at the request of any party shall, instruct the jury as to the applicable law and the extent to which the instructions are binding. The court may give its instructions orally or, with the consent of the parties, in writing instead of orally. The court need not grant a requested instruction if the matter is fairly covered by instructions actually given.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">The requirements of the rule are mandatory: \u201ca trial judge must give a requested instruction that correctly states the applicable law and that has not been fairly covered in instructions actually given.\u201d <em>Mack v. State, </em>300 Md. 583, 592, 479 A.2d 1344 (1984). In deciding whether a trial court was required to give a requested instruction, an appellate court \u201cmust determine whether the requested instruction constitutes a correct statement of the law; whether it is applicable under the facts and circumstances of this case; and whether it has been fairly covered in the instructions given.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">The State does not contend that the requested instruction was covered in the instructions actually given. Nor does the State contend that the requested instruction was an incorrect statement of the law. As appellant\u2019s trial counsel indicated, the Court of Appeals held in <em>Johnson v. State, </em>292 Md. 405, 414, 439 A.2d 542 (1982), that psychiatrists on the staff of Perkins Hospital, although paid by the State, are \u201cindependent psychiatric experts,\u201d and not</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6N\">\u201c\u2018partisans of the prosecution, though their fee is paid by the State, any more than is assigned counsel for the defense beholden to the prosecution merely because he is ... compensated by the State. Each is given a purely professional job to do\u2014counsel to represent the defendant to the best of his ability, the designated psychiatrists impartially to examine into and report upon the mental condition of the accused.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-7\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>McGarty v. O\u2019Brien, </em>188 F.2d 151, 155 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>341 U.S. 928, 71 S.Ct. 794, 95 L.Ed. 1359 (1951)). The <em>Johnson </em>Court therefore held that the trial court\u2019s refusal to provide a defendant with a private psychiatric expert of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>own choosing at State expense did not deny him his right to assistance of counsel, due process, or equal protection, when a Perkins psychiatrist had found him competent and responsible. <em>Id. </em>at 412-415, 439 A.2d 542. <em>See also Thomas v. State, </em>301 Md. 294, 324, 483 A.2d 6 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>470 U.S. 1088, 105 S.Ct. 1856, 85 L.Ed.2d 153 (1985) (\u201cPerkins\u2019 psychiatrists are deemed to be wholly impartial experts and not partisans of the prosecution.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">The State\u2019s contention is rather that the <em>Johnson </em>holding was not the \u201capplicable law\u201d under the circumstances of appellant\u2019s case. The State cites <em>Chambers v. State, </em>337 Md. 44, 650 A.2d 727 (1994), in which the Court of Appeals held that a trial court did not err in refusing to instruct a jury that it could return a recommendation of mercy. <em>Id. </em>at 46-47, 650 A.2d 727. The Court reasoned that the provision that a jury may recommend mercy is not \u201cthe applicable law\u201d because \u201c[w]ith the exception of death penalty and insanity cases, the sole function of the jury in a criminal case in Maryland is to pass on whether the defendant is guilty as charged, a decision based on the evidence presented at trial and the law pertaining to the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 48, 650 A.2d 727. Because, with the exception of death penalty cases, \u201cthe mission of the jury is to evaluate guilt, not set punishment, mercy is not an \u2018essential question\u2019 before it,\u201d and the court is, therefore, not required to give an instruction about mercy on request. <em>Id. </em>at 48, 650 A.2d 727 (quoting <em>Sims v. State, </em>319 Md. 540, 550, 573 A2d 1317 (1990)). The State contends that \u201c[w]hat constitutes \u2018applicable law1 is the law pertaining to the crime\u201d and that \u201c[t]he proposed instruction at issue here is in no way related to the elements of the crime or the standard for determining Ellison\u2019s lack of criminal responsibility.\u201d The definition of \u201capplicable law\u201d is not, however, so narrow.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">In <em>Gooch v. State, </em>34 Md.App. 331, 337, 367 A.2d 90 (1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>280 Md. 735 (1977), we held that a trial court had erred by not instructing the jury as requested on \u201cthe effect and weight to be given to character testimony as such.\u201d In <em>Huber v. State, 2 </em>Md.App. 245, 256-58, 234 A.2d 264 (1967), we found that a trial court had erred by refusing a request for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>instruction that the defendant\u2019s prior convictions were to be considered only in \u201cevaluating defendant\u2019s credibility as a witness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 258, 234 A.2d 264. In <em>Christiensen v. State, </em>274 Md. 133, 141, 333 A.2d 45 (1975), the Court of Appeals held that the refusal of the trial court to instruct the jury, as-requested, that no unfavorable inference could be drawn from the defendant\u2019s failure to call an accomplice as a witness was error. In none of those cases did the requested instruction relate to the elements of the crime or to the defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility. All those instructions related to the jury\u2019s consideration of particular evidence (or, in <em>Christiensen, </em>lack of evidence), as did the instruction requested here.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">As the <em>Chambers </em>Court said, \u201cthe mission of the jury is to evaluate guilt.\u201d <em>Chambers, </em>337 Md. at 48, 650 A.2d 727. The Court said further that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-6\">\u201c[t]he main purpose of a jury instruction is to aid the jury in clearly understanding the case, to provide guidance for the jury\u2019s deliberations, and to help the jury arrive at a correct verdict.... \u2018[A] defendant is entitled to an instruction on every essential question or point of law supported by evidence.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-7\"><em>Chambers, </em>337 Md. at 48, 650 A.2d 727 (quoting <em>Sims v. State, </em>319 Md. 540, 550, 573 A.2d 1317 (1990)). \u201cIn a criminal jury trial, it is the jury\u2019s province to assess the credibility of witnesses and to weigh all of the evidence.\u201d <em>Joyner-Pitts v. State, </em>101 Md.App. 429, 445, 647 A.2d 116 (1994). An instruction, such as that requested in <em>Gooch, </em>that correctly states a principle of law that may provide guidance for the jury\u2019s deliberations with regard to weighing the evidence or assessing credibility states \u201capplicable\u201d law and must be given on request.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">In this case, there was a \u201cbattle of experts\u201d as to whether appellant was criminally responsible at the time of the shooting. The relative weight the jury gave to Dr. Spodak\u2019s testimony as against that of the four defense experts and the jury\u2019s assessment of each expert\u2019s credibility were clearly \u201cessential questions\u201d in relation- to their determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>of appellant\u2019s criminal responsibility. The trial court was of the opinion that it would \u201churt\u201d appellant if the jury was instructed that the experts from Perkins were impartial, apparently thinking that otherwise the jury would tend to believe that Perkins staff members would, if anything, favor the State. Appellant\u2019s counsel, however, was apparently of the opinion that the jury would give more weight to the testimony of the two doctors from Perkins, who testified as defense witnesses, if it knew that they were impartial. It was not for the court to weigh what would or would not \u201churt\u201d appellant; once counsel asked for the instruction, the court was bound to give it if it stated the applicable law. It did.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Because the relative weight the jury gave to the opinions of the experts may well have been important to its finding that appellant was criminally responsible, we cannot say that the court\u2019s error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and shall remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">JUDGMENTS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; CECIL COUNTY TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
