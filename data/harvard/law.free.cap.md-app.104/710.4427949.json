Pursuant to an ordinance first enacted in 1947, Baltimore City imposes a tax on the \u201cgross sales price\u201d of \u201csales for consumption\u201d of electricity. In 1991, C <em>&amp; </em>P Telephone, Santoni\u2019s, Inc., Charles Towers Partnership, Baltimore Budget Hotel Partnership, Apartment Services, Inc., and United Holdings Co., Inc. (the taxpayers) filed separate claims with appellant, the City\u2019s Director of Finance (the Director), seeking a refund of taxes paid on certain portions of their monthly electric bills. After those requests were denied, the taxpayers sought relief in the Maryland Tax Court, where some of the cases were consolidated. The Tax Court rendered three separate decisions, each of which was decided on a motion for summary judgment. In each case, the Tax Court concluded that the customer and demand charges at issue were not for \u201csales for consumption\u201d of electricity and thus were not taxable under the ordinance. The cases were consolidated on appeal to the circuit court, and the trial judge affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">Appellant presents three questions for our review, which we restate as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-8\">I. Did the Tax Court err when it concluded, as a matter of law, that the \u201ccustomer charge\u201d and \u201cdemand charge\u201d are not taxable under the Baltimore City ordinance?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-9\">II. Did the Tax Court err by failing to give proper deference to the administrative construction placed on the ordinance by the City\u2019s Director of Finance?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-10\">III. Did the Tax Court err by awarding interest on the amount of the refunds?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">In 1947, the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore first levied a tax on sales of electricity delivered to consumers in Baltimore City.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The ordinance, now codified as art. 28, \u00a7 55 of the Baltimore City Code, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-5\">(a)(1) <em>Artificial or natural gas, electricity, and steam rates. </em>There is hereby levied and imposed on all <em>sales for consumption </em>of artificial or natural gas, electricity and steam delivered in Baltimore City through pipes, wires or conduits within the limits of Baltimore City, hereinafter referred to as \u201cenergy sales,\u201d and billed after the effective date hereof, a tax at the rate of 8% upon the <em>gross sales price thereof;</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0l\">(emphasis added). It is undisputed that the taxpayers purchased electricity \u201cfor consumption\u201d from Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric Company (BG <em>&amp; </em>E). The issue here is whether the tax may be levied against certain portions of their monthly electric bills that do not vary in direct proportion to the actual amount of electricity consumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Before the tax court, the parties stipulated that each monthly electric bill includes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-7\">(a) a \u201ccustomer charge,\u201d billed at a flat monthly rate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-8\">(b) \u201cdemand charges,\u201d based on the maximum monthly demand in kilowatts (KW) during any single half-hour interval;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-9\">(c) \u201cenergy charges,\u201d based on total monthly consumption in kilowatt-hours (Kwh);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>(d) \u201cfuel rate charges,\u201d calculated by multiplying the total Kwh consumed during the month by the dollar amount of the current fuel rate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-4\">(e) a small environmental surcharge, as mandated by Md. Code Ann. Natural Resources \u00a7 3-302; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-5\">(f) the City\u2019s electricity tax, which is levied against items (a) through (d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Those charges were billed pursuant to a rate schedule approved by the Public Service Commission (the PSC). Each of the first four charges is designed to recover some portion of the costs incurred by BG &amp; E in producing and delivering electricity to its customers. For example, the customer charge is intended to recover the costs associated with metering, billing, and other administrative functions. Demand charges, on the other hand, are designed to recover the costs associated with the equipment and facilities needed to produce, transmit, and distribute electricity.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">The applicable rate schedule, designated as Schedule GL, applies to all BG &amp; E customers who establish a monthly demand of sixty kilowatts or more. Consumers who are billed under Schedule GL pay the same customer charge each month, regardless of the amount of electricity they actually purchase and consume. To determine the amount of the demand charge, BG &amp; E monitors a customer\u2019s electricity use each month and identifies the half-hour period in which the customer\u2019s consumption of electricity was greatest. The demand charge is calculated by multiplying the number of kilowatts consumed during that half-hour period by a specified dollar amount. Unlike the energy charges and fuel rate charges, the customer charge and demand charges are not based on the actual amount of electricity consumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">In 1991, the taxpayers each requested a refund of taxes paid on the customer and demand charges during the preceding three years. After those requests were denied, the taxpayers sought relief in the Maryland Tax Court. In deciding the cases at hand, the Tax Court relied upon its decision in the cases consolidated as <em>Blue Circle Atlantic, et al. v. Baltimore </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number><em>County, et al., </em>Misc. Nos. 684-688 (August 15,1990).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, a brief review of the Tax Court\u2019s earlier decision is in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">The <em>Blue Circle </em>case involved a Baltimore County ordinance that levied a tax against \u201csales for consumption of electricity.\u201d The Baltimore County ordinance was modelled after the Baltimore City ordinance at issue here, and the language was virtually identical.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Blue Circle Atlantic, Inc. and four other corporations alleged that the tax was unlawfully levied against the customer and demand charges on their bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Because the case involved construction of a tax statute, the Tax Court noted that any ambiguity in the statutory language \u201cmust be construed strictly against [Baltimore County] and in favor of Petitioners.\u201d The Court then quoted from <em>State v. Fabritz, </em>276 Md. 416, 421-22, 348 A.2d 275 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 942, 96 S.Ct. 1680, 48 L.Ed.2d 185 (1976), wherein Chief Judge Murphy explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-6\">[W]here statutory language is plain and free from ambiguity and expresses a definite and sensible meaning, courts are not at liberty to disregard the natural import of words with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>a view towards making the statute express an intention which is different from its plain meaning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Applying those principles to the issue presented here, the Tax Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-5\">Thus we must determine whether the statutory language is \u201cplain and free from ambiguity.\u201d We conclude that the words \u201csales for consumption of electricity\u201d express a \u201cdefinite and sensible meaning,\u201d namely, sales of electricity actually consumed. We find that customer and demand charges, which are not based on KWH consumed, are not \u201csales for consumption,\u201d and therefore are exempt from the county tax.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">In each of the cases consolidated under the present appeal, the Tax Court granted the taxpayers\u2019 motions for summary judgment. The Tax Court determined that there was no genuine issue of material fact, and concluded as a matter of law that the City ordinance does not authorize the assessment of the electricity tax against the customer and demand charges, \u201cas those charges are not sales of electricity actually consumed.\u201d The Director was instructed to refund the pertinent taxes with interest.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The circuit court affirmed the Tax Court\u2019s rulings, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">LEGAL ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">A final order of the Maryland Tax Court is subject to judicial review as provided for contested cases under the Administrative Procedure Act. <em>See </em>Md.Code Ann., Tax-General (TG) \u00a7 13-532(a) (1988 &amp; Supp.1994). Because the cases before us were decided as a matter of statutory interpretation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>we must determine whether the Tax Court\u2019s decision was \u201cpremised solely upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>Comptroller of Treas. v. Shell Oil Co., </em>65 Md.App. 252, 259, 500 A.2d 315 (1985) (quoting <em>Ramsay, Scarlett &amp; Co. v. Comptroller, </em>302 Md. 825, 834, 490 A.2d 1296 (1985)). The standard of review is expansive, and we may freely substitute our judgment for the Tax Court\u2019s legal conclusions. <em>Ramsay, Scarlett &amp; Co., </em>302 Md. at 834, 490 A.2d 1296; <em>Supervisor of Assessments v. Asbury Methodist Home, Inc., </em>313 Md. 614, 626-27, 547 A.2d 190 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and carry out the actual intent of the legislature. <em>Montgomery County v. Buckman, </em>333 Md. 516, 523, 636 A.2d 448 (1994). As a general rule, statutes involving taxation must be strictly construed. In <em>Fair Lanes, Inc. v. Comptroller, </em>239 Md. 157, 162, 210 A.2d 821 (1965), the Court of Appeals explained that a reviewing court may not extend the reach of a tax statute \u201cbeyond the clear import of the language employed,\u201d and where there is doubt as to such a statute\u2019s scope, it should be construed \u201cmost strongly\u201d in favor of the taxpayer. A strict construction must nonetheless be fair, reasonable, and consistent with the legislative intent. <em>Maryland State Fair v. Supervisor of Assessments, </em>225 Md. 574, 588, 172 A.2d 132 (1961). <em>See also Supervisor of Assessments v. Trustees of Bosley Methodist Church Graveyard, </em>293 Md. 208, 212-13, 443 A.2d 91 (1982); <em>Hearst Corp. v. State Dept. of Assessments and Taxation, </em>269 Md. 625, 643, 308 A.2d 679 (1973). The canon in favor of strict construction \u201cis not an inexorable command to override common sense and evident statutory purpose.\u201d <em>Wynn v. State, </em>313 Md. 533, 540, 546 A.2d 465 (1988) (quoting <em>United States v. Brown, </em>333 U.S. 18, 25-26, 68 S.Ct. 376, 380, 92 L.Ed. 442 (1948)).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">The task of statutory interpretation begins with the ordinary and natural meaning of the words employed. <em>Buckman, </em>333 Md. at 523, 636 A.2d 448; <em>Harford County v. Univ. of Md. Med. System, </em>318 Md. 525, 529, 569 A.2d 649 (1990). Thus, \u201cwhere statutory language is plain and free from ambiguity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>and expresses a definite and sensible meaning,\u201d there is no need to look elsewhere to ascertain the intent of the legislative body. <em>Fabritz, </em>276 Md. at 421-22, 348 A.2d 275. <em>See also In re Criminal Investigation No. 1-162, </em>307 Md. 674, 685, 516 A.2d 976 (1986). The statute must be construed as a whole, so that no word, clause, or phrase is rendered superfluous. <em>Condon v. State, </em>332 Md. 481, 491, 632 A.2d 753 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">We do not agree with the Tax Court\u2019s conclusion that the language of the ordinance is \u201cplain and free from ambiguity.\u201d The tax at issue here is levied against \u201csales for consumption\u201d of electricity, at a rate of eight percent \u201cupon the gross sales price thereof.\u201d Under the Tax Court\u2019s interpretation, the City Council\u2019s use of the phrase \u201csales for consumption\u201d was intended to distinguish charges billed for electricity actually consumed from charges billed for the service of providing electricity. We believe that the Director\u2019s interpretation of the statute is also reasonable. The Director contends that the phrase \u201csales for consumption\u201d means that the tax applies to a purchase for consumption by the ultimate consumer, in contrast to a purchase for the purpose of reselling electricity to other consumers. <em>See </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1315 (6th ed. 1990) (defining \u201cretail\u201d as \u201c[a] sale for final consumption in contrast to a sale for further sale or processing\u201d). In other words, the Director suggests that \u201csales for consumption\u201d of electricity may reasonably be construed to mean \u201cretail sales\u201d of electricity.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Our conclusion that the Director\u2019s interpretation is reasonable finds support in the language of a decision rendered by the United States Supreme Court. <em>See McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Coal Mining Co., </em>309 U.S. 33, 60 S.Ct. 388, 84 L.Ed. 565 (1940). <em>Berwind-White </em>involved a retail sales tax imposed by the City of New York. Writing for the Court, Justice Stone noted that \u201c[t]he question for decision is whether the New York City tax laid upon <em>sales of goods for consumption, </em>as applied to respondent, infringes the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41, 60 S.Ct. at 390 (emphasis added). Justice Stone explained the nature of the tax as follows: \u201cThe ultimate burden of the tax, both in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>form and in substance, is thus laid upon the buyer, <em>for consumption, </em>of tangible personal property, and measured by the sales price.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 43, 60 S.Ct. at 391 (emphasis added). The Court\u2019s opinion makes it clear that the Court regarded the phrase \u201csales of goods for consumption\u201d as being synonymous with \u201csales of goods at retail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">We find further support in <em>Topps Garment Mfg. Corp. v. State, </em>212 Md. 23, 128 A.2d 595 (1957), where the Court of Appeals considered a constitutional challenge to a Maryland statute requiring vendors to collect a tax on tangible personal property sold for \u201cuse, storage, or consumption\u201d within the state. With regard to the <em>Benoind-White </em>case, Judge Hammond noted that \u201cthe Supreme Court equated the New York City tax on <em>sales for consumption </em>in the City with the ordinary use tax ... that the Court had previously sustained as constitutional.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29, 128 A.2d 595 (emphasis added). Because the precise phrase \u201csales for consumption\u201d does not appear in the <em>Benoind-White </em>opinion, we assume that Judge Hammond deliberately selected those words to convey a particular meaning. Thus, Judge Hammond and the other members of the Court plainly understood the phrase \u201csales for consumption\u201d to mean \u201cretail sales.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">The opinions in both <em>Topps </em>and <em>Benoind-White </em>support our conclusion that the ordinance at issue here may reasonably be construed as a tax upon the \u201cgross sales price\u201d for \u201cretail sales\u201d of electricity. The Tax Court and circuit court, however, endorsed a different interpretation. When a statute is plainly susceptible of more than one meaning, \u201ccourts consider not only the literal or usual meaning of the words, but their meaning and effect in light of the setting, the objectives and purpose of the enactment.\u201d <em>Allied Vending v. City of Bowie, </em>332 Md. 279, 306, 631 A.2d 77 (1993) (quoting <em>Kaczorowski v. City of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 513, 525 A.2d 628 (1987)). <em>See also Fabritz, </em>276 Md. at 421-22, 348 A.2d 275. Under those circumstances, a reviewing court may consider the consequences flowing from one meaning rather than another, and should avoid a construction that produces an unreasonable result or is inconsistent with common sense. <em>Kaczorowski, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>309 Md. at 513, 525 A.2d 628; <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 75, 517 A.2d 730 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">The Tax Court concluded that the City\u2019s electricity tax may be levied only against those charges which are directly proportional to the number of kilowatt hours consumed. We think that the Tax Court\u2019s conclusion would lead to. unreasonable, nonsensical results. Among the documents submitted to the Tax Court was an affidavit from D. Douglas DeWitt, Director of Rate Research for BG &amp; E. According to Mr. DeWitt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXq\">All customers pay a demand component as a part of BG &amp; E\u2019s product cost. For residential customers and for nonresidential customers with demands of less than 60 kilowatts, <em>all costs including the demand component are included as part of the kilowatt hour or energy rate.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ApD\">(Emphasis added). In other words, the demand component paid by these customers is billed on a per-kilowatt-hour basis, and would be taxable under the interpretation advanced by the Tax Court. We think it illogical to conclude that the City Council intended to levy a tax against the demand component paid by some customers, but not against the demand component paid by others, when the sole distinction between those customers is the manner in which the charges are calculated and billed.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">An opinion and order rendered by the Public Service Commission provides further support for our conclusion that the Tax Court\u2019s interpretation is inconsistent with the legislative intent. <em>See Re Baltimore Gas and Electric Co., </em>73 PSC 6 (1982). In that opinion, the Commission discussed at length the general guidelines to be used in designing BG &amp; E\u2019s electrical rates. Under state law, the Commission\u2019s rate-setting efforts are guided, in part, by Md.Ann.Code art. 78, \u00a7\u00a7 26(a), 28(d), and 56 (1991 Repl.Vol. &amp; Supp.1994), which collectively provide that rates shall not \u201cextend undue or unreasonable preferences to any particular person or class of service, and that rates not discriminate against or result in undue or unreasonable prejudice to any particular person or class of service.\u201d <em>Baltimore Gas and Electric, </em>73 PSC at 12. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>At the time of the Commission\u2019s decision, the proper method of allocating the cost of BG &amp; E\u2019s generating plant and facilities was vigorously contested. The debate centered, in part, on whether those costs should be included in the \u201cenergy charges,\u201d which are billed on a per-kilowatt-hour basis. The Commission concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-4\">[T]he degree to which plant costs are allocated between demand and energy costs is a matter of judgment; it depends upon many factors, including the types of generating facilities on the utility\u2019s system; the mix of base load, intermediate and peak units; and the load characteristics of the system and the various customer classes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 15. The design of electric rates is a complex, technical process that relies heavily on the expertise and judgment of the Public Service Commission. Under the Tax Court\u2019s interpretation of the City ordinance, the City\u2019s revenues under the electricity tax would depend, in part, on decisions made by the Commission. We do not believe that the City Council intended such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">As a final guide to construction, we must give some weight to the Director\u2019s administrative interpretation of the ordinance. The ordinance provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-7\">(d) <em>Regulations. </em>The Director of Finance is hereby authorized to adopt such rules and regulations as may be necessary to insure the collection of the tax imposed by this section and to define any terms used in this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2q\">Baltimore City Code art. 28, \u00a7 55(d). Although the Director has not adopted formal rules or regulations, it has been the City\u2019s long-standing practice to treat the ordinance as a tax on retail sales of electricity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> According to Mr. DeWitt, Director <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>of Rate Research for BG &amp; E, both Baltimore City and the State of Maryland \u201chave continuously and consistently included customer and demand charges in their respective taxable basis calculations since 1947.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">When a reviewing court construes a statute, we will generally give some weight to the long-standing administrative practice of the agency responsible for administering the statute, so long as that practice is not inconsistent with the plain meaning of the words employed by the legislature. <em>Controller v. Pleasure Cove Yacht Club, </em>334 Md. 450, 466, 639 A.2d 685 (1994); <em>Fishkind Realty v. Sampson, </em>306 Md. 269, 283, 508 A.2d 478 (1986). The weight we give to an administrative interpretation varies, depending on the facts of each particular case. The relevant factors include whether the interpretation has resulted from a rule-making process or contested adversarial proceeding, and the consistency and length of the administrative interpretation or practice. <em>Magan v. Medical Mut. Liab. Ins. Soc., </em>331 Md. 535, 546-47, 629 A.2d 626 (1993); <em>Comptroller v. John C. Louis Co., </em>285 Md. 527, 544-45, 404 A.2d 1045 (1979). Although the Director\u2019s interpretation has not been embodied in formal rules, the Director\u2019s interpretation has been applied \u201ccontinuously and consistently\u201d for more than forty years. Moreover, we note that \u201c[legislative acquiescence in a long-standing administrative construction gives rise to a strong presumption that the interpretation is correct.\u201d <em>Maryland Classified Employees Ass\u2019n v. Schaefer, </em>325 Md. 19, 33-34, 599 A.2d 91 (1991). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>Consequently, we think the Director\u2019s administrative interpretation is entitled to significant weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">In light of the foregoing considerations, we conclude that the phrase \u201csales for consumption\u201d of electricity was intended to distinguish between \u201cretail\u201d and \u201cwholesale\u201d sales of electricity. The use of the adjective \u201cgross\u201d indicates that the City Council intended to levy the tax against the \u201cwhole,\u201d \u201ctotal,\u201d or \u201centire\u201d sales price. Black\u2019s Law Dictionaky 702 (6th ed. 1990). By using the phrase \u201cgross sales price,\u201d the City Council intended to tax all charges that might reasonably be construed as part of the total sales price for electricity. Had the City Council intended to impose a tax on the \u201cprice per kilowatt-hour\u201d thereof, the Council could have said so directly. <em>Compare </em>TG \u00a7 9-305 (imposing a tax \u201cfor each gallon of gasoline other than aviation gasoline\u201d); TG \u00a7 12-105 (imposing a tax \u201cfor each package\u201d of cigarettes).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Having reached that conclusion, we must determine whether the customer charge and demand charges may properly be taxed as part of the gross sales price. As we noted earlier, an ordinance involving taxation must be strictly construed in favor of the taxpayer. <em>See Pleasure Cove, </em>334 Md. at 464, 639 A.2d 685. The Tax Court concluded that the charges at issue do not, in themselves, constitute \u201csales for consumption\u201d of electricity. The taxpayers argue that the customer and demand charges constitute \u201ccharges for the service of providing electricity\u201d rather than \u201ccharges for the actual use of electricity.\u201d We agree with the taxpayers on that point. As the Public Service Commission noted in <em>Baltimore Gas and Electric, </em>73 PSC at 12-13, the rates charged to each class of customer are designed to reflect \u201cthe cost of providing service to that class.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">It does not follow, however, that the cost of providing service is not taxable as part of the \u201cgross sales price\u201d for retail sales of electricity. The pertinent legal principles may be gleaned from a series of cases dealing with other tax statutes. The first two cases involve the tax on \u201cadmissions.\u201d Pursuant to TG \u00a7 4-102, a county or municipal organization <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>may impose a tax on \u201cthe <em>gross receipts </em>derived from any admissions and amusement charge\u201d within \u2022 its jurisdiction (emphasis added). In <em>Scoville Serv. Inc. v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>269 Md. 390, 306 A.2d 534 (1973), the Court of Appeals considered whether a charge for parking at Laurel Raceway was subject to the admissions tax. Scoville Service, Inc. (Scoville) operated a parking lot on land adjacent to the racetrack. Although the land itself was owned by the Laurel Harness Racing Association, the parking operation was a separate enterprise. During the racing season, the parking area was used exclusively by those attending the races. Scoville charged a flat rate for each automobile, regardless of the number of passengers. The admission fee to the racetrack was charged separately, at a gate leading into the track.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">Under those circumstances, the Court of Appeals held that the parking fee did not constitute part of the \u201cgross receipts\u201d from admission to the racetrack. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-5\">That one may park on the lot has nothing whatever to do with his entry into the racetrack. Patrons must, in any event, pay to enter the track, and automobile passengers (other than the driver), as well as those traveling by public transportation or living nearby, pay no parking charge. Similarly one is free to park in Scoville\u2019s lot and not enter the racetrack at all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 395, 306 A.2d 534. The admissions tax, the Court concluded, was intended to be a tax on the \u201cprice of entrance\u201d to any place, \u201cand not on a service provided for one\u2019s convenience <em>prior </em>to entering.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">The Court of Appeals reached a similar result in <em>Washington Nat\u2019l Arena Ltd. Partnership v. Comptroller, </em>308 Md. 370, 519 A.2d 1277 (1987). The appellant in that case operated a sports and entertainment arena in Prince George\u2019s County. The seating at the arena included sky suites and other special seating arrangements. Patrons who purchased this special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>seating also received certain amenities,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> including reserved parking and membership in the Capital Club, a restaurant and bar located within the confines of the arena. Notwithstanding the fact that the arena charged a single sum for both the admissions and the amenities, the Court of Appeals concluded that the price of the amenities was not taxable as part of the \u201cgross receipts\u201d from admissions. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-4\">In <em>Scoville </em>we looked to the plain meaning of the word \u201cadmission\u201d to determine legislative intent. We cannot extend a legislative intent to tax admission to an intent to tax things <em>only remotely or tangentially related to admissions. </em>In short, we think that when a package includes the price of admission and the price of largely unrelated amenities, the legislature intended there to be an allocation of the charge between that portion relating to admissions and that portion not so related.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 376, 519 A.2d 1277. (emphasis added; footnote omitted). The Court concluded that the legislature did not intend to tax items that are not \u201creasonably related or functionally subordinate\u201d to the cost of admission. <em>Id. </em>at 377, 519 A.2d 1277. In reaching that conclusion, however, the Court rejected the argument that parking was not a taxable admission charge as a matter of law. After reviewing the facts of <em>Scoville, </em>269 Md. 390, 306 A.2d 534, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5k\">Thus, the charge for parking was not a charge for admission to the track. But if the parking privilege is tied to admission to particular events, and is used only in connection with attendance at those events, a fact-finder could determine that parking is reasonably related or functionally subordinate to the price of admission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-6\"><em>Washington Nat\u2019l Arena, </em>308 Md. at 377, 519 A.2d 1277.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">The Court of Appeals applied a similar analysis in <em>Baltimore Country Club, Inc. v. Comptroller, </em>272 Md. 65, 321 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>308 (1974), a case involving the Maryland Retail Sales Tax, now codified at TG \u00a7 11-101 <em>et seq. </em>The statutory definition of \u201cretail\u201d sale included \u201cthe sale of any meals, food or drink for human consumption on the premises where sold.\u201d <em>See Baltimore Country Club, </em>272 Md. at 66, 321 A.2d 308. For many years, the Baltimore County Club had added a 15% mandatory gratuity or \u201cservice charge\u201d to the stated price for food and beverages. Notwithstanding the fact that the language of the statute did not provide for a tax on those services, the Court concluded that the mandatory service charge was subject to the tax.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-4\">As shown by the agreed statement of facts in the present case, in making sales of food and beverages to its members, service is always provided by the Club as <em>an integral part of the transaction. </em>The mandatory service charge imposed by the Club as part of the sale is a legally binding contractual obligation upon the purchaser, one \u201cautomatically and invariably\u201d levied and required to be paid as a constituent part of the \u201cprice\u201d of the sale.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 73, 321 A.2d 308 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">The principles that emerge from <em>Scoville, Washington Nat'l Arena, </em>and <em>Baltimore Country Club </em>were considered most recently in <em>Pleasure Cove, </em>334 Md. 450, 639 A.2d 685. The dispositive issue in that case concerned the scope of Md.Ann. Code art. 24, \u00a7 9-602, which authorized Anne Arundel County to collect a tax on \u201cspace rentals,\u201d including fees for the docking or storage of boats. In addition to annual dues, Pleasure Cove Yacht Club charged a separate fee to members for rental of a slip, outside storage rack, or indoor storage space. Prior to 1989, the rental fee covered the cost of certain \u201cmarina services,\u201d including forklift services, electricity, trash removal, security, snow removal, assistance with \u201ccanvassing\u201d boats, keeping the water free from ice in the winter, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>periodic checking of bilge pumps. In 1989, Pleasure Cove reduced the rental fee and charged members separately for marina services. The Court of Appeals rejected the Tax Court\u2019s conclusion that the charge for marina services was taxable. In reaching that conclusion, the Court distinguished <em>Pleasure Cove </em>from its earlier decision in <em>Baltimore Country Club, 272 </em>Md. 65, 321 A.2d 308:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-4\">With regard to the <em>Baltimore Country Club </em>case, restaurant service is inherently necessary to the sale of restaurant meals and is usually not optional.... Since the mandatory gratuity was, in essence, part of the cost of the meal, it was held to be subject to the retail sales tax.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-5\">The marina services involved here, on the other hand, are not <em>inherently necessary </em>to the wet slip, outside rack, or boatel rental. Boat slip renters are capable of performing the marina services on their own and quite often do. Checking bilge pumps, breaking up ice around boats, cleaning and canvassing boats, etc., are all activities performable without the assistance of the marina staff. Likewise, members do not necessarily require a marina forklift to get their boats into and out of the water. There is nothing in the record to suggest that a renter may not use his or her own boat trailer or other means for that purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-6\"><em>Id. </em>334 Md. at 462-63, 639 A.2d 685 (emphasis added; footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Applying these principles to the case at hand, we conclude that the customer charge and demand charges may be taxed as part of the \u201cgross sales price\u201d of electricity. As in <em>Baltimore Country Club, </em>the charges at issue here are \u201cautomatically and invariably\u201d levied as part of each monthly electricity bill for all customers who are billed under Schedule GL. The taxpayers do not have the option to forego those charges. For practical reasons, they cannot purchase the \u201cservice\u201d of providing electricity from a different supplier, nor can they make other arrangements for delivery of the electricity they intend to consume. <em>Compare Scoville, </em>269 Md. at 395, 306 A.2d 534 (noting that patrons who do not park in Scoville\u2019s lot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>are free to enter the racetrack without paying the parking fee).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">More importantly, the service of providing electricity is both \u201cfunctionally subordinate\u201d and \u201cinherently necessary\u201d as part of any transaction involving the \u201csale for consumption\u201d of electricity. <em>See Washington Nat\u2019l Arena, </em>308 Md. at 376-77, 519 A.2d 1277; <em>Pleasure Cove, </em>334 Md. at 463, 639 A.2d 685. The documents considered by the Tax Court included an affidavit by Alan Haymes, the Director of the Public Service Commission\u2019s Rate Research &amp; Economics Division. According to Mr. Haymes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-5\">The sale of electricity involves a number of processes. These processes include production, transmission, distribution, metering and billing, various administrative functions and the consumption of fuel. <em>All of these processes are necessary in order for electricity to be produced and delivered to customers for consumption.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-6\">Utility rates are set forth in terms of different charges including customer charges, demand charges, energy charge and fuel rate charges for the purpose of accurately allocating different cost components to different customer classes.... [E]ach cost component and each charge represents a facet of the total expense involved in producing and distributing electricity ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">The taxpayers contend that <em>Baltimore Country Club </em>and <em>Pleasure Cove </em>are inapposite because the present case does not involve a general retail sales tax.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We think it useful to set forth the argument made by the taxpayers in more detail:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>Appellant argues that, unlike marina services, demand and customer charges are \u201cinherently necessary\u201d to the provision of electricity sold , and, thus, subject to the electricity tax. This argument fails to recognize that the customer and demand charges are for something other than the commodity which is subject to the tax. Those charges are not based on the amount of electricity consumed and are no more \u201csales for consumption of electricity,\u201d than the marina charges were for space rental.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">(Footnote omitted). In a nutshell, the taxpayers argue that charges which are not sales of <em>electricity </em>are not subject to the tax, as a matter of law. In <em>Washington Nat\u2019l Arena, </em>308 Md. 370, 519 A.2d 1277, the Court of Appeals squarely rejected a similar argument with regard to the admissions tax. As the Court explained in <em>Scoville, </em>269 Md. 395, 306 A.2d 534, the reach of the admissions tax is limited to the \u201cprice of entrance\u201d to \u201cany place.\u201d Thus, a parking fee does not constitute a charge for admissions. Nonetheless, the Court subsequently concluded that parking fees might, under proper circumstances, be taxable as part of the \u201cgross receipts\u201d from admission. <em>See Washington Nat\u2019l Arena, </em>308 Md. at 377, 519 A.2d 1277.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">The fact that the tax at issue here is not a general retail sales tax does not alter our analysis or conclusion. Although we agree that the customer and demand charges constitute charges for the service of providing electricity, we nonetheless hold that those charges may be taxed as part of the \u201cgross sales price\u201d of \u201csales for consumption\u201d of electricity.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">As the Court of Appeals explained in <em>Washington Nat\u2019l Arena, </em>308 Md. at 377, 519 A.2d 1277, resolution of the question presented here ordinarily requires a factual determination by the Tax Court. Because the Tax Court concluded that there was no genuine dispute of material fact, we think it unnecessary to remand the case for factual findings. When the affidavits and other documents submitted to the Tax Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>are considered under the correct legal standard, no \u201creasoning-mind reasonably could have reached\u201d the conclusion that the customer and demand charges are not taxable. <em>Ramsay, Scarlett &amp; Co., </em>302 Md. at 836, 490 A.2d 1296.
