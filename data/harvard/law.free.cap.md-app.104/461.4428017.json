The court merged the simple possession count into the distribution count and, treating him as a second offender, sentenced appellant to ten years imprisonment without the possibility of parole under Md.Code, art. 27, \u00a7 286(c). The court imposed no sentence on the remaining count. Appellant presents four questions in this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">\u201c1. Did the trial court err in denying the motion for mistrial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-9\">2. Did the trial court err in allowing evidence of prior crimes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-11\">3. Did . the trial court impose an illegal sentence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-12\">4. Did the trial court err in concluding that the statute involved required a consecutive sentence?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-14\">We find no error with respect to the first two questions and shall therefore affirm appellant\u2019s convictions; we hold, however, that the trial court erred in imposing a ten-year no-parole sentence and, accordingly, shall vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing. We do not reach the fourth question.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-15\">\n<em>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b489-16\">State Trooper Darren Whitehead testified that at about 3:30 p.m. on July 20, 1993, while working undercover, he drove to appellant\u2019s house. Whitehead said that he had met appellant on June 17,1993 and had observed him on June 23. He stated that appellant got into the car, that Whitehead gave him $20, and that, in exchange, appellant gave him a piece of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>Appellant was arrested at about 3:35 p.m. and was found to be in possession of crack cocaine at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">\n<em>Mistrial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">On direct examination, appellant admitted that he was in possession of cocaine when he was arrested but denied ever meeting Whitehead or selling him cocaine. On cross-examination, the prosecutor, having elicited the fact that appellant had seen the trooper in court on one occasion, began to ask about appellant\u2019s prior convictions. During this colloquy, amid several objections, defense counsel uttered the word \u201cmistrial.\u201d The word apparently left her lips as counsel approached the bench, before the court reporter was able to record the words preceding it. The context in which the word was uttered is therefore unclear. The court did not respond to the word and thus did not regard counsel as having actually made a motion for mistrial, and counsel did not pursue the matter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">If counsel in fact intended to move for a mistrial, she certainly did not make that intent clear. In any event, even if we were to assume that such a motion was made and, by the court\u2019s silence, it was effectively denied, we would find no abuse of discretion: The prosecutor\u2019s attempt to show prior convictions was, to some extent, a fumbling one, requiring some guidance by the court, but there was clearly insufficient prejudice to warrant a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>\n<em>The Photograph</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">Trooper Whitehead testified that the day before he met appellant for the first time, he received a photograph of appellant from the Wicomico County Sheriffs Department. Over objection on grounds of relevance, the court permitted a copy of the photograph to be admitted into evidence, ruling that \u201c[i]dentification, as I understand, is the issue here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Appellant argues that, because of the stated source of the photograph, it amounted to evidence of a prior arrest whose probative value was clearly outweighed by the potential for prejudice. He argues that \u201cgiven the fact that Trooper Whitehead had very recently seen Appellant, twice, before,\u201d the photograph had relatively little probative value on the question of identification, and that that little probative value was outweighed by the potential for prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">That issue is not properly before us because it was not raised in the circuit court. The basis of appellant\u2019s objection below was that the photograph was not relevant; no claim was made that it constituted improper evidence of \u201cother crimes.\u201d The court ruled that the photograph was relevant to the issue of identification. Appellant had denied ever meeting Whitehead, and thus the photograph was relevant to establish that Whitehead correctly identified the man he met on June 17, the day after receiving the photograph, and the man from whom he purchased cocaine on July 20, as appellant. The court did not err in overruling the objection, the grounds for which were limited to relevance.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Even if the \u201cother crimes\u201d argument had been preserved for our review, we would find no error. There was no testimony as to how the sheriffs department had obtained the photograph\u2014nothing directly indicating it was taken pursuant to an arrest. As the photograph is not in the record before us, we are unable to determine whether it is in the nature of a \u201cmug\u201d shot, but, even if it were clearly recognizable as such, \u201cthe decision of a trial court to admit mug shots of a defendant as substantive evidence will not be reversed absent a showing of clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Straughn v. State, </em>297 Md. 329, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>334, 465 A.2d 1166 (1983). Given the clear relevance of the photograph to a disputed issue, we would not find that the court had abused its discretion in admitting it if the issue had been preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">\n<em>The Enhanced Sentence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The issue here is whether the word \u201csecond,\u201d as used in the enhanced punishment provision of Md.Code, art. 27, \u00a7 286(c)(2), really means only \u201csecond,\u201d <em>ie., </em>\u201cnext in order after the first in time or place; the ordinal of two\u201d (Webster\u2019s ' New Universal Unabridged Dictionary), or whether it means anything more than \u201cfirst\u201d and thus includes \u201cthird.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Prior to 1988, art. 27, \u00a7 286(b)(1) required, in relevant part, that a person convicted of distributing certain specified drugs who had \u201cpreviously been convicted under this paragraph\u201d be sentenced to prison for not less than 10 years, that no part of that sentence be suspended, and that the defendant not be subject to parole except through Patuxent Institution. A similar provision appeared in \u00a7 286(b)(2) with respect to a subsequent conviction of distributing certain other drugs. Under that statute, the 10-year non-suspendable, essentially non-parolable sentence was mandated for each and every conviction after the first, provided that at least one prior conviction occurred before the later offense was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">In 1988, the Legislature repealed those parts of subsection (b) and substituted in their place a more structured enhanced punishment provision, which it added as new subsections (c), (d), and (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">Subsection (c)(1) provided that a person who had previously been convicted under subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2) \u201cshall be sentenced, on being convicted a <em>second </em>time under either subsection (b)(1) or subsection (b)(2) of this section, to imprisonment for not less than 10 years.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Subsection (c)(2) stated that the sentence of a person sentenced under subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2) <em>\u201cas a second offender </em>\u201d could not be suspended to less than 10 years and that the person could be paroled during that period only through Patuxent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>Institution. (Emphasis added.) The penalty mandated in subsections (c)(1) and (2) was thus comparable to that required by the deleted provisions formerly contained in subsections (b)(1) and (2), except that the new subsections applied only to persons convicted \u201ca second time,\u201d to a \u201csecond offender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Subsection (d), a more complex provision, mandated a sentence of 25 years for a person \u201cconvicted a <em>third </em>time\u201d under subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2), but only if (i) the person had previously been convicted on two separate occasions under subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2), (ii) the convictions did not arise from a single incident, and (iii) the person served at least one term of confinement of at least 180 days in a correctional institution as a result of a previous conviction under \u00a7 286 or \u00a7 286A. (Emphasis added.) That sentence was not subject to suspension and the defendant could not be paroled except through Patuxent Institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Subsection (e) was comparable to subsection (d). It mandated a non-suspendable and (except through Patuxent Institution) a non-parolable sentence of 40 years for a person who had served three separate terms of confinement as a result of three separate convictions under subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2) on being convicted \u201ca <em>fourth </em>time\u201d under subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2). (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Prior to 1991, only prior convictions under Maryland law could result in enhanced sentences under \u00a7 286. In that year, the Legislature again amended \u00a7 286. The purpose of the amendment, according to the synopsis of the bill, was to require \u201ccertain mandatory penalties to be imposed on a subsequent offender for certain violations of the Controlled Dangerous Substances Act if the prior offense occurred under the laws of the United States, the District of Columbia, or another state.\u201d 1991 Md.Laws Ch. 185. The amended \u00a7 286(c)(1) reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-8\">\u201cA person who is convicted under subsection (b)(1) or subsection (b)(2) of this section, or of conspiracy to violate subsection (b)(1) or subsection (b)(2) of this section shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>sentenced to imprisonment for not less than ten years if the person has previously been convicted:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-5\">(i) Under subsection (b)(1) or subsection (b)(2) of this section;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-6\">(ii) Of conspiracy to violate subsection (b)(1) or subsection (b)(2) of this section; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">(iii) Of an offense under the laws of another state, the District of Columbia, or the United States that would be a violation of subsection (b)(1) or subsection (b)(2) of this section if committed in this State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">Analogous changes were made to subsections (d) and (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">There is no indication in the legislative history of the 1991 amendment of any intent to make \u00a7 286(c), and particularly \u00a7 286(c)(2), to a conviction other than the second. For one thing, subsection (c)(2), making the sentence of a \u201csecond offender\u201d non-suspendable and not subject to parole, was left unchanged. Moreover, the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee Floor Report acknowledges that subsection (c) applies to a person \u201cconvicted for the second time\u201d and makes clear that the sole purpose of the amendment was to treat \u201cconvictions ... rendered under the law of another state, the District of Columbia, or the United States as prior convictions for the purpose of calculating these mandatory minimum penalties....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">As we have indicated, appellant was sentenced under \u00a7 286(c) to 10 years, no part suspended, without parole except through Patuxent Institution. The problem is that the evidence on which that sentence was based showed that this was, in fact, appellant\u2019s third conviction in sequence, not his second, but, because the second conviction had not occurred before he committed the crime leading to this conviction, he could not be sentenced under subsection (d). <em>See Gargliano v. State, </em>334 Md. 428, 446, 639 A.2d 675 (1994), holding that, for purposes of subsection (c), and necessarily as well for subsections (d) and (e), \u201can enhanced penalty is warranted <em>only </em>if the defendant was convicted of an earlier offense prior to the <em>commission </em>of the principal offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>Appellant\u2019s first conviction occurred in 1992. His arrest on the charge leading to this conviction occurred in 1993, \u201cwithin weeks\u201d of another arrest on drug charges. Although the precise dates are not clear from the record, we are informed, without contradiction, that appellant was convicted and sentenced on the other 1993 charge before he was sentenced on this conviction and that he was sentenced under \u00a7 286(c) to a non-suspended, non-parolable 10 years on that occasion. The imposition of sentence under subsection (c) on this conviction thus constitutes his second sentence under that section. He argues that that is improper\u2014that subsection (c) applies only to a sentence as a \u201csecond offender\u201d and not a third. The State responds that such a limited reading of subsection (c) would be inconsistent with the intent of the Legislature in enacting the 1988 revisions, which was to increase enhanced punishments for subsequent offenders, in that it would result in a lesser sentence than appellant would have received under the pre-1988 law.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">We agree with appellant. In <em>Gargliano v. State, supra, </em>334 Md. at 437, 639 A.2d 675, the Court held \u00a7 286(c) to be \u201ca highly penal statute\u201d which must be \u201cstrictly construed so that only punishment contemplated by the language of the statute is meted out.\u201d When an appellate court \u201cis uncertain whether the Legislature intended to authorize the imposition of an enhanced penalty in a particular situation,\u201d the Court continued at 449, 639 A.2d 675, \u201cthe presumption must be that the Legislature did not intend to do so.\u201d The first step in resolving any uncertainty is to examine \u201cthe words of the statute, given their ordinary and popularly understood meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 435, 639 A.2d 675. Relying on earlier decisions of the Court of Appeals, we expressed essentially the same principles in <em>Calhoun v. State, </em>46 Md.App. 478, 488, 418 A.2d 1241 (1980), <em>aff'd, </em>290 Md. 1, 425 A.2d 1361 (1981), holding that, in resolving a dispute over the severity of a penalty provided in a penal statute, \u201ca presumption arises in favor of the lesser penalty over the greater one\u201d and that \u201cinternal consistency between the various provisions of a statute must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>be maintained, and subsections must, therefore, be interpreted in the context of the entire statutory scheme.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">There can be little doubt here as to the legislative intent. The General Assembly in 1988 repealed a statute that provided a mandatory 10-year minimum sentence upon a finding of any previous conviction in favor of a more structured approach of increasing mandatory sentences for a second, third, and fourth conviction. It was presumably aware of our holding in <em>Calhoun </em>that, where a statute prescribes an enhanced penalty for a \u201cthird\u201d conviction, as opposed to a \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d conviction, it allows that penalty only upon the one conviction that constitutes the third, and not upon any conviction beyond the second. The Legislature had a variety of language to choose from, in existing enhanced punishment statutes, and it chose specificity over generality. In 1991, when it amended \u00a7 286(c)(1) to include certain foreign convictions, it left unchanged the specific language \u201cas a second offender\u201d in the provision mandating a non-suspendable, essentially non-parolable sentence for persons previously convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">The State\u2019s argument that this result would be inconsistent with the legislative purpose of increasing the mandatory penalties upon subsequent convictions misses the mark. The legislative purpose enunciated in the statute has been fulfilled to the letter. Appellant received the required 10-year nonsuspendable, non-parolable sentence upon his conviction as a second offender. What the State seeks to do is have the sentence carefully prescribed for a sentence as a second offender imposed upon a third conviction when the conditions for a mandatory sentence for someone who has been convicted twice have not been satisfied. That, not the result we reach, would be inconsistent with the legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">CONVICTIONS AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WICOMICO COUNTY FOR SENTENCING PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.
