Pursuant to Md.Rule 8-131(a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> however, we -will reach, for the benefit of the trial court, certain of the other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">FACTS<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">In 1983, appellant was a police officer with the Hagerstown Police Department. By the fall of 1983, there was considerable suspicion that someone in the Hagerstown Police Department was \u201cleaking\u201d police information concerning ongoing gambling investigations. In an attempt to identify these \u201cleaks,\u201d Clinton E. Mowen, chief of the Hagerstown Police Department, requested that a wiretap be placed on appellant\u2019s telephone extension at police headquarters. Specifically, Chief Mowen ordered Corporal John E. Ryder, Sr. and Lieutenant Nelson S. Dunahugh \u201cto tap Leon Fearnow\u2019s phone.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Notwithstanding Ryder\u2019s plea that this was \u201cillegal as hell,\u201d Chief Mowen commanded the officers to proceed with the wiretap. Ryder attempted to locate appellant\u2019s extension line <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>on the telephone terminal board of the police headquarters, but lacked the technical expertise to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Soon thereafter, Ryder telephoned Wood<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> at home \u201csometime between six and nine o\u2019clock in the evening\u201d and requested that he come to the police building.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Ryder explained only that there was a problem at police headquarters. Wood was not told what the problem was or why his assistance was requested.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Wood stated that he would be there \u201cwithin the hour.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">When Wood arrived at police headquarters, he was met by Ryder and, shortly thereafter, Chief Mowen. He was asked to look at the police headquarters\u2019 telephone terminal board in the basement and identify the binding posts (wire terminations) associated with an internal extension number.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Wood did not inquire into the police officers\u2019 authorization for their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>actions, but testified that because the terminal board and internal wiring were the property of the Hagerstown Police Department, \u201cit has all the right in the world to go down and make any changes on [Chief Mowen\u2019s] telephone equipment that he would elect to do so.\u201d Wood also testified that he never saw a court order authorizing the proposed interception. Moreover, he testified that \u201c[t]he thought never really crossed my mind of a need for a court order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">When Wood was unable to identify the specified binding posts on the terminal board in the basement of the building, he, Ryder, and Mowen went to a second, redundant terminal board on the third floor of the police building where the binding posts were identified by the extension number written next to them. Once the particular extension number was located, \u201cRyder produced a tape recorder from a paper bag that he had been carrying and proceeded to hook the tape recorder to the binding post.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> When the tape recorder was attached, Ryder concealed it above the ductwork and turned on the recorder.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Almost immediately thereafter, Wood left the police building alone and heard nothing further about the incident until approximately three years later when he was questioned by a state police investigator.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">On 15 October 1987, appellant filed a two-count Complaint in the Circuit Court for Washington County against C &amp; P, Wood, Mowen, Dunahugh, Ryder, Kauffman, and Baker, alleging invasion of privacy and violation of the Maryland Wiretap Act. On 26 February 1988, the circuit court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, with leave to amend within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>thirty days. On 24 March 1988, appellant filed a four-count Amended Complaint alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>invasion of privacy (Count I), portrayal in false light (Count II), civil conspiracy (Count III), and violation of the Maryland Wiretap Act (Count IV). Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss was granted as to Counts I and II<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and denied as to Counts III and IV. In October 1989, appellant voluntarily dismissed Count III, civil conspiracy, with prejudice.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">On 31 October 1989, Wood and C &amp; P moved for summary judgment on the remaining wiretap count, arguing that there was no evidence that Wood acted \u201cwilfully\u201d so as to violate the Maryland Wiretap Act. Therefore, argued C <em>&amp; </em>P, it could not be liable \u201cbecause the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior </em>alone is incapable of establishing liability against C &amp; P under the [Maryland Wiretap Act].\u201d In the alternative, C &amp; P argued that it \u201cis entitled to summary judgment because Wood could not have been acting -within the scope of his employment with C &amp; P to the extent that he violated the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">The court granted appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment on 28 November 1989. The court concluded that \u201cthere is no evidence or reasonable inferences that Donald K. Wood acted wilfully.\u201d Therefore, the court explained,- \u201c[b]ecause the claim against the C &amp; P Telephone Company is predicated upon the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior, </em>the Court finds it unnecessary to address the other arguments presented by ... [C &amp; P].\u201d Final judgment was entered against appellant on 27 February 1990.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">On 6 March 1990, appellant noted a timely appeal to this Court. In <em>Fearnow v. Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Tel. Co., </em>85 Md.App. 788, 790, September Term, No. 392, an unreported per curiam opinion filed on 4 January 1991, this Court re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>versed and remanded the circuit court\u2019s grant of appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment. This Court explained that \u201cthe determination of willfulness is a question of intent, and as such, is within the province of a fact-finder and should not be determined on a motion for summary judgment.\u201d The parties then filed petitions for writ of certiorari, which were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">On remand, the trial court heard argument on the respondeat superior and scope of employment issues and, on 1 September 1992, granted summary judgment to C&amp;P, thereby removing it from this case.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> On 10 September 1992, appellant filed a motion for summary judgment requesting that the court \u201cissue an Order stating that [Wood] violated [the Maryland Wiretap Act] and permit [appellant] to proceed to trial to prove the type and amount of damages.\u201d That motion was denied on 27 October 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Also on 27 October 1992, the circuit court granted Wood\u2019s partial motion for summary judgment as to the issue of punitive damages. In so ruling, the court found that \u201cproof of malice is required to support the imposition of punitive damages under the [Maryland Wiretap Act].\u201d Therefore, concluded the court, \u201cthe evidence before it is insufficient as a matter of law to support a finding that [Wood] acted with malice and ... punitive damages would be inappropriate in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Az\">On 3 June 1993, summary judgment was again granted in favor of Wood on the issue of reputational damages and resultant emotional distress.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-6\">While the court agrees that reputational damage may be recovered under the statute as a component of actual damages, such damages are not appropriate under the facts of this case. The statute clearly does not prohibit the disclosure of the existence of a wiretap. The only disclosure prohibited by the statute is a disclosure of the contents of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>the communication. No such disclosure is present in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">The court concluded that \u201cany damage caused to [appellant\u2019s] reputation due to this publicity was due to the existence of the underlying suspicions of [appellant] \"within the police department.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">The case proceeded to trial against Wood on 21 June 1993. After six days of trial, the jury answered the following question in the negative: \u201cDid the Defendant, Donald K. Wood, willfully intercept any telephone communications of Leon C. Fearnow?\u201d Judgment was entered on 26 July 1993; appellant noted a timely appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">We shall relate additional facts as necessary in our discussion of appellant\u2019s issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">As an initial challenge, appellant argues that the circuit court erred in refusing to give appellant\u2019s requested jury instruction no. 21:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-10\">I have ruled that Donald Wood is responsible for the injuries and damages to Leon Fearnow in this case so you need not concern yourself with that question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-11\">You need only decide the amount of damages that should be awarded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-12\">In support of this verdict-directing instruction, appellant asserts that, because the circuit court instructed the jury that appellant was not guilty of any crime, section 10\u2014402(c)(2) of the Act<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> did not apply. Therefore, argued appellant, section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>10-402(c)(l),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> making it lawful to intercept a wire or oral communication with a court order, imposed on Wood a legal duty to inquire as to the existence of a court order. Because Wood conceded that he did not so inquire, his conduct could not fall under section 10-402(c)(l), and is consequently a violation of the Maryland Wiretap Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">To determine the propriety of denying a requested jury instruction, we must examine whether the requested jury instruction is a correct statement of the law, whether the law is applicable in light of the evidence presented to the jury, and whether the requested instruction was fairly covered by the instructions actually given. <em>Sergeant Co. v. Pickett, </em>285 Md. 186, 193, 401 A.2d 651 (1979); <em>E.G. Rock, Inc. v. Danly, </em>98 Md.App. 411, 421, 633 A.2d 485 (1993); <em>Myers v. Estate of Alessi, </em>80 Md.App. 124, 132, 560 A.2d 59, <em>cert. denied, </em>317 Md. 640, 566 A.2d 101 (1989). As appellant\u2019s instruction no. 21 fails the first and second parts of this test, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s refusal to give such an instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>First, we hold that appellant\u2019s requested jury instruction was an incorrect statement of the law concerning the Maryland Wiretap Act. Appellant contends that Wood violated section 10-410(a) of the Act, which establishes civil liability, except where specifically provided otherwise, for the wilful interception of any wire, oral, or electronic communication.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Section 10-410 also establishes civil liability for a violation of section 10-402<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and authorizes a private cause of action. <em>Kassap v. Seitz, </em>315 Md. 155, 159, 553 A.2d 714 (1989). To establish liability under the Maryland Wiretap Act, appellant must prove that Wood acted wilfully. <em>Earley v. Smoot, </em>846 F.Supp. 451, 453 (D.Md.1994) (interpreting the Maryland Wiretap Act); <em>Benford v. ABC, </em>649 F.Supp. 9, 10 (D.Md.1986) (same). The term \u201cwilfully\u201d means \u201cmore than intentional or voluntary. It denotes either an intentional violation or a reckless disregard of a known legal duty.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Indeed, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>the federal district court explained in <em>Earley, </em>the violator must know that what he or she is doing is illegal. <em>Earley, </em>846 F.Supp. at 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Section 10-402(c), on the other hand, sets forth exceptions, under the caption \u201cLawful acts,\u201d to the conduct proscribed in sections 10-410 and 10-402(a). Merely because there existed evidence that Wood did not inquire into the lawfulness of the wiretap and no court order to wiretap appellant\u2019s telephone extension was obtained, that does not establish, as a matter of law, that Wood violated the Maryland Wiretap Act.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Appellant still must prove that Wood wilfully intercepted a wire or oral communication in violation of section 10-410 or section 10-402(a). Whether Wood had a legal duty to inquire into the police officers\u2019 authorization, i.e., court order, to conduct the wiretap is but a factor for the jury to consider in making its determination of wilfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Second, we hold that the evidence presented at trial was not sufficient to establish, as a matter of law, that Wood acted wilfully. Appellant\u2019s instruction no. 21 was a verdict-directing instruction stating, in essence, that Wood, as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>matter of law, wilfully intercepted the wire communications of appellant. Appellant points to the following facts, based on Wood\u2019s response to cross-examination questions regarding the C &amp; P company manual,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> that he contends \u201cclearly show[ ] a reckless disregard of a known legal duty\u201d: no court order was ever obtained to wiretap appellant\u2019s telephone; Wood knew that a court order was necessary to install the wiretap; Wood had a legal duty to inquire as to the officer\u2019s authorization to implement the wiretap; Wood testified that the C &amp; P manual informed him that it was a criminal offense to violate \u201cthe secrecy of communications.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Counsel for Wood, however, countered by asking Wood his interpretation of the scope of the C &amp; P company manual. Wood explained that \u201cthis document was published for C &amp; P employees to protect the C &amp; P network.\u201d Wood testified that he did not understand the company manual to apply to equipment owned by its customers, i.e., the Hagerstown Police Department, and therefore he believed he was under no legal duty to inquire as to whether the police needed, applied for, or actually obtained a court order.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The testimony at trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>however, at the very least, presented conflicting evidence of Wood\u2019s state of mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">Moreover, Wood\u2019s testimony at trial indicated that he believed the law relating to wiretaps was complex, and did not always require a court order.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Wood also testified that he relied upon Chief Mowen and the other police officers to have obeyed the law in obtaining the necessary authorization to wiretap their own equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">As appellant\u2019s proposed jury instruction no. 21 would have amounted to, in essence, a verdict on the issue of Wood\u2019s liability, the evidence adduced at trial, coupled with the conflicting testimony regarding Wood\u2019s state of mind, do not support the giving of such an instruction. As explained in <em>Rock, </em>a jury instruction is not appropriate if it is not <em>\u201capplicable </em>in light of the evidence before the jury.\u201d <em>Rock, </em>98 Md.App. at 421, 633 A.2d 485 (emphasis in original). Indeed, this Court, in an unreported per curiam opinion in this same case,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> reversed and remanded the trial court\u2019s grant of sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>mary judgment in favor of <em>appellees </em>on the issue of wilfulness (i.e., liability) and stated: \u201c[T]he determination of wilfulness is a question of intent, and as such, is within the province of a fact-f\u00ednder.\u201d <em>Fearnow v. Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Tel. Co., 85 </em>Md.App. 788, 790, September Term 1990, No. 392, slip op. at 5. We are in accord with this Court\u2019s prior decision that the determination of wilfulness is a question for the finder of fact in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">Appellees also contend that appellant\u2019s requested instruction is equivalent to \u201cmaking a <em>de novo </em>motion in this Court for a \u2018directed verdict\u2019 on the issue of Wood\u2019s liability, since he neither moved for judgment nor otherwise properly preserved the issue in the trial court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">We agree with appellees that requested jury instruction no. 21 was, in essence, an attempt to have the trial court grant a motion for judgment without employing the necessary procedural mechanism for making such a motion. Md.Rule 2-519(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\">A party may move for judgment on any or all of the issues in any action at the close of the evidence offered by an opposing party, and in a jury trial at the close of all the evidence. The moving party shall state with particularity all reasons why the motion should be granted. No objection to the motion for judgment shall be necessary. A party does not waive the right to make the motion by introducing evidence during the presentation of an opposing party\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">To obtain such relief, or to preserve the point for appellate review, a party must: (i) specifically make the motion at the close of the evidence; and (ii) state with particularity the grounds for the motion. These procedural safeguards are necessary to ensure that the opposing party is not \u201csandbagged.\u201d <em>Annapolis Mall Ltd. Partnership v. Yogurt Tree, Inc., </em>299 Md. 244, 256, 473 A.2d 32 (1984); 5A J. Moore, <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 50.08, at 50-88 (2d ed. 1982). Appellant, however, ignored the mandate of our Rules and blazed his own brave, new procedural trail, attempting to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>judgment granted by way of jury instruction, rather than by the appropriate motion to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">As we have already lauded the circuit court\u2019s decision to refuse appellant\u2019s jury instruction no. 21 based on the three-part test set forth in <em>Sergeant, supra, </em>we also note, for the sake of thoroughness, that the instruction is, in effect, an impermissible attempt at a motion for judgment on the issue of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Appellant also contends that the trial court erred in giving certain instructions to the jury. In reviewing the adequacy of a given jury instruction, we must determine whether the charge as a whole contains a fair statement of the law. <em>Casey v. Roman Catholic Archbishop, </em>217 Md. 595, 612, 143 A.2d 627 (1958); <em>State ex rel. Taylor v. Barlly, </em>216 Md. 94, 100, 140 A.2d 173 (1958); <em>Ager v. Baltimore Transit Co., </em>213 Md. 414, 425, 132 A.2d 469 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">The first jury instruction objected to by appellant in his brief was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-10\">In determining whether the defendant, Don Wood, Donald Wood, is liable, you are first to, you are first to determine whether or not there was a violation of the Maryland Wiretap Statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">Appellant argues that because there was a stipulation that no court order was obtained to wiretap appellant\u2019s telephone extension, the wiretap was per se illegal, and the jury should not have been permitted to decide whether there was a violation of the Maryland Wiretap Act. Appellees argue, however, that \u201cthere was ample evidence that Wood <em>did not act wilfully, </em>and there was <em>no evidence </em>of either willfulness or interception.\u201d (emphasis in original). Therefore, assert appellees, only Wood could complain that the issue of violation of the Act was submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>As this is, in essence, the same argument advanced by appellant in issue I, we reiterate that the issue of Wood\u2019s liability in this case is properly a question for the jury. It is clear that to recover under section 10-410 of the Maryland Wiretap Act, appellant must first prove that there was an actual violation of the Act. The absence of a court order, however, is not dispositive of this issue. <em>See </em>discussion <em>supra. </em>Consequently, the trial court\u2019s instruction was the precise vehicle through which the issue of Wood\u2019s liability was presented to the jury.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">B. &amp; C.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The second jury instruction objected to by appellant was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-6\">The Maryland legislature enacted this law to prevent the unauthorized interception of conversations where at least one of the parties has a reasonable expectation of privacy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">I might stop here and say that the attorneys will argue to you their differing views on what is meant by this law with respect to reasonable expectation of privacy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-8\">In proving a violation of the statute, the defendant [sic] must prove that any conversations that were intercepted were ones in which he had an expectation of privacy. This is a factual determination which must be made by you, the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred on several grounds in giving this instruction to the jury. These include: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>(i) the definition of \u201cwire communication,\u201d as provided in \u00a7 10-401(l)(i) of the Maryland Wiretap Act, does not require proof of a reasonable expectation of privacy; (ii) \u201c[a]ll parties to a telephone conversation have a reasonable expectation of privacy;\u201d (in) appellees \u201celicited absolutely no evidence to support this instruction;\u201d and, (iv) requiring a finding of reasonable expectation of privacy would place an undue burden on appellant because \u00a7 10-402(a)(2) makes it unlawful for any person to disclose to anyone the contents of any wire if such information was obtained in violation of the law; (v) this Court\u2019s prior ruling in <em>Fearnow v. Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Tel. Co., 85 </em>Md.App. 788, 790; September Term 1990, No. 392, held that appellant has, as a matter of law, a reasonable expectation of privacy in the use of his office telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Appellees, as a threshold issue, argue that appellant failed to preserve several of these challenges. Rule 2-520 provides that a party must \u201cstat[e] distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the objection.\u201d As appellant did not state distinctly the first three of the challenges he now presses on appeal, argue appellees, they are not preserved for our review. In addition, appellees respond substantively to each of appellant\u2019s numbered arguments respectively: (i) appellant invited this alleged error by basing his claim on appeal exclusively on the interception of \u201cwire communications\u201d as opposed to \u201cwire and oral communications,\u201d so as to argue, albeit incorrectly, that wire communications do not require a reasonable expectation of privacy; (ii) the jury instruction as given was a correct statement of the law; (in) the fact that the tapes of the allegedly intercepted communications would have been available through judicial process had appellant made such an attempt, coupled with the other evidence available to appellant, vitiate any notion of an undue burden on appellant; and, (iv) this Court\u2019s footnote in its prior unreported per curiam opinion was dicta and therefore not binding on the circuit court in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">We first address appellant\u2019s alleged failure to preserve several of the objections now raised on appeal. Appellant\u2019s exception to the instruction at trial was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>In addition, we except to the giving of Defendant\u2019s Instruction No. 7. We believe that reasonable privacy is not an issue of fact before this jury. The Court of Special Appeals, in the <em>Fearnow </em>decision, has already stated that the plaintiff has a reasonable expectation of privacy and we believe that this Court is bound by that determination and this is not an issue of fact for the jury. In addition, we believe that the statute does not require that the plaintiff prove that each conversation intercepted was one in which he had a reasonable expectation of privacy. We don\u2019t believe we have that burden of proof under that statute and that we are entitled to an inference that when the recorder was hooked up on plaintiffs phone, that that constitutes the interception, and we do not have to prove each specific conversation, that there was a reasonable expectation of privacy on each conversation. We believe that the instruction that was given was confusing because it implies that we have to prove each specific conversation. As we pointed out in chambers, the tapes are under seal. They may have very well been destroyed and the plaintiff has no way of ascertaining the subject matter of each conversation on that tape. Oh, and then we have to get the consent of all the other parties to the conversations on the tape because they have an expectation of privacy. And as also pointed out in chambers, Judge Thacker [sic] has ordered the tapes sealed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">It is clear that appellant objected to this jury instruction based, in part, on the contention that his expectation of privacy in his telephone communications was not an issue for the jury. Indeed, appellant stated specifically \u201cthat reasonable privacy is not an issue of fact before this jury.\u201d We believe that this was sufficient, pursuant to Md.Rule 2-520(e), to preserve that issue for our review. As it is upon this basis that we hold the instruction to be reversible error, we need not discuss appellant\u2019s additional claims in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">The Maryland Wiretap Act, Md.Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc. \u00a7 KM01 <em>et seq., </em>defines \u201cwire communication,\u201d in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>any aural transfer made in whole or in part through the use of facilities for the transmission of communications by the aid of wire, cable, or other like connection between the point of origin and the point of reception (including the use of a connection in a switching station) furnished or operated by any person licensed to engage in providing or operating such facilities for the transmission of communications.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-4\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 10-401(l)(i).

Indeed, the privacy of a wire communication appears to be protected as a matter of law. <em>Smith, </em>438 N.W.2d at 573. Consequently, a plaintiffs reasonable expectation of privacy under the federal act, as well as the Maryland act, is irrelevant. <em>Id. </em>(\u201c[t]he expectation of privacy, whether reasonable or unreasonable, is irrelevant\u201d); <em>PBA Local No. 38, </em>832 F.Supp. at 819 (\u201cwire communications, unlike oral communications, are generally protected regardless of whether the person making or receiving such communications has an expectation of privacy\u201d); <em>Kratz, 477 </em>F.Supp. at 473 (\u201cwhether or not [plaintiff] had any justifiable expectation of privacy in the telephone calls made from or received in their own homes is irrelevant under Title III\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">There is, therefore, a sharp legal and factual distinction between an intercepted \u201cwire communication\u201d and an intercepted \u201coral communication\u201d under both the Maryland and the federal acts. The classification in which a particular communication is placed can play a significant role in how it should be evaluated by the fact finder.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>We hold that appellant\u2019s telephone conversations are \u201cwire communications\u201d as defined by section 10\u2014401(l)(i) of the Maryland Wiretap Act, and are therefore protected against interception regardless of appellant\u2019s expectation of privacy in those communications. Appellant\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy being irrelevant to statutory liability for the alleged interception of wire communications, the circuit court\u2019s instruction to the jury admonishing them to assess appellant\u2019s expectation of privacy in his office telephone conversations must be declared error.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">We are precluded from finding harmless error in this instance as the reasonable expectation of privacy instruction went clearly to the heart of the jury\u2019s determination whether Wood acted wilfully. The trial judge, in instructing the jury on the element of wilfulness, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-5\">In proving a violation of statute, the defendant [sic] must prove that <em>any conversations </em>that were intercepted were ones in which he <em>had a reasonable expectation of privacy. </em>This is a factual determination which must be made by you, the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">If you find that the defendant, Donald Wood, <em>knew </em>that Leon Fearnow and all other parties to a telephone conversation <em>had a reasonable right of privacy in their conversation over a telephone ... that is a factor that you may consider in determining whether the defendant ... acted wilfully. </em>(emphasis added).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Therefore, had the jury been properly instructed, i.e., \u201cbecause plaintiffs telephone communications are \u2018wire communications,\u2019 the plaintiffs reasonable expectation of privacy is irrelevant to your determination of whether Wood acted wilfully,\u201d it would have been free to decide whether Wood acted wilfully when he allegedly intercepted appellant\u2019s telephone conversations, regardless of appellant\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy and Wood\u2019s knowledge of that expectation.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Appellees argue, however, that appellant invited this error by pleading interception of both oral and wire communications in his complaint. As appellant did not differentiate between oral and wire communications throughout the trial, contend appellees, \u201c[h]e cannot now assert that his claims were based exclusively on \u2018wire communications,\u2019 in order to argue (incorrectly) that an expectation of privacy was unnecessary.\u201d Notwithstanding appellees\u2019 misstatement of the law as to expectation of privacy, we are unpersuaded, in light of the evidence in the record, that appellant \u201cinvited\u201d this error by failing to differentiate its claims. As we explained <em>supra, </em>appellant clearly and distinctly objected to the circuit court\u2019s expectation of privacy instruction in accordance with Md.Rule 2-520(e). As this Court held in <em>Edmonds v. Murphy, </em>83 Md.App. 133, 178, 573 A.2d 853 (1990), <em>aff'd, </em>325 Md. 342, 601 A.2d 102 (1992) (citations omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-5\">The purpose of the relevant Maryland Rule is to allow the trial court to correct any inadvertent error or omission in the oral charge.... In this manner, the trial judge is afforded an opportunity to amend or supplement his charge if he deems an amendment necessary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">We believe that the trial judge was afforded such an opportunity and thus the purposes of Rule 2-520 were adequately served by the exception taken by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Appellees also argue that the trial court\u2019s instruction was a correct exposition of the law. Appellees quote this Court\u2019s prior unreported per curiam opinion in this case<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> in support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>of their contention that reasonable expectation of privacy is \u201cas much a component of protected wire communication as it is a component of protected oral communications.\u201d Moreover,' appellees assert that \u201c[n]ot every telephone conversation is one in which the speaker has a reasonable expectation of privacy.\u201d The federal court decisions cited by appellees as support, however, apply the expectation of privacy standard set forth in <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967) to telephone communications <em>not protected by the federal wiretap act.</em><footnotemark><em>32</em></footnotemark><em> </em>This Court\u2019s prior opinion seems also to misinterpret this distinction.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> <em>See Fearnow, </em>85 Md.App. 788, 790, September Term, No. 392, slip op. at 5 n. 2. Every case that we have discovered interpreting a telephone conversation under the federal wiretap act has held that the <em>Katz </em>reasonable expectation of privacy standard is inapplicable to wire communications. We can find no reason to interpret the Maryland act differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">Therefore, we hold that appellant\u2019s telephone conversations are wire communications under the Maryland Wiretap Act. Consequently, appellant\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy in those telephone conversations, and Wood\u2019s knowledge of. that expectation of privacy, should have been irrelevant to the jury\u2019s determination of Wood\u2019s wilfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The fourth jury instruction objected to by appellant was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>In the absence of evidence to the contrary, there is a presumption under Maryland law that public officers properly performed their duties and did what the law required of them. The determination in this case is to [sic] whether there is evidence to the contrary or not will be argued by the attorneys, and is a determination for you, the jury, to make. If you find that there is evidence to the contrary, then I point out to you that there is no presumption. If, on the other hand, you find that there is no evidence to the contrary, then I instruct you that, in that instance, there is a presumption under Maryland law that public officers properly performed their duties and did what the law required of them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">Appellant argues that, because the Maryland Wiretap Act imposes a duty on Wood to inquire into the police officers\u2019 authorization for wiretapping appellant\u2019s telephone, \u201c[a]ny presumption in [the police officers\u2019] favor improperly and prejudicially eliminated any duty or obligation on Wood\u201d to inquire into such authorization. In fact, argues appellant, the Maryland Wiretap Act \u201cvoids any presumption that law enforcement officers are presumed to act lawfully.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Appellees argue initially that appellant objected to the giving of this instruction, but did not refer to section 10-402(c)(l)(ii) in his objection and therefore cannot properly assert it before this Court. As to the merits of appellant\u2019s claim, appellees argue that the Maryland Wiretap Act \u201cimposes no \u2018duty of inquiry\u2019 \u201d which precludes this presumption.\u201d (emphasis omitted). Instead, argue appellees, the Act prohibits wilful violations, \u201cleaving it to the fact finder to determine whether the circumstances warranted inquiry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">We agree that appellant failed to object with specificity to the challenged jury instruction as required by Md.Rule 2-520(e). Appellant\u2019s objection was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>We also except to the giving of Defendant\u2019s Instruction No. 5 pertaining to the presumption that police officers are properly [sic] their duties. We believe that it\u2019s a confusing instruction because it\u2019s not applicable in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-4\">And we believe that\u2019s prejudicial, particularly since the Court denied our presumption that a person is presumed to know the law. We believe if you\u2019re going to give the presumption of police officers or public officials are [sic] properly performed their duties, that we should have been given the presumption instruction that you\u2019re presumed to know the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">As appellant failed to raise to the trial court section 10-402(c)(l)(ii) as a basis for his objection, that issue is not before us. Md.Rule 2-520(e); <em>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. v. McFarland, </em>21 Md.App. 501, 516, 319 A.2d 824 (1974). We shall, however, for the benefit and guidance of the trial court, discuss this issue. <em>See </em>Md.Rule 8-131 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">As we explained <em>supra, </em>the Maryland Wiretap Act does not impose a duty of inquiry on Wood to determine the lawfulness of the police department\u2019s wiretap activities. Therefore, an instruction that public officials are presumed to perform properly their duties cannot eliminate such a duty.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>It is clear that Maryland recognizes a rebuttable presumption that public officers properly perform their duties. <em>Beane v. McMullen, </em>265 Md. 585, 602, 291 A.2d 37 (1972) (\u201cIt is presumed that public officials will properly perform their duties.\u201d); <em>Lerch v. Maryland Port Auth., </em>240 Md. 438, 457, 214 A.2d 761 (1965) (\u201cThere is a strong presumption that public officers properly perform their duties.\u201d). It is also clear that Mowen and Ryder, as police officers, were public officials. Consequently, we hold that the circuit court\u2019s instruction that a presumption exists that \u201cpublic officers properly performed their duties and did what the law required of them,\u201d was a correct statement of the law and properly warranted by the evidence presented at trial. <em>Sergeant, </em>285 Md. at 193, 401 A.2d 651.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">We are similarly unpersuaded by the one-sentence assertion in appellant\u2019s brief that the Maryland Wiretap Act \u201cvoids any presumption that law enforcement officers are presumed to act lawfully.\u201d Again misinterpreting the exceptions set out in section l(M02(c), appellant contends that, because section 10-402(e)(l) requires a court order for the lawful interception of a wire or oral communication, there is no presumption that police officers properly perform their duties. As explained <em>supra, </em>the requirement of a court order is but one way to conduct a lawful interception of a wire or oral communication under the Act. Accordingly, we hold that the Maryland Wiretap Act does not void the presumption, afforded public officials in Maryland, that they perform their duties properly within the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The fifth jury instruction objected to by appellant was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHu\">The burden is on the plaintiff to prove by clear and convincing evidence each item or element of damages he claims was caused by the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">As this instruction relates to damages, and not liability, we elect not to reach the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in failing to give certain requested jury instructions. As discussed <em>supra, </em>issue I, to determine the propriety of denying a requested jury instruction, we must examine whether the requested jury instruction is a correct statement of the law, whether the law is applicable in light of the evidence presented to the jury, and whether the requested instruction was fairly covered by the instructions actually given. <em>Sergeant Co. v.

Under this rule of law, we shall examine the first two and the last of appellant\u2019s four requested jury instructions, ignoring the third, as it is a sufficiency of the evidence question and may not present itself again at a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Appellant requested a jury instruction that provided: \u201cA person is presumed to know the law.\u201d Appellant argues that because C&amp;P\u2019s business is primarily cable and wire communications, and it has employees specifically assigned to assist the police department, its employees \u201cshould be presumed to have the requisite knowledge and expertise in the State and Federal Wiretap Statutes. As such, Wood should be chargeable with knowledge of matters which he has the opportunity of knowing and should know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">We agree with appellees, however, that \u201c[a]n instruction that Wood was presumed to know the law would have conflicted with the Act\u2019s requirement of criminal wilfulness.\u201d Violation of the Maryland Wiretap Act requires wilfulness on behalf of the alleged violator. <em>See Earley, </em>846 F.Supp. at 453; <em>Benford, </em>649 F.Supp. at 10. Wilfulness is defined as \u201ceither an intentional violation or a reckless disregard of a known legal duty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[W]hen the law makes knowledge of some requirement an element of the offense, it is totally incorrect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>say that ignorance of such law is no excuse or that everyone is presumed to know such law.\u201d <em>United States v. Golitschek, </em>808 F.2d 195, 203 (2d Cir.1986); <em>accord United States v. Maniktala, </em>934 F.2d 25, 29 (2d Cir.1991) (\u201cthe \u2018combination of an instruction that the charged offenses require some knowledge of the law and an instruction that everyone is presumed to know the law was erroneous\u2019 \u201d (citing <em>Golitschnek, </em>808 F.2d at 201)).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">Appellant cites several cases in support of this requested jury instruction. All, however, are distinguishable in that none involved jury instructions or a claim requiring the element of wilfulness.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Appellant\u2019s next unrequited jury instruction provided: \u201cOwnership of the telephone equipment has no bearing on whether or not consent exists under Maryland\u2019s wiretap act for a lawful interception.\u201d Appellant argues that this instruction was proper because the Maryland Wiretap Act protects the privacy of communications regardless of the ownership of the telephone equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Ownership of the telephone equipment in the case <em>sub judice, </em>however, is relevant only to whether Wood acted wilfully in violation of the Maryland Wiretap Act. To this end, appellees introduced evidence at trial, without objection, that the Hagerstown Police Department owned the telephone equipment Wood was asked to assist in wiretapping. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>purpose of this evidence was to support the assertion that Wood believed the constricts of the C <em>&amp; </em>P company manual applied only to C &amp; P equipment, and therefore he was not intentionally and recklessly disregarding a \u201cknown\u201d legal duty when he allegedly assisted the police officers in wiretapping their own equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">As appellees did not present evidence of the Hagerstown Police Department\u2019s ownership of the telephone equipment to prove consent,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> appellant\u2019s requested jury instruction was properly denied as it was inapplicable in light of the evidence presented to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Appellant would next focus our attention on his requested jury instruction that provided: \u201cThere is no legally sufficient evidence that Fearnow\u2019s phone was consentually [sic] monitored under \u00a7 10-402(c)(2) of Maryland\u2019s wiretap act.\u201d As this instruction relates to sufficiency of the evidence and may not present itself at a new trial, we do not reach the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">Appellant also requested a jury instruction that provided: \u201cMaryland\u2019s wiretap act required a court order prior to the interception of Fearnow\u2019s phone.\u201d As explained <em>supra </em>part I, text accompanying notes 19-26, this is an incorrect statement of the law. Therefore, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s refusal to give the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in quashing certain trial subpoenas and sustaining objections to the use of interrogatory answers by appellees. As this is a discovery matter that may be resolved prior to any new trial, we do not reach the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">\n<em>Respondeat Superior</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The circuit court, by Memorandum and Order dated 1 September 1992, granted C&amp;P\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the issue of respondeat superior. In that opinion, the court found that Wood \u201cwas not acting within the scope of his employment with C &amp; P Telephone when he assisted the Hagerstown Police Department at police headquarters in implementing the wire-tap in question.\u201d The court explained that because Wood\u2019s alleged actions, if true, constituted a serious criminal violation, they \u201cwere not reasonably foreseeable or expectable in view of his duties.\u201d (citing Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 231 cmt. a (1958) (\u201cserious crimes are not only unexpectable but in general are in nature different from what servants in a lawful occupation are expected to do\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Appellant argues first that the circuit court erred in granting C &amp; P\u2019s motion for summary judgment on procedural grounds. Appellant contends that his Amended Complaint alleged that Wood was acting within the scope of his employment,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> and that appellees did not specifically deny that allegation in their answer. Therefore, asserts appellant, pursuant to Md.Rule 2-323(e),<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> that allegation is deemed admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">While it is true that appellees did not specifically deny appellant\u2019s scope of employment allegation, Md.Rule 2-323(e) provides that \u201c[ajverments in a pleading to which a responsive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>pleading is required ... are admitted <em>unless denied in the responsive pleading or covered by a general denial.\u201d </em>As appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss was granted as to Count I (invasion of privacy) and Count II (portrayal in a false light) of the Amended Complaint, appellant\u2019s only remaining claims at the time appellees answered the Amended Complaint were civil conspiracy and violation of the Maryland Wiretap Act. Therefore, because those claims were tort actions for money damages, appellees properly answered with a general denial. Maryland Rule 2-323(d) provides that \u201c[w]hen the action in any count is for ... tort and the claim for relief is for money only, a party may answer that count by a general denial of liability.\u201d Therefore, appellees\u2019 general denial was sufficient to refute <em>\u201cthe </em>whole substance\u201d of appellant\u2019s claim, <em>Maryland Trust Co. v. Poffenberger, </em>156 Md. 200, 204, 144 A. 249 (1928), and allowed appellees to \u201coffer any evidence tending to show that [appellant] has no right to recover.\u201d <em>Herrick v. Swomley, </em>56 Md. 439, 456 (1881).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Apparently unaware of the existence of Md.Rule 2-323(g),<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> appellant also suggests that scope of employment is an affirmative defense not raised, and thereby waived, by appellees. Maryland Rule 2-323(g) expressly itemizes affirmative defenses that must be specifically alleged, and scope of employment is not included among them. The two cases cited by appellant both involved affirmative defenses specifically listed in Rule 2-323(g). <em>See Gooch v. Maryland Mechanical Sys., Inc., </em>81 Md.App. 376, 567 A.2d 954, <em>cert. denied, </em>319 Md. 484, 573 A.2d 807 (1990) (qualified privilege); <em>Ocean Plaza Joint Venture v. Crouse Constr. Co., </em>62 Md.App. 435, 490 A.2d 252, <em>cert. granted, </em>304 Md. 163, 497 A.2d 1163, <em>dismissed by </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number><em>counsel </em>(1985) (release and waiver). In contrast, scope of employment is recognized as a fundamental element of a respondeat superior claim that must be affirmatively plead and proved by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Appellant next argues that C &amp; P acted \u201cdeceptively\u201d when it raised the issue of scope of employment in a motion for summary judgment, after the close of discovery. Appellant contends that \u201cC &amp; P had a duty under the Maryland Rules to assert [scope of employment] in its answer to the complaint and also to raise the issue immediately after Wood testified in his deposition that the acts were within the scope of his duties.\u201d As we explained <em>supra, </em>appellees were not required to allege specifically scope of employment (or lack thereof) in their Answer. Moreover, we find no reason to require C <em>&amp; </em>P to raise this issue before the close of discovery. There is no evidence in the record that appellant was \u201cdeceived\u201d by C &amp; P\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the issue of scope of employment. Indeed, we are unable to empathize with appellant\u2019s charge of \u201cdeception\u201d when it is obvious from the record that appellant took deposition discovery on the issue of scope of employment. Wood\u2019s deposition states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-6\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: You were an employee of the C <em>&amp; </em>P Telephone Company at the time, weren\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-7\">[WOOD]: I was an employee of the C <em>&amp; </em>P Telephone Company, yes, sir, responding to a request of the Hagerstown Police Department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-8\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: Okay, and you were responding as a C &amp; P Telephone Company employee, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-9\">[WOOD]: Yes, I was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-10\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: You considered this to be part of your job?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>[WOOD]: Yes, I did.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">We find appellant\u2019s challenge on the merits to be equally unpersuasive. Appellant contends (i) that, because Wood testified that he considered the technical assistance he rendered to the police department to be part of his job, summary judgment on the issue of scope of employment was inappropriate and (ii) that the circuit court improperly ruled that criminal acts are outside the scope of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The standard of appellate review of a trial court\u2019s grant of a motion for summary judgment is whether the trial court was \u201clegally correct.\u201d <em>Heat &amp; Power Corp. v. Air Prods. &amp; Chems., Inc., </em>320 Md. 584, 591, 578 A.2d 1202 (1990). When making a determination on summary judgment, a trial court makes no findings of fact. <em>King v. Bankerd, </em>303 Md. 98, 111, 492 A.2d 608 (1985). Rather, the court decides whether a genuine issue of material fact exists to prevent the entry of summary judgment. <em>Beatty v. Trailmaster Prods., Inc., </em>330 Md. 726, 737, 625 A.2d 1005 (1993); <em>see also Bond v. NIBCO, Inc., </em>96 Md.App. 127, 135, 623 A.2d 731 (1993); Md.Rule 2-501(e). Under this standard, therefore, we review the trial court\u2019s ruling as a matter of law. <em>Beatty, </em>330 Md. at 737, 625 A.2d 1005.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Our eases recognize that a grant of summary judgment is appropriate only where a two-fold test is met. <em>Gross v. Sussex, Inc., </em>332 Md. 247, 255, 630 A.2d 1156 (1993); <em>Castiglione v. Johns Hopkins Hosp., </em>69 Md.App. 325, 332, 517 A.2d 786 (1986). The movant for summary judgment must (i) clearly demonstrate the absence of any genuine issue of material fact, and (ii) demonstrate that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Castiglione, </em>69 Md.App. at 332, 517 A2d 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">To satisfy the first part of this test, the moving party must present the material facts necessary to obtain judgment and demonstrate that there is no dispute as to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>of those facts. <em>Bond, </em>96 Md.App. at 136, 623 A.2d 721. A material fact is one that will \u201csomehow affect the outcome of the case.\u201d <em>King, </em>303 Md. at 111, 492 A.2d 608. It is the burden of the movant to \u201cidentify the portions of the record that \u2018demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bond, </em>96 Md.App. at 136, 623 A.2d 721 (quoting <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2553, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">Once the movant makes this showing, the burden shifts to the non-moving party to identify \u201cwith particularity the material facts that are disputed.\u201d Md.Rule 2-501(b). Neither general allegations of facts in dispute nor a mere scintilla of evidence will suffice to support the non-movant\u2019s position, <em>Lynx, Inc. v. Ordnance Prods., Inc., </em>273 Md. 1, 7-8, 327 A.2d 502 (1974); <em>Seaboard Surety Co. v. Richard F. Kline, Inc., </em>91 Md.App. 236, 243-45, 603 A.2d 1357 (1992); there must be evidence upon which the jury could reasonably find for the non-moving party. <em>Beatty, </em>330 Md. at 738, 625 A.2d 1005 (citing <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) (\u201cmere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties \u25a0will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no <em>genuine </em>issue of <em>material </em>fact\u201d) (emphasis in original)). In other words, the opposing party \u201c \u2018must do more than simply show there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 1356, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the court must consider the motion and response submitted by the parties in a light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Id. </em>at 737, 625 A.2d 1005. Thus, summary judgment is inappropriate where the evidence is susceptible to more than one inference. <em>Coffey v. Derby Steel Company, Inc., </em>291 Md. 241, 246, 434 A.2d 564 (1981). Furthermore, the non-moving party \u201c \u2018is to be given the benefit of all reasonable doubts in deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>mining whether a genuine issue exists.\u2019 \u201d <em>Beatty, </em>330 Md. at 739, 625 A.2d 1005 (quoting Charles Alan Wright, <em>The Law of the Federal Courts </em>\u00a7 99, at 666-67 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the facts of the case <em>sub judice </em>to consider the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The circuit court explained that \u201cWood\u2019s alleged actions in this case were arguably violative of the applicable wiretap statute, a serious crime.\u201d Therefore, \u201c[u]nder acceptable agency law, \u2018serious crimes are not only unexpectable but in general are in nature different from what servants in a lawful occupation are expected to do.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Consequently, assuming Wood\u2019s intent, in part, to serve C <em>&amp; </em>P\u2019s interests, \u201cthe evidence before [the] court [was] not legally sufficient to form the basis for a jury finding that Wood\u2019s actions were within the scope of his employment with C &amp; P Telephone.\u201d We agree with the circuit court that Wood\u2019s actions, if violative of the Maryland Wiretap Act, were not within the scope of his employment with C <em>&amp; </em>P.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">As explained in <em>Sheets v.

Wood was contacted at home by Ryder after working hours. Wood was told that his assistance was needed with a problem at police headquarters, and was advised that a wiretap was required. When he arrived at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>police headquarters, Wood was asked by Ryder and Mowen to look at the telephone terminal board in the basement and identify the binding posts associated with an internal extension number. Unable to identify the specified binding posts on the terminal in the basement, Wood went to a second, redundant terminal board on the third floor of the police building. Once Wood identified the extension number, he \u201chooked up\u201d a tape recorder to the binding post.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">Importantly, Wood did not follow established C &amp; P procedures and policy for instituting a wiretap; he received no prior authority from the C <em>&amp; </em>P security office. Indeed, there is evidence in the record that it was Wood\u2019s friendship with Ryder and Mowen that motivated him to assist in the alleged illegal wiretap. The Maryland Wiretap Act and the C &amp; P company manual both prohibit the <em>unauthorized </em>interception of wire or oral communications. Wood, however, made no inquiry into Ryder and Mowen\u2019s authorization to wiretap appellant\u2019s telephone extension. Wood\u2019s actions, if violative of the Maryland Wiretap Act, constituted a \u201cserious crime\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> as that term is used in the Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 231. C &amp; P, moreover, could not reasonably expect that Wood, while responding to a call from the Hagerstown Police Department, would secretly and wilfully wiretap a telephone extension without proper authorization. Consequently, he was not \u201cadvancing [C &amp; P\u2019s] interests in doing what he did at the time he did it,\u201d <em>Henderson, </em>78 Md.App. at 132, 552 A.2d 935; <em>see Nazareth, </em>467 So.2d at 1078, and therefore acted outside the scope of his employment with C &amp; P. <em>See, e.g., United States v.

Wood explained merely that, in going to the police department building, he \u201cwas an employee of the C &amp; P Telephone Company ... responding to a request of the Hagerstown Police Department.\u201d His conduct once there extended outside the scope of that employment, however, when he allegedly participated in the illegal wiretapping of appellant\u2019s telephone extension. We agree with the circuit court that this deposition testimony, by itself, is legally insufficient to overcome appellant\u2019s burden to identify \"with particularity the material facts that are in dispute.

That is the full extent of appellant\u2019s argument. With equal concision, we hold that the circuit court was correct in finding no such conflict of interest, a decision best left to the discretion of the trial court. <em>Peat, Marwick, Mitchell &amp; Co. v.

Therefore, we agree with the circuit court that any conflict of interest that may have occurred was consented to by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>VI., VIL, VIII. &amp; IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">We do not reach these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">X.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Finally, appellant contends that the circuit court \u201cdemonstrated partiality to [appellees] by issuing contradictory opinions, illogical rulings and refusing to obey\u201d a prior ruling of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">In Maryland, there is a strong presumption that judges are impartial participants in the legal process. <em>Jefferson-El v. State, </em>330 Md. 99, 107, 622 A.2d 737 (1993); <em>Boyd v.

Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Tel. Co. et al., </em>104 Md.App. at 13, 655 A.2d at 7 (No. 495, September Term 1994). Appellee, Donald K. Wood, filed a motion for reconsideration on 8 February 1995. Appellant, Leon C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>Fearnow, filed a motion for reconsideration on 9 February 1995. Having pleased no one entirely, we approached the motions with a certain ambivalence.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Appellee\u2019s motion for reconsideration argued that we had overlooked his previously raised points that the circuit court erred in denying his motion for judgment at the close of all the evidence for two reasons: (1) there was insufficient evidence, as a matter of law, that any telephone conversations of appellant were intercepted by appellee; and (2) there was insufficient evidence, as a matter of law, that appellee acted wilfully.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As we find no merit in appellee\u2019s arguments for reconsideration, his motion is hereby denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration, as we perceive it, argued, among other things, that this Court\u2019s affirmance of the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of C &amp; P on the issue of respondeat superior was incorrect. Moreover, appellant contended that several issues, not addressed by our prior opinion, must be addressed in order to avoid a \u201cmultiplicity of appeals and unnecessary expense.\u201d These \u201cunaddressed\u201d issues included: (1) \u201c[d]id the trial court err in quashing certain trial subpoenas and sustaining objections to the use of interrogatory answers by Wood and C &amp; P;\u201d (2) \u201c[d]id the trial court err in granting summary judgment against the plaintiff on the issue of punitive damages by requiring proof of actual malice;\u201d \u2022 (3) \u201c[d]id the trial court err in granting summary judgment against Fearnow on his claim \u2022 for damages for reputational injury and resultant emotional distress;\u201d (4) \u201c[d]id the trial court err in denying the plaintiff additional discovery while permitting additional discovery to be reopened by the defendants;\u201d and (5) \u201c[d]id the trial court err in ruling as a matter of law that no conspiracy existed.\u201d We find limited merit in appellant\u2019s arguments as to questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>numbered 2 and 3, <em>supra. </em>We briefly explain those merits.

[and] provides that any person whose communication is intercepted in violation of the act shall have a cause of action against <em>any person </em>who violates the act and <em>be entitled </em>to recover punitive damages.\u201d (Emphasis in the original.) Citing <em>Franklin Square Hosp. v. Laubach, </em>318 Md. 615, 569 A.2d 693 (1990), appellant contended that because \u201c[t]here is no mention of malice in the act nor [sic] in the legislative history of the act,\u201d proof of a violation of the Act should entitle appellant to submit the issue of punitive damages to the jury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, appellant drew our attention to the case of <em>Citron v. Citron, </em>539 F.Supp. 621, 624 (S.D.N.Y.1982), <em>aff'd, </em>722 F.2d 14 (2d Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>466 U.S. 973, 104 S.Ct. 2350, 80 L.Ed.2d 823 (1984), in which the federal district court held that \u201cpunitive damages must be available once liability has been established.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 624 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Appellee, however, contended in his brief that \u201c[t]he legislative history of the federal law, with civil liability language virtually identical to that of the [Maryland] Act, explicitly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>provides that proof of malice is a prerequisite for punitive damages.\u201d Without mention of appellant\u2019s discussion of <em>Citron, supra, </em>appellee asserted that \u201c[n]early every federal court which has ruled on the issue has so held.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) Therefore, concluded appellee, we \u201cshould be guided by the weight of federal authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Section l(M10(a) of the Maryland Wiretap Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-5\">Any person whose wire, oral, or electronic communication is intercepted, disclosed, or used in violation of this subtitle shall have a civil cause of action against any person who intercepts, discloses, or uses, or procures any other person to intercept, disclose, or use the communications, and be entitled to recover from any person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">(1) Actual damages but not less than liquidated damages computed at the rate of $100 a day for each day of violation or $1,000, whichever is higher;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-7\">(2) Punitive damages; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-8\">(3) A reasonable attorney\u2019s fee and other litigation costs reasonably incurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">Md.Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc. \u00a7 10-410(a) (1989 Replacement Volume). Although the legislative history of the Act is silent as to whether a plaintiff must prove malice to sustain a punitive damages award, there are two Maryland Court of Appeals cases that tangentially we find instructive on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">The first case is <em>Franklin Square Hosp. v. Laubach, </em>318 Md. 615, 569 A.2d 693 (1990). In that case, Timothy Laubach and Nancy Laubach, his wife, brought an action against Franklin Square Hospital (Hospital) and others. The action involved the medical treatment of the pregnant Mrs. Laubach, the death of her brain damaged daughter, and the disclosure of \u201cfetal heart monitoring tracings.\u201d The complaint alleged that the Hospital had violated the dictates of section 4-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>302(b)(1)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the Health-General Article and prayed for compensatory and punitive damages pursuant to section 4-302(d)(2).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The jury found for the Laubachs against the Hospital and awarded $300,000 in actual damages and $700,-000 in punitive damages. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed, <em>Laubach v. Franklin Square Hosp., </em>79 Md.App. 203, 556 A.2d 682 (1989), <em>aff'd, </em>318 Md. 615, 569 A.2d 693 (1990), and the Court of Appeals limited its review to the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-5\">Whether malice is a prerequisite to recovery of punitive damages under Md.Health-Gen.Code Ann. (\u201cHG\u201d) \u00a7 4-302.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ah\">In its search for the answer to this question, the Court went \u201chunting the ghost of legislative intent.\u201d <em>Franklin Square Hosp., </em>318 Md. at 619, 569 A.2d 693. Stating that \u201c[t]he obvious purpose of the statute is to compel disclosure of medical records under prescribed circumstances, and to attain uniformity by having all facilities bound by the same rules,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 622, 569 A.2d 693, the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\">Section 4-302(d)(2) declares that if the facility does not disclose a medical record as required, it <em>\u201cis </em>liable for punitive damages.\u201d (emphasis added). That is, the issue of punitive damages goes to the jury; whether to award those damages is within the jury\u2019s discretion. Nowhere in the language of the statute or in its available legislative history is there any indication that the Legislature intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>impress on the liability for punitive damages a requirement of proof of malice, actual or implied.... To achieve [the uniform disclosure of medical records under prescribed circumstances], no more than a mere refusal to disclose within a reasonable time, upon proper request, whether done maliciously or not, results in liability for punitive damages in addition to actual damages. This is a case where the language of the statute is clearly consistent with its apparent purpose, and not productive of any absurd result. In other words, when the plain language in which the law is couched is considered in the context of the legislative purpose, the legislative intent shines bright and clear.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 622-23, 569 A.2d 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the plain language of section 10-410(a) of the Maryland Wiretap Act is very similar to that of former section 4-302(d)(2) of the Health-General Article. Both sections are devoid of any explicit requirement that the plaintiff prove malice to sustain an award of punitive damages. Also, both sections are similarly couched in the conjunctive, providing for actual damages <em>and </em>punitive damages. Their difference, however, lies in the paucity of legislative history relevant to the Maryland Wiretap Act. Absent such \u201cbright and clear\u201d legislative intent as was gleaned by Judge Orth in <em>Franklin Square Hosp., </em>we are unpersuaded in this case to hold that a mere violation of the Maryland Wiretap Act, without a showing of malice, will sustain an award for punitive damages.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>A more recent and persuasive discussion of the appropriate analytical standard for ascertaining the availability of punitive damages in tort actions is found in <em>Ellerin v. Fairfax Sav., FSB, </em>337 Md. 216, 652 A.2d 1117 (1995).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In that case, Fairfax Savings, FSB (Fairfax) filed an action against Charles Ellerin, Louis Seidel, and their wives as personal guarantors of a loan issued by Fairfax and defaulted on by Sherwood Square Associates (of which Ellerin and Seidel were general partners). The guarantors filed counterclaims setting forth tort causes of action for fraud and deceit based on their allegation that Fairfax had obtained post-completion guarantees by fraud. The guarantors demanded $6,000,000 in compensatory damages and $10,000,000 in punitive damages for the fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">After a first trial on the merits, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Fairfax. The Court of Special Appeals reversed and granted a new trial, and the Court of Appeals denied a petition for a writ of certiorari. The second trial ended in a hung jury and the case was tried for a third time, with the liability phase of the trial tried separately from the damages phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">As to liability, the jury found in favor of the guarantors on the fraud count and in favor of Fairfax on the balance due on the loans. At the damages phase, the court told the jury that, while it need not award punitive damages, it could award punitive damages in its discretion. The trial court refused Fairfax\u2019s request that the court instruct the jury with respect to the malice required for an award of punitive damages. The court concluded that such an instruction was unnecessary in light of the jury\u2019s verdict on liability. \u201cIn the court\u2019s view, if a plaintiff had established the elements of the tort action, he had necessarily established malice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 226. The jury awarded both compensatory and punitive damages in the fraud <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>action. On appeal, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the compensatory award and vacated the punitive award, \u201cholding that the trial court should have instructed the jury concerning the malice necessary to support a punitive damages award.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Fairfax Sav., FSB v. Ellerin, </em>94 Md.App. 685, 695-96, 619 A.2d 141 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">The Court of Appeals, in its discussion of the appropriate standard for an award of punitive damages, explained that, \u201cwith regard to most types of tort actions, Maryland law has limited the availability of punitive damages to situations in which the defendant\u2019s conduct is characterized by knowing and deliberate wrongdoing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>337 Md. at 228, 652 A.2d 1117 (citing <em>Adams v. Coates, </em>331 Md. 1, 13, 626 A.2d 36 (1993); <em>Komomik v. Sparks, </em>331 Md. 720, 725, 629 A.2d 721 (1993); <em>Owens-Illinois v. Zenobia, </em>325 Md. 420, 454, 601 A.2d 633 (1992); <em>Philadelphia, Wilmington &amp; Baltimore R.R. Co. v. Hoeflich, </em>62 Md. 300, 307 (1884)).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Thus, the Court deemed it \u201cappropriate to examine the elements of the tort of fraud or deceit for the purpose of determining to what extent the tort inherently involves the state of mind and conduct which is ordinarily required for the availability of punitive damages.\u201d <em>Ellerin, </em>337 Md. at 229, 652 A.2d 1117. The Court acknowledged the two different mental states that are sufficient to commit the tort of fraud or deceit\u2014intentional false representations and reckless disregard for the truth\u2014and held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-6\">the elements of the tort of fraud or deceit in Maryland, where the tort is committed by a defendant who knows that his representation is false, include the type of deliberate wrongdoing and evil motive that has traditionally justified the award of punitive damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-7\">On the other hand, when a particular fraud or deceit action is based on the alternative form of the knowledge element, namely a \u201creckless disregard\u201d as to the truth of the representation, the traditional basis for the allowability of punitive damages is not present.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 235, 652 A.2d 1117 (footnote omitted). Therefore, concluded the Court, \u201creckless disregard\u201d or \u201creckless indifference\u201d concerning the truth of the representation \u201cfalls short of the mens rea which is required to support an award of punitive damages.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">The reasoning of <em>Ellerin </em>is directly applicable to the case <em>sub judice. </em>As we explained in our prior opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-5\">To establish liability under the Maryland Wiretap Act, appellant must prove that Wood acted wilfully. The term \u201cwilfully\u201d means \u201cmore than intentional or voluntary. It denotes either <em>an intentional violation or a reckless disregard of a known legal duty. </em>Indeed, as the federal district court explained in <em>Earley, </em>the violator must know that what he or she is doing is illegal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-6\"><em>Fearnow, </em>104 Md.App. at 24, 655 A.2d at 12 (citations omitted; footnote omitted); <em>see also Hawes v. Carberry, </em>103 Md.App. 214, 653 A.2d 479 (1995) (citing <em>Fearnow, </em>swpra). The mens rea which is required to violate the Maryland Wiretap Act is remarkably similar to that required to commit the tort of fraud or deceit as explained in <em>Ellerin, supra. </em>As in <em>Ellerin, </em>there are two mental states that are sufficient to violate the Act\u2014an intentional violation or a reckless disregard of a known legal duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Thus we apply the Court of Appeals\u2019 reasoning in <em>Ellerin </em>to the case <em>sub judice </em>and reach a similar conclusion. The mens rea required to violate the Maryland Wiretap Act, where the violation is committed by a defendant who knows that he is violating the Act, includes the type of deliberate wrongdoing and evil motive that has traditionally justified the award of punitive damages. On the other hand, when a particular violation of the Act is based on the alternative form of mens rea, namely a \u201creckless disregard\u201d as to a known legal duty, the traditional basis for the allowability of punitive damages, i.e. malice, is not present. <em>See Ellerin, </em>337 Md. at 235, 652 A.2d 1117.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">Our conclusion here is also in accord with the weight of federal authority interpreting the punitive damages provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>of the federal wiretap statute.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We agree with appellee\u2019s contention that the legislative history of the federal act \u201cexplicitly provides that proof of malice is a prerequisite for punitive damages.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Bess v. Bess, </em>929 F.2d 1332, 1335 (8th Cir.1991); <em>Jacobson v. Rose, </em>592 F.2d 515, 520 (9th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>442 U.S. 930, 99 S.Ct. 2861, 61 L.Ed.2d 298 (1979); <em>Biton v. Menda, </em>812 F.Supp. 283, 285 (D.Puerto Rico 1993). This is not, however, inconsistent with our discussion and application of <em>Ellerin, supra. </em>Where a defendant knowingly and intentionally violates the federal act, such conduct would be considered \u201cmalicious\u201d so as to justify a punitive damages award pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2520(a). <em>Cf. Ellerin, </em>337 Md. at 235, 652 A.2d 1117. On the other hand, where a violator of the federal wiretap statute acts with a \u201creckless disregard\u201d of a known legal duty, the requisite \u201cwanton, reckless, and malicious\u201d state of mind for allowability of punitive damages is not present.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Cf. id.; e.g., Bess, </em>929 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>F.2d at 1335 (where defendant testified that he installed the tape recorder out of a belief that the phone messages left for him at the marital residence were being withheld, conduct not sufficient to warrant punitive damages).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">In the instant case, we agree with the circuit court that, at the time appellee\u2019s summary judgment motion as to punitive damages was granted (27 October 1992), there was insufficient evidence to support the conclusion that appellee intentionally and deliberately, i.e. maliciously, violated the Maryland Wiretap Act. Therefore, to the extent the circuit court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on this issue retains any vitality at the new trial, we affirm the court\u2019s decision in that regard. We point out for the circuit court, however, in light of the Court of Appeals\u2019s recent decision in <em>Ellerin, </em>that its prior pronouncement that \u201ca showing of willfulness is not sufficient to support an award of punitive damages under the statute\u201d may not necessarily remain true if additional relevant facts are adduced. As we discussed <em>supra, </em>our bifurcated definition of wilfulness under the Act allows for, in some instances, a showing of wilfulness to be sufficient to warrant an award of punitive damages under the Maryland Wiretap Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>\n<em>Reputational Damages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">In its memorandum and order on appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment concerning appellant\u2019s claim for reputational damages, the circuit court found that appellant was not entitled to reputational damages in the instant case for two reasons: 1) \u201cthere is no duty imposed on anyone by the wiretap act to safeguard against the publication by others of the circumstances surrounding an alleged wiretap;\u201d and 2) \u201cas a police officer, [appellant] had no protectable interest in preventing publications about the suspicions which prompted the tape recorder incident.\u201d We shall discuss each reason in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The Maryland Wiretap Act explicitly prohibits three forms of conduct: 1) the wilful interception of any wire, oral, or electronic communication; 2) the wilful disclosure of the contents of any wire, oral, or electronic communication; and 3) the wilful use of the contents of any wire, oral, or electronic conversation. Md.Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc. \u00a7 10-402(a). Appellant, however, does not claim that his reputation was injured by the interception, disclosure, or use of his wire communications. Instead, he claims that the discovery of the tape recorder incident at the Hagerstown Police Department led to disclosure in the press and elsewhere of the circumstances that <em>prompted </em>the police to wiretap his telephone extension. As explained by the circuit court, because \u201cthe wiretap law imposes no duty to safeguard against disclosing police suspicions about [appellant], and any resulting investigation, [appellant\u2019s] claim for injury to reputation and related emotional distress\u201d cannot be sustained under the guise of actual damages proximately caused by a violation of the Maryland Wiretap Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Appellant\u2019s claim for reputational damages similarly fails under the tort theory of defamation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> To recover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>for defamation, a plaintiff must ordinarily establish that the defendant made a defamatory statement to a third person; the statement was false; the defendant was legally at fault for making the statement; and, the plaintiff thereby suffered harm. <em>Rosenberg v. Helinski, </em>328 Md. 664, 675, 616 A.2d 866 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 113 S.Ct. 3041, 125 L.Ed.2d 727 (1993); <em>Kairys v. Douglas Stereo Inc., </em>83 Md.App. 667, 678-79, 577 A.2d 386 (1990). Where the plaintiff in a defamation action is a \u201cpublic figure,\u201d he or she must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the allegedly false defamatory publication was made with \u201cactual malice.\u201d <em>Capital-Gazette Newspapers, Inc. v. Stack, </em>293 Md. 528, 540, 445 A.2d 1038 (citing <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964)), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 989, 103 S.Ct. 344, 74 L.Ed.2d 384 (1982). Maryland law affords a \u201cqualified privilege,\u201d however, to \u201cany person who makes an oral, written or printed report about matters involving violation of the law.\u201d <em>Seymour v. A.S. Abell Co., </em>557 F.Supp. 951, 955 (D.Md.1983) (applying Maryland law).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">We agree with the circuit court that <em>Seymour v. A.S. Abell Co., </em>557 F.Supp. 951 (D.Md.1983) is persuasive in disposing of appellant\u2019s claim for reputational damages, couched, as it was, as a defamation action. In <em>Seymour, </em>a police officer claimed he had been defamed by publications that disclosed that he had been investigated within the police department. In granting summary judgment to the department, the federal district court explained that Maryland law affords a broad privilege that protects publishing, or causing the publication, of substantially accurate reports about police investigatory activity. <em>Id. </em>at 955. The court emphasized that the privilege applies to non-media defendants as well as to media defendants, and encompasses virtually all police investigatory activity, whether it ultimately proves to be well-founded or not:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>[T]he policy behind the privilege [to publish matters involving alleged violation of law] is that the public\u2019s strong interest in receiving information about matters involving violation of the law outweighs the interest of the subjects of defamatory statements at least where the defamatory statements are not made with actual malice. <em>See Cowley v. Pulsifer, </em>137 Mass. 392, 394 (1884) (Holmes, J.). Since the public\u2019s interest in receiving the information is just as strong whether the purveyor of the information is a newspaper or some other source, the Court holds that the Maryland privilege applies to all persons who pass on information about matters involving violation of the law____ Although no formal criminal charges were ever filed, the police investigation and administrative charges unquestionably constitute \u201cmatters involving violation of the law.\u201d <em>Indeed, most, if not all, police activity concerns matters involving the violation of the law.

Appellant also raised the following issues in his reply brief: (1) the juiy should have been instructed that appellees could be civilly liable to appellant under the Maryland Wiretap Act for \u201cendeavoring to intercept\u201d his communications, even in the absence of proof that any of his communications actually were \"intercepted, disclosed or used\u201d by appellees; and (2) the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury that civil liability could be based on \u201cendeavoring to intercept\u201d indicated partiality toward appellees. Neither of these arguments, however, were raised in appellant\u2019s initial brief. As explained in <em>Federal Land Bank, Inc. v.

We think that the reply brief must be limited to responding to the points and issues raised in the appellee\u2019s brief.... To allow new issues or claims to be injected into the appeal by a reply brief would work a fundamental injustice upon the appellee, who would then have no opportunity to respond in writing to the new questions raised by the appellant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AS\">A fair reading of the briefs submitted by appellant indicates that appellant did more in his reply brief than reply to appellees\u2019 brief. Indeed, as appellees suggest in their Motion to Strike Arguments First Raised in Appellant\u2019s Reply Brief Regarding Civil Liability for \u201cEndeavoring to Intercept\u201d Without Proof of Actual Interception: \"While [appellant] unquestionably had the right to respond to appellees\u2019 contention that he had failed to prove \u2018interception,\u2019 he cannot properly do so by raising a new attack on the \u2018interception\u2019 requirement in the jury instructions, which he failed to raise as an original appeal point.\u201d We agree with appellees that the two issues stated <em>supra </em>were raised for the first time by appellant in his reply brief, and therefore the motion to strike those arguments on pages six and thirteen of the reply brief pertaining to such issues is granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b42-6\">.

Such evidence may preclude Wood from claiming as a defense one of the exceptions, i.e., section 10-402(c)(l) or (2). The court\u2019s instruction that appellant was not \"guilty of any criminal act\u201d does not, however, necessarily preclude the application of section 10-402(c)(2). That section provides that it is lawful, with one-party consent, to intercept wire or oral communications in a criminal investigation of one of the enumerated crimes in order to obtain evidence pertaining to that crime. It does not, however, require the target of the investigation to have <em>actually </em>been adjudged guilty of committing one of those crimes.

We carefully point out, however, that our holding here does not foreclose on the long line of cases that establish vicarious liability on behalf of a principal that ratifies the agent\u2019s conduct. <em>See Smith v.

This issue was raised by appellant in his brief in the context of the circuit court's grant of appellee\u2019s summary judgment motion. Therefore, we shall review, as a matter of law, the need to prove malice to sustain an award of punitive damages. <em>Franklin Square Hosp. v.

We note a difference, albeit inconsequential, between the Maryland Wiretap Act and its federal counterpart in the wording of their respective punitive damages provisions. While the Maryland Act provides for \u201cpunitive damages,\u201d Md.Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc. \u00a7 10-410(a), section 2520(b)(2) of the federal act provides for \u201cpunitive damages <em>in appropriate cases.\" </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2520(b)(2) (1988) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b90-5\">. 1968 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2196 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-6\">Recovery [under the federal act] shall include: (a) actual damages, but not less than liquidated damages at the rate of $100 a day for each day of violation or $1,000, whichever is higher, (b) <em>punitive damages, where malice is shown, </em>and (c) a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee and other litigation costs reasonable incurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">S.Rep.

Appellant draws our attention to the case of <em>Citron v. Citron, </em>539 F.Supp. 621 (S.D.N.Y.1982), <em>aff'd, </em>722 F.2d 14 (2d Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>466 U.S. 973, 104 S.Ct. 2350, 80 L.Ed.2d 823 (1984), ignored by appellee in his brief, to support appellant\u2019s contention that a mere violation of the Maryland Wiretap Act, without proving malice, is sufficient to submit the issue of punitive damages to the jury. In <em>Citron, </em>the federal district court, interpreting the federal wiretap act, held: \"We reject the rule set forth in <em>Jacobson v. Rose </em>that an award of punitive damages must be supported by a stronger showing than necessary for compensatory damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 624 n. 5 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"A3l\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>We note, however, that the federal act differs from the Maryland Act in that it provides civil sanctions <em>only </em>for actions taken in violation of its penal provisions. <em>Kratz v. Kratz, </em>477 F.Supp. 463, 483 (E.D.Pa. 1979). The <em>Citron </em>court apparently relied on this distinction in making its ruling: \u201cIf, as this Circuit has ruled, only criminal conduct is covered by the statute, it follows that punitive damages must be available once liability has been established.\u201d <em>Citron, </em>539 F.Supp. at 624 n. 5 (citing <em>Kratz, </em>supra).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">In 1986, however, the punitive damages language of the federal wiretap statute was amended to allow for \"punitive damages in appropriate cases.\u201d It is for this reason perhaps that we have been unable to discover any subsequent case that reached the same conclusion as <em>Citron. </em>Therefore, as the Maryland and federal wiretap statutes are worded differently in this regard, we elect not to adopt the reasoning set forth by the <em>Citron </em>court and, instead, apply the bifurcated approach set forth in <em>Ellerin, supra, </em>to determine the appropriate standard for the availability of punitive damages under the Maryland Wiretap Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b92-7\">. Appellant, throughout this case, has never asserted a defamation cause of action. The discussion of reputational damages in the context of defamation was initiated by appellee in its motion for summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>judgment filed 25 March 1993, and perhaps unnecessarily carried forward by the circuit court in its explanation for the grant of that motion. We shall discuss this alternative characterization of appellant\u2019s reputational damages claim, however, for the purpose of closure.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
