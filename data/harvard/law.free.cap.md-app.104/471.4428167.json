The MDE issued a Final Determination recommending issuance of a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit to Villa Julie College, Inc. (Villa Julie) for discharge of waste water effluent into an unnamed, intermittent stream on Villa Julie property that also crosses property owned by Northwest located downstream. Northwest challenged the MDE\u2019s Final Determination and a hearing was held before Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Susan S. Wagner of the Office of Administrative Hearings. ALJ Wagner issued a Recommended Decision affirming the MDE\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>Final Determination, with certain modifications. Northwest filed exceptions to ALJ Wagner\u2019s Recommended Decision and, after a hearing before the Final Decision Maker for the MDE, the MDE issued its Final Decision and Order affirming in part and rejecting in part ALJ Wagner\u2019s Recommended Decision. Northwest appealed the MDE\u2019s Final Decision and Order to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. The circuit court affirmed the MDE\u2019s Final Decision and Order and dismissed Northwest\u2019s appeal. Northwest filed a timely appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">\n<em>ISSUES</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">I.

In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>early 1990, Villa Julie learned that its septic system<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> had failed. Specifically, Villa Julie\u2019s and the adjacent Sisters\u2019s property have a very high water table (indeed, the septic system is in the water table) and clay soils. Percolation tests performed on the properties indicated that the percolation levels do not meet the minimum criteria for a filter drain system by Baltimore County standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">As there are no public sewage facilities available in the Greenspring Valley,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Villa Julie has been forced to pump its excess waste water into storage tanks and haul it away by truck on a daily basis. According to Gene Neff, Director of Public Works for Baltimore County, however, this \u201cpump and haul\u201d method is only permitted in Baltimore County as a short-term solution to waste water disposal problems.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Therefore, Villa Julie engaged the services of Maryland Environ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>mental Services, Inc. (MES)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to assist in solving its sewage problems. MES completed an initial evaluation of Villa Julie\u2019s existing septic system. Dane Sherman Bauer, MES\u2019s project manager for the Villa Julie project, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-4\">We went to Baltimore County and got\u2014and from the college and got whatever was available in the way of as-built drawings [of the existing septic system] to begin with. It had been modified at least once that we could find. We assessed that it was approximately 10,000 gallons we felt in size, although some of the preliminary plans showed it to be about 6,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-5\">We examined the area where the tile fields were to try to ascertain exactly where the tile fields were as compared to the drawing. We found that the system was failing immediately upon examining it, failing in the sense that there was water coming out of the ground\u2014waste water coming out of the ground around the whole area where the tile fields were. We did some early-on flow determinations to see how much water was actually going into these systems as compared to the design and found that they were significantly hydraulically overloaded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">MES investigated other forms of waste water treatment on the Villa Julie property. First, the possibility of installing another septic system was examined. MES recommended against the installation of another septic system because \u201cthe entire property was generally subject to high water table and ... the soil conditions were silt, loam with heavy clay content <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>and perk [sic] tests failed throughout.\u201d Second, MES examined the possibility of implementing spray irrigation,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and concluded that it would be inadequate to accommodate the amount of discharge contemplated by Villa Julie.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Third, MES considered an on-site mound system<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> to rectify Villa Julie\u2019s sewage problem. A mound system, however, requires a site that percolates, and was therefore incompatible with Villa Julie\u2019s property. MES\u2019s final recommendation to Villa Julie was \u201cto put in some sort of a on-site waste water treatment plant discharged to one of several locations that were available to the college.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">On 17 January 1991, pursuant to Villa Julie\u2019s application, the Office of Planning and Zoning, the Department of Environmental Protection and Resource Management, and the Department of Public Works jointly proposed an amendment to the Baltimore County Water and Sewer Plan (the Plan), which authorized the construction of a private waste water treatment plant for the combined properties of the Sisters and Villa Julie.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> After two public hearings, the Baltimore County Council passed Resolution 2-91, which provided, <em>inter alia,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>6. The maps attached hereto and marked as Exhibit 6 entitled \u201cVilla Julie College and Baltimore Province\u2014Sisters of Notre Dame Revision to the Water Supply and Sewerage Plan\u201d are hereby approved with special authorization to operate an existing community water system for the combined properties and with special authorization to operate a community sewage treatment plant for the combined properties, with capacity subject to special exception to the RC-2 Zoning. This authorization is also granted pursuant to Section 34-7 of the Baltimore County Code, 1978.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">On 14 June 1991, Villa Julie applied for a NPDES permit from the MDE to discharge up to 62,900 gallons per day of treated waste water effluent from its proposed waste water treatment plant into an intermittent stream that flows through its property, as well as property owned by Northwest, and into the Jones Falls downstream. Villa Julie\u2019s permit application also included an estimated discharge capacity for the Sisters\u2019s property in its calculations. Subsequent to filing the permit application, a flow measurement study and Sewage Treatment Plant Alternatives Evaluation were conducted for Villa Julie. As a result of these studies, Villa Julie amended its permit application to request approval to discharge up to 60,000 gallons per day. On 21 November 1991, a public hearing was held to address surrounding landowners\u2019 concerns about Villa Julie\u2019s permit request.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">On 20 March 1992, the MDE issued its Notice of Final Determination, indicating that it would approve Villa Julie\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>application for a discharge permit. The MDE determined that the discharge, as limited by the proposed effluent limitations, would not cause any violations of water quality standards in the intermittent stream, the Jones Falls, or Lake Roland. The Notice of Final Determination contained the following Summary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-4\">There is no feasible alternative to a discharge to the intermittent stream on the College\u2019s property. Water quality conditions in Jones Falls, above and below Villa Julie College, were used to establish discharge permit parameters which would protect the receiving water and prevent water quality violations. The permit will be based on a flow of 60,000 gpd. The limitations will remain as drafted except for the pound loadings for BOD5, suspended solids, ammonia, and total phosphorous, which will be set to correspond to the lowered flow. For BOD5, they will be 2.3 kg/day (5.0 lbs/day) for the maximum monthly average and 3.4 kg/day (7.5 lbs/day) for the maximum weekly average from June through September, and 6.8 kg/day (15 lbs/day) for the maximum monthly average and 10 kg/day (23 lbs/day) for the maximum weekly average from October through May. For suspended solids, the loading shall be 6.8 kg/day (15 lbs/day) maximum monthly average and 10 kg/day (23 lbs/ day) maximum weekly average. For total phosphorous, they shall be 0.05 kg/day (0.10 lbs/day) maximum monthly average and 0.07 kg/day (0.15 lbs/day) maximum weekly average. For ammonia nitrogen, the loading shall be 0.23 kg/day (0.50 lbs/day) maximum monthly average and 0.34 kg/day (0.75 lbs/day) maximum weekly average.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Northwest and several surrounding landowners (petitioners) <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> requested an adjudicatory hearing on the MDE\u2019s issuance of the NPDES discharge permit to Villa Julie. On 15 May 1992, an appeal was scheduled with the Office of Adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>trative Hearings. On 18 September 1992, a motions hearing was held before ALJ Wagner. On 1 October 1992, she issued an order (i) granting the motion to dismiss Valleys Planning Council as a petitioner for lack of standing, (ii) rejecting petitioners\u2019 claim that MDE failed to comply with Md.Code Ann., Envir. \u00a7 9-324(c), which requires an informational hearing to be held at least fifteen days before the public hearing, (iii) striking the issue of riparian rights of downstream owners raised by petitioners, (iv) dismissing petitioners\u2019 claim that they had been harmed by MDE\u2019s receipt of additional evidence from Villa Julie after the conclusion of the public hearing, and (v) reserving a ruling on the standing of other petitioners until the issuance of her Recommended Decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">A hearing was commenced on 11 January 1993. Dr. F. Pierce Linaweaver, an expert in environmental and civil engineering, and Richard D. Klein, an expert in water quality standards, testified as expert witnesses for the petitioners. On behalf of Villa Julie, the following expert witnesses testified: Steven Lewis Luckman, as an expert in stream water quality standards and water quality monitoring; James Allison, as an expert in water pollution biology; Frederick Chadsey, as an expert in civil engineering, percolation tests, soil boring interpretation, soil maps, and identification of soils; Dr. F. Pierce Linaweaver, as an expert in water quality, waste water management, and waste water treatment; and Dane Sherman Bauer, as an expert in water and waste water, issuance of discharge permits, and federal and state water quality regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">On 23 March 1993, ALJ Wagner issued a Recommended Decision making the following substantive Conclusions of Law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">5.

A hearing was held on 14 September 1993 before the Final Decision Maker for the MDE and, on 23 November 1993, he issued a Final Decision and Order directing that the discharge permit be issued.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Northwest appealed to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County and, on 7 July 1994, the circuit court found that the MDE\u2019s \u201cdecision is supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence and that the decision is not affected by any error of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>law.\u201d Pursuant to Md.Rule 7-209, the circuit court dismissed Northwest\u2019s appeal and affirmed the MDE\u2019s Final Decision and Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The Court of Appeals recently stated that \u201c[j]udicial review of administrative agency action is narrow.\u201d <em>United Parcel Serv., Inc. v.

Therefore, argues Northwest, the MDE erred in issuing Villa Julie\u2019s discharge permit because it \u201cdoes not conform to the approved water and sewer plan of Baltimore County.\u201d Specifically, Northwest argues that the Plan authorizes only a community<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> waste water treatment plant to be constructed on Villa Julie property, whereas Villa Julie \u201cproposes to construct a multiuse<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> sewerage treatment plant, which will serve its property exclusively.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">Villa Julie, as a threshold issue, suggests that Northwest\u2019s argument in this regard is barred by Md.Code Ann., Envir. \u00a7 l-605(d) (1993 Replacement Volume &amp; 1994 Supp.). That section provides that \u201c[a] party may not, in a contested case hearing, challenge a facility\u2019s compliance with zoning and land use requirements or conformity with a county plan issued under Title 9, Subtitle 5 of this article.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We note, however, that Northwest is not challenging <em>the facility\u2019s </em>compliance with the Plan, but instead challenges the <em>discharge permit\u2019s </em>compliance with the Plan. Section l-605(d) is therefore not applicable in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Similarly, we hold that Md.Code Ann., Envir. \u00a7 9-511 is not applicable to the case at bar. That section provides that a sewerage system cannot be <em>installed or extended </em>unless it conforms to the county plan or revision or amendment of the county plan. Villa Julie, however, is not, at this stage of the proceedings, seeking a permit to install its waste water treatment plant. Md.Code Ann., Envir. \u00a7 9-204 (1993 Replacement Volume) governs the installation pqrmit process for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>waste water treatment plants. Although section 9-511 may require that the installation and/or extension permit, issued pursuant to section 9-204, comply with the Plan, it is not applicable to the discharge permit process contemplated by section 9-323 and at issue in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">COMAR \u00a7 26.08.04.02.A(3)(b) does, however, directly apply to the discharge permit process and requires that \u201cthe discharge or proposed discharge ... [comply] with ... [t]he approved county water and sewerage plan adopted pursuant to Environmental Article, Title 9, Subtitle 5, Annotated Code of Maryland.\u201d As the MDE has already determined that the discharge from Villa Julie\u2019s proposed waste water treatment plant \u201cis consistent with the Baltimore County Water and Sewer Plan,\u201d we need only decide whether there is substantial evidence in the record to support that determination. We hold that such substantial evidence exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The Baltimore County Water and Sewer Plan, as amended by Resolution 2-91, states that Villa Julie and the Sisters may \u201coperate a community sewage treatment plant for the combined properties, with capacity subject to a special exception.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Northwest contends that, because the Sisters \u201cdid not join Villa Julie in its application for a NPDES discharge permit,\u201d and because Villa Julie proposes a multiuse sewage treatment plant as. opposed to a community sewage treatment plant, the permit issued did not conform to the Plan. Northwest fails to acknowledge, however, that, although the Sisters did not \u201cjoin\u201d in Villa Julie\u2019s permit application, the permit application submitted by Villa Julie did include estimated discharge from the Sisters in its calculations of the effluent to be treated by the ultimate facility. Accordingly, because the terms of the proposed permit were based upon the permit application and its calculations, it is of no consequence that Villa Julie and the Sisters were not co-applicants.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>We note also that the MDE, in issuing the NPDES discharge permit, did not make a determination as to whether the discharge approved in the permit would emanate from a community waste water treatment plant or a multiuse waste water treatment plant, as that issue was not before it. So long as the proposed discharge conforms with the Plan, and we hold that it does, the MDE need not determine the propriety of operating a community versus a multiuse waste water treatment plant on Villa Julie\u2019s property at the discharge permit stage of the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">Northwest also argues that, because the proposed discharge specified in the permit application must be in compliance with all applicable requirements of federal and state law, <em>see </em>CO-MAR \u00a7 26.08.04.02.A(l)(d), the MDE erred in issuing the discharge permit to Villa Julie prior to obtaining local zoning approval for the installation of Villa Julie\u2019s proposed waste water treatment plant. Appellees, on the other hand, argue that section 26.08.04.02.A(l)(d) states that the proposed discharge must comply with federal and state law, not with local zoning ordinances, and therefore the MDE was correct in issuing the discharge permit without local zoning approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">While section 26.08.04.02.A(l)(d) does not, on its face, require compliance with local zoning ordinances, we hold that a NPDES discharge permit may be subject to certain applicable local zoning ordinances. This does not mean, however, as Northwest suggests, that zoning approval for the proposed facility must be obtained prior to issuing the discharge permit. The MDE, as in the case <em>sub judice, </em>may issue the permit <em>subject to </em>local zoning ordinances, without first satisfying itself that local zoning approval has been obtained.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> As the MDE properly contemplated compliance with local zoning ordinances in issuing the NPDES discharge permit to Villa Julie, we hold that there was no error in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>issuing the discharge permit prior to the obtention by Villa Julie of local zoning approval for the proposed waste water treatment plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The MDE has adopted water quality standards to protect the public health and welfare, enhance the quality of water, protect aquatic resources, and serve the purposes of the Federal Act. COMAR \u00a7 26.08.02.01.A. These water quality standards consist of two parts: designated uses of the water,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and water quality criteria to protect the designated uses.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 26.08.02.01.B(1). In assigning use designations to each body of water in Maryland, the MDE evaluates the biological, chemical, and physical data compiled for the body of water. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 26.08.02.07. In the instant case, the Jones Falls and its tributaries (including the intermittent stream at issue) are designated as Use III waters, and therefore are subject to the water quality criteria set forth in COMAR \u00a7 26.08.02.03-3.D. In issuing a NPDES discharge permit for discharge into an intermittent stream, the MDE must ensure that the effluent limitations set forth in the permit are not less stringent than: (1) the minimum national effluent guidelines established under the Federal Act; (2) those levels necessary to maintain the water quality standards of downstream segments; (3) those levels necessary to protect the biological community of the intermittent stream; or (4) those levels necessary to protect public health. COMAR \u00a7 26.08.02.05-l.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Northwest argues that the effluent limitations in Villa Julie\u2019s NPDES discharge permit are insufficient to protect the biological community of the intermittent stream. First, Northwest suggests, albeit without any substantiation, that COMAR \u00a7 26.08.01.01 requires that effluent limitations for pollutants, particularly ammonia, must be stated in maximum <em>daily </em>quantitative limitations to protect the biological community of the intermittent stream into which the effluent will be discharged; Villa Julie\u2019s discharge permit only provided for maximum weekly and monthly average limitations for BOD5, suspended solids, ammonia nitrogen, and total phosphorous. As noted by appellees, however, COMAR \u00a7 26.08.01.01 is a definitional section and nowhere requires the MDE to set maximum <em>daily </em>quantitative limitations on any pollutants.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">Second, Northwest contends that COMAR \u00a7 26.08.04.02-l.A(l), which provides that \u201c[e]ach discharge permit, unless inappropriate, shall specify average and maximum daily quantitative limits, in terms of weight, for the discharge of pollutants in the authorized discharge,\u201d also requires the MDE to express ammonia limitations in maximum daily quantitative limitations. Northwest, however, failed to raise this argument before the MDE. Although Mr. Klein, testifying on behalf of Northwest, stated that the ammonia limits should be expressed in maximum values as opposed to average values, he did not testify that the ammonia limits should be stated in daily m\u00e1ximums, as allegedly required by COMAR \u00a7 26.08.04.02-l.A(l), as opposed to weekly and monthly m\u00e1ximums.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">It is axiomatic that \u201ca person may not obtain judicial review of a matter when he or she failed to properly raise the matter before the administrative agency.\u201d <em>Heft v. Maryland Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>323 Md. 257, 273-74, 592 A.2d 1110 (1991). <em>See, e.g., Consumer Protection v. Consumer Publishing Co., </em>304 Md. 731, 775, 501 A.2d 48 (1985); <em>Prince George\u2019s Doctors\u2019 Hosp. v. Health Servs. Cost Review Comm\u2019n, </em>302 Md. 193, 226, 486 A.2d 744 (1985); <em>Cicala v. Disability Review Bd., </em>288 Md. 254, 261-62, 418 A.2d 205 (1980). Therefore, Northwest\u2019s argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>ment concerning COMAR \u00a7 26.08.04.02-l.A(l) was not preserved for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Third, Northwest argues that, because the MDE failed to conduct a special biological assessment of the intermittent stream, there is \u201cno adequate assurance that the biological community in the stream will be protected by the effluent limitations contained in Villa Julie\u2019s permit because the [MDE] does not know what animal or plant life is present in the stream.\u201d We are unable to find any legal authority, regulation, statute, or otherwise (and Northwest draws our attention to none) that requires the MDE to perform a separate and discrete biological assessment of a body of water before issuing a discharge permit. As explained <em>supra, </em>in assigning use designations to each body of water in Maryland, the MDE evaluates the biological, chemical, and physical data compiled for the body of water. COMAR \u00a7 26.08.02.07. Therefore, in the instant case, the MDE completed its biological assessment of the intermittent stream when it designated that body of water (along with the Jones Falls and its tributaries) as Use III. To require the MDE to perform an additional biological survey before issuing a discharge permit would be duplicative as well as burdensome on the NPDES permit process.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Fourth, Northwest suggests that, based on the EPA\u2019s Ambient Aquatic Life Water Quality Criteria for Ammonia (EPA Guidelines),<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> \u201cthe proposed weekly average concentration for ammonia [set forth in Villa Julie\u2019s discharge permit as ammonia nitrogen] is <em>not </em>more stringent than those levels necessary to protect the biological community in the intermittent stream.\u201d The EPA Guidelines set one-hour and four-day average concentrations for ammonia, which the EPA recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>mends should not be exceeded any more than once every three years. Northwest contends that, under the parameters set out by the MDE in Villa Julie\u2019s NPDES discharge permit,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> the weekly average concentration for ammonia, i.e., 1.5 mg/1, exceeds the four-day average concentration for ammonia (for a pH level of 6.5 to 8.75) permitted under the EPA Guidelines, i.e., 1.23 mg/1.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">Appellees, on the other hand, contend that the EPA Guidelines are national criteria recommendations that are not binding on Maryland. Appellees explain that, \u201c[i]n addition to the EPA [Guidelines], States may use any other scientifically defensible guidance material including the State\u2019s own monitoring and sampling data and additional published studies and articles on the effects of the pollutant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The Foreword to the EPA Guidelines states that the criteria contained therein were promulgated as \u201c[guidelines to assist the States in the modification of criteria presented in this document, in the development of water quality standards, and in other water-related programs.\u201d Maryland, however, has declined to adopt the ammonia criteria set forth in the EPA Guidelines. <em>See </em>COMAR \u00a7 26.08.02.03-3. Indeed, Maryland has no water quality standard for ammonia. <em>See </em>Md.Code Ann., Envir. \u00a7 9-314(a) (\u201c[t]he [MDE] <em>may </em>adopt rules and regulations that set, for the waters of this State, water quality standards and effluent standards\u201d (emphasis added)). There is nothing in the statutory provisions or elsewhere that requires the MDE to set effluent limitations for ammonia in a NPDES discharge permit. In fact, section 9-314(a) specifically allows for the agency to decide against setting such a standard. As explained in <em>Howard County, supra, </em>\u201cThe laws of Maryland do not require effluent standards for every discharge, nor do they require the use of every control strate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>gy to abate the evils of pollution.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> <em>Howard County, </em>72 Md.App. at 42, 527 A.2d 772.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">As explained <em>supra, </em>the MDE\u2019s failure to express ammonia limitations in daily m\u00e1ximums was not in contravention of state and federal law. Therefore, we need only determine whether there is substantial evidence in the record to support the MDE\u2019s conclusion that its proposed ammonia limitations, expressed as ammonia nitrogen, are sufficient to protect the water quality of the intermittent stream, its biological community, and the public health. We hold that such substantial evidence exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Steven Lewis Luckman, Chief of the Municipal Permits Division of the MDE, testified as an expert in stream water quality standards and water quality monitoring. He opined that the effluent limitations proposed in Villa Julie\u2019s NPDES discharge permit were sufficient to meet both state and federal guidelines, to protect the Jones Falls, to protect the biological community of the intermittent stream, and to protect the public health.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Dr. F. Pierce Linaweaver opined that the effluent limitations in the proposed permit were sufficient to protect the biological community in the intermittent stream and to maintain water quality standards in the Jones Falls. He also testified that Villa Julie\u2019s proposed waste water treatment plant would be able to meet those limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Only Richard D. Klein, a technician with the Department of Natural Resources, testified that \u201cthe ammonia level [in Villa Julie\u2019s discharge permit] is set too high to protect the biological community of the intermittent stream and the biological community of the Jones Falls.\u201d These assumptions, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>were based upon the calculations set forth in the EPA Guidelines. Mr. Klein acknowledged that if the MDE lowered the pH levels (i.e., more acidic) in the effluent limitations, \u201cthat would reduce the potential impact of the ammonia upon the intermittent stream.\u201d In fact, Villa Julie and the MDE agreed to amend the pH standard from 6.5-8.7 to 6.5-7.8. <em>See supra </em>note 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">Notwithstanding Mr. Klein\u2019s equivocal opinion to the contrary, the testimony of Dr. Linaweaver and Mr. Luckman provided substantial evidence for the MDE-\u2019s conclusion that the effluent limitations set forth in Villa Julie\u2019s permit are sufficient to maintain the water quality standards of the intermittent stream, protect its biological community, and protect the public health.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Pursuant to COMAR \u00a7 26.08.02.05-1.A, \u201c[discharges to intermittent streams are not permitted when feasible alternatives are available.\u201d Northwest argues that, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>holding tanks and spray irrigation were available as feasible alternatives to the discharge from Villa Julie\u2019s proposed waste water treatment plant into the intermittent stream. Therefore, contends Northwest, the MDE erred in issuing the NPDES discharge permit to Villa Julie. As the question of whether feasible alternatives to Villa Julie\u2019s proposed discharge into the intermittent stream was a question of fact before the MDE, we need only determine whether the MDE\u2019s conclusion that no feasible alternatives existed is supported by substantial evidence in the record. We hold that such substantial evidence exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Mr. Bauer stated that Villa Julie\u2019s septic system had failed and that the use of an intermittent stream for discharge of treated waste water was a choice of last resort. Mr. Bauer explained that Villa Julie\u2019s current waste removal procedure, namely the \u201cpump and haul\u201d method, is not a long-term solution for waste water problems because it is problematic and cost prohibitive.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>George Neff, as spokesman for Baltimore County with respect to the proposed wast\u00e9 water treatment plant at Villa Julie, confirmed that the use of holding tanks and the hauling of excess discharge is a temporary and short-term solution to Villa Julie\u2019s failed septic system. In addition, Mr. Neff testified that Baltimore County does not authorize \u201cpump and haul\u201d as a permanent or long-term solution to the disposal of waste water.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Furthermore, COMAR \u00a7 26.04.02.03.B expressly prohibits the use of holding tanks at Villa Julie. That section provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">Holding tanks may be used to resolve existing on-site sewage disposal failures when the community sewer facilities are not available or on-site repair is not possible. They may not be permitted to serve new construction or for the purpose of adding capacity to an existing disposal system in order to accommodate a change in property use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Villa Julie is currently seeking a special exception to accommodate its anticipated expansion, including the construction of a new academic building and a private waste water treatment plant. (Villa Julie is currently a lawful nonconforming use in the RC-2 zone.) As COMAR \u00a7 26.04.02.03.B expressly prohibits the use of holding tanks \u201cto serve new construction or for the purpose of adding capacity to an existing disposal system in order to accommodate a change in property use,\u201d the MDE could not have concluded that the proposed use of holding tanks could have been a feasible alternative to Villa Julie\u2019s proposed discharge into the intermittent stream.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">A spray irrigation system was also rejected by the MDE as a feasible alternative to Villa Julie\u2019s proposed discharge into the intermittent stream. Mr. Bauer testified that spray irrigation would require a substantial lagoon so that storage capacity would exist during inclement weather and other times when spraying would be impracticable. He explained that the size of the storage lagoon for Villa Julie would have to be approximately two acres wide in area and approximately five feet deep. In addition, Villa Julie would have to provide an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>adequate buffer zone from the irrigation and lagoon areas to protect its students. Finally, it was estimated that spray irrigation would only be able to accommodate a maximum of 27,000 gallons of waste water per day, whereas Villa Julie currently generated between 27,000 and 30,000 gallons per day.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Mr. Bauer concluded that spray irrigation was not a feasible alternative to discharge into the intermittent stream.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">The only evidence offered by Northwest to support its contention that spray irrigation was a feasible alternative to the proposed discharge into the intermittent stream was a letter from Dr. Ching-Tzone Tien, Division of Residential Sanitation, to J. James Dieter, Baltimore County Department of Environmental Protection and Resource Management. In that letter, Dr. Tien identified an area \u201cwith potential for spray irrigation\u201d estimated at 10.2 acres. Dr. Tien concluded, however, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\">In summary of the feasibility of employing spray irrigation for this facility, the area identified with potential for spray irrigation is estimated at 10.2 acres. The capacity of this area is estimated at 26,600 gpd using our recommended l\"/week application rate and 6-day storage time. This 26,600 gpd capacity is well below the estimated flow volume of 42,000 gpd to be used for designing sewage treatment</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ap_\">and disposal for the existing Villa Julie College facilities. It appears, therefore, that even Dr. Tien acknowledged that spray irrigation would not be a feasible alternative, as its \u201ccapacity is well below the estimated flow volume ... to be used for designing sewage treatment and disposal for the existing Villa Julie College facilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">In light of the testimony of Mr. Bauer and Mr. Neff, and the conclusions of Dr. Tien, we hold that there was substantial evidence to support the MDE\u2019s conclusion that holding tanks and spray irrigation were not feasible alternatives to Villa Julie\u2019s proposed discharge into the intermittent stream.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">COMAR \u00a7 26.08.04.02.A(l)(d) provides that the \u201cproposed discharge specified in the application ... will be in compliance with all applicable requirements of ... Federal and State law or regulation.\u201d Northwest argues that, because Villa Julie\u2019s proposed discharge into the intermittent stream \u201cviolates Northwest\u2019s private property interests and riparian rights,\u201d it does not comply with all applicable requirements of state law and regulation. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Appellees, as a threshold issue, suggest that Northwest has failed to preserve this argument for our review. Appellees contend that, because Northwest failed to file exceptions to ALJ Wagner\u2019s grant of appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss the riparian rights issue, Northwest \u201cfailed to exhaust its administrative remedies as to this issue.\u201d The record indicates the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">In a letter to Timmerman T. Daugherty, Esquire, Director, of the Office of Community Assistance, MDE, dated 14 April 1998 and captioned \u201cExceptions to Proposed Decision,\u201d Michael J. Collins, Esquire, counsel for Northwest, stated, \u201cThe proposed discharge from the plant is a violation of Northwest Land\u2019s riparian rights.\u201d Indeed, the circuit court specifically commented, without objection from appellees\u2019 counsel,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> on Northwest\u2019s riparian rights claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">I will comment for the record, Mr. Collins argued in his brief and, again reiterated today, the issue of the riparian\u2019s [sic] rights issue. That issue is not foreclosed by the decision of the Court today but certainly can be entertained and, in a correct forum of this Court, which is not this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">Notwithstanding appellees\u2019 protestations to the contrary, it is clear that Northwest excepted to ALJ Wagner\u2019s dismissal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>its riparian rights claim, and carried forward that argument to the circuit court, thereby exhausting its administrative remedies. The issue was therefore properly preserved for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">As to the merits of Northwest\u2019s claim, however, we agree with the circuit court and are persuaded by a decision of the Missouri Court of Appeals, <em>Curdt v. Missouri Clean Water Comm\u2019n, </em>586 S.W.2d 58 (Mo.Ct.App.1979), which similarly rejected an attempt by adjacent landowners to interject a riparian rights claim into a discharge permit proceeding. In that case, the discharger applied to the Missouri Clean Water Commission (Commission) for a permit to discharge its treated effluent from a purification lagoon into a surface watercourse on the discharger\u2019s property. The watercourse continued from the discharger\u2019s property into a pond on adjacent landowners\u2019 property. The adjacent landowners challenged the permit, arguing that its riparian rights were violated by the flow of the discharged water onto its property.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The Commission refused to consider the riparian rights claim in the discharge permit proceeding, and the Missouri Court of Appeals agreed. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-6\">The statutory provisions of the Missouri Clean Water Law do not explicitly grant the Commission the power to determine riparian rights. Moreover, these provisions do not impliedly grant this power. For example, a clarification of the respective rights and duties of a lagoon owner and an adjacent property owner would not affect, and, thus could not facilitate the Commission\u2019s required determination of whether the discharged water meets the statutorily defined effluent limitations and water quality standards. Furthermore, determination of the riparian rights of individual landowners would not reveal what impact the discharge would have on water quality and, thus, could not serve to insure minimum water quality degradation in this state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Adt\"><em>Id. </em>at 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">The Court recognized, however, that the adjacent landowners\u2019 existing rights, including their riparian rights, are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>abridged by the issuance of a permit, as indicated in Mo.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 204.131 (1973).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <em>Curdt, </em>586 S.W.2d at 60. The Court held that the adjacent landowners \u201cmisconceive the legal effect of the clean water permit. This permit merely reflects full compliance with the clean water standards imposed by the Missouri Clean Water Law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If a discharger is indeed violating adjacent landowners\u2019 riparian rights, that discharger is not absolved from liability by its clean water permit. <em>Id. </em>The proper forum for the landowners\u2019 action, however, is the courts, and not an administrative discharge permit proceeding. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">The MDE, similar to the Commission in <em>Curdt, </em>is an administrative agency charged with managing, improving, controlling, and conserving the waters of Maryland. <em>See Howard County, </em>72 Md.App. at 23, 527 A.2d 772. Like other administrative agencies, the MDE has only those powers that the legislature has expressly or impliedly conferred. <em>Mayor &amp; Aldermen of the City of Annapolis v. Annapolis Waterfront Co., </em>284 Md. 383, 394, 396 A.2d 1080 (1979); <em>Dal Maso v. Board of County Comm\u2019rs, </em>182 Md. 200, 205, 34 A.2d 464 (1943). The MDE is neither expressly nor impliedly authorized to determine the rights of individual property owners. <em>See </em>Md.Code Ann., Envir. \u00a7 9-302, 9-324. As in <em>Curdt, </em>specific recognition that Northwest\u2019s existing riparian rights are not abridged by the issuance of a discharge permit is found in Md.Code Ann., Envir. \u00a7 9-303 (1993 Replacement Volume). That section provides: \u201cThis subtitle does not take away the. right of any person, as a riparian owner or otherwise, in equity, at common law, or under statutory law to suppress a nuisance or abate pollution.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b529-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Thus, if Villa Julie\u2019s proposed discharge indeed does, sometime in the future, violate Northwest\u2019s riparian rights, Villa Julie is not absolved from liability by its discharge permit. Northwest\u2019s relief, if any, is in the courts. Consequently, the MDE had no authority to entertain, and properly refused to consider, this private dispute raised by Northwest, a third party to the permit proceeding. <em>Cf. Maryland Action for Foster Children, Inc. v. State, </em>279 Md. 133, 138-139, 367 A.2d 491 (1977) (mandamus will not lie to control the exercise of discretion by a public official); <em>Glen Burnie Improvement Ass\u2019n v. State Appeal Bd., </em>213 Md. 407, 411-12, 132 A.2d 451 (1957) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">Interestingly, Northwest concedes in its reply brief that the MDE \u201cdoes not have the authority to resolve riparian rights issues.\u201d It claims, however, that the MDE \u201cis required under COMAR \u00a7 26.08.04.02.A(l)(d) to determine that the discharge will comply with applicable State and federal law,\u201d and the MDE\u2019s failure to consider the riparian rights of Northwest and others was \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d We are unable to discern a meaningful difference between Northwest\u2019s claim in its brief (that because Villa Julie\u2019s proposed discharge into the intermittent stream \u201cviolates Northwest\u2019s private property interests and riparian rights,\u201d the proposed discharge specified in the application does not comply with all applicable requirements of state law and regulation) and its apparently refined argument in its reply brief (that the MDE must consider the riparian rights of Villa Julie\u2019s downstream neighbors to determine whether the proposed discharge complies with state law and regulations). In order for the MDE to determine, under Northwest\u2019s theory, whether the proposed discharge complies with state law and regulations, it must make an independent determination as to whether the proposed discharge will violate Northwest\u2019s riparian rights. As we hold <em>supra, </em>the MDE is not vested with the authority to make such a determination and, therefore, the riparian rights of adjacent landowners are not applicable regulatory or legal considerations in determining whether the proposed discharge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>complies with federal or state law or regulations under CO-MAR \u00a7 26.08.04.02.A(l)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Finally, Northwest contends that Md.Code Ann., Envir. \u00a7 9-222 (1993 Replacement Volume) gives \u201cthe MDE authority to correct a failing sewage system by ordering a County, such as Baltimore County in this case, to extend public sewer to correct a failing sewerage system which \u2018[clauses a condition by which any of the waters of this state are being polluted or could become polluted in a way that is dangerous to health or is a nuisance.\u2019 \u201d As Villa Julie\u2019s septic system has failed, Northwest contends that, of the 27,000 gallons per day of sewerage currently generated by Villa Julie, approximately 19,000<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> gallons per day is flowing directly into the water table; the other 8000 gallons per day is hauled away by truck. Therefore, concludes Northwest, \u201cVilla Julie is polluting the waters of the State in a way that is \u2018dangerous to health and [is] a nuisance.\u2019 \u201d Appellees, on the other hand, argue that section 9-222 is discretionary, and the \u201cMDE cannot be required to order Baltimore County to extend the public sewer in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Section 9-222(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">(a) <em>Findings by Secretary that justify </em>order.\u2014The Secretary may issue an order under subsection (b) of this section, if, after investigation, the Secretary determines that the absence or incompleteness of a public water supply system, public sewerage system, or refuse disposal system in a county, municipal corporation, sanitary district, subdivision, or locality:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>(1) Is sufficiently prejudicial to the health or comfort of that or any other county, municipal corporation, sanitary district, subdivision, or locality; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-4\">(2) Causes a condition by which any of the waters of this State are being polluted or could become polluted in a way that is dangerous to health or is a nuisance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-5\"><em>Id. </em>\u201cThis grant of authority is independent of MDE\u2019s authority to issue permits and enables MDE to move immediately when necessary to protect the public interest in a healthful environment.\u201d 78 Op.Att\u2019y Gen. 273, 278 (8 November 1993). An order under this section must be based on a finding that the absence or incompleteness of a public sewerage system is sufficiently prejudicial to the health or comfort of the county, or causes a condition by which waters of Maryland are polluted in a way that is dangerous to health or is a nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>there is no evidence in the record indicating that the absence of a public sewerage system at Villa Julie creates a nuisance or menace to health, or any danger of water pollution. Although Northwest baldly asserts in its brief that approximately 19,000 gallons per day of untreated waste water is flowing directly into the water table at Villa Julie, it points to no evidence in the record, and we are unable to find any, that such pollution is occurring. There is also no evidence in the record that MES or the MDE, in their environmental studies of the Villa Julie sewage problem, found the level of pollution or the health dangers alleged by Northwest to exist at Villa Julie. Accordingly, the MDE cannot be found to have abused its discretion by not making such findings and not ordering the extension of a public sewerage system to Villa Julie. <em>Accord Wincamp Partnership v.

According to appellees\u2019 counsel at oral argument, the property on which Villa Julie is situated was once owned by the Baltimore Province-Sisters of Notre Dame (Sisters), one of Villa Julie\u2019s current adjacent landowners. At that time, a single septic system was installed with two adjacent drainage fields. When the Sisters subsequently sold a portion of their property to what is now Villa Julie, the septic system remained on the Sisters\u2019s property. Consequently, Villa Julie's failed septic system is located on the Sisters\u2019s property. Again, according to appellees' counsel, assuming Villa Julie can somehow accommodate its increased waste water discharge (e.g., a waste water treatment plant), the current septic system located on the Sisters\u2019s property would be adequate for continued use only by the Sisters. The record does not disclose whether, and to what extent, the current septic system on the Sisters's property would accommodate increases in effluent flow occasioned by intensification of the existing uses on the Sisters\u2019s property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b506-6\">.
