Nonetheless, we need not discuss that morass, focusing instead only on the trial court\u2019s denial of appellants\u2019 motions for costs. On 11 August 1993, we filed a per curiam opinion affirming the judgment of the circuit court in favor of the Littys. <em>Becker, et al. v. Litty, et al., </em>97 Md.App. 751 (1993). Subsequently, appellants moved for costs. Talbot County filed its motion on 18 February 1994, and the Littys filed their motion on 28 March 1994. The trial court denied the motions by orders dated 13 May 1994, in which it said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\">1. The instant motion was filed more than thirty (30) days after issuance of the mandate dispositive of the appeal and more than thirty (30) days after the Order of the Court of Appeals denying the Petition for Writ of Certiorari.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-8\">2. This issue was not raised prior to the appeal and was therefore not reserved by this Court as an issue collateral to those on appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-9\">3. In exercising its discretion, this Court now declines to hear the matters raised in the instant motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>In declining to consider appellants\u2019 motions for costs, the trial court \u201cchose to be guided by sections (b)(3) and (d)(1) of the \u201cPROPOSED\u201d amendment to Rule 1-341, a copy of which is attached hereto____ This court still believes that exercise of discretion was proper.\u201d Interestingly, the proposed amendments were not adopted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">In any event, this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">Maryland\u2019s appellate courts have not before considered whether costs, as sanctions under Md.Rule 1-341, may first be sought after judgment has been entered and appealed and the appeal has been concluded. According to appellants, the trial court erred in concluding that it was without jurisdiction to consider their motions for costs. As appellants see it, the trial court abused its discretion by failing to exercise discretion, asserting that it is within the discretion of the trial court to consider at any time a motion for costs under Rule 1-341.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">It is beyond cavil in Maryland that attorney\u2019s fees may be sought after a final judgment has been entered, because attorney\u2019s fees are considered to be a collateral matter. <em>Mercedes-Benz v. Garten, </em>94 Md.App. 547, 568, 618 A.2d 233 (1993). Moreover, even though noting an appeal vests an appellate court \u201cwith the exclusive power and jurisdiction over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>the subject matter of the proceedings, and the authority and control of the lower court with reference thereto is suspended,\u201d <em>Kirsner v. Edelmann, </em>65 Md.App. 185, 192-193, 499 A.2d 1313 (1985) (quoting <em>Lang v. Catterton, </em>267 Md. 268, 297 A.2d 735 (1972)), a trial court may act \u201cwith respect to collateral or independent matters, not relating to the subject of the appeal.\u201d <em>Kirsner, supra. </em>In <em>Kirsner, </em>we were called upon to consider whether the trial court lacked jurisdiction to determine the issue of counsel fees because \u201cthe hearing before the Master occurred, and her Report and Recommendation issued .... \u201d while the appeal was pending before our court. We concluded that, as the trial court had specifically reserved the issue of counsel fees and referred it to the Master for a hearing, \u201cits jurisdiction was unaffected by the master\u2019s hearing prior to the decision and mandate in Kirsner\u2019s appeal.\u201d <em>Kirsner, supra, </em>at 193-194, 499 A.2d 1313. Nevertheless, in <em>Bohle v. Thompson, </em>78 Md.App. 614, 642, 554 A.2d 818 (1989), we said that \u201c[wjhere a party seeks attorney\u2019s fees based on pretrial proceedings maintained or defended by another party and determination of the attorney\u2019s fee issue may be had without inquiry into the merits of the substantive action, it would be an abuse of discretion for the lower court to wait until an appeal has been noted and decided to determine ... the ... attorney\u2019s fees issue.\u201d We nonetheless concluded in <em>Bohle, </em>because it was the responsibility of the moving party to ensure \u201cthat a pretrial attorney\u2019s fees issue is resolved prior to appeal ...,\u201d that the moving party had waived his right to attorney\u2019s fees by thirteen months inaction. <em>Id. </em>at 642, 554 A.2d 818. As we said earlier, however, Maryland\u2019s appellate courts have not addressed the effect of a moving party first seeking costs pursuant to Rule 1-341 after an appeal has been concluded. The issue with which we are here faced has been commented upon, however, by Niemeyer and Schuett, <em>in Maryland Rules Commentary </em>(2d ed. 1992):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-5\">A motion for sanctions under this rule is a proceeding ancillary to the action. For that reason, leaving aside whether the rule may form the basis for a separate action, a motion must be filed within the confines of the action. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>filed before the entry of judgment in the underlying action, it will be treated like any other motion. If after judgment, it may be treated as a matter of costs collateral to the action or as an adjunct to an enforcement proceeding. If on appeal, it should be filed with the appellate court and either decided by that court or by the trial court on remand....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-5\">If sanctions are sought after an appeal has been concluded or after the time for an appeal has expired and no appeal has been filed, <em>the motion must be supported by some basis that justifies the court\u2019s continuing jurisdiction over the case.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 51-52<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (emphasis added.) Niemeyer and Schuett have cited no cases in support of this proposition, nor have we found any.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">As a result, we turn to the federal courts\u2019 treatment of Fed.R.Civ.P. 11 in cases similar to the one at hand. The Supreme Court of the United States said in <em>Cooter &amp; Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., </em>496 U.S. 384, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-8\">This Court has indicated that motions for costs or attorney\u2019s fees are \u201cindependent proceeding[s] supplemental to the original proceeding and not a request for a modification of the original decree.\u201d <em>Sprague v. Ticonic National Bank, </em>307 U.S. 161, 170, 59 S.Ct. 777, 781, 83 L.Ed. 1184 (1939). Thus, even \u201cyears after the entry of a judgment on the merits\u201d a federal court could consider an award of counsel fees. <em>White v. New Hampshire Dept. of Employment Security, </em>455 U.S. 445, 451, n. 13, 102 S.Ct. 1162, n. 13, 71 L.Ed.2d 325 (1982).... Like the imposition of costs, attorney\u2019s fees, and contempt sanctions, the imposition of a Rule 11 sanction is not a judgment on the merits of an action. Rather, it requires the determination of a collateral issue: whether the attorney has abused the judicial process, and, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>so, what sanction would be appropriate. Such a determination may be made after the principle suit has been terminated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-5\"><em>Cooter &amp; Gell, supra, </em>496 U.S. at 395-396, 110 S.Ct. at 2455-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Despite what Niemeyer and Schuett have said, we believe that a trial court may entertain a motion for costs even though the principle suit has been concluded. We therefore conclude that a motion for costs pursuant to Md.Rule 1-341 is an \u201cindependent proceeding supplemental to the original proceeding and a trial court is not deprived of jurisdiction\u201d whenever costs are sought. <em>See Id. </em>Although \u201cthe only time limitation arises out of those equitable considerations that a [ ] judge may weigh in his discretion,\u201d <em>Hicks v. Southern Maryland Health Systems Agency, </em>805 F.2d 1165, 1167 (4th Cir. 1986), the judge\u2019s discretion must be exercised. In other words, the trial court must initially determine whether considering such a motion would unduly prejudice the non-moving party. If the trial court determines that the non-moving party will not be unduly prejudiced, two matters must be determined before considering an award of costs pursuant to Rule 1-341.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">As the Court of Appeals said in <em>Inlet Associates v. Harrison Inn Inlet, Inc., </em>324 Md. 254, 267-268, 596 A.2d 1049 (1991):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aar\">First, the judge must find that the proceeding was maintained or defended in bad faith and/or without substantial justification. This finding will be affirmed unless it is clearly erroneous or involves an erroneous application of law. Second, the judge must find that the bad faith and/or lack of substantial justification merits the assessment of costs and/or attorney\u2019s fees. This finding will be affirmed unless it was an abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the trial court declined to consider appellants\u2019 motions because they were not filed until after the appeal had been concluded, and \u201cmore than thirty (30) days after the Order of the Court of Appeals denying the Petition for Writ of Certiorari.\u201d Essentially, the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>first concluded that it was unable to consider issues raised by appellants\u2019 motions for costs because they had not been raised prior to the appeal and were \u201ctherefore not specifically reserved as an issue collateral to those on appeal.\u201d Although this is consistent with the comments of Niemeyer and Schuett in the <em>Maryland Rules Commentary, supra, </em>we hold that it is precisely because a motion for costs pursuant to Rule 1-341 is an \u201cindependent proceeding supplemental to the original proceeding\u201d that it may be filed and considered by the trial court after the appeal has been concluded. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the trial court erred in concluding that it was precluded from considering appellant\u2019s motions because they had not previously been raised or reserved for its consideration. Thus, the trial court\u2019s failure to exercise its discretion is an abuse of discretion. <em>Maus v. State, </em>311 Md. 85, 532 A.2d 1066 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">In denying appellant\u2019s motions for reconsideration, the trial court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-5\">In issuing the Order dated May 13, 1994, this Court, while exercising its discretion under existing Rule 1-341, chose to be guided by sections (b)(3) and (d)(1) of the \u201cPROPOSED\u201d amendment to Rule 1-341,....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">We note that sections (b)(3) and (d)(1) of the proposed amendment to Rule 1-341 were not adopted. Consequently, the trial court erred in being guided by the unadopted amendment, as Rule 1-341 contains no time limit for filing a motion for costs. Moreover, it is not within the province of the trial court to be guided by rules of procedure that have not been adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Nevertheless, it may often be prudent for a party to delay filing such a motion until the appeal has been concluded, to avoid presenting an issue that need no longer be decided. Moreover, as we pointed out in <em>Dent v. Simmons, </em>61 Md.App. 122, 130, 485 A.2d 270 (1985), \u201cthe better practice in most cases would be to determine those issues before judgment becomes final on the case in chief, in order to avoid successive appeals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">In sum, we hold that the trial court erred in declining to consider appellant\u2019s motions for costs. Consequently, we shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>reverse the judgment of the circuit court and remand the case to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Appellants further contend that we may, and should, decide whether costs pursuant to Rule 1-341 are warranted. As appellants seek costs for proceedings in the trial court, we believe \u201c[t]he trial court is the proper tribunal to make determinations as to whether actions before it have been brought in \u2018bad faith\u2019 or \u2018without substantial justification.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fowler v. Printers II, </em>89 Md.App. 448, 480, 598 A.2d 794 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">JUDGMENT REVERSED. CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR TALBOT COUNTY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-16\">. We note that the Littys are presently in the process of obtaining a divorce.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b398-10\">. Maryland Rule 1-341 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-11\">In any civil action, if the court finds that the conduct of any party in maintaining or defending any proceeding was in bad faith or without substantial justification the court may require the offending party or the attorney advising the conduct or both of them to pay to the adverse party the costs of the proceeding and the reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, incurred by the adverse party in opposing it.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b399-11\">.

Appellants have failed to address that portion of the above quoted material concerning filing a motion after an appeal has been concluded. Such a lapse misrepresents the whole of the Maryland Rules Commentary\u2019s section on Md.Rule 1-341 and adds nothing to this discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
