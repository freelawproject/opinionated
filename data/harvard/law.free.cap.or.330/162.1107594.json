The proceedings have been consolidated for argument, consideration, and decision. Petitioner is an elector who timely submitted written comments to the Secretary of State respecting the content of the draft ballot title for each of the proposed measures, which the Secretary of State had designated as Initiative Petitions 108,122,123, 124, 125, and 139 (2000). Petitioner therefore is entitled to seek review of the resulting ballot titles certified by the Attorney General. <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(2) (setting that requirement). We review the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot titles to determine whether they substantially comply with the requirements of ORS 250.035(2) (1997).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(5) (setting out standard of review). For the reasons that follow, we conclude that none of the six ballot titles meets the foregoing statutory standard. We therefore modify all six ballot titles.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The measures in question would establish certain rights of health care patients, impose duties on various health care providers and insurers who offer health or accident insurance, and require an independent review process respecting payment and coverage decisions by insurers and health care providers. The ballot titles certified by the Attorney General for the six measures are identical with respect to the caption and result statements. The caption and result statements for each of the six proposed measures are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>\u201cESTABLISHES: PATIENT RIGHTS, MEDICAL PLAN DUTIES; INDEPENDENT EXTERNAL REVIEW PROCESS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-5\">\u201cRESULT OF \u201cYES\u2019 VOTE: Yes\u2019 vote establishes: patient rights, medical plan duties; independent external review for payment, coverage decisions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">\u201cRESULT OF \u2018NO\u2019 VOTE: \u2018No\u2019 vote rejects: patient rights, medical plan duties; independent external review for payment, coverage decisions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Although all the captions and result statements are identical, the summaries in the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot titles differ to reflect the differences among the measures. We set out each of the summaries \u2014 none of which we alter \u2014 at the conclusion of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">Petitioner makes a variety of attacks on all aspects of the six certified ballot titles. We have considered each of those arguments and conclude that only one demonstrates that the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot titles fail to comply substantially with the standards for such ballot titles set out in ORS 250.035(2)(a) to (d) (1997). We confine our discussion to the one challenge that we find to be well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">As noted, the Attorney General\u2019s \u201cno\u201d result statement states: \u201c \u2018No\u2019 vote rejects: patient rights, medical plan duties; independent external review for payment, coverage decisions.\u201d Petitioner argues, correctly, that the \u201cno\u201d result statement is incorrect; what is \u201crejected\u201d is not <em>all </em>patient rights, medical plan duties, and the like. Many patient rights and medical plan duties already exist from independent sources. Instead, a \u201cno\u201d vote on the proposed measures would reject any statutory increase in rights, duties, etc. To comply substantially with ORS 250.035(2)(c) (1997), which requires that the Attorney General provide a \u201cno\u201d result statement that accurately \u201cdescribes the result if the state measure is rejected,\u201d the Attorney General\u2019s \u201cno\u201d result statement must be modified. We do that by inserting the word \u201cincreasing\u201d before the words \u201cpatient rights\u201d in the Attorney General\u2019s \u201cno\u201d result statement and by deleting the word \u201cexternal.\u201d Deletion of the word \u201cexternal\u201d from the phrase \u201cindependent external review\u201d sacrifices little of the information that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>voter would need to have. What is central is the concept of \u201cindependent\u201d review; whether that review is \u201cinternal\u201d or \u201cexternal\u201d is pertinent, but not as important as correcting the misimpression created by the present phrasing of the \u201cno\u201d result statements following the word \u201crejects.\u201d We modify the Attorney General\u2019s \u201cno\u201d result statement for each of the six ballot titles accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Modification of the \u201cno\u201d result statement in turn has two consequences: The \u201cyes\u201d result statement, which should parallel the \u201cno\u201d result statement wherever practical, ORS 250.035(3), also should be modified by adding the word \u201cincreased\u201d and deleting the word \u201cexternal.\u201d A similar modification to the caption completes the parallel construction of those three parts of the ballot title. We make those modifications, as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">We certify to the Secretary of State the following ballot title for Initiative Petition 108 (case number S47164):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\">ESTABLISHES: INCREASED PATIENT RIGHTS, MEDICAL PLAN DUTIES; INDEPENDENT REVIEW PROCESS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-7\">RESULT OF \u201cYES\u201d VOTE: \u201cYes\u201d vote establishes: increased patient rights, medical plan duties; independent review for payment, coverage decisions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-8\">RESULT OF \u201cNO\u201d VOTE: \u201cNo\u201d vote rejects: increasing patient rights, medical plan duties; independent review for payment, coverage decisions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-9\">SUMMARY: Grants medical-plan patients right to: independent external review of plan\u2019s payment, coverage decisions; standing referral to specialist under defined circumstances; referral to outside provider in specified situations; recover damages for harm caused by plan\u2019s failure to exercise ordinary care; obtain drugs outside medical plan\u2019s formulary in specified circumstances.
