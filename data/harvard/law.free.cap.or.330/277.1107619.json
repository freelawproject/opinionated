Petitioners are electors who timely submitted written comments concerning the content of the draft ballot titles submitted to the Secretary of State and who therefore are entitled to seek review of the ballot titles certified by the Attorney General. <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(2) (setting that requirement).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Initiative Petition 147 would allow governmental units to impose a \u201csystem development charge\u201d to pay for costs associated with facilities or assets used for schools. Initiative Petition 151 would allow counties to impose an \u201cimpact fee\u201d on new housing to finance new school construction and improvements to existing schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">We have considered petitioners\u2019 arguments concerning the ballot titles certified by the Attorney General. We conclude that petitioners have not shown that the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot titles fail to comply substantially with the standards for such ballot titles set out in ORS 250.035(2)(a) to (d) (1997).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(5) (setting out standard of review). Accordingly, we certify to the Secretary of State the following ballot title for Initiative Petition 147:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\">ALLOWS IMPOSITION OF \u201cSYSTEM DEVELOPMENT CHARGE\u201d FOR SCHOOL FACILITES, ASSETS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-9\">RESULT OF \u2018YES\u201d VOTE: \u2018Yes\u201d vote allows governmental unit to impose \u201csystem development charge\u201d (defined) for school facilities, assets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>RESULT OF \u201cNO\u201d VOTE: \u201cNo\u201d vote rejects allowing governmental unit to impose \u201csystem development charge\u201d for school facilities, assets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-4\">SUMMARY: Currently, governmental units may collect \u201csystem development charge\u201d \u2014 defined as \u201creimbursement\u201d or \u201cimprovement\u201d fee (defined) \u2014 for costs associated with \u201ccapital improvement\u201d (defined as facilities or assets used for: water, sewer, drainage systems; transportation; parks).
