Petitioners are electors who timely submitted written comments concerning the content of the Attorney General\u2019s draft ballot title and who therefore are entitled to seek review. <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(2) (stating that requirement). We review the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title to determine whether it substantially complies with the requirements of ORS 250.035 (1997).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(5) (setting standard). For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the caption and the \u201cyes\u201d vote result statement do not comply substantially with the statutory standards. We modify the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Under the proposed measure, proceeds paid to this state by United States tobacco products manufacturers, pursuant to a \u201cMaster Settlement Agreement of 1998,\u201d would be dedicated to a health-care trust fund, and the earnings from the trust would be used to provide health-care services for low-income persons. The Attorney General certified the following ballot title to the Secretary of State:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">\u201cTOBACCO-SETTLEMENT PROCEEDS RESTRICTED TO PROVIDING LOW-INCOME HEALTH CARE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">\u201cRESULT OF \u201cYES\u2019 VOTE: Yes\u2019 vote requires using all tobacco-settlement proceeds for health care for low-income persons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>\u201cRESULT OF \u2018NO\u2019 VOTE: \u2018No\u2019 vote leaves use of tobacco-settlement proceeds unrestricted, rejects creation of health trust fund.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-4\">\u201cSUMMARY: Currently, use of proceeds from settlement with tobacco products manufacturers is unrestricted. Measure places entire settlement into trust fund. Requires continuous appropriation of all fund earnings, for medical, dental, other remedial care services for low-income persons. Principal may be used for those purposes if court order or settlement agreement requires principal to go to federal government, or upon 2/3 approval by legislature when certain economic conditions indicate presence or likelihood of recession. Prohibits appropriations for other purposes, or under other conditions, absent voters\u2019 approval.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Petitioner Patterson challenges the caption, the \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d vote result statements, and the summary. Petitioner Lowe challenges only the caption and the \u201cyes\u201d vote result statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">ORS 250.035(2)(a) (1997) requires a ballot title to contain a caption of not more than 10 words that \u201creasonably identifies the subject matter\u201d of the proposed measure. Petitioner Patterson contends that the Attorney General\u2019s caption is not informative, that it is written in a manner that might dissuade voters from approving the measure, and that it fails to inform voters that the measure would put the proceeds of the tobacco settlement into a trust fund and dedicate the earnings from that fund to providing health care for low-income persons. Petitioner Patterson proposes the following caption: \u201cCREATES \u2018OREGON HEALTH PLAN TRUST FUND\u2019 WITH TOBACCO-SETTLEMENT MONEY.\u201d Petitioner Lowe faults the Attorney General\u2019s caption for suggesting that <em>all </em>the proceeds, including principal, from the tobacco settlement will be used to fund low-income health care. She proposes the following caption: \u201cTOBACCO SETTLEMENT PROCEEDS RESTRICTED TO LOW-INCOME HEALTH CARE TRUST.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">We agree with petitioner Patterson that the subject of the measure is the dedication of the proceeds of the tobacco settlement to a particular fund and the requirement that earnings from that fund be used to provide low-income health care. To comply substantially with ORS 250.035(2)(a) (1997), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>the caption must alert voters to both aspects of the proposed measure. The Attorney General\u2019s certified caption does not do so. However, petitioner Patterson\u2019s proposed caption also misses the mark, because it does not explain that the earnings from the trust fund will be used to fund health care for low-income persons. Petitioner Lowe is correct that, under the proposed measure, with certain exceptions, only <em>earnings </em>from the proceeds of the settlement will be used to fund low-income health care. The caption should refer to earnings rather than to proceeds in referring to the money that will be used to provide low-income health care.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">We certify the following caption for the proposed measure: DEDICATES TOBACCO-SETTLEMENT PROCEEDS; EARNINGS FUND LOW-INCOME HEALTH CARE.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">We turn to petitioners\u2019 challenges to the \u201cyes\u201d vote result statement and to petitioner Patterson\u2019s challenge to the \u201cno\u201d vote result statement. ORS 250.035(2)(b) (1997) requires a \u201cyes\u201d vote result statement that contains a \u201csimple and understandable statement of not more than 15 words that describes the result if the state measure is approved.\u201d ORS 250.035(2)(c) (1997) requires a \u201cno\u201d vote result statement that contains a \u201csimple and understandable statement of not more than 15 words that describes the result if the state measure is rejected.\u201d ORS 250.035(3) requires that, \u201cto the extent practical,\u201d the wording of the \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d vote statements be parallel.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Both petitioners argue that the result of the proposed measure is the creation of a health-care trust fund using tobacco-settlement proceeds, with income from the trust to benefit low-income persons. They contend that the Attorney General\u2019s \u201cyes\u201d vote result statement does not inform voters of that result. According to petitioners, the absence of reference to the trust fund in the \u201cyes\u201d vote result statement is misleading, because the statement suggests that the tobacco-settlement principal would be used directly for providing health care to low-income persons. The first mention of a health trust fund appears in the Attorney General\u2019s \u201cno\u201d vote result statement. What is more, both petitioners argue, the wording of the \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d vote result statements is not parallel.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>The Attorney General does not dispute that the proposed measure requires tobacco-settlement moneys to be placed into a health-care trust fund. However, he argues that that information does not need to appear in the \u201cyes\u201d vote result statement, because it appears in the \u201cno\u201d vote result statement, and voters will be able to infer from its appearance in the \u201cno\u201d vote result statement that a health-care trust fund would be created if the measure is approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">As noted, the <em>subject </em>of the proposed measure is the dedication of tobacco-settlement proceeds and the requirement that earnings from the proceeds be used in a particular manner. The <em>result </em>of the proposed measure, as petitioners correctly argue, would be to create a health-care trust fund, the earnings from which will provide health care to low-income persons. To comply substantially with ORS 250.035(2)(b) (1997), the \u201cyes\u201d vote statement must state that result. We disagree with the Attorney General that it suffices to mention the trust fund for the first time in the \u201cno\u201d vote result statement, leaving the voters to draw the inference about creation of the trust fund. Accordingly, we modify the Attorney General\u2019s \u201cyes\u201d vote result statement as follows: RESULT OF \u201cYES\u201d VOTE: \u201cYes\u201d vote creates tobacco settlement trust fund; earnings dedicated to low-income health care.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Our modification of the \u201cyes\u201d vote result statement obviates petitioner Patterson\u2019s challenge to the \u201cno\u201d vote result statement. As noted, petitioner Lowe does not challenge the \u201cno\u201d vote result statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Regarding the Attorney General\u2019s certified summary, petitioner Patterson suggests a variety of ways in which he thinks that the summary could be written <em>better, </em>but he fails to demonstrate that the Attorney General\u2019s summary fails to comply substantially with the requirements of ORS 250.035(2)(d) (1997). Petitioner Lowe agrees that the Attorney General\u2019s summary complies with the statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">We certify to the Secretary of State the following ballot title:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>DEDICATES TOBACCO-SETTLEMENT PROCEEDS; EARNINGS FUND LOW-INCOME HEALTH CARE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">RESULT OF \u201cYES\u201d VOTE: \u201cYes\u201d vote creates tobacco settlement trust fund; earnings dedicated to low-income health care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-6\">RESULT OF \u201cNO\u201d VOTE: \u201cNo\u201d vote leaves use of tobacco-settlement proceeds unrestricted, rejects creation of health trust fund.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-7\">SUMMARY: Currently, use of proceeds from settlement with tobacco products manufacturers is unrestricted.

Kulongoski (Elections Division #13), </em>322 Or 15, 55, 902 P2d 1143 (1995) (Unis, J., dissenting) (arguing that judicial modification of ballot titles offends Article III, section 1, of the Oregon Constitution); <em>Sizemore v. Kulongoski, </em>322 Or 229, 237, 905 P2d 1146 (1995) (Durham, J., concurring) (same). The court should revisit that premise.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
