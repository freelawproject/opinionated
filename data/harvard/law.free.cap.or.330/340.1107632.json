Petitioners are electors who timely submitted written comments to the Secretary of State respecting the content of the draft ballot title for a proposed measure, designated Initiative Petition 156 (2000). They therefore are entitled to seek review of the ballot title that the Attorney General has certified. <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(2) (setting that requirement).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">We have considered each of petitioners\u2019 arguments concerning the ballot title certified by the Attorney General. We conclude that none establishes that the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title fails to comply substantially with the standards for such ballot titles set out in ORS 250.035(2)(a) to (d) (1997).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See ORS 250.085(5) (setting out standard of review). Accordingly, we certify to the Secretary of State the following ballot title:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-6\">AMENDS CONSTITUTION: APPLIES POTENTIAL FUTURE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION, EXPENDITURE LIMITS TO SPECIFIED ENTITIES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">RESULT OF \u201cYES\u201d VOTE: \u201cYes\u201d vote applies potential Oregon corporate campaign contribution, expenditure limits to certain other corporations, unions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-8\">RESULT OF \u201cNO\u201d VOTE: \u201cNo\u201d vote rejects applying potential Oregon corporate campaign contribution, expenditure limits to other corporations, unions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-9\">SUMMARY: Amends constitution. Current law allows unlimited campaign contributions and expenditures by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>Oregon for-profit corporations. Measure requires any future campaign contribution or expenditure limits applied to Oregon for-profit corporations to be applied equally to out-of-state for-profit corporations and to public employee unions, including any political committee or entity receiving public employee union funds used for political purposes or commingled with money used for political purposes. Measure\u2019s provision would not limit contributions, expenditures by certain nonprofit corporations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Ballot title certified. This decision shall become effective in accordance with ORAP 11.30(10).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b381-10\"> The 1999 Legislature amended ORS 250.035 in several respects. Or Laws 1999, ch 793, \u00a7 1. However, section 3 of that 1999 enactment provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-11\">\u201c(1) The amendments to ORS 250.035 by section 1 of this 1999 Act do not apply to any ballot title prepared for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-12\">\u201c(a) Any initiative petition that, if filed with the Secretary of State with the required number of signatures of qualified electors, will be submitted to the people at the general election held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November 2000M\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-13\">The present measure is one to which the 1999 act does not apply. We therefore apply the pertinent provisions of ORS 250.035 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
