The proceedings, which have been consolidated for purposes of argument and opinion, concern the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot titles for two closely related proposed initiative measures, denominated by the Secretary of State as Initiative Petition 137 and 138 (2000). Petitioner is an elector who timely submitted written comments to the Secretary of State concerning the content of the Attorney General\u2019s draft ballot title for each measure and who therefore is entitled to seek review in this court. <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(2) (stating that requirement). We review the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot titles to determine whether they \u201csubstantially compl[y]\u201d with the requirements of ORS 250.035 (1997).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(5) (setting out standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">We have considered each of petitioner\u2019s arguments concerning the ballot titles certified by the Attorney General. We conclude that none establishes that the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot titles fail to comply substantially with the standards for such ballot titles set out in ORS 250.035 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">We certify to the Secretary of State the following ballot title for Initiative Petition 137:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-7\">CHANGES WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION LAWS ON COMPENSABILITY, EMPLOYERS\u2019 DEFENSES, MEDICAL CARE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>RESULT OF \u201cYES\u201d VOTE: \u201cYes\u201d vote changes some workers\u2019 compensation laws about claim compensability, employer defenses, treatment before acceptance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-4\">RESULT OF \u201cNO\u201d VOTE: \u201cNo\u201d vote retains current workers\u2019 compensation laws about claim compensability, employer defenses, treatment before acceptance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">SUMMARY: Currently, workers\u2019 compensation law disallows benefits when off-work activities or preexisting medical conditions are the \u201cmajor contributing cause\u201d of a worker\u2019s injury or illness.
