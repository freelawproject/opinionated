Petitioners are electors who timely submitted written comments to the Secretary of State respecting the content of the draft ballot title for a proposed measure, which has been designated by the Secretary of State as Initiative Petition 126 (2000). They therefore are entitled to seek review of the resulting ballot title for that proposed measure certified by the Attorney General. <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(2) (setting that requirement). We review the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title to determine whether it substantially complies with the requirements of ORS 250.035 (1997).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(5) (setting out standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">We have considered each of petitioners\u2019 arguments concerning the ballot title certified by the Attorney General. We conclude that none establishes that the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title fails to comply substantially with the standards for such ballot titles set out in ORS 250.035(2)(a) to (d) (1997). Accordingly, we certify to the Secretary of State the following ballot title:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-6\">AMENDS CONSTITUTION: ADDS CAMPAIGN FINANCE DISCLOSURE, REPORTING REQUIREMENTS; RESTRICTS CONTRIBUTORS, CONTRIBUTION AMOUNTS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\">RESULT OF \u201cYES\u201d VOTE: \u201cYes\u201d vote adds campaign finance disclosure, reporting requirements, political committee regulation; restricts contributors, contribution amounts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>RESULT OF \u201cNO\u201d VOTE: \u201cNo\u201d vote rejects: additional campaign finance disclosure, reporting requirements, political committee regulation; restricting contributors, contributions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-4\">SUMMARY: Amends Constitution. Constitution now requires certain campaign disclosures, guarantees contribution methods. Measure adds disclosure, reporting requirements; prohibits laws restricting payroll deduction contribution process. \u201cPaid advocacy communication\u201d receiving \u201cpolitical committee\u201d funding must state names, businesses, contribution amounts of committee\u2019s \u201cdominant contributors\u201d; voters pamphlet must list political committees supporting, opposing each measure, candidate, with similar disclosures. Allows contributions, expenditures only from individuals, \u201cqualified corporations,\u201d \u201cpolitical committees,\u201d \u201cgrass-roots nonprofit organizations.\u201d Limits contribution, expenditure amounts. Allows voter-initiated enforcement lawsuits; provides penalties for violations. Defines terms. Other provisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Ballot title certified. This decision shall become effective in accordance with ORAP 11.30(10).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b235-8\"> The 1999 Legislature amended ORS 250.035(2) in several respects. Or Laws 1999, ch 793, \u00a7 1. However, section 3 of that 1999 enactment provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-10\">\u201c(1) The amendments to ORS 250.035 by section 1 of this 1999 Act do not apply to any ballot title prepared for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-11\">\u201c(a) Any initiative petition that, if filed with the Secretary of State with the required number of signatures of qualified electors, will be submitted to the people at the general election held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November 2000M\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-12\">The present proposed measure is one of those to which the 1999 act does not apply. We therefore apply the pertinent provisions of ORS 250.035(2) (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
