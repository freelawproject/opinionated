Petitioners are electors who timely submitted written comments concerning the content of the Attorney General\u2019s draft ballot title and who therefore are entitled to seek review in this court. <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(2) (setting that requirement). We review the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title to determine whether it substantially complies with the requirements of ORS 250.035 (1997). <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(5) (setting out standard of review). For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title does not do so. We therefore modify it and, as modified, certify it to the Secretary of State.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The proposed measure, titled the \u201cFirearms Act of 2000,\u201d would enact statutes that, <em>inter alia, </em>expand present provisions for background checks respecting the sale of firearms, provide limited immunity from liability for sellers of firearms if the purchaser causes harm to another, and alter criminal penalties imposed for the commission of certain crimes while armed with a firearm. The Attorney General certified the following ballot title for the measure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">\u201cINCREASES FIREARM TRANSACTION BACKGROUND CHECKS; REQUIRES RECORDS DESTRUCTION, SENTENCING CHANGES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-8\">\u201cRESULT OF TES\u2019 VOTE: Tes\u2019 vote increases firearm transfers requiring background checks, requires destruction of records, changes sentencing laws.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-9\">\u201cRESULT OF \u2018NO\u2019 VOTE: \u2018No\u2019 vote rejects increasing firearm transfers requiring background checks, requiring records destruction, changing sentencing laws.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-10\">\u201cSUMMARY: Extends background-check requirement to all gun-dealer firearm transfers, not just handgun transfers. Creates background-check requirement, with exceptions, for nondealer transfers at events offering over 25 firearms. Prohibits background-check fees; current law allows $10 background-check fee. For lawful transfers, generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>requires record destruction within 24 hours; current law authorizes record retention for five years. Creates minimum sentence for felon-possessing-firearm conviction. Revises statute governing minimum sentences for use, threatened use, of firearm during felony. Expands certain crimes; other changes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">As noted, ORS 250.085(5) requires this court to review challenged ballot titles for \u201csubstantial compliance with the requirements of ORS 250.035.\u201d As applied to the present proceeding, the latter statute<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> requires that a ballot title contain a caption of not more than 10 words that \u201creasonably identifies the subject matter\u201d of the proposed measure, ORS 250.035(2)(a) (1997), a \u201cyes\u201d result statement containing a \u201csimple and understandable statement of not more than 15 words that describes the result if the state measure is approved,\u201d ORS 250.035(2)(b) (1997), a \u201cno\u201d result statement containing a \u201csimple and understandable statement of not more than 15 words that describes the result if the state measure is rejected,\u201d ORS 250.035(2)(c) (1997), and a summary that is a \u201cconcise and impartial statement of not more than 85 words summarizing the state measure and its major effect,\u201d ORS 250.035(2)(d) (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">In case number S47166, petitioner Starrett challenges only the legal sufficiency of the Attorney General\u2019s caption. We have considered petitioner Starrett\u2019s arguments concerning the caption, but conclude that none establishes that the Attorney General\u2019s caption fails to comply substantially with the requirements of ORS 250.035(2)(a) (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">We turn to the arguments presented by petitioner Nichols in case number S47170. Petitioner Nichols challenges the Attorney General\u2019s caption, his \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>result statements, and his summary. We have considered his arguments concerning the caption and the \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d result statements, but conclude that none establishes that the Attorney General has failed to comply substantially with the requirements of ORS 250.035(2)(a), (b), or (c) (1997). We turn to petitioner Nichols\u2019s arguments concerning the summary.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Petitioner Nichols challenges the Attorney General\u2019s summary in two respects, one of which we find to be well taken. He asserts that the Attorney General\u2019s summary fails to summarize the measure and its major effect, in that it does not mention that the proposed measure provides for qualified immunity from civil liability for persons who voluntarily comply with the background check provisions of the proposed measure, even when such persons are not required to do so. We agree with petitioner Nichols that such a limitation on personal liability is sufficiently important to be deemed a major effect of the proposed measure that should be included in the summary, provided that there is room within the 85-word limit to mention it. We also agree with petitioner Nichols that there is such room. The Attorney General\u2019s summary expends 11 words on a sentence describing the fact that the proposed measure eliminates the $10 background check fee that the State Police presently is authorized to charge. The fact that the fee is eliminated might be a major effect; the amount of the fee under existing law \u2014 although useful information-does not rise to the same level as the limitation on personal liability. We conclude that the summary must be modified by deleting the sentence discussing background check fees and inserting the following: \u201cProhibits background-check fees. Voluntary compliance creates qualified immunity from civil liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AzV\">Based on the foregoing discussion, we certify to the Secretary of State the following ballot title:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-7\">INCREASES FIREARM TRANSACTION BACKGROUND CHECKS; REQUIRES RECORDS DESTRUCTION, SENTENCING CHANGES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-8\">RESULT OF \u201cYES\u201d VOTE: \u2018Tes\u201d vote increases firearm transfers requiring background checks, requires destruction of records, changes sentencing laws.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>RESULT OF \u201cNO\u201d VOTE: \u201cNo\u201d vote rejects increasing firearm transfers requiring background checks, requiring records destruction, changing sentencing laws.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-4\">SUMMARY: Extends background-check requirement to all gun-dealer firearm transfers, not just handgun transfers. Creates background-check requirement, with exceptions, for nondealer transfers at events offering over 25 firearms. Prohibits background-check fees. Voluntary compliance creates qualified immunity from civil liability. For lawful transfers, generally requires record destruction within 24 hours; current law authorizes record retention for five years. Creates minimum sentence for felon-possessing-firearm conviction. Revises statute governing minimum sentences for use, threatened use, of firearm during felony. Expands certain crimes; other changes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Ballot title certified as modified. This decision shall become effective in accordance with ORAP 11.30(10).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b185-7\"> The 1999 Legislature amended ORS 250.035(2) in several respects. Or Laws 1999, ch 793, \u00a7 1. However, section 3 of that 1999 enactment provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-9\">\u201c(1) The amendments to ORS 250.035 by section 1 of this 1999 Act do not apply to any ballot title prepared for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-10\">\u201c(a) Any initiative petition that, if filed with the Secretary of State with the required number of signatures of qualified electors, will be submitted to the people at the general election held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November 20001.1\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">The present proposed measure is one of those to which the 1999 act does not apply. We therefore apply the pertinent provisions of ORS 250.03512) (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b187-6\">VAN HOOMISSEN, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ah5\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">I respectfully dissent. In my view, the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title substantially complies with the requirements of ORS 250.035 (1997). ORS 250.085(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">The unspoken premise on which this court\u2019s modification decision is based is that it does not violate the principle of separation of powers for this court to rewrite a certified ballot title. <em>See Rooney v. Kulongoski (Elections Division #13), </em>322 Or 15, 55, 902 P2d 1143 (1995) (Unis, J., dissenting) (arguing that judicial modification of ballot titles offends Article III, section 1, of the Oregon Constitution); <em>Sizemore v. Kulongoski, </em>322 Or 229, 237, 905 P2d 1146 (1995) (Durham, J., concurring) (same). The court should revisit that premise.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
