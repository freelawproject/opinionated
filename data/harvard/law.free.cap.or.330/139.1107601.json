Petitioners are electors who timely submitted written comments concerning the content of the Attorney General\u2019s draft ballot title and who therefore are entitled to seek review in this court. <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(2) (setting that requirement). We review the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title to determine whether it substantially complies with the requirements of ORS 250.035 (1997). <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(5) (setting out standard of review). For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title does not do so. We therefore modify it and, as modified, certify it to the Secretary of State.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The proposed measure, entitled the \u201cGun Violence Prevention Act,\u201d would enact statutes that relate, <em>inter alia, </em>to the sale of firearms at \u201cgun shows\u201d and to the kind of background check respecting a potential purchaser that must be made before a firearm may be sold. The Attorney General certified the following ballot title for the measure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-6\">\u201cEXPANDS CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRING BACKGROUND CHECK BEFORE TRANSFER OF FIREARM</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-7\">\u201cRESULT OF TES\u2019 VOTE: Yes\u2019 vote requires background check before any firearm transfer at gun show or by dealer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-8\">' \u201cRESULT OF \u2018NO\u2019 VOTE: \u2018No\u2019 vote rejects expanding current background-check requirement beyond handgun transfers by gun dealers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-9\">\u201cSUMMARY: State law currently requires background check before gun dealer sells handgun. Measure requires: background check before gun dealer transfers any firearm; background check, or transfer through gun dealer, before nondealer may transfer firearm at \u2018gun show\u2019 (event with over 25 available firearms present). Noncompliance creates criminal liability. Authorizes confidential retention, for five years, of information obtained during background check. Expands crimes of providing false information, improper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>transfer, to include transfers of all firearms, not just handguns. Other changes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">As noted, ORS 250.085(5) requires this court to review challenged ballot titles for \u201csubstantial compliance with the requirements of ORS 250.035.\u201d As applied to the present proceeding, the latter statute<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> requires that a ballot title contain a caption of not more than 10 words that \u201creasonably identifies the subject matter\u201d of the proposed measure, ORS 250.035(2)(a) (1997), a \u201cyes\u201d result statement containing a \u201csimple and understandable statement of not more than 15 words that describes the result if the state measure is approved,\u201d ORS 250.035(2)(b) (1997), a \u201cno\u201d result statement containing a \u201csimple and understandable statement of not more than 15 words that describes the result if the state measure is rejected,\u201d ORS 250.035(2)(c) (1997), and a summary that is a \u201cconcise and impartial statement of not more than 85 words summarizing the state measure and its major effect,\u201d ORS 250.035(2)(d) (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">In case number S47079, petitioner Starrett challenges only the legal sufficiency of the Attorney General\u2019s caption and summary. With respect to the caption, petitioner Starrett\u2019s argument does not establish that the Attorney General\u2019s caption fails to comply substantially with the requirements of ORS 250.035(2)(a) (1997). Petitioner Starrett\u2019s challenge to the Attorney General\u2019s summary is not one that he (or any other party) made during the period for comment on the Attorney General\u2019s draft ballot title; neither is it aimed at wording either inserted in or deleted from the ballot title after that comment period. We therefore do not consider it. <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(6) (in review process, court shall not consider \u201carguments * * * not presented in writing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>to the Secretary of State unless the * * * argument concerns language added to or removed from the draft title after expiration of the comment period\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">We turn to the arguments presented by petitioner Nichols in case number S47085. Petitioner Nichols challenges the Attorney General\u2019s \u201cno\u201d result statement and his summary. We address each of those topics in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">As noted, the Attorney General\u2019s certified \u201cno\u201d result statement provides: \u201c \u2018No\u2019 vote rejects expanding current background-check requirement beyond handgun transfers by gun dealers.\u201d That statement is erroneous, petitioner Nichols asserts, because \u201cit suggests that a \u2018No\u2019 vote would result in a situation in which background checks were not required for purchasers of firearms other than handguns.\u201d Petitioner Nichols acknowledges that the \u201csuggestion\u201d about which he complains would be correct with respect to <em>Oregon </em>law, if the proposed measure is rejected. But, he points out, <em>federal </em>law presently requires background checks for the sale of firearms other than handguns. <em>See </em>18 \u00dcSC \u00a7 922(t)(l) (requiring \u201ccriminal background check\u201d for sales of \u201cfirearms,\u201d not just handguns).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Petitioner Nichols asserts that the Attorney General\u2019s \u201cno\u201d result statement leaves the erroneous impression that there is no other law regulating the sale of firearms. That erroneous implication can be avoided, he claims, by mentioning \u201cOregon\u201d specifically in the \u201cno\u201d result statement. (The statement contains only 14 words. Adding \u201cOregon\u201d between the words \u201ccurrent\u201d and \u201cbackground\u201d would clarify for the voters that they are making a choice as to Oregon law only.) That argument is well taken. As presently written, the Attorney General\u2019s \u201cno\u201d result statement creates the impression that only handguns presently are subject to background checks before purchase. Because that impression is incorrect and need not be created within the 15-word limit for the \u201cno\u201d result statement, it must be corrected for the statement to comply with the requirements of ORS 250.035(2)(c) (1997). Accordingly, we make that addition.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>The addition to the \u201cno\u201d result statement in turn dictates a change to the \u201cyes\u201d result statement, to further the parallelism that ORS 250.035(2)(b) and (c) (1997) are intended to reflect. We make that change by substituting the words, \u201cexpands Oregon\u201d for \u201crequires\u201d in the \u201cyes\u201d result statement and by deleting the word \u201cany\u201d from that statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">Petitioner Nichols also challenges the Attorney General\u2019s summary in three respects, only one of which requires discussion. Petitioner Nichols challenges the accuracy of the sentence in the summary that states that the proposed measure \u201c[authorizes confidential retention, for five years, of information obtained during background check.\u201d That sentence is based on the impact of section 6(5)(b) of the proposed measure, which provides that the information obtained in background checks is \u201cexempt from disclosure under public records law.\u201d But, as petitioner Nichols points out, Oregon\u2019s Public Records Law, ORS 192.410 <em>et seq., </em>is a law that guarantees a right to public inspection of certain public records. Nothing in that law, however, denies a state agency the right to disclose other information in its possession. Thus, although the information collected in background checks need not be disclosed under the Public Records Law, the proposed measure does not deny to any agency in possession of that information the right to disseminate the information as the agency finds appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Petitioner Nichols\u2019s point is well taken. The proposed measure does keep background check information from being subject to disclosure under a demand under the Public Records Law, but it does not thereby render retention of that information \u201cconfidential,\u201d as the summary states. To comply with the requirements of ORS 250.035(2)(d) (1997), it is necessary to rephrase the sentence to describe what the measure does, while omitting the \u201cconfidential\u201d characterization.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Based on the foregoing discussion, we certify to the Secretary of State the following ballot title:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>EXPANDS CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRING BACKGROUND CHECK BEFORE TRANSFER OF FIREARM</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYB\">RESULT OF \u201cYES\u201d VOTE: \u2018Yes\u201d vote expands Oregon background check before firearm transfer at gun show or by dealer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\">RESULT OF \u201cNO\u201d VOTE: \u201cNo\u201d vote rejects expanding current Oregon background-check requirement beyond handgun transfers by gun dealers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\">SUMMARY: State law currently requires background check before gun dealer sells handgun. Measure requires: background check before gun dealer transfers any firearm; background check, or transfer through gun dealer, before nondealer may transfer firearm at \u201cgun show\u201d (event with over 25 available firearms present). Noncompliance creates criminal liability. Retains background information five years; bars disclosure under Public Records Law. Expands crimes of providing false information, improper transfer, to include transfers of all firearms, not just handguns. Other changes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Ballot title certified as modified. This decision shall become effective in accordance with ORAP 11.30(10).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b177-6\"> The 1999 Legislature amended ORS 250.035(2) in several respects. Or Laws 1999, ch 793, \u00a7 1. However, section 3 of that 1999 enactment provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-8\">\u201c(1) The amendments to ORS 250.035 by section 1 of this 1999 Act do not apply to any ballot title prepared for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-9\">\u201c(a) Any initiative petition that, if filed with the Secretary of State with the required number of signatures of qualified electors, will be submitted to the people at the general election held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November 20001.1\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">The present proposed measure is one of those to which the 1999 act does not apply. We therefore apply the pertinent provisions of ORS 250.035(2) (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b180-8\">VAN HOOMISSEN, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AHf\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">I respectfully dissent. In my view, the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title substantially complies with the requirements of ORS 250.035 (1997). ORS 250.085(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">The unspoken premise on which this court\u2019s modification decision is based is that it does not violate the principle of separation of powers for this court to rewrite a certified ballot title. <em>See Rooney v. Kulongoski (Elections Division #13), </em>322 Or 15, 55, 902 P2d 1143 (1995) (Unis, J., dissenting) (arguing that judicial modification of ballot titles offends Article III, section 1, of the Oregon Constitution); <em>Sizemore v. Kulongoski, </em>322 Or 229, 237, 905 P2d 1146 (1995) (Durham, J., concurring) (same). The court should revisit that premise.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
