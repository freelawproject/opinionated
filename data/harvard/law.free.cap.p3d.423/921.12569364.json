In its order, the superior court ruled that First Student's income from transporting students under contracts with various school districts is properly taxed under the Business and Occupation (B&amp;O) tax, but not the Public Utility Tax (PUT).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 First Student claims that it provides transportation services to school districts on a \"for hire\" basis and, therefore, should be taxable under the motor and urban transportation business PUT classifications instead of the B&amp;O tax classification.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   First Student argues that the term \"for hire\" is plain on its face and unambiguously means \"services provided for compensation,\" bringing its services under the PUT. The Department interprets the term \"for hire\" by excise tax rule to provide that school bus operators are taxable under the \"other business or service activities\" B&amp;O tax classification. This appeal, therefore, revolves around the meaning of \"for hire\" contained in Title 82 RCW, a term not defined by the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 Concluding that the term \"for hire\" is ambiguous, and the Department's interpretation is entitled to great weight, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 First Student provides transportation services to organizations, including school districts, youth groups, summer camps, and churches, as well as other private parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Between 1990 and 2014, First Student regularly reported on the B&amp;O tax form the income it received for providing transportation services to school districts under the \"other business or service activities\" tax classification. Clerk's Papers (CP) at 110-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 On September 6, 2013, however, First Student requested a letter ruling from the Department regarding the correct tax classification for the revenue it received from its contracts with school districts. First Student explained that it owns and operates school buses and that its customers are primarily various school districts in Washington, including the Seattle School District. First Student argued that the Department should tax it under the PUT classifications, not the B&amp;O tax classification, because its \"school buses are motor propelled vehicles that convey students\" and \"are passenger vehicles for public use that convey students.\" CP at 128-29. The Department issued a letter ruling declining to change its longstanding interpretation that school bus operators are subject to the \"other business or service activities\" B&amp;O tax classification. CP at 134-35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 First Student filed an appeal with the Department's Appeals Division seeking reversal of the Department's letter ruling. While the appeal was pending, First Student submitted three administrative refund requests to the Department and sought to reclassify its income reported under the \"other business or service activities\" B&amp;O tax classification to the \"motor transportation business\" and \"urban transportation business\" PUT classifications. The refund request also sought the difference in taxes paid resulting from the Department's alleged incorrect tax classification. The Department denied the administrative refund requests, and First Student submitted a supplemental petition to the Department's Appeals Division appealing the refund request denials. The Appeals Division consolidated the refund requests into First Student's appeal of the letter ruling. After review, the Appeals Division issued a determination that denied First Student's consolidated appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 In accord with RCW 82.32.180, First Student then filed a notice of appeal and complaint for refund of excise taxes with the Thurston County Superior Court. First Student filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming its transportation services were taxable under the PUT classifications but exempt from B&amp;O taxation under former RCW 82.04.310 (2010). First Student also requested a refund of the B&amp;O taxes it paid between December 1, 2008 and December 31, 2014. In its response to First Student's motion for summary judgment, the Department requested that the superior court grant it judgment as a matter of law, arguing that the B&amp;O tax properly applies to revenues received by First Student for providing bus transportation services to school districts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 In response to First Student's requests for admission, the Department admitted that \"during the Refund Period the vehicles operated by First Student were used to transport people.\" CP at 26. The Department also admitted that \"First Student operates vehicles with passengers,\" but did not \"admit that the vehicles were 'passenger vehicles' because the term is not defined. Washington law distinguishes between buses and 'passenger vehicles.' \" CP at 26. The Department also admitted that \"during the Refund Period First Student received compensation for transporting passengers\" and that \"during the Refund Period the students transported by First Student ... were passengers.\" CP at 27. The Department denied that \"during the Refund Period First Student transported persons for hire.\" CP at 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9 The superior court found that there were no genuine issues of material fact. The superior court concluded that the Department was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because First Student's income from transporting students under its contracts with school districts was properly taxed under the B&amp;O tax classification \"other business or service activities,\" former\n   RCW 82.04.290 (2013), not under the PUT. Accordingly, the superior court denied First Student's motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment in the Department's favor. The court dismissed First Student's tax refund claim with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10 First Student appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   I. SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 11 First Student argues that the superior court erred when it denied First Student's motion for summary judgment, granted summary judgment to the Department, and dismissed First Student's excise tax refund action.

Former RCW 82.04.220(1) (2011). Business activities other than those that are specifically taxable elsewhere in chapter 82.04 RCW are subject to the \"other business or service activities\" B&amp;O tax classification.

If we accept the Department's view of the definition of the term \"for hire\" in the context of transportation services, then network telephone service would be subject to the PUT as a \"for hire\" service only if each user paid for each use of the service when it occurred. This is incongruous with customary notions of \"network telephone service,\" thus supporting First Student's position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 36 The Department urges that its interpretation that transportation provided by school bus operators is not provided on a \"for hire\" basis can be harmonized with the other related definitions in former RCW 82.16.010.

The Department argues its interpretation does not create conflict between different related provisions because the legislature's other uses of the term \"for hire\" involve public utilities unrelated to the transport of persons or property. The Department asserts that the only other definition in former RCW 82.16.010 that involves the transport of persons or property is \"railroad business.\" \"Railroad business\" means the business of operating any railroad, by whatever power operated, for public use in the conveyance of persons or property for hire. Former RCW 82.16.010(8). The Department claims there is no inconsistency in applying the interpretation that \"for hire\" requires the payment \"to be paid by such passengers.\" Br. of Resp't at 29.

By their nature, these enterprises are not all equally amenable to requiring payment for each use. Thus, reading \"for hire\" in the context of telephone service not to require payment for each separate use is not necessarily inconsistent with reading \"for hire\" to require payment for each use from bus passengers.

Review of the plain meaning and statutory context of former RCW 82.16.010 leads us to one conclusion: the statute remains susceptible of more than one reasonable meaning.

State Tax Comm'n , Business Tax Regs., art. 294.12 (1934) ). The classification included persons operating school buses in situations where the school district became the lessee of the vehicle under an agreement and where the owner of the vehicle entered into a contract with a school district to provide services. It similarly applied to \"certified or other licensed motor vehicle carriers operating, under contract, buses, carrying school children exclusively.\"\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
