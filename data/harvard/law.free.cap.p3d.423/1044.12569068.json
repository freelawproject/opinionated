The role of the judiciary is to interpret and apply those laws in actual controversies. The wisdom of a statute is not the concern of the courts. See\n   <em>\n    INS v. Chadha\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6196077\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/919/#p944\">\n    462 U.S. 919\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 944,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6196077\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/919/#p944\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6196077\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/919/#p944\">\n    77 L.Ed.2d 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We are asked today to decide what is meant by the subject-matter requirement in our Kansas statutes that a citizen-initiated grand jury petition set out \"sufficient general allegations to warrant a finding that such inquiry may lead to information which, if true, would warrant a true bill of indictment.\" K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 22-3001(c)(2). We are also asked to apply that interpretation to the facts of this case. We are asked to do this because Steven Davis filed a petition to summon a grand jury alleging that Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach and others engaged in various election crimes. The district court dismissed his petition, holding that he failed to allege\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   facts in his petition. Davis appealed. He asserts that in denying his petition the district court misinterpreted the statute in two key ways.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   First, Davis argues that the subject-matter provision in K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 22-3001(c)(2) is directory rather than mandatory so he need not list specific allegations. In other words, when the statute uses the phrase \"shall state\" in referring to the contents of the petition it really means \"may state.\" But, an analysis of the applicable caselaw leads us to conclude that the provision is mandatory. To be valid, a petition must comply with the subject-matter provision. So it must contain \"sufficient general allegations to warrant a finding that such inquiry may lead to information which, if true, would warrant a true bill of indictment.\" K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 22-3001(c)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Second, Davis argues that the district court misinterpreted the statute by requiring that his petition contain specific allegations of a crime, when only general allegations are required by the statute. His argument on this point is persuasive. The statute requires only general allegations, not specific allegations as the district court held. Moreover, because Davis' petition meets this standard, the district court erred in denying his request to summon a grand jury. As a result, we reverse and remand with directions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In August 2017, Davis filed a petition to summon a grand jury under K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 22-3001(c). His petition stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"The grand jury shall investigate\n   <strong>\n    Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach\n   </strong>\n   and any of his subordinates, employees, and other affiliated persons carrying out duties related to the management of voter registration data for allegedly:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Even so, the district court dismissed Davis' petition without prejudice, holding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"Wherefore, the petition has been reviewed by a majority of the district judges of the Seventh Judicial District pursuant to K.S.A. 22-3001(c)(3) to determine if the petition is in proper form. And, being well and fully advised in the premises, this court finds that the petition is not in proper form, based on the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"1. K.S.A. 22-3001(c)(2) requires that a petition contain, among other things, 'sufficient general allegations to warrant a finding that such an inquiry may lead to information which, if true, would warrant a true bill of indictment.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"2.\n   <em>\n    While the other requirements of K.S.A. 22-3001(c)(2) have been met\n   </em>\n   , the petition contained no allegations of specific facts that would warrant a finding that the inquiry might lead to information which, if true, would warrant a true bill of indictment.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Davis appealed. Davis gave notice to the Kansas Attorney General of the appeal, although there does not seem to be any requirement in the statute that the State or district attorney receive notice or respond. The Attorney General did not seek to intervene in the case. As a result, there is no appellee brief for consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    We examine the history of the grand jury process.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   To understand the grand jury process and the issues that this case raises we believe it is helpful to briefly examine the history of the grand jury system in this country and this state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The grand jury system predates our United States Constitution and has its roots in England.\n   <em>\n    Costello v.

In fact, the process has come under increasing scrutiny since its initial adoption. Critics believe that the grand jury process has become little more than a rubber stamp for prosecutors who present evidence to the jurors in secret, in hearsay form, with no duty to present exculpatory evidence. Witnesses are denied their right to counsel. Many believe that the grand jury process is not transparent enough and does not comply with present day notions of due process and fairness. Based on similar concerns, England abandoned the grand jury system in 1933. See\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

The sentiment of Sedgwick county is that grand juries cost a good deal and amount to nothing.\" The Topeka Capital-Commonwealth, February 12, 1889, p. 3.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   No changes were made to the law in 1889.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   For the next 124 years, only a few minor changes were made in the grand jury process. Instead of requiring the signatures of 200 county taxpayers, citizen-initiated grand jury petitions had to bear the \"signatures of a number of electors equal to 100 plus 2% of the total number of votes cast for governor in the county in the last preceding election.\" K.S.A. 22-3001(2). In addition, rather than a single judge, the statute required \"[a] majority of the district judges in any judicial district may order a grand jury to be summoned in any county in the district when it is determined to be in the public interest.\" K.S.A. 22-3001(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   But beginning in 2011, the process began to experience almost yearly modifications. First, in 2011, the Legislature expanded the grand jury provisions to allow a third way to summon a grand jury. H.B. 2031 (later incorporated into S.B. 55) allowed the county attorney or the district attorney to petition the court to order a grand jury be summoned. L. 2011, ch. 100, \u00a7 8; K.S.A. 2011 Supp. 22-3001(b). The only substantive testimony presented to the Legislature about the amendment was from the families of two crime victims. Minutes, House Comm. on Judiciary, February 8, 2011 (H.B. 2031), attach. 6-9. They argued that the secretive grand jury process was preferable to a preliminary hearing because the horrific evidence of the crime would not be available for public viewing-which only increases the personal trauma to the family and the possibility of poisoning potential jury pools. The changes were adopted with no further testimony. K.S.A. 2011 Supp. 22-3001(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The changes at issue here were made in 2013, along with several others. For the first time the subject matter of the petition was addressed.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   \"[c](2) The petition, upon its face, shall state the name, address and phone number of the person filing the petition, the subject matter of the prospective grand jury, a reasonably specific identification of areas to be inquired into and sufficient general allegations to warrant a finding that such inquiry may lead to information which, if true, would warrant a true bill of indictment.\" L. 2013, ch. 85, \u00a7 2.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Several people testified in support of the bill, including Secretary Kobach. Minutes, House Comm. on Judiciary, February 12, 2013 (H.B. 2182). The proponents of the bill were primarily concerned that the grand jury process had been improperly commandeered by prosecutors. Secretary Kobach explained the historical purpose of grand juries: a defense against unjust prosecution and an offensive tool against \"royal officials who were breaking the law.\" Minutes, House Comm. on Judiciary, February 12, 2013 (H.B. 2182), attach. 2. Secretary Kobach believed that H.B. 2182 would help Kansas' grand jury system remain consistent with its historical purpose. He argued that the bill would also allow grand juries to select special counsel or investigators, which would \"free[ ] the grand jury from dependence upon a prosecutor who may for personal or political reasons be attempting to steer a grand jury improperly.\" Minutes, House Comm. on Judiciary, February 12, 2013 (H.B. 2182), attach. 2. It would also \"allow[ ] the person who filed the petition for the grand jury to be the first witness, thereby preventing a prosecutor from steering the grand jury away from its intended purpose.\" Minutes, House Comm. on Judiciary, February 12, 2013 (H.B. 2182), attach. 2. And, he continued, it would \"make[ ] it more difficult for a prosecutor to keep a grand jury from hearing evidence.\" Minutes, House Comm. on Judiciary, February 12,\n   2013 (H.B. 2182), attach. 2. Other groups, like Kansans for Life and American Family Action, made similar arguments. See Minutes, House Comm. on Judiciary, February 12, 2013 (H.B. 2182), attach. 3-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Patrick Vogelsberg, a representative from the Kansas County and District Attorneys Association, presented the only testimony in opposition to the bill. He opposed the bill out of concern that the bill would \"allow special interest groups to micromanage and potentially politicize the grand jury process.\" Minutes, House Comm. on Judiciary, February 12, 2013 (H.B. 2182), attach. 8. Although prophetic, that view did not win the day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   With this historical frame of reference, we are ready to proceed with the issues raised by Davis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <em>\n    Shall means shall.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Davis' first assertion of error is that the district court misinterpreted the grand jury statute by finding that the subject-matter requirements in K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 22-3001(c)(2) are mandatory. Interpretation of a statute is a question of law over which appellate courts have unlimited review.\n   <em>\n    Neighbor v.

K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 22-3001(c)(1). There is no dispute that Davis acquired the requisite number of signatures in his petition. Subsection (c)(2) of the statute provides that the petition \"\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   state ... the subject matter of the prospective grand jury, a reasonably specific identification of areas to be inquired into and sufficient general allegations to warrant a finding that such inquiry may lead to information which, if true, would warrant a true bill of indictment.\" (Emphasis added.) K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 22-3001. Subsection (c)(3) imposes requirements on the petition's form. K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 22-3001. It also provides that \"[t]he judge or judges of the district court of the county\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   ... consider the petition and, if it is found that the petition is in proper form and bears the signatures of the required number of electors, a grand jury\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   be ordered to be summoned.\" (Emphasis added.) K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 22-3001(c)(3)(B)(iii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Davis argues that subsection (c)(2) is directory, despite using the word \"shall.\" In other words, we should read the word \"shall\" as meaning \"may.\" As a result, it is of no import that he did not set forth the specific factual allegations that the district court found necessary. He cites\n   <em>\n    State v.

As noted before, the subject-matter requirement in K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 22-3001(c)(2) was added by the Kansas Legislature in 2013. L. 2013, ch. 85, \u00a7 2. Prior to that, the only requirements\n   for citizen-initiated grand jury petitions were that they contain the requisite number of signatures and that one of the signers of each paper containing voter signatures verified \"upon oath ... that such signer believes that the statements in the petition are true.\" K.S.A. 2012 Supp. 22-3001(c). But the statute did not specify which statements must be made in the petition. K.S.A. 2012 Supp. 22-3001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The legislative history surrounding the adoption of H.B. 2164 (2013) (originally proposed as H.B. 2182) does not explain the meaning of the subject-matter requirement. As previously outlined, other revisions were discussed, but the subject-matter language was included without discussion. In this situation, it is best to assume that the Legislature knew what it meant when it used the unambiguous, mandatory word \"shall\" in the bill. See\n   <em>\n    Walker v. Brizendine\n   </em>\n   , No. 114776,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205012505\">\n    2016 WL 5012505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (Kan.

We thus proceed from the apparently unambiguous use of the word shall as requiring the district court to take a specific course of action.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The subject-matter provision also appears elsewhere in the statute. Upon summoning a grand jury, the district court must provide instructions. K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 22-3001(c)(4). These instructions \"shall include\" but are not limited to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   \"(A) You have been impaneled as a grand jury pursuant to a citizens' petition filed in this court, signed by (insert number) qualified electors of this county, stating (insert the subject matter described in the petition, including a reasonably specific identification of the areas to be inquired into and the allegations sufficient to warrant a finding that the grand jury's inquiry may lead to information which, if true, would warrant a true bill of indictment).

While the general rule is that statutes dealing only with form or procedure are not mandatory, that is not the case here. The Legislature provided a penalty for failure to follow the form requirements in a citizen-initiated grand jury petition: dismissal of the petition. The statute states that \"if it is found that the petition is\n   <em>\n    in proper form\n   </em>\n   and bears the signatures of the required number of electors, a grand jury shall be ordered to be summoned.\" (Emphasis added.)

There, the State brought an action to the Kansas Supreme Court asking it to declare a Wichita city ordinance null and void. The ordinance essentially decreased penalties for first-time marijuana possession offenses. The ordinance was proposed by a group called Marijuana Reform Initiative, and that group had filed a petition containing thousands of signatures with the Wichita city clerk proposing the change to the municipal code. When Wichita received notice that the petition contained the requisite number of signatures of qualified electors, the city submitted the issue to voters in a special election. A majority of Wichita's electorate approved the ballot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   One of the State's arguments was that the ordinance \"was not adopted in accordance with the procedures set out in K.S.A. 12-3013(a).\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12416048\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/303/650/\">\n    303 Kan. at 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12416048\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/303/650/\">\n    367 P.3d 282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That statute stated that \"a proposed ordinance may be submitted to the governing body of any city accompanied by a petition as provided by this section. ... Such ordinance and petition shall be filed with the city clerk.\" K.S.A. 12-3013(a). The petition that was circulated among voters did not fully set forth\n   the language of the proposed ordinance. Additionally, when the petition was filed with the city clerk it was not accompanied by a copy of the proposed ordinance. Wichita agreed that the failure to file a copy of the proposed ordinance with the city clerk violated the language of the statute. But it argued that the initiative's submission substantially complied with the law and that should have been enough.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Supreme Court agreed with the State. It noted several places within the statute that \"the legislature ha[d] expressly linked the petition to the proposed ordinance through some form of the word 'accompany.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12416048\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/303/650/\">\n    303 Kan. at 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12416048\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/303/650/\">\n    367 P.3d 282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The subject-matter provision provides a way to ensure that the people signing the petition to summon a grand jury know what they are supporting. It also helps ensure that the petition will allege some claim which, if true, could lead to issuing a true indictment. That way courts and citizen jurors would not have to expend time and resources on an \"arbitrary fishing expedition[ ].\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. R.

The\n   <em>\n    Raschke\n   </em>\n   analysis points toward a reading of the subject-matter provisions of the statute as mandatory. The legislative history does not reveal that the provision is directory, suggesting that the Legislature intended the word \"shall\" to be mandatory. The fact that the subject-matter requirements are repeated in the grand jury instructions reinforces this interpretation. If the provision is substantive, then the second\n   <em>\n    Raschke\n   </em>\n   factor supports a mandatory reading. Even if the provision is procedural, the\n   <em>\n    Raschke\n   </em>\n   factors still support a mandatory reading because the statute does not allow a grand jury to be called unless the petition is in proper form.

So we must determine the meaning of \"sufficient general allegations\" using the plain language of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In ordinary usage, \"general\" is defined as \"lacking in details; not specific\" and \"not precise; vague.\" Webster's New World College Dictionary 604 (5th ed. 2014). And, an \"allegation\" is \"an assertion made without proof.\" Webster's New World College Dictionary 37 (5th ed. 2014). \"Sufficient\" is a synonym for \"enough\" and describes \"neither more nor less in amount than is needed.\" Webster's New World College Dictionary 1449-50 (5th ed. 2014). With this in mind, we could restate the statutory provision as requiring \"enough vague assertions made without proof to warrant a finding that such inquiry may lead to information which, if true, would warrant a true bill of indictment.\" This is decidedly different than allegations of \"specific facts.\" \"Specific\" means \"precise [or] definite.\" Webster's New World College Dictionary 1395 (5th ed. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The plain language of the statute does not support the district court's holding that Davis was required to make allegations of specific facts.

In other words, what is the underlying purpose of the requirement in the statute and what other procedures has the Legislature adopted that have a similar purpose? Because charging documents serve a similar purpose of providing notice of the allegations, albeit to those who sign the petition rather than to a criminal defendant, we find it useful to examine the requirements of charging documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Criminal defendants have \"a right under the Sixth Amendment to notice of the charge or charges pursued by the State.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

K.S.A. 22-3201(b). A charging document is deemed to meet this standard if it is drawn in the language of the statute. K.S.A. 22-3201(b). For example, it is sufficient to charge a person with the crime of drunk driving by merely alleging that the person operated a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol to the extent that he or she could not safely operate the vehicle. This is mere parroting of the language of K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 8-1567. It is not required that the complaint list the behavior involved like swerving around traffic, stumbling out of the car, or failing sobriety tests. In other words, it is not necessary to list the evidence of the crime in a complaint or information. See\n   <em>\n    State v.

But, as already discussed, the grand jury statute uses even broader language. It does not require \"essential facts\"; it merely requires \"sufficient general allegations.\" This is indeed a very broad brush. We find it impossible to conclude that the Legislature would require more from a grand jury petition than would be required for a prosecutor to present a case to a judge for preliminary hearing-the alternative process to a grand jury.

The Kansas Constitution establishes the position of secretary of state and contains provisions regarding elections and voting. Kansas Constitution, Articles 1, 4, and 5. The duties and responsibility of the secretary are outlined by statute. K.S.A. 75-401 et seq. In addition, Kansas has a comprehensive scheme of election laws contained in Chapter 25 of the Kansas statutes. The chief state election official is the secretary of state. K.S.A. 25-2504. As part of that scheme, the Legislature has established specific election crimes. K.S.A. 25-2407 et seq. Davis' petition alleges facts which closely track the language of three election crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   His first allegation states that the grand jury should investigate Secretary Kobach and those involved with voter registration for \"[d]estroying, obstructing, or failing to deliver online voter registration applications in violation of K.S.A. 25-2421a.\" That statute defines voter registration suppression as knowingly destroying voter registration applications, obstructing the delivery of signed applications to the appropriate election officials, or failing to deliver the applications to the appropriate election officials. K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 25-2421a(a). Davis' allegations align with the language of the voter registration suppression statute, meaning that if the grand jury uncovers information suggesting the allegations are true they would warrant a true bill of indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Davis' second allegation is that Secretary Kobach and others \"[p]ossess[ed] falsely made or altered registration books in violation of K.S.A. 25-2420.\" K.S.A. 25-2420(c) defines election fraud as \"while being charged with any election duty, and with intent to hinder, prevent or defeat a fair election: ... (c) Possessing any falsely made, altered, forged or counterfeit poll books, registration books, party affiliation lists, election abstracts or returns or any other election papers.\" While Davis' petition does not specifically allege intent, it does make a general allegation that Secretary Kobach possessed election materials in a way that violates K.S.A. 25-2420(c). An inquiry into this allegation could lead to information that, if true, would warrant a true bill of indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Davis' third and fourth allegations are that Secretary Kobach and others \"[p]revent[ed] qualified electors from voting\" and were \"grossly neglectful with respect to their election duties in violation of K.S.A. 25-2419.\" K.S.A. 25-2419 defines misconduct of an election officer as: \"[W]hile being charged with\n   any election duty[,] ... [b]eing grossly neglectful with respect thereto\" and \"[p]reventing a qualified elector from voting.\" K.S.A. 25-2419(a), (e). Thus, if the grand jury uncovers information suggesting that Davis' allegations are true it could lead to a true bill of indictment for a violation of K.S.A. 25-2419.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   While analogizing to charging documents is useful, we do not suggest that grand jury petitions must meet all the same requirements as charging documents. For example, charging documents must show that the crime alleged occurred within the statute of limitations and must allege the \"precise time of the commission of an offense\" if \"time is an indispensable ingredient in the offense.\" K.S.A. 22-3201(b). Davis' petition does not include the dates of the offenses he alleges. Even so, for two reasons Davis' failure to allege dates is not fatal to his petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   First, the grand jury petition and formal charging documents come at different stages of a criminal investigation. The grand jury is summoned to investigate possible crimes.

The fact that the citizen filing the petition need not have all the relevant facts is evident from the language of the citizens' grand jury petition statute. It states that the petition must contain \"sufficient general allegations to warrant a finding that such inquiry\n   <em>\n    may lead to information\n   </em>\n   which, if true, would warrant a true bill of indictment.\" (Emphasis added.) K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 22-3001(c)(2). The text of the statute envisions that the grand jury will uncover information which may not be discernable when the petition is filed. Charging documents, on the other hand, are filed by the State and contain information which was gained with the benefit of State investigatory services that may be unavailable to the general citizenry.

The New Mexico Supreme Court has also found citizen-initiated grand jury petitions to be sufficient that did not allege specific dates. See\n   <em>\n    Pino v. Rich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563553\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/118/426/#p428\">\n    118 N.M. 426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 428,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563553\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/118/426/#p428\">\n    882 P.2d 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994) ;\n   <em>\n    Cook v.

For this court to hold that Davis' petition is insufficient for failing to state the dates of the alleged offenses would limit citizens' ability to file petitions, and therefore investigate malfeasance, contrary to the Legislature's intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Second, another distinction between citizen-initiated grand jury petitions and charging documents is the purpose each serves. A charging document must include a time frame to enable a defendant to prepare his or her defense.\n   <em>\n    Dunn\n   </em>\n   , 304 Kan. at 815,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12416566\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/304/773/\">\n    375 P.3d 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that a charging document must \"meet[ ] federal and state constitutional standards for due process and notice, such that the defendant has an opportunity to meet and answer the State's evidence\"). This is not the purpose of a grand jury petition, as there is no defense lodged against a grand jury inquiry. The petition must merely state general\n   allegations which could potentially \"lead to information which, if true, would warrant a true bill of indictment.\" K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 22-3001(c)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   If a grand jury does issue an indictment, then it would have to comply with the mandate of K.S.A. 22-3201, which requires the indictment to state that the crime charged occurred within the statute of limitations. However, the \"general allegations\" requirement of the citizen-initiated grand jury petition statute does not require a citizen to state the particular time in which the alleged crimes occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Finally, the conclusion that Davis makes sufficient factual allegations is supported by caselaw from other states that have considered this issue. Two other states, Oklahoma and New Mexico, which allow citizen-initiated grand juries have a similar sufficiency requirement, and their courts have had opportunities to examine whether citizen-initiated petitions for grand juries satisfy the requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The Oklahoma Constitution provides for citizen-initiated grand juries. Okla. Const. art. II, \u00a7 18. In 1989, the state Legislature added sufficiency requirements.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Okla.%20Stat.%20tit.%2038%2C%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    Okla. Stat. tit. 38, \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Before gathering signatures for a petition to impanel a grand jury, Oklahomans must have the petition approved by the court. As in Kansas, the face of the petition must state \"a reasonably specific identification of areas to be inquired into and sufficient general allegations to warrant a finding that such inquiry may lead to information which, if true, would warrant a true bill of indictment\" in their petition.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Okla.%20Stat.%20tit.%2038%2C%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    Okla. Stat. tit. 38, \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If an Oklahoma court determines that the face of the petition does not satisfy these requirements, the petitioners have two days to amend the petition.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Okla.%20Stat.%20tit.%2038%2C%20%C2%A7%20102\">\n    Okla.

There, the petitioners filed an amended petition to summon a grand jury. The petition stated that the purpose of the grand jury was:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   \" '1.

It noted that the petitioners stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   \"1) the subject matter-the bombing of the Murrah Building; 2) the area to be inquired into-the identification of people who planned and participated in carrying out the heinous act; and 3) general allegations that would lead to an indictment-the murders of seven people for which no prosecution is currently pending.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11998506\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/935/1189/\">\n    935 P.2d at 1191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The Oklahoma case demonstrates that making sufficient general allegations is a low threshold. Petitioners are not expected to lay out the specific facts of the crimes; rather, they can merely allege that a crime, such as murder, has occurred. Here, Davis has also made sufficient allegations under Kansas' statute. He has identified a subject matter-election duties. He has identified the areas to\n   be inquired into-whether Secretary Kobach or others interfered with voter registration, prevented people from voting, or otherwise failed to carry out their statutory election duties. And, Davis has made general allegations which may lead to information which, if true, would warrant an indictment for violation of K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 25-2421a, K.S.A. 25-2420, and K.S.A. 25-2419.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   New Mexico courts have also investigated what allegations would be sufficient in a citizen-initiated grand jury petition. The New Mexico Constitution provides that \"a grand jury shall be ordered to convene ... upon the filing of a petition therefor signed by not less than the greater of two hundred registered voters or two percent of the registered voters of the county ....\" N.M. Const. art. II, \u00a7 14. Unlike in Kansas and Oklahoma, there is no statutory requirement that the petition contain sufficient general allegations which may lead to information which, if true, would warrant a true bill of indictment. Even so, the New Mexico Supreme Court has held that a petition must \"on its face delimit an area of inquiry that colorably lies within the permissible scope of grand jury inquiry.\"\n   <em>\n    Cook\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"731663\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/114/41/#p42\">\n    114 N.M. at 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"731663\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/114/41/#p42\">\n    834 P.2d 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It was apparently the opposite belief, that a prosecutor could just as easily thwart a grand jury process, that was the impetus for the changes that were made to the Kansas grand jury process in 2013. In issuing our decision today, we are mindful that the mere calling of a grand jury directed at the actions of a public official or a private individual without probable cause to believe a crime has been committed and without the guiding hand of a professional prosecutor can have serious personal and professional consequences. But the Kansas Legislature has determined that it wants to provide for citizen-initiated grand juries and it wants them to have broad powers to investigate possible criminal activity. The wisdom of this law is not a concern of our court. Our role, as set forth at the beginning of this opinion, is merely to interpret and apply the law as it exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The district court erred when it held that Davis was required to allege specific facts in his petition. The statute merely requires sufficient general allegations. Davis has met this standard. Accordingly, based on the plain\n   and unambiguous language of the statute, we must remand this case to the district court to summon a grand jury. In doing so, we make no judgment regarding the validity of the claims made by Davis. Whether Davis' allegations are meritorious is a matter for the citizen-initiated grand jury to investigate and determine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Reversed and remanded with directions.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
