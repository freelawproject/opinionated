Well-reasoned modern cases reject this bright line rule, recognizing that if a jury's discharge is rescinded within a short period of time and external influences have not compromised its impartiality, reempaneling a jury can be a more reasonable response to an error in a verdict than is the alternative of a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 Karrlee Clements appeals her convictions and exceptional sentence for first degree theft and first degree identity theft, arguing in part that her conviction for identity theft cannot stand where the jury, having completed a flawed verdict form, was momentarily discharged before being recalled to complete a corrected verdict form. Following a reference hearing and clarification of the timing and circumstances of the jury's brief discharge, we conclude the conviction can stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 For that reason, and because Karrlee\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   raises no other viable issues on appeal, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Catherine Clements worked as a nuclear operator for 24 years at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation. She retired in 2013, at age 55. She did not yet qualify for Social Security, but her house was paid off and until she did qualify, she planned to live frugally using assets in a 401(k) account that she held with The Vanguard Group.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 A couple of years later, Catherine's daughter-in-law, Monique, expressed concern about a conversation she had recently had with Catherine's daughter, Karrlee. Karrlee told Monique that she had withdrawn some funds from her mother's 401(k) account. Karrlee told Monique that withdrawals from the account were permitted for limited purposes, one being home improvements. She said that friends would provide her with inflated bids for improvement projects for her mother's home, she would withdraw the funds, pay the actual cost for the home improvement, and pocket the difference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 Assisted by her brother-in-law, who always helped Catherine with computer transactions, Catherine discovered that the registered user address for her online account with Vanguard had been changed from her brother-in-law's e-mail address to an address belonging to Karrlee. Using Vanguard's security questions for Catherine, they were able to access account statements and discovered that substantial funds had been withdrawn. The next day, Catherine and her son, daughter-in-law, and brother-in-law went to the Kennewick Police Department to file a police report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 Investigation by Kennewick police revealed that Karrlee used a number of e-mail addresses to access her mother's 401(k) account online. Karrlee had also applied for an American Express credit card in her mother's name and then created subaccounts, obtaining six cards in variations on Karrlee's own name. Through transfers from the 401(k) account, to the American Express card in Catherine's name, to a subaccount in a variation on her own name, Karrlee had withdrawn over $200,000 from her mother's 401(k) account between May 2014 and August 2015. Catherine eventually realized that Karrlee had tricked her into providing the answer to Catherine's security question for online access to the Vanguard account. Claiming to be preparing a family tree, Karrlee asked Catherine for Catherine's mother's unusual and unusually-spelled maiden name. Catherine provided the information but no family tree was ever prepared.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8 Karrlee was charged with theft and identity theft with aggravating circumstances: that the crimes were major economic and domestic violence offenses. She defended on the basis that the funds were withdrawn with her mother's permission, to be used for improvements to her mother's home. Karrlee\n   lived with her mother, and Karrlee's boyfriend had moved into Catherine's home as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9 Catherine testified at trial that she knew Karrlee and her boyfriend had undertaken some improvement projects in her home. But Catherine testified that Karrlee continually said her boyfriend was paying for the improvements \"[b]ecause he was gonna be livin' in the house.\" Report of Proceedings (RP) at 234.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10 At trial, the State offered photographs of projects Karrlee had undertaken on the house, many of which remained unfinished or had been finished poorly. It presented evidence that the home, which Catherine had since sold, sold for only $135,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 11 The jury found Karrlee guilty on both counts, and found both aggravators. When the jury returned its verdicts and the clerk read them aloud, however, the first and second verdict forms indicated a finding of guilt of\n   <em>\n    theft\n   </em>\n   in the first degree, neither addressing\n   <em>\n    identity theft\n   </em>\n   in the first degree-an irregularity that went unnoticed. A special verdict form for the major economic offense aggravator was predicated on having found Karrlee guilty of identity theft, however.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Clerk's Papers (CP) at 152 (\"We, the jury, having found the defendant guilty of Identity Theft in the First Degree return a special verdict by answering as follows ....\"). The jury had been properly instructed on the different crimes charged in count I and count II and the prosecutor had discussed the different crimes in his closing argument.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , RP at 322 (\"She's guilty of theft in the first degree. She's guilty of identity theft in the first degree. It is a major economic offense, and it was by a family or a household member. It's important to hold her accountable, and I'll ask you to do that by finding her guilty as charged.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 12 After polling the jury, the trial court told the jurors, \"You are all now discharged as jurors and discharged from my instructions regarding independent research and speaking about the case. You are free to talk to anyone you wish, and you're also free to decline to talk to anyone.\" RP at 343. The court went on to say, \"I always enjoy the opportunity to chat with jurors after a verdict,\" and invited them to stay if they wanted to meet after the court completed \"a little bit of business here in the courtroom.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2%20P.2d%20681\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court also stated, however, \"If not, you're sure free to go as soon as you hit the door.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2%20P.2d%20681\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The jurors were then escorted from the courtroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 13 The report of proceedings reflects what happened next:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (Whereupon the jurors were escorted from the courtroom.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I heard something from the clerk that sounded odd to me. It said Count II was theft in the first degree, and they found her guilty of theft in the first degree as Count II.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   THE COURT: The verdict forms, may I have them?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   THE CLERK: (Indicating.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   THE COURT: Count I is the theft and Count II is the identity theft.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That's not how I heard it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   THE COURT: Oh my. Oh my. Will you run and stop any jurors from leaving the building, please?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   THE CLERK: (Indicating.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: What is it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   THE COURT: They both say theft in the first degree. Verdict Form One says theft in the first degree as charged in Count I. Verdict Form Two says theft in the first degree as charged in Count II.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [To the lawyers:] You may be seated, if you wish.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I've never had this issue come up, your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   THE COURT: I have.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   THE COURT: Do we still have all of our jurors?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   THE BAILIFF: Uh-huh.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   RP at 344-45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 14 The court then told counsel that it believed the proper course of action was to recall the jurors, explain that there was an error in one of the verdict forms, not identify what it was, give them the four blank verdict\n   forms (with the second form corrected), and have them complete the forms a second time. Neither party objected or requested any questioning of the jurors about what had transpired following their discharge. The following then occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (Whereupon the jurors were escorted into the courtroom.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen, I made an error. Specifically, I made an error on one of the four verdict forms. So, I must tell you a couple of things. One, you are not discharged as jurors. You're still jurors subject to all of the instructions of the Court. Two, once we get the corrected verdict-once we get that verdict form corrected you will be given four new blank verdict forms, and my instructions to you will be to resume deliberations until you have reached your verdicts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Notice I'm not telling you what the error was because I'm afraid that if I were to do so that could be interpreted as my giving you certain instructions as to what to do, okay? So, Madam Bailiff will take you back to the jury room. In the meantime, these instruction forms-blank instruction forms will be prepared and you should have them within five or ten minutes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   THE BAILIFF: Do I have to bring the evidence back?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   THE COURT: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   So, it's just as if you had not reached any verdict. You are to resume your deliberations until you can reach verdicts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   And their notepads are still in the jury room?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   THE BAILIFF: Nope. I will retrieve them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   THE COURT: Okay, good. All right, why don't you accompany the bailiff back to the jury room.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (Whereupon the jurors were escorted from the courtroom.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   RP at 349-50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 15 Following a short period of additional deliberation,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the jurors returned the second set of verdict forms, finding Karrlee guilty on both counts and again finding both aggravating factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 16 After oral argument of this appeal, the panel ordered a reference hearing to take evidence and answer the panel's questions about events transpiring following the jury's initial discharge. The superior court conducted a hearing in which it heard from the deputy clerk and bailiff who were present for the trial, and from Karrlee's defense lawyer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on the testimony of the witnesses, all of whom the superior court found credible and to have a good understanding of the events, the court found that the following events happened at the following times:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-54\">\u2022 2:26 p.m. Court is in session for the announcement of the verdicts. \u2022 Between 2:29 and 2:32 p.m. Jurors were excused. \u2022 Between 2:30 and 2:34 p.m. Jurors were stopped and notified not to leave the building pursuant to the trial court's directive. \u2022 Between 2:31 and 2:36 p.m. Bailiff answers \"Uh-huh\" to the court's question, \"Do we still have all of our jurors?\"</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Findings of Fact Pursuant to Order for Reference Hr'g at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 17 The superior court found that between the time jurors were excused following the taking of the first verdicts and the time\n   they were stopped and notified not to leave the building, they were being taken to the jury room or were in the hallway outside the jury room. It found that the clerk told the bailiff not to release the jurors as the bailiff was escorting them to the jury room, at which point the bailiff had the jurors line up in the hallway in preparation for returning to the courtroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 18 More important than the time of day, which is necessarily a range, the superior court found that \"at most between 1-2 minutes elapsed from the time the jurors were excused and the Judge asked the clerk to stop the jurors.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. The court also found that it was only another 1-2 minutes before the bailiff returned and indicated to the trial judge that \"we still have all of our jurors.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. The balance of the 16 minutes was consumed by the jury providing its verdicts, being polled, being excused, and waiting in the hallway to return.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 19 The court made additional findings that the bailiff who served at the trial is strict about juror access to social media and has a practice of telling jurors to either leave their cell phones in their vehicles or use their phones only with her permission and with her monitoring the call. The court found no evidence that any jurors were in communication with anyone other than their fellow jurors and the bailiff before returning to the courtroom. It added that it is not positively known that there were no communications, however.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 20 The court imposed an exceptional sentence of 20 months of total confinement. Karrlee appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 21 Karrlee makes two related assignments of error to the second set of verdicts: that they violated her right to trial by jury and, if not, then her trial lawyer provided ineffective assistance of counsel by bringing the problem with the verdict form to the court's attention in time to cure the error. She raises two alleged evidentiary errors, two alleged instructional errors, and two alleged sentencing errors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   We address her claims of error in the foregoing order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 22 In the published portion of this opinion, we address only her assignment of error to the second set of verdicts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   I. ERRORS RELATED TO THE INITIAL DISCHARGE OF THE JURY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 23 Karrlee contends that reassembling the jury after its discharge and allowing jurors to return a second set of verdicts violated her constitutional right to a sentence authorized by a jury's verdict. But the harm she alleges is one associated with a different constitutional concern: her right to an\n   <em>\n    impartial\n   </em>\n   jury. We conclude that Karrlee's right to a sentence authorized by a jury's verdict is not implicated in this case. Her right to an impartial jury is.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 24 Dicta in\n   <em>\n    Beglinger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"845001\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash/164/147/#p152\">\n    164 Wash. 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2%20P.2d%20681\">\n    2 P.2d 681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , suggests that a jury's discharge is a bright line after which it cannot be reempaneled. The dicta relies on common law, but also reasons that jurors, once discharged, may be exposed to external influences. Insofar as\n   <em>\n    Beglinger\n   </em>\n   was based on common law, we find the 87-year-old common law to be outdated. Insofar as it reflects a valid concern about risks to a discharged jury's impartiality, it fails to consider that there can be instances when jurors are stopped and recalled before they can be improperly influenced by contact with other persons or sources of information. We take this opportunity to embrace and expand on the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    State v. Edwards\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1776270\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/15/848/\">\n    15 Wash.

In\n   <em>\n    Williams-Walker\n   </em>\n   , jurors in three cases consolidated for appeal returned special verdicts finding that the defendants committed crimes while armed with a \"deadly weapon.\" Rather than adding the two years to the defendants' sentences that was statutorily authorized for a deadly weapon enhancement, however, the sentencing courts added the five years statutorily authorized for a firearm enhancement-the aggravator with which each defendant had been charged. While it was implicit in the\n   <em>\n    guilty\n   </em>\n   verdicts that the jury found use of firearms by the defendants, the Supreme Court declined to hold the guilty verdicts sufficient to authorize the firearm enhancements, holding instead that \"[w]hen the jury is instructed on a specific enhancement and makes its finding, the sentencing judge is bound by the jury's finding.\"\n   <em>\n    Williams-Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4004348\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/167/889/#p896\">\n    167 Wash.2d at 899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=225%20P.3d%20913\">\n    225 P.3d 913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 26 Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   , which relies on\n   <em>\n    Williams-Walker\n   </em>\n   , the defendant was charged with child molestation in the first degree but the verdict form completed by the jury addressed child molestation in the second degree. The jury had not been instructed on the latter crime. As happened here, there was an error in the verdict form that was not caught when the verdict was returned. A week after the jury was discharged, and in response to a defense motion to set aside the verdict, the trial court corrected the verdict relying on CrR 7.8, convicting the defendant of the greater crime. This court reversed, holding that the defendant's right to a jury-authorized sentence had been violated. In\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   , as in\n   <em>\n    Williams-Walker\n   </em>\n   , the jury was not reassembled to enter a second verdict that would have authorized the defendant's sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 27 The trial court in this case was aware of the then-recent\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   decision, citing it\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   to the lawyers as the reason it was going to recall the jurors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   Let me give you the benefit of some law, okay?

The court explained that in some cases a court can make a correction, \"[b]ut this is not one of those cases because it has the wrong crime on the verdict form.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 346-47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 28 The constitutional right to a sentence authorized by the jury applies when the court convicts a defendant based on its correction to the jury's verdict rather than the verdict itself. Because the trial court in this case did not make a correction and based its judgment and sentence on the jury's second set of verdicts, the constitutional right to a sentence authorized by a jury is not implicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    B.

The common law required that juries be sequestered from the rest of society until they reached a verdict. This generally meant no going home at night, no lunch breaks, no dispersing at all until they reached a verdict. Courts are no longer required to impose these requirements on juries in order to prevent possible prejudice. Accordingly, while courts should not think they are generally free to discover new inherent powers that are contrary to civil practice as recognized in the common law, the advent of modern federal trial practice limits the common law's relevance as to the specific question whether a judge can recall a just-discharged jury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597482\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1885/#p1895\">\n    136 S.Ct. 1885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1895-96,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597482\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1885/#p1895\">\n    195 L.Ed. 2d 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <em>\n    C.

When a party has complied with requirements for advance notice and custodial affidavits, chapter 10.96 RCW allows business records to be admitted without the usual live authentication testimony from the record custodian. The statute applies only in criminal cases. It was based on legislative findings, set forth in the statute, that business records needed for criminal prosecution are \"often maintain[ed] ... in a location outside the state of Washington,\" and that the \"ability of law enforcement and the criminal justice system to effectively perform their duties to the public often depends upon ... being able to obtain and use records relevant to crimes.\" RCW 10.96.005.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   \u00b6 54 A party seeking to offer records under RCW 10.96.030 must provide \"written notice of that intention to all adverse parties, and must make the record and affidavit, declaration, or certification available for inspection sufficiently in advance of their offer into evidence to provide an adverse party with a fair opportunity to challenge them.\" RCW 10.96.030(3).

While the State suggested a $10,000 per month approach to arriving at the length of an exceptional sentence, the trial court's written findings of fact and conclusions of law provide different reasons for the sentence it imposed: the standard range sentence, which Karrlee did not dispute; the jury's justified finding that the offenses were major economic offenses; the monetary loss was substantial; the crimes involved a high degree of sophistication and planning; and the scheme occurred over a long period of time.
