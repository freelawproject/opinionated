SEIU 925 filed a complaint seeking to enjoin UW from releasing the records. The superior court concluded that the records at issue are not \"public records\" under the PRA, because they were not prepared, owned, used, or retained within the scope of employment. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    The Parties\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 2 The Freedom Foundation (Foundation) is a non-profit organization that \"seeks to promote individual liberty, free enterprise, and limited accountable government.\" \"Part of its mission is to pursue governmental transparency and accountability.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 3 The University of Washington (UW) is a public four year institution of higher education, an agency of the State of Washington, and has campuses in Tacoma, Bothell, and Seattle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 4 Service Employees International Union Local 925 (SEIU 925) is a labor organization representing public and private sector workers in Washington State. Purposes of SEIU\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   925 include organizing faculty at institutions of higher education in Washington State and providing representation as appropriate to its members and the individuals the union represents. SEIU 925 has worked with UW faculty in efforts to organize a union under chapter 41.76 RCW, which provides collective bargaining for faculty at public four year institutions of higher education.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    The Foundation's PRA Request\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 5 In December 2015, the Foundation submitted a request under the Public Records Act (PRA), chapter 42.56 RCW, to UW. It requested all documents, e-mails, or other records created by, received by, or in the possession of UW faculty/employees Amy Hagopian, Robert Woods, James Liner, or Aaron Katz that contained specified terms, including \"Freedom Foundation,\" \"SEIU,\" \"Union,\" and others. The request also sought e-mails sent to or received by the four named UW faculty members from the domain names \"seiu925.org\" and \"uwfacultyforward.org.\" And, it requested all e-mails sent from and received by aaup@u.washington.edu.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Foundation's stated purpose of the request was \"to ensure accountability and transparency among government employees using government-issued e-mail addresses.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 6 After receiving the PRA request, the UW Office of Public Records and Open Public Meetings (OPR) asked the named professors for responsive records. Professor Robert Wood, one of the named faculty members in the Foundation's request, sent records to OPR. OPR reviewed the records and \"was unable to determine that the records were not public records.\" OPR notified Wood that the records would be released, unless he sought a court order by April 26, 2018 preventing their release. The proposed release, records provided only by Wood, was 3913 pages of e-mails and attachments, the \"vast majority\" of which were e-mails sent to or from Wood's UW e-mail address, or to or from the AAUP listserver e-mail account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Complaint and Subsequent Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 7 On April 25, 2016, SEIU 925 filed a complaint for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, seeking to enjoin UW from releasing the records. On the same day, SEIU 925 also moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction to enjoin UW from releasing the records to the Foundation. Based on a proposal by the Foundation, the parties agreed that SEIU 925 would not seek a TRO and instead would argue the case at a preliminary injunction hearing. The Foundation agreed not to seek disclosure of the requested records and agreed to waive claims against the University for penalties and attorney fees for the period until the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 8 On June 10, 2016, the trial court held a hearing on SEIU 925's motion for a preliminary injunction and entered a TRO, enjoining the release of records, except those identified as \"public records.\" The order also directed SEIU 925 on or before July 6 \"to show by affidavit cataloging and describing with sufficient particularity as to the status of the records as public or not public records.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 9 In compliance with the trial court's order, SEIU 925 catalogued the documents at issue, identifying 102 pages of public records, and placing the remaining records into categories. UW sent the 102 pages of identified public records to the Foundation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 10 On August 5, 2016, the trial court held a second preliminary injunction hearing. The court entered a preliminary injunction, finding the documents identified as nonpublic records were not \"public records\" subject to disclosure. In its written order filed on September\n   23, the trial court found that SEIU 925 had standing to seek injunctive relief. Further, it found that the records at issue \"were not created within the scope of the employee's employment and therefore are not public records.\" And, it found that SEIU 925 demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims for injunctive relief:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (1) [SEIU 925] has established a clear legal or equitable right to nondisclosure of those parts of [the records] that have not already been disclosed as public records because they contain personal and private emails [sic] unrelated to the scope of Professor Robert Wood's employment at UW and cannot be categorized as public records; (2) a well-grounded fear of immediate invasion of that right by the disclosure of those records, and that (3) the release of those records will result in immediate, actual and substantial injury to [SEIU 925].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 11 On October 4, 2016, the Foundation filed a motion for reconsideration of the injunction. On October 12, the trial court denied the Foundation's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 12 On February 24, 2017, SEIU 925 filed a motion for summary judgment and permanent injunction. On March 27, 2017, the trial court entered a permanent injunction enjoining release of the documents at issue, finding that they were \"not public records as defined in RCW 42.56.010(3) of the PRA.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 13 On March 27, 2017, the Foundation appealed the order granting the TRO, the order granting SEIU's motion for preliminary injunction, the order denying Foundation's motion for reconsideration,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the order granting SEIU's motion for summary judgment and permanent injunction. On April 3, 2017, SEIU filed a motion to change trial date and for a stay of proceedings, pending the outcome of the appeal to this court. On April 7, 2017, the Foundation filed a combined motion to strike SEIU's motion and motion for sanctions, asserting that the trial court no longer had jurisdiction. The trial court denied the Foundation's motion to strike and for sanctions, and granted SEIU 925's motion to change trial date and for a stay of proceedings, staying the matter and continuing the trial until October 23. The Foundation amended its appeal, appealing the order denying its motion to strike and for sanctions and the order granting SEIU's motion to change trial date and stay proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 14 The Foundation argues that the trial court erred in (1) granting a permanent injunction, (2) granting a preliminary injunction, and (3) granting a TRO. It also argues that the trial court abused its discretion in granting SEIU's 925 motion to change trial date and stay proceedings and denying its motion to strike and motion for sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    The PRA\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 15 The PRA mandates the broad disclosure of public records.\n   <em>\n    Resident Action Council v.

But, laws such as the Educational Employment Relations Act, chapter 41.59 RCW, and the Personnel System Reform Act of 2002, chapter 41.80 RCW, make it an unfair labor practice for employers to try to interfere with or control employees' union activities.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   RCW41.59.140; RCW41.80.110.

RCW 41.76.050(1)(a) (\"It is an unfair labor practice for a an employer to[ ] interfere with, restrain, or coerce faculty members in the exercise of their rights guaranteed by this chapter.\"). Further, the employees' communications do not fall within the scope of their employment, even if in the future, these efforts affect appointment, promotion, evaluation, tenure, or state budgets, as the Foundation proposes. Documents relating to faculty organizing and addressing faculty concerns are not within the scope of employment, do not relate to the UW's conduct of government or the performance of government functions, and thus are not \"public records\" subject to disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Ambiguity\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 31 Finally, the Foundation argues that even if it was ambiguous that the e-mails qualified as public records, the trial court erred in not resolving the ambiguity in favor of disclosure. The text of the PRA and our case law is clear that courts are to liberally construe the PRA in favor of disclosure and narrowly construe its exemptions.

Here, this court must determine whether there was substantial evidence before the trial court when it entered the TRO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 42 Even assuming the TRO issued in\n   <em>\n    Fed. Way Family Physicians\n   </em>\n   is comparable to the TRO at issue here, the result is not the same. Before entering the TRO, the trial court reviewed declarations SEIU 925 filed in support of its motion for a temporary restraining order, including one from Wood, as well as declarations from Patricia Flores, Brooke Lather, and others. In his declaration, Wood refers to the union organizing in the documents. In their declarations, SEIU 925 organizers Patricia Flores and Brooke Lather put the e-mails into categories. Those categories include (1) those about union organizing, (2) postings to the AAUP UW chapter listserver, (3) e-mails between Wood and others not related to UW business, and (4) e-mails that mention SEIU 925 specifically. The trial court also reviewed declarations from the Freedom Foundation and Perry Tapper, a compliance officer in the OPR at UW.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 43 Based on these declarations, there was substantial evidence for the trial court to conclude that SEIU 925 had a well-grounded fear of an invasion of its legal right of nondisclosure of nonpublic records. It was reasonable for the court to conclude that the Foundation would not suffer harm as a result of a temporary delay in the release of any material that is subject to the PRA. While the trial court should have made a more complete order, any error in not doing so was harmless. The trial court did not err in entering the TRO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    SEIU 925's Motion to Stay and the Foundation's Motion for Sanctions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b6 44 Finally, the Foundation argues that the court abused its discretion in granting\n   SEIU 925's motion to change trial date and stay proceedings, and in denying its motions to strike and for sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Motion to Change Trial Date and Stay Proceedings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b6 45 The Foundation argues that the trial court no longer had jurisdiction to grant SEIU 925's motion to change trial date and stay proceedings, because the Foundation had already filed a notice of appeal, on March 27, 2016, of the permanent injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b6 46 A court's determination on a motion to stay proceedings is discretionary, and is reviewed only for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    King v.

In its order granting a permanent injunction enjoining UW from release the nonpublic records, the trial court did not address SEIU 925's claim against UW. For purposes of the appeal, the order granting the injunction was final for one party, the Foundation, but it had not addressed the unfair labor practices claim against UW.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b6 50 RAP 7.2 and 8.3 are intended to keep a case from developing branches in the absence of an appropriate order of the appellate court.\n   <em>\n    Burton v.
