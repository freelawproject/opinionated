Krikorian then negotiated a settlement with the District in which Miller released any potential PRA claims. Krikorian, asserting that the PRA claims were hers, later filed suit against the District for an alleged denial of her opportunity to inspect requested records. The trial court granted summary judgment to the District on the theory that Krikorian lacked standing to prosecute this action. We affirm, holding that Krikorian, as Miller's agent, did not own the cause of action and could not prosecute it once it was released by Miller.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 In December 2014, Erica Miller filed suit in the United States District Court against the District, alleging civil rights violations related to the seclusion and restraint of her autistic child. She was represented by Erica Krikorian of Creer Legal (Krikorian) and Brian Krikorian.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the course of litigation, Krikorian sent the District two PRA requests on behalf of Miller. Krikorian e-mailed the first request on February 12, 2015. The District produced records to Miller's attorneys in installments. On April 27, 2015, Krikorian sent an e-mail to the District both requesting additional records and following up on the first request. Krikorian threatened to file a lawsuit under the PRA based on the District's failure to produce records responsive to the first request, noting that the records were necessary for depositions in the civil rights litigation. The District produced records to Miller's attorneys in installments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 On June 4, 2015, Miller filed a motion to show cause in federal district court, alleging that the District wrongfully withheld records from her under the PRA. The district court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 On January 13, 2016, Miller filed another motion to show cause for a PRA violation. She requested that she be awarded $55,250 in attorney fees, noting that in the time since the original motion, \"another 75 hours of attorney time has been invested.\" The court denied Miller's motion, but the District was ordered to produce any remaining responsive documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 Miller's suit was tried in federal district court. The jury returned a defense verdict. Miller was ordered to pay $17,224.07 in costs to the District. Thereafter, she and the District entered into a settlement agreement in which the District agreed to waive execution on the cost bill in consideration for Miller waiving her right to appeal and releasing all\n   claims, including those under the PRA. In so doing, Miller and the District agreed to\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   hereby release, acquit and forever discharge each other, their employees, agents, board members, attorneys in this litigation, and assigns of and from any and all claims, demands, actions, causes of action, or damages of whatever nature, known or unknown, to the date of the settlement, including, but not limited to ... claims brought pursuant to the Washington Public Records Act....

Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. On April 5, 2017, the trial court granted the District's motion for summary judgment, dismissing Krikorian's PRA claims on the basis that she lacked standing. The trial court did not rule on Krikorian's motion. Krikorian appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 This case presents two related questions.

But we read the Act to provide for a single cause of action arising from an alleged PRA denial, regardless of how many individuals were involved in making the request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 11 If the agency fails to disclose records, then\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [u]pon the motion of any person having been denied an opportunity to inspect or copy a public record by an agency, the superior court in the county in which a record is maintained may require the responsible agency to show cause why it has refused to allow inspection or copying of a specific public record or class of records.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   RCW 42.56.550(1). This provision authorizes any person to file \"the motion\" if that person was \"denied an opportunity\" to inspect requested records. This reference to \"the motion\" establishes the cause of action for a PRA violation. The statute then ties the cause of action to the alleged violation: \"denied an opportunity to inspect.\" The PRA references a cause of action in the singular-\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   motion-and links that singular cause of action to the alleged denial while also linking the denial to the request. In so doing, RCW 42.56.550 provides that there is but one cause of action per alleged denial under the PRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 12 Having established that the denial of an opportunity to inspect records gives rise to a single cause of action under the PRA, we turn to this question: who is authorized to bring that action? Both parties in this case argue that this is a question of standing. While this is an understandable viewpoint, given the existing appellate court opinions on the matter, a standing framework is not useful here. The question of ownership of the cause of action is the more appropriate inquiry. In this case, the question of ownership is resolved by resort to the law of agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 13 The District's position is that Krikorian acted as Miller's attorney-agent with respect to the PRA request and litigation. The District contends that because Miller, Krikorian's principal, owned the cause of action and released that cause of action in her settlement with the District, Krikorian, as a mere agent, cannot maintain her PRA claims. The District is correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 14 \"Agency is the fiduciary relationship that arises when one person (a \"principal\") manifests assent to another person (an \"agent\") that the agent shall act on the principal's behalf and subject to the principal's control, and the agent manifests assent or otherwise consents so to act.\" RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF AGENCY \u00a7 1.01 ( AM.

In federal district court motions, Krikorian repeatedly represented that Miller made the PRA requests: \"Miller has been requesting documents reflecting the subject communications since January 2015\"; \"Miller submitted a second PRA request\"; \"Miller has been requesting documents reflecting the subject communications.\" A second federal court PRA motion referenced \"Miller's request\" and \"Miller's PRA request\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 16 These motions also alleged that it was Miller who was harmed by the wrongful withholding of records, and requested penalties on her behalf: \"Miller should have been given access to an electronic folder containing the requested emails.\" Alleging that the District wrongfully withheld records, \"Miller respectfully requests an award of penalties against defendants in the amount of $27,200 - $100 per day for each of the 272 days [that] have lapsed since April 14.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 17 Miller's PRA motions even requested an award of attorney fees. When arguing that \"Miller is entitled to an award of attorneys' fees\", the court was told that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [a]s a result of the District's conduct, Krikorian was forced to invest approximately 45 hours attempting to obtain the records and resolve this ongoing dispute. ... Krikorian has made every imaginable attempt to find a solution to this dispute and has granted every requested courtesy. Yet, six months into this action, Miller is still without communications having to do with her child and the District's use of aversive interventions. As such, Miller respectfully requests that this Court grant an award of attorneys' fees in the amount of $30,875, pursuant to the declaration of Erica Krikorian.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 18 The second PRA motion requests an award of even more attorney fees, explaining that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [a]t the time of the original motion, Miller had incurred $30,875 in attorneys' fees in connection with the dispute arising out of the Board Member emails. Since that time, another 75 hours of attorney time has been invested in the review of the subsequent productions, cataloging [the] nature and date of the content produced and in negotiations with opposing counsel for an informal resolution. As such, Miller respectively [sic] requests an award of $55,250 in attorneys' fees pursuant to paragraph 21 of the Declaration of Erica Krikorian.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 19 This is all clear evidence that Krikorian was acting as Miller's agent with respect to the PRA claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 20 Further, in negotiating the settlement between Miller and the District, Krikorian communicated with the District on Miller's behalf. Significantly, Miller represented in her settlement agreement with the District that she was the sole owner of the PRA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 21 In support of her argument that she owns the PRA claim, Krikorian points only to the fact that she, herself, e-mailed the PRA requests to the District. This is not in dispute. Rather, it provides additional evidence that Krikorian sent the requests as an agent on behalf of a client. The first request states, \"since we are in litigation, I am directing the request to you, as opposed to my client submitting the request directly to the district. However, if you prefer that she submit the request directly please let me know so she can proceed accordingly.\" And in the second records request, Krikorian discusses the federal court litigation at length, contextualizing her requests as being taken in furtherance of her client's goals in that lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 22 The records requests, federal court motions, and settlement agreement support that Krikorian was Miller's agent from the inception of the PRA request to its settlement. Krikorian acted \"on the principal's behalf and subject to the principal's control.\" She submitted the request on behalf of Miller, filed motions to enforce the requests on behalf of Miller, and negotiated the resolution of the PRA claims on behalf of Miller. By releasing the PRA claim as its sole owner, Miller demonstrated that Krikorian, as agent, was subject to her control. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Krikorian, there is no indication that she was anything other than Miller's agent with respect to the PRA requests and claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 23 Miller released the PRA cause of action in the settlement agreement. An agent derives from her principal only such powers as the principal has.\n   <em>\n    Schorman v. McIntyre\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"639304\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash/92/116/#p119\">\n    92 Wash. 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 119,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=158%20P.%20993\">\n    158 P. 993\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1916). Because Miller, as principal, extinguished the cause of action, Krikorian, as agent, cannot assert rights that Miller no longer possesses. Moreover, because Krikorian was Miller's agent, it is irrelevant that Krikorian was not a party to the settlement agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 24 In further support of this outcome, our Rules of Professional Conduct (RPC) militate against the inference that an attorney-agent would find herself as anything other than the client's agent in the prosecution of such a cause of action. These rules provide, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    CONFLICT OF INTEREST: CURRENT CLIENTS: SPECIFIC RULES\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    (a)\n   </strong>\n   A lawyer shall not enter into a business transaction with a client or knowingly acquire an ownership, possessory, security or other pecuniary interest adverse to a client unless:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (1) the transaction and terms on which the lawyer acquires the interest are fair and reasonable to the client and are fully disclosed and transmitted in writing in a manner that can be reasonably understood by the client;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (2) the client is advised in writing of the desirability of seeking and is given a reasonable opportunity to seek the advice of an independent lawyer on the transaction; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (3) the client gives informed consent, in a writing signed by the client, to the essential terms of the transaction and the lawyer's role in the transaction, including whether the lawyer is representing the client in the transaction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    (i)\n   </strong>\n   A lawyer shall not acquire a proprietary interest in the cause of action or subject matter of litigation the lawyer is conducting for a client, except that the lawyer may:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (1) acquire a lien authorized by law to secure the lawyer's fee or expenses; and\n   (2) contract with a client for a reasonable contingent fee in a civil case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   RPC 1.8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 25 Krikorian asserts that she has an independent propriety interest in the PRA cause of action that Miller attested to be hers alone. If this were so, Krikorian would be afoul of RPC 1.8(a). During settlement negotiations, Krikorian's asserted interest in a PRA cause of action was directly adverse to her client's interest in settling the case. The record lacks evidence that Krikorian made the necessary disclosures to overcome this conflict of interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 26 Moreover, if Krikorian had an interest in the PRA cause of action as a co-principal along with Miller, that would be in clear violation of RPC 1.8(i), because Krikorian's asserted interest does not involve acquiring a lien to secure a fee or contracting with a client for a reasonable contingency fee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 27 The parties refer us to three Washington cases that, while discussing similar issues as concerning standing, can easily be seen as consistent with the agency law framework that we utilize.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Germeau v.

The client later sued the city under the PRA. The city argued that the client lacked standing because the attorney communicated the request.
