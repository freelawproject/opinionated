In a separate capital sentencing phase, Appellant's jury found the existence of four statutory aggravating circumstances\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and sentenced Appellant to death. The Honorable Cindy H. Truong, District Judge, presided over the trial and pronounced judgment and sentence accordingly. Appellant now appeals his conviction and death sentence. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 On March 16, 2012, around 10:30 a.m., Appellant fatally stabbed Tia Bloomer inside the Metro Transit bus station in downtown Oklahoma City. Tia recently broke off her relationship with Appellant due in part to his inability to support their infant child. Appellant was terminally unemployed and drew as income a meager $628.00 a month in Social Security disability benefits. The couple too had a stormy relationship. The day before her death-March 15, 2012-Tia called Detective Jeffrey Padgett of the Oklahoma City Police Department (OCPD) Domestic Violence Unit to schedule a follow-up interview for an assault case in which she was the named victim. Tia previously denied to authorities that Appellant had assaulted her. Instead, she claimed another man had assaulted her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 During her phone conversation with Detective Padgett, Tia repeated this claim but agreed nonetheless to meet the next day. Later that night, Tia sent Appellant a text message stating the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   It's okay bc im [sic] going to tell the truth tomorrow. I'm tired of holding lies for yhu [sic]. Isaiah Tryon is the guy who choked nd [sic] nearly killed me Saturday.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (State's Ex. 38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b64 The next day, Appellant accosted Tia inside the downtown bus station while she was talking on her cell phone. Surveillance video from inside the terminal showed Appellant speaking to Tia before stabbing her repeatedly with a knife. Immediately before this brutal attack, an eyewitness heard Tia yell for Appellant to leave her alone. Appellant then stabbed Tia in the neck with the knife, causing blood to gush out from her neck. The surveillance video shows Appellant grabbing the victim then stabbing her when she tried to leave the terminal building. Appellant stabbed the victim repeatedly after she fell to the floor. The victim said \"help\" as Appellant continued stabbing her repeatedly and blood gushed out of her wounds. During the attack, several bystanders unsuccessfully attempted to pull Appellant off the victim. At one point, a bystander can be seen on the surveillance video dragging Appellant across the floor while Appellant held on to Tia and continued stabbing her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b65 Appellant released his grip on the victim only after Kenneth Burke, a security guard, sprayed him in the face with pepper spray. The security guard then forced Appellant to the ground, handcuffed him and ordered the frantic crowd to move away both from Appellant and the bloody scene surrounding the victim's body. A bloody serrated knife with a bent blade was found resting a short distance away on the floor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 While waiting for police to arrive, Burke checked on the victim but found no signs of life. Paramedics soon arrived and decided to transport the victim to the hospital\n   because they detected a faint pulse. Despite the efforts of emergency responders, Tia died from her injuries. The medical examiner autopsied the victim and found seven (7) stab wounds to her head, neck, back, torso and right hand. Several superficial cuts were also observed on the victim's face and the back of her neck. The medical examiner testified these cuts were consistent with having been made by a serrated blade. The cause of death was multiple stab wounds. In addition to these injuries, the medical examiner observed redness and heavy congestion in the victim's eyes. The medical examiner did not associate this congestion with the victim's stab wounds but testified it is sometimes found in cases of strangulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 OCPD Lieutenant Brian Bennett was one of the first officers on the scene. He removed Appellant from the ground and escorted him out of the bus station. Because Appellant had a great deal of blood on his hands and clothing, Lt. Bennett asked whether Appellant needed medical treatment. Appellant replied that he did not. Appellant said he was not injured and all of the blood on him \"was hers.\" Appellant was nonetheless transported to nearby St. Anthony's Hospital where he was treated for cuts to his hand. When asked by a doctor about these injuries, Appellant calmly responded that he had stabbed his girlfriend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 After being released from the hospital, Appellant was transported to police headquarters. There, he was read the Miranda\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   warning by OCPD Detective Robert Benavides and agreed to talk. During his interview, Appellant admitted stabbing Tia repeatedly while inside the bus terminal. Appellant said he stabbed the victim six times with a kitchen knife he brought from home. Appellant explained that he and Tia recently broke up and that they had been fighting over his support of their infant son. When Appellant saw Tia at the bus station, he walked up and tried to talk with her about their problems. Tia refused and told Appellant to get away from her. That is when Appellant said he pulled out his knife and began stabbing her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b69 Appellant claimed he did not know Tia would be at the bus station that morning or that he would even see her that day. Appellant did know, however, that Tia had some business to take care of that day. Appellant admitted bringing the knife with him because if he saw Tia, he planned to stab her. Appellant said Tia was facing him when he grabbed her and started stabbing her in the neck. Appellant described how he continued stabbing Tia after she fell to the ground and how he kept hold of her arm. Appellant said he was sad and depressed when he stabbed Tia because he didn't want to be without her. Nor did he want anyone else to be with her. Appellant did not believe he could find someone else to be with. Appellant admitted that what he did to Tia \"wasn't right.\" At one point during the interview, Appellant demanded protective custody because \"people ain't gonna like that type of shit\" and would try to kill him in the county jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b610 During the interview, Appellant asked whether Tia was okay. Detective Benavides promised to let him know about Tia's condition as soon as he found out. When informed by Detective Benavides at the end of the interview that Tia did not survive her injuries and was dead, Appellant showed no emotion to this news.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     JURY SELECTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b611 In Proposition I, Appellant complains that the trial court violated due process by limiting the questions defense counsel was allowed to ask of the prospective jurors. Appellant says the trial court improperly restricted the questions he was allowed to ask the venire panel concerning their views on both the death penalty and mitigating evidence. This, Appellant says, limited his ability to ask questions which would provide the information needed to intelligently exercise his peremptory challenges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b612 The Supreme Court has recognized that a critical part of the constitutional right to an impartial jury is \"an adequate\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   to identify unqualified jurors.\"\n   <em>\n    Morgan v.

In the first instance, defense counsel described for the prospective jurors a \"hypothetical situation\" in which a defendant is convicted of \"intentional first degree murder of a person who committed malice aforethought murder, planned it, intended to do it, did it of an innocent person.\" Defense counsel then asked:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   I want to know what each of your individual feelings are about the death penalty under that situation for a person who's guilty of malice aforethought murder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (Tr.

Illinois\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , to ask the challenged question. Defense counsel urged that he could only ascertain whether the prospective jurors would automatically vote for the death penalty if they first knew \"what first degree murder is. It doesn't involve heat of passion, doesn't involve some of the other things.\" The trial court stated it would provide definitions and sustained the objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b616 The trial court did not abuse its discretion in limiting defense counsel's\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   in this manner. In the challenged passage, defense counsel was attempting to ascertain what sentences the prospective jurors would give based on a \"hypothetical\" scenario drawn from the facts of the case.

The fact-intensive question posed by Appellant did not address this issue. There is a difference between 1) asking whether a prospective juror would automatically impose the death penalty, regardless of the facts of the case, upon the defendant's conviction for first degree murder; and 2) asking prospective jurors to prejudge the appropriate sentence in light of the supposed facts of the case.

When prospective jurors were excused, they were replaced so that thirty prospective jurors remained on the panel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b624 At the conclusion of the State's questioning, the prosecutor passed the panel for cause. At the conclusion of the defense questioning, defense counsel announced he had no further questions of the venire panel but refused to pass the panel for cause. Instead, defense counsel made a lengthy record complaining about the trial court's limitations on his\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   examination. This argument was based largely on the same issues raised by Appellant in Proposition I above. At the conclusion of this argument, defense counsel read for the court the names of twelve prospective jurors he said should be removed for cause in light of the trial court's restrictions on defense counsel's\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   of the prospective jurors. Defense counsel stated that prospective jurors W.T., N.M., M.V., La.H., B.M., J.F., Ly.H., A.F., K.T., D.W., R.G. and P.S. should be removed for cause. Notably, with the exception of A.F. and K.T., Appellant did not challenge any of these prospective jurors for cause earlier in the\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b625 The trial court denied Appellant's motion to strike these particular jurors. Defense counsel then requested nine extra peremptory challenges \"because you are requiring us to use peremptory challenges to kick people that should have been kicked because they were excusable for cause.\" The trial court too denied this request. Both parties then exercised nine peremptory challenges each, leaving twelve jurors to hear the case. Defense counsel used peremptory challenges to remove prospective jurors W.T., N.M., M.V., La.H., A.F., B.M., J.F., Ly.H., D.W.-nine of the twelve prospective jurors defense counsel identified just moments earlier as ones who should be removed for cause based on the trial court's limitations on the defense\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   . Ultimately, K.T., P.S. and R.G. survived the exercise of peremptory challenges by both parties and sat on the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b626 Appellant made a conscious decision not to remove K.T. with any of the eight peremptory challenges he used against prospective jurors who were, in effect, not properly challenged for cause.

The properly-admitted portion of the text message, combined with the domestic violence evidence introduced by the State during the trial's first stage, constituted strong evidence identifying Appellant as the perpetrator of this previous attack and showing motive for the killing. Moreover, the videotape of the killing itself represented overwhelming evidence demonstrating Appellant's responsibility for the victim's death and that the murder was committed with malice aforethought. Under the total circumstances, any imaginable error from admission of the third sentence in the text message was harmless and did not contribute to the verdict or sentence given the strong evidence against Appellant.

Rico Wilson is Appellant's brother. Rico testified that he saw Appellant standing in front of his mother's apartment around 9:30 or 10:00 p.m. the night before the murder and that Appellant appeared to be high on drugs at the time. Rico testified too that Appellant was \"probably\" drinking then because Appellant had been drinking earlier in the day. Rico saw Appellant several times previously during the week leading up to the murder. Rico saw Appellant snorting cocaine and using PCP earlier in the week.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b648 Eric Wilson is Appellant's cousin. Eric testified he was with Appellant and Rico on March 13-14, 2012, and when they were not looking for employment, he and Appellant were drinking and getting high on drugs. Appellant stayed at Eric's apartment the evening of March 14 through the morning of March 15. Eric testified that he and Appellant began using drugs early in the morning on March 15 and Appellant continued drinking and using drugs throughout the afternoon and evening hours of March 15. According to Eric, Appellant left around 3:00 or 4:00 a.m. on March 16-just hours before the murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b649 Prior to this testimony, defense counsel stated her intent during an in camera hearing to ask Rico and Eric on direct whether Appellant expressed any desire to harm the victim or otherwise expressed concern about getting a text message from her. Defense counsel argued that, with this testimony, she wanted to elicit that Appellant did\n   not make or express any threats towards the victim during the five day period Rico and Eric reported being with Appellant. This was to be part of defense counsel's strategy to counter the State's motive evidence relating to the text message. The prosecutor objected on grounds that any such testimony would be inadmissible self-serving hearsay. The trial court sustained the prosecutor's objection and ruled she would not allow this type of testimony. Rico and Eric testified the next day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b650 Now on appeal, Appellant claims the trial court violated his rights to a fundamentally fair trial and to present a defense with this ruling.

In the present case, Appellant's proposed evidence (we assume\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   Eric and Rico would have testified that Appellant had no reaction to the text message or simply did not mention it and that he did not threaten the victim) would at best call into question the State's theory of the motive for the murder. However, it does not refute the overwhelming evidence presented showing Appellant's guilt for Tia Bloomer's murder, including the surveillance tape showing him repeatedly stabbing the victim; eyewitness testimony describing this attack and the efforts needed to stop Appellant's attack; testimony concerning the victim's injuries; and Appellant's videotaped interview describing how he came to be in the bus station with a knife that morning along with his confession to repeatedly stabbing Tia and the reasons why-namely, his sad mental state upon their breakup as a couple. The defense was able to elicit considerable evidence from Eric and Rico regarding Appellant's extended drug binge over the five day time span leading up to the murder. Rico testified concerning Appellant's emotional condition over the loss of his relationship with the victim. Eric described Appellant's relationship with Tia the week before the murder as \"off and on\" and \"they just always have been off and on.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b654 We fail to see how the additional evidence championed on appeal might have affected the outcome of the first stage,\n   let alone called into question the State's considerable evidence showing malice aforethought. 21 O.S.2011, \u00a7 701.7(A) (\"Malice is that deliberate intention unlawfully to take away the life of a human being, which is manifested by external circumstances capable of proof.\"). \"Premeditation sufficient to constitute murder may be formed in an instant or it may be formed instantaneously as the killing is being committed.\"\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6984224\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/268/86/\">\n    2011 OK CR 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 76,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6984224\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/268/86/\">\n    268 P.3d at 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The jury too may rely upon circumstantial evidence to ascertain a person's intent at the time of the homicidal act.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . In this sense, it matters little for first stage purposes whether the motive behind Appellant's murder of the victim was his deep sadness over the end of the relationship or, instead, was an effort to stop Tia from identifying him to police as her attacker during the previous assault. The overwhelming evidence at trial shows the killing was committed with malice aforethought as alleged by the State even if the jury found the State's theory of motive unpersuasive. Thus, under the total circumstances, Appellant fails to show he was deprived of a fundamentally fair trial through the denial of critical defense evidence during the guilt stage of his trial. Appellant therefore fails to show a plain or obvious error affecting his substantial rights. Proposition IV is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b655 In Proposition V, Appellant challenges the admission of what he describes as \"numerous gruesome photographs\" during guilt stage. Specifically, Appellant challenges State's Exhibits 21-36, 41-49 and 51. Appellant argues these photographs were unnecessary because there was no dispute that he stabbed the victim to death. Appellant argues these photographs \"serve[d] no legitimate purpose other than to inflame the passion of the jury.\" Appellant tells us the photographs were more prejudicial than probative, unduly gruesome and cumulative, and deprived him of a fair and reliable trial and sentencing proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b656 We review the trial court's admission of photographic evidence for an abuse of discretion. Photographic exhibits are subject to the same relevancy and unfair prejudice analysis as any other piece of evidence. 12 O.S.2011, \u00a7\u00a7 2401 - 2403. As we have held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   Photographs may be probative of the nature and location of wounds ; may corroborate the testimony of witnesses, including the medical examiner; and may show the nature of the crime scene.

Neither Detective Benavides nor any of the officers at the bus station who interacted with Appellant observed any of the tell-tale signs and behaviors they typically associated with PCP use based on their training and experience.

Appellant never claimed during the interview that he was high or intoxicated or that drug or alcohol use was somehow responsible for his actions. Instead, Appellant calmly-and at times, tearfully-explained his actions as being fueled by the depression and anger he felt over Tia's termination of their relationship. Appellant asked if the detective would contact his mother, asked about the victim's condition and expressed his belief that he would be killed in jail for what he had done to Tia.

VI and XIV ; Okla. Const. art. 2, \u00a7 20. Towards that end, trial judges in Oklahoma are required to instruct jurors \"that it is their duty not to converse with, or suffer themselves to be addressed by, any other person, on any subject of the trial, and that it is their duty not to form or express an opinion thereon, until the case is finally submitted to them.\" 12 O.S.2011, \u00a7 581.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   \u00b682 In the present case, the trial court repeatedly admonished the jury not to discuss the case before releasing the jurors for mid-trial and evening recesses. The record shows Marva Banks, an assistant public defender not involved with Appellant's case, informed the trial court on the fifth day of trial that she heard three jurors (two African American males and a woman with blonde hair) the previous evening discussing witness testimony in the parking garage while they were all waiting for the elevator. Banks testified that two jurors were standing in front of her waiting on the elevator in the parking garage when a third juror approached and said \"I've never seen so much orange.\" At that point, the other two jurors started laughing and one said \"Yeah, there were so many family members that showed up in orange and it didn't help.\" Banks said the jurors' reference to \"orange\" was to jail orange. According to Banks, one of the jurors asked \"where was his mother? That would have helped.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   \u00b683 Notably, the last three witnesses before this purported incident were Eric Wilson, Roy Tryon, and Rico Wilson-Appellant's cousin, father and brother respectively. All three of these witnesses were in custody, and wearing orange jail garb, when they took the witness stand. Based on Banks's description of the three jurors, the trial court and parties questioned Juror C.E., Juror R.G. and Alternate Juror C.S. When R.G. was brought in for questioning, Banks stated R.G. was not the female juror involved. R.G. was then returned to the jury room without being questioned. Juror C.E. was brought in next and admitted saying \"I couldn't believe there was [sic] so many people in orange coming today.\" However, C.E. denied saying this on the way to the elevator or in the parking lot. Instead, he claimed to have made this comment upstairs in the courthouse the day before when the jurors were leaving as one of the witnesses in orange was also getting on an elevator to leave. C.E. testified that the man in orange had a \"weird\" stare.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   \u00b684 When asked by Judge Truong whether, when C.E. left the day before, he rode with anyone in the elevator on the way to his car, C.E. responded that he rode with Juror R.G. C.E. explained that he was waiting at the elevator with R.G. and then rode the elevator up with her and some other people. C.E. denied discussing anything about the case. When asked whether anyone mentioned too many people in orange or said they wished the mother was there, C.E. replied \"[n]o, not during there.\" C.E. then immediately corrected himself and recalled that he \"did say I wish the mother would have got up here.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   \u00b685 In follow-up questioning, the prosecutor asked whether C.E. had predetermined the outcome of the case; C.E. said no. When asked to explain what precipitated the comment about people being in orange, C.E. said it was because of the behavior of the person\n   in orange. C.E. acknowledged too that the defense had no burden of proof and had no obligation to present any witnesses. When asked by the defense with whom he was discussing all the orange, C.E. responded \"I had just said it out loud ... I just said that was a lot of orange.\" When asked whether there was discussion to the effect that all the orange didn't help the client, C.E. denied having any such conversation or ever saying it. However, one of the other jurors-he believed Juror J.L.-in response to his comment about all the orange told him \"shh.\" Additionally, C.E. said he made the comment about wishing they had heard from the mother to Juror R.G. When C.E. made the comment, he said R.G. \"just didn't say nothing. She just kind of looked at me and just acknowledged that I said something and that was it.\" C.E. denied that any other male jurors were present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   \u00b686 Alternate Juror C.S. did not recall walking the night before with Jurors C.E. and R.G. to the parking garage. C.S. denied saying to the other jurors anything about having made up his mind on the case. Nor had he talked to the other jurors about the case. C.S. also did not remember hearing the other jurors talk about the case. C.S. testified that he had not made up his mind on the case because he had not yet heard all the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   \u00b687 Banks never identified C.S. as one of the people involved in the conversation with C.E. At the conclusion of C.S.'s testimony, defense counsel stated that Banks thought the other male involved in the conversation may have been Juror Q.A. The prosecutor noted too that Banks gestured in a manner indicating she was not sure it was C.S. when he first entered the room. When Q.A. was questioned, he testified C.E. did walk ahead of him on the way to the parking garage the night before. Q.A. did not, however, hear C.E. talking. Nor had he heard any of the jurors discussing the case or indicating that they had reached a verdict. Q.A. denied doing the same. When asked by defense counsel whether Q.A. heard any of the jurors discussing what they saw yesterday as they were leaving, Q.A. responded that he only saw \"some shaking of heads, but no discussion.\" Q.A. clarified that no one was shaking their heads to each other but only in \"self-contemplation\" just as some had done when they were sitting in the jury box listening to the testimony. Q.A. clarified no one was talking about the case or deliberating in any way when they were shaking their heads.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   \u00b688 Juror R.G. was the last juror questioned. R.G. denied discussing the case with anyone on the jury. Nor had R.G. heard other jurors talking about the case in her presence. R.G. admitted using the elevators in the parking garage the previous evening but denied hearing anyone talking about orange. R.G. could not remember other jurors being around her as she walked to the parking garage. R.G. explained she \"want[s] to leave here as soon as possible when I'm done at the end of the day. I don't look or talk to anybody. I just want to get the heck out of here.\" R.G. testified the trial had been \"very intense\" and she \"just want[s] to leave\" after court each day. Hence, R.G. could not recall who she was with yesterday as she left. Nor did she hear any conversations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   \u00b689 The parties agreed to remove Juror C.E. based on his violation of the court's admonishment not to talk about the case. The trial court granted that request. C.E. was replaced by Alternate Juror C.S., the first alternate juror. Defense counsel objected because she said Banks thought C.S. looked closer to the man she saw than Juror Q.A. Defense counsel urged that the second alternate juror replace C.E. instead. Defense counsel also requested R.G. be removed from the panel. The trial court overruled Appellant's objection as to C.S. because he heard nothing and had not discussed the case with anyone. The trial court likewise denied Appellant's challenge to R.G., concluding that even if C.E. had been talking to R.G., her testimony makes clear she was not paying any attention. The trial court observed R.G.'s testimony that all she cared about was going home at the time and noted too that there was no evidence C.E. and R.G. had been discussing anything. Unsuccessful in his quest to remove C.S. and R.G., Appellant requested a mistrial which was also denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   \u00b690 In\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

During this testimony, the trial court sustained a hearsay objection to Dr. Musick's regurgitation on his direct examination of hearsay statements by Appellant's mother concerning Roy Tryon's violent conduct using a knife against one of Sheryl Wilson's boyfriends. This testimony was offered to show the facts relied upon by Dr. Musick in formulating Appellant's life story which, in turn, was used to support his conclusions and opinions.

This amended version of Section 2703 was in force during Appellant's trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   \u00b697 The trial court's limitation of Dr. Musick's testimony was driven by the compelling state interest of preventing a party from using an expert witness as a mere conduit to regurgitate large amounts of inadmissible and possibly unreliable hearsay. Appellant argues it was impossible for him to present a full social history to the jury in light of the trial court's limitation. The record, however, does not support this assertion. Appellant presented numerous first-hand accounts from several relatives and family members-including Sheryl Wilson and Roy Tryon-concerning the physical abuse and violence Roy inflicted on Appellant, Sheryl and Appellant's siblings as well as the turbulent, drug-fueled nature of Roy and Sheryl's relationship. Indeed, Roy admitted in his testimony to stabbing in front of the children a man whom he believed was Sheryl's boyfriend. Appellant presented mitigation evidence from the family witnesses concerning virtually every aspect of his life. This included first-hand accounts concerning Appellant's drug abuse; learning disabilities; educational background; prior incarcerations; prior head injuries ; suicide attempts; family background; mental health treatment and institutionalization; prior incarcerations of his mother, father and siblings; gang involvement; the crowded conditions at the family home; the fact the family constantly moved; the non-stop drug activity at the family home; the routine absence of Appellant's mother from the family home while on multi-day drug binges; Appellant's mother buying drugs from Appellant and his brother; Sheryl's physical abuse of her children; Appellant's drug dealing; Appellant's love for his son; the nature of Appellant's relationship with the victim; and the nature of Appellant's relationship with his mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   \u00b698 Dr. Musick's expert testimony was based in large part on the same first-hand accounts relayed through Appellant's family witnesses during penalty phase testimony. To be sure, Dr. Musick's opinions and conclusions were subject to extensive cross-examination and impeachment by the prosecutor, but we fail to see how this fact undermined Appellant's Eighth Amendment right to present relevant mitigating evidence-particularly in light of the large amount of mitigating evidence Appellant presented about every aspect of his life. Under these circumstances, Appellant was not deprived of his Eighth Amendment right to present relevant mitigating evidence based on the trial court's hearsay ruling. At best, the effect of the trial court's ruling was to disallow cumulative accounts by the expert witness that would needlessly prolong the trial. This was well within the trial court's discretion under the governing law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Postelle v.

This aspect of Proposition IX is denied as there is no plain or obvious error affecting Appellant's substantial rights based on the trial court's ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   \u00b699 Appellant's complaint that the trial court violated his Eighth Amendment rights by disallowing mitigation testimony from Pamela Wilson, Appellant's aunt, concerning domestic violence between Appellant's parents which occurred before Appellant was born also lacks merit. In the challenged passage, Pamela Wilson testified on direct examination to the controlling nature of the relationship between Sheryl Wilson and Roy Tryon. When defense counsel asked whether Roy had ever become physical with Sheryl, the prosecutor asked to approach and a bench conference ensued. The prosecutor objected to the form of the question, arguing the question would allow testimony about incidents of domestic abuse between the couple which occurred before Appellant was born. The prosecutor urged that the defense be required to limit its inquiry to those instances of domestic violence which Appellant personally observed because \"this is a trial about [Appellant] not about Roy and Sheryl's relationship. So it's only relevant if somehow that behavior morphed or shaped who [Appellant] is.\" Defense counsel responded\n   that she was eliciting testimony showing \"the foundation of when the behavior began, which does impact him, and how long it had began and how long it has happened\". The trial court sustained the prosecutor's objection and directed defense counsel to limit her inquiry to those incidents of domestic violence witnessed by both the witness and Appellant. Wilson went on in her testimony to describe incidents of domestic abuse which occurred in front of Appellant and his siblings, thus conforming to the ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   \u00b6100 During Sheryl Wilson's direct examination, the trial court sustained a similar objection to testimony concerning certain instances of domestic abuse between Roy and Sheryl. In this instance, Wilson acknowledged that the domestic violence she was asked to describe was nothing Appellant \"knew much about\". The trial court later sustained a challenge to testimony from Wilson concerning her drug use before Appellant was born.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   \u00b6101 Appellant complains on appeal that the trial court violated his Eighth Amendment right to present relevant mitigation evidence with these rulings. Appellant did not make these arguments in connection with the trial court's ruling, thus waiving all but plain error. Moreover, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in limiting the mitigation testimony. As discussed earlier, Appellant has a constitutional right to present\n   <em>\n    relevant\n   </em>\n   mitigation evidence during his capital sentencing hearing. Drawing on the general relevancy standard for the admission of evidence, the Supreme Court has held that \"[r]elevant mitigating evidence is evidence which tends logically to prove or disprove some fact or circumstance which a fact-finder could reasonably deem to have mitigating value.\"\n   <em>\n    Tennard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2524793\" index=\"269\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/274/#p284\">\n    542 U.S. at 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 124 S.Ct. at 2570 (internal quotation omitted). Thus, the state cannot bar \"the consideration of ... evidence if the sentencer could reasonably find that it warrants a sentence less than death.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2524793\" index=\"270\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/274/#p284\">\n    542 U.S. at 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 124 S.Ct. at 2570 (internal quotation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   \u00b6102 The trial court did not bar the admission of evidence the sentencer could reasonably find warranted a sentence less than death. The disallowed testimony was not relevant because it described incidents of domestic violence Appellant did not witness and that did not affect his development. This testimony, along with the specifics of Sheryl Wilson's drug use prior to Appellant's birth, was not evidence of Appellant's character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense. Moreover, defense counsel elicited from the various family members extensive testimony concerning the domestic abuse Appellant witnessed as a child as well as the dynamics of his parents' relationship. Defense counsel too elicited a great deal of testimony concerning Sheryl Wilson's drug use, including evidence concerning the drugs she ingested while pregnant with Appellant. The trial court appropriately limited the witness's testimony with the challenged rulings. There was no plain or obvious error affecting Appellant's substantial rights from the trial court's ruling. Proposition IX is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   \u00b6103 In Proposition X, Appellant complains that capital punishment for \"brain damaged and chronically mentally ill defendants\" like himself violates the Eighth Amendment. In urging a categorical exception from the death penalty for those whom he describes as \"severely mentally ill,\" Appellant compares his situation to mentally retarded inmates who are ineligible for execution under\n   <em>\n    Atkins v. Virginia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1255406\" index=\"271\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/304/\">\n    536 U.S. 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1255406\" index=\"272\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/304/\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1255406\" index=\"273\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/304/\">\n    153 L.Ed.2d 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002). Appellant argues too that mental illness \"is often misunderstood\" by juries who \"might believe, wrongly, that mental illness necessarily implies violence.\" This, in turn, means \"a mentally ill defendant cannot adequately wage a mitigation case.\" And because evidence of mental illness is \"often not well received by jurors\" this fact calls into question the ability of a capital sentencer to adequately conduct the individualized sentencing determination required by the Eighth Amendment. For these reasons, Appellant tells us a categorical exception is needed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   \u00b6104 We have previously rejected this claim and do so here.\n   <em>\n    Underwood v.

In the present case, Appellant presented expert testimony that he was low functioning and suffered both from mental illness\n   (most prominently depression) and brain damage. Appellant presented this testimony along with anecdotal evidence from family members concerning his cognitive and developmental limitations, his mental health treatment and his experience taking-then discontinuing-medications prescribed specifically for his mental issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   \u00b6105 Appellant did not assert an insanity defense at trial or otherwise show that he suffered diminished capacity to understand the nature of his conduct at the time of the crime. Appellant calmly described for police during the videotaped interview a few hours after the murder how, and why, he repeatedly stabbed the victim. Appellant's neuropsychological expert, Dr. John Fabian, testified Appellant was not mentally retarded. And there is no evidence suggesting mental illness prevents Appellant from comprehending the reasons for the death penalty in this case or its implications.\n   <em>\n    Ford v. Wainwright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6208971\" index=\"276\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/399/#p417\">\n    477 U.S. 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 417,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6208971\" index=\"277\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/399/#p417\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2606,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6208971\" index=\"278\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/399/#p417\">\n    91 L.Ed.2d 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986).

Here, the jury rejected this evidence as a basis for imposing a non-capital punishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   \u00b6106 We decline Appellant's invitation to hold that mentally ill persons are categorically ineligible for the death penalty. Appellant provides no workable standard to implement such a rule and one is not readily apparent considering the various forms of mental illness and their varying effects on different individuals. We reject too Appellant's suggestion that he was somehow unable to mount an adequate penalty-phase defense because of the so-called \"double-edged\" nature of mental health evidence. In the present case, the jury was adequately instructed on the consideration of mitigating circumstances and was presented a plethora of mitigation evidence by the defense to consider in determining the appropriate sentence for Appellant's crime. The value and worth of this evidence was ultimately for the jury to decide. \"Despite evidence that Appellant suffers from ... mental illness, we accept the jury's conclusion that he was morally culpable for his actions and deserving of the death penalty.\"\n   <em>\n    Underwood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6987124\" index=\"279\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/252/221/\">\n    2011 OK CR 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 69,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6987124\" index=\"280\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/252/221/\">\n    252 P.3d at 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Proposition X is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   \u00b6107 In Proposition XI, Appellant complains that his prior felony conviction was improperly used to support three (3) separate aggravating circumstances. This, Appellant argues, violated the Eighth Amendment requirement that aggravators narrow the class of persons eligible for the death penalty. Appellant complains too that using the same evidence to support three separate aggravating circumstances skews the weighing process and creates the risk that the death penalty will be imposed arbitrarily.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   \u00b6108 Appellant did not raise this claim below, thus waiving all but plain error. Appellant fails to show error, plain or otherwise. In the present case the State introduced by stipulation State's Exhibits 60 and 61, a judgment and sentence and docket sheet for Appellant's convictions on four (4) counts of Assault with a Dangerous Weapon in 2011. According to the judgment and sentence, Appellant received a ten (10) year suspended sentence on each count. These convictions were for Appellant's act of shooting at several people in a hotel parking lot. Evidence of the facts surrounding these crimes was independently presented from the police officer who witnessed the shooting. Evidence of Appellant's prior felony convictions was introduced by the State to support the aggravating circumstances that the murder was committed by a person while serving a sentence of imprisonment on a conviction of a felony; and the defendant was previously convicted of a felony involving the use or threat of violence to the person. Appellant's prior felony convictions were also relevant to show future dangerousness and, thus, the aggravating circumstance of the existence of a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lockett v.

We have rejected\n   the claim that use of a prior conviction to support both the prior violent felony and continuing threat aggravators constituted error. We reasoned that the same evidence, a prior felony conviction, may be used to support these two aggravators so long as the prior conviction covers different aspects of the defendant's conduct.\n   <em>\n    Hammon v.

Appellant fails to show a plain or obvious error affecting his substantial rights. Thus, there is no error, plain or otherwise. To the extent Appellant bases his duplicity challenge on the serving a sentence of imprisonment aggravator, this aspect of his Proposition XI claim is moot. We strike this particular aggravating circumstance in the next proposition of error and conduct reweighing in connection with our mandatory sentence review. Proposition XI is therefore denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   \u00b6111 In Proposition XII, Appellant complains that application of the serving a sentence of imprisonment aggravator in his case renders the aggravator unconstitutionally overbroad because he was not physically incarcerated when he committed the murder.

The difference between the present case and those previous situations where this aggravator has been approved is that Appellant's ten year sentence of imprisonment was not executed prior to Tia Bloomer's murder. That is because Appellant's sentence of imprisonment was\n   <em>\n    suspended\n   </em>\n   . Appellant thus was not serving a sentence of imprisonment when he stabbed Tia Bloomer but, rather, was serving a\n   <em>\n    suspended\n   </em>\n   sentence of imprisonment while on probation.

The judgment and sentence, however, makes clear that Appellant's ten year sentence of imprisonment was\n   <em>\n    suspended\n   </em>\n   on condition that Appellant follow the rules and conditions of probation contained within the supplemental order. Moreover, Appellant was not even\n   being supervised by the Department of Corrections when he stabbed the victim. He was being supervised by the Oklahoma County District Attorney's Office and, at that, for a mere fraction (two years) of the ten year suspended sentence imposed. We therefore think the State's comparison of Appellant's supervised two-year probation to that of an inmate serving out the balance of his or her unexpired sentence of imprisonment through parole or some other form of early release to be misguided. The record makes clear Appellant's sentence of imprisonment was never executed and that he was never in DOC custody on the suspended sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   \u00b6119 The difference between a suspended sentence of imprisonment and an actual sentence of imprisonment is stark when one considers the significance of an order revoking a suspended sentence.

That means had Appellant's sentencing judge found a violation by Appellant of his rules and conditions of probation, the court would have been authorized to revoke Appellant's ten year sentence in whole, thus resulting in Appellant's subsequent service of ten full years in confinement.

Although her injuries were delivered rapidly and her death was relatively quick, there is no question the victim suffered excruciating pain from the stab wounds and cuts at the hands of her estranged boyfriend as she and several bystanders resisted his attack. The surveillance video of the killing reveals a ferocious attack launched by Appellant against the victim in a public place after following and cornering her near the glass doors.

As in\n   <em>\n    Cole\n   </em>\n   , we find the intensity of suffering caused by the rapidly\n   inflicted injuries here warrants a finding that this evidence of conscious physical suffering and mental anguish was unlike virtually all murders, thereby placing this crime within the narrowed class of individuals for which capital punishment is a valid option.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maynard v.

Appellant's attack on Tia Bloomer in the downtown bus station was pitiless and showed no feeling or mercy towards the victim as he thwarted the efforts of both bystanders and the victim to resist his onslaught. Given the couple's tumultuous history, the victim too surely experienced increased anxiety and mental anguish when Appellant appeared, attempted to speak with her and followed her around inside the bus terminal. Appellant attacked the victim only after she rejected his advances to talk inside the bus terminal and walked away, further increasing the already tense relations between the two and sparking Appellant's unrestrained violence and fury towards her. The jury could infer that Appellant sought to (and in fact did) severely punish the victim when delivering the deadly knife attack. Under these circumstances, the victim's murder was, at the least, \"cruel\" in light of our definitional interpretation of the statutory language for the especially heinous, atrocious or cruel aggravator. These facts further place the crime within the narrowed class of individuals for which capital punishment is a valid option.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   \u00b6129 Taken in the light most favorable to the State, any rational trier of fact could have found the victim was conscious for a significant portion of the stabbing and that she suffered the requisite torture or serious physical abuse.

Appellant's outburst occurred when the prosecutor objected to Sheryl Wilson's testimony concerning domestic violence by Roy Tryon. The prosecutor objected on grounds of relevance because there was no evidence that Appellant had witnessed the specific instance of domestic violence being described by Wilson.

The witness left the stand after proclaiming \"I'm done too.\" Before he was led out of court, Appellant stated, apparently to the prosecutor, \"You keep jumping up and objecting to shit, like mother fuck is lying.\" After a brief recess, a record was made during which defense counsel requested a mistrial based on Appellant's outburst. The trial court also issued a bench warrant to authorize the arrest of Sheryl Wilson who, by this point, had left the courthouse. The trial court denied the defense request for a mistrial and to question the jurors individually concerning what each one heard and whether it would affect their ability to sit on the case. The trial court then admonished Appellant that further outbursts would result in his permanent banishment from the courtroom. The jury was brought in and, after explaining that a new witness was going to be called out of order, the trial court admonished the jury to \"don't let that be part of your deliberation or cause you any concerns.

During\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   , the prosecutor told prospective juror J.H. that \"[t]he dictionary defines justice as rendering unto each man or woman that which he or she is due.\" With that definition in mind, the prosecutor asked J.H. whether she could \"sit in this case and see that justice is done?\" When J.H. replied \"yes\", the prosecutor followed up and asked whether she realized that could mean finding the defendant guilty or it could mean acquitting the defendant. The prosecutor then asked the other prospective jurors whether they could do the same thing. The prospective jurors agreed that they could do justice in the case based on the evidence. During this discussion, the prosecutor told the panel that what the attorneys said is not evidence and that the trial judge would give the jury instructions at the end of the case to \"lay out exactly what it is that you have to do or, I mean, what the rules are.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   \u00b6139 At the end of the State's second closing argument, the prosecutor revisited the earlier discussion she had with the jurors about doing justice in the case:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-193\">\n   Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I ask each of you, when you were chosen, if you could sit in this case and see that justice is done. And justice was defined to you as rendering unto each man or woman that which he or she is due. I would submit to you that the State of Oklahoma has proved beyond all doubt that on March the 16th of 2012 [Appellant] murdered Tia Bloomer; that he had malice aforethought.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   (Tr. V 1172). The prosecutor then briefly urged that stabbing someone in the vital areas of the body, as Appellant had done to the victim, showed malice aforethought. Thus, the prosecutor argued, Appellant killed the victim with malice aforethought and a verdict of guilty on first degree murder was warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   \u00b6140 Later, during final penalty phase closing, the prosecutor once again\n   briefly revisited the earlier discussion about justice she had with the jurors during\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   . The prosecutor then continued with her argument by discussing the evidence supporting Appellant's mitigating circumstances. During this argument, the prosecutor urged that the \"fair\" and \"just\" punishment for Tia Bloomer's murder was the death penalty; \"that, when we talk about justice and rendering unto each man what he is due, that is what he is due.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   \u00b6141 Appellant did not object to any of these arguments below.

In this case, we assumed first stage error based on the trial court's admission of the third sentence of the text message evidence in which the victim expressly identified Appellant as her attacker. We nonetheless found any error harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of Appellant's guilt along with the properly admitted evidence establishing Appellant's responsibility for previously choking the victim (Proposition III). We also assumed first stage error from the trial court's disallowance of testimony from Appellant's brother and cousin concerning whether Appellant expressed any desire to harm the victim or otherwise expressed concern about getting the text message from her. However, we found no plain error based on the overwhelming evidence of guilt which the omitted evidence would not overcome (Proposition IV).

The evidence supporting all three aggravating circumstances was strong. The evidence detailed earlier showed not only Appellant's prior felony convictions for four counts of Assault with a Dangerous Weapon but also numerous instances of prior violent acts towards police officers, family members, the victim, other inmates and the public supporting the continuing threat aggravator. Appellant's murder of Tia Bloomer in a crowded public place while serving a sentence of supervised probation likewise supports this aggravator as does the callous and brutal nature of the killing itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hooks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"421\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1993%20OK%20CR%2041\">\n    1993 OK CR 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 33, 862 P.2d at 1282-83. Moreover, as discussed in Proposition XIII, the evidence showed the victim endured conscious physical suffering as Appellant stabbed her repeatedly in the bus station, thus supporting the especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   \u00b6151 Appellant presented abundant mitigation evidence from his family members covering virtually every aspect of his life. This included first-hand accounts concerning Appellant's drug abuse; learning disabilities; educational background; prior incarcerations; prior head injuries ; suicide attempts; family background; mental health treatment and institutionalization; prior incarcerations of his mother, father and siblings; gang involvement; the crowded conditions at the family home; the fact the family constantly moved; the non-stop drug activity at the family home; the routine absence of Appellant's mother from the family home while on multi-day drug binges; Appellant's mother buying drugs from Appellant and his brother; Sheryl's physical abuse of her children; Appellant's drug dealing; Appellant's love for his son; the nature of Appellant's relationship with the victim; and the nature of Appellant's relationship with his mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   \u00b6152 The defense also presented expert testimony from Dr. Fabian, a neuropsychologist, that Appellant was low functioning (but not mentally retarded) and suffered both from mental illness and brain damage. Appellant presented this testimony along with anecdotal evidence from family members concerning his cognitive and developmental limitations, his mental health treatment and his experience taking-then discontinuing-medications prescribed specifically for his mental issues. Dr. Musick, a sociology professor, was presented by the defense as an expert witness to discuss the risk factors and events from Appellant's life history which impacted his development. This was offered to explain Appellant's pattern of illegal behavior culminating in his murder of Tia Bloomer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   \u00b6153 Upon reweighing the remaining valid aggravating circumstances against the mitigation evidence, we find the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating evidence and supported the death sentence. Had the jury considered only these valid aggravating circumstances, we find beyond a reasonable doubt the jury would have imposed the same sentence of death. Upon review of the record, we are also satisfied that neither passion, prejudice nor any other arbitrary factor contributed to the jury's sentencing determination. After carefully reviewing the evidence presented, we find too that it supported the jury's finding of the three valid aggravating circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DECISION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   \u00b6154 The Judgment and Sentence of the district court is\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n   .

I disagree with the interpretation expressed in the opinion of a suspended sentence not coming within the parameters of the aggravator. I believe the opinion \"strains a gnat's hair\" to get to the result reached and I see no difference between the parolee committing murder and a person on a suspended sentence committing murder. The analysis used in the opinion applies form over substance as to the condition of the defendant when a murder is committed.

I'm tired of lies for yhu [sic]. Isaiah Tryon is the guy who choked nd [sic] nearly killed me Saturday.\" The Majority finds that admission of this statement did not violate Appellant's Sixth Amendment right to confront his accusers, because it was not testimonial in nature. I agree with that conclusion. Turning next to the statement's admissibility under the Evidence Code, the Majority finds that the first two sentences of the text are hearsay, but admissible under the \"state of mind\" exception to the general ban on hearsay evidence. 12 O.S.2011, \u00a7 2803(3). I agree with that analysis as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   \u00b62 The Majority finds the third sentence-which directly accuses Appellant of domestic abuse-admissible under the same state-of-mind exception. I disagree with that analysis. After conceding that the state-of-mind exception expressly disallows statements \"of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., the Majority nevertheless tries to defend the victim's reference to past abuse under this exception by distinguishing statements merely\n   <em>\n    about\n   </em>\n   prior acts from those that actually\n   <em>\n    describe\n   </em>\n   the events in question. Statements about past events, offered to prove the past event, simply are not contemplated by the state-of-mind exception. No matter how hard you hit a square peg, it won't fit into a round hole.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   \u00b63 To determine admissibility of an unsworn statement, the questions to be asked are: (1) Is it hearsay? (2) If so, does it meet an exception to the general rule barring hearsay? (3) If so, is it relevant? and (4) Even if it is relevant, is its probative value substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice? I believe the accusation of prior abuse-indeed, the entire text message-is admissible under the \"forfeiture by wrongdoing\" doctrine. 12 O.S.Supp.2014, \u00a7 2804(B)(5). And I believe the entire message, admissible under\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   exception, was relevant to show Appellant's intent and motive for killing the victim and had considerable probative value. Because trial courts and counsel look to this Court for guidance on evidentiary issues, I believe the doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing merits additional discussion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   \u00b64 Because the text message referred to another crime, the State gave pretrial notice of its intent to offer the evidence. 12 O.S.2011, \u00a7 2404(B) ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   <em>\n    Burks v.

At a hearing, the prosecutor argued that the victim's text message was admissible on equitable grounds, because it was reasonable to infer that Appellant killed the victim to prevent her from making good on her threat to report his prior abuse to the police.

From (1) the substance of the text message, (2) the fact that it was sent directly to Appellant, (3) Appellant's admission that, just hours later, he armed himself with a knife, purposefully sought the victim out, and fatally stabbed her, the trial court could reasonably infer that Appellant wrongfully procured the victim's absence to prevent her from publicly accusing him of domestic abuse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   \u00b67 Admissibility and relevance are independent concepts.

Evidence of other crimes may be admitted for purposes of establishing intent or motive for the instant offense. 12 O.S.2011, \u00a7 2404(B).

Intent is an essential element of First Degree Malice Murder.

Appellant claimed he killed the victim out of jealousy, because he did not want anyone else to have her. Once it discovered the text messages, the State disputed that explanation and alleged that Appellant sought to kill the victim to prevent her from reporting his domestic abuse. The victim's text message was admissible in its entirety. There was no error here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   \u00b69 As to Proposition VI, the Majority finds that instructions on lesser forms of homicide were properly rejected. I agree, but wish to clarify that our focus must be not on whether the evidence supports the greater charge, but on whether any rational juror could have found the lesser charge.\n   <em>\n    McHam v.

In my view, the manner in which the victim was killed is not as convincing on this point as the circumstances surrounding the killing: the domestic quarrels, the fight over child support, the victim's threat to report Appellant's domestic abuse, and, of course, the fact that Appellant admitted arming himself with a knife with the express intent to stab the victim if he saw her that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   \u00b610 Finally, Appellant raises several constitutional issues which were not preserved at trial. It is unclear from the Opinion whether the Majority has considered these claims using the appropriate standard of review.
