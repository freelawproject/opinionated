An accounting technician, however, erroneously paid the judgment from the Construction Insurance Fund (\"CIF\"). When the mistake was discovered, the Department reimbursed the CIF from the Revolving Fund.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 The legislature created the Revolving Fund to pay claims against the State and to buy insurance, among other things.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 41-622(A). It is funded by premiums paid by State agencies, insurance reimbursements, and other sources. The State self-insures for claims up to $7 million and purchases an umbrella policy to reimburse it for payments that exceed that amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 In 2015, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment to resolve the calculation of post-judgment interest accrued during the pendency of the appeal. Glazer argued that, because the judgment had initially been paid from the CIF, it was subject to the rate of interest prescribed by A.R.S. \u00a7 44-1201(B) instead of the lower rate prescribed by \u00a7 41-622(F) for judgments paid from the Revolving Fund. The State maintained that the lower rate applied because the Revolving Fund had reimbursed the CIF. At the time, the \u00a7 44-1201(B) rate was 4.25% per year, and the \u00a7 41-622(F) rate was less than 1%. The superior court granted judgment for the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 The court of appeals affirmed in part, agreeing that the mistaken payment from the CIF had no bearing on the interest rate.\n   <em>\n    Glazer II\n   </em>\n   , 242 Ariz. at 394-95 \u00b6\u00b6 13-14, 17, 396 P.3d at 630-31. The court noted that because the Revolving Fund and not the CIF ultimately paid the judgment against the State, the lower rate applied.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12564753\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/410/433/#p435\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 394 \u00b6 14, 396 P.3d at 630-31. The court, however, took this analysis one step further, finding that because the State's excess insurer would reimburse the State for any portion of the\n   judgment that exceeded its self-insured retention, the State would ultimately pay only $7 million.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 395 \u00b6 16, 396 P.3d at 631. The court held that \"[t]he remaining $800,000 of the judgment will be paid by the State's insurer and does not qualify for the reduced interest rate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 395 \u00b6 17, 396 P.3d at 631.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 We granted the State's petition for review because the calculation of interest on judgments against the State is a recurring legal question with statewide significance. We have jurisdiction under article 6, section 5(3) of the Arizona Constitution and A.R.S. \u00a7 12-120.24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 The State argues that the reduced interest rate applies to the entire judgment. Glazer concedes that the Revolving Fund rather than the CIF was the source of the payment but argues that the reduced rate does not apply to the portion of the judgment reimbursed by the State's excess insurer. Resolving this issue turns on the interpretation of \u00a7 41-622(F), and we review statutory interpretation issues de novo.\n   <em>\n    Premier Physicians Grp., PLLC v.

Applying this rule, we conclude that \u00a7 41-622 can be reasonably interpreted only in the manner urged by the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 13 Section 41-622(F) provides a single requirement for the lower interest rate: the judgment must be \"paid for out of the risk management revolving fund.\" The statute further provides that if the State loses an appeal, as it did here, \"the judgment amount plus interest at the rate prescribed in this subsection shall be paid.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12564753\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/410/433/#p435\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This subsection contains no exceptions, conditions, or qualifications regarding excess insurance that the\n   State may purchase to cover liabilities exceeding the State's self-insured limit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 14 This construction of subsection (F) is supported by \u00a7 41-622(E), which provides that any monies the State recovers \"pursuant to litigation ... or otherwise, for damages relating to ... a liability ... for which monies from the risk management revolving fund ... have been or will be paid shall be deposited in the [Revolving Fund].\" This provision suggests that the legislature recognized that the State may be reimbursed by insurance or other collateral sources for liability payments made from the Revolving Fund, and yet did not modify subsection (F) to limit its lower interest rate to self-insured payments for which the State would not be reimbursed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 15 By contrast, Glazer contends that this interpretation fails to account adequately for \u00a7 41-622(A), which describes the Revolving Fund:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   A risk management revolving fund and a construction insurance fund are established in the department of administration for the purchase of insurance, risk management services including loss prevention services,\n   <em>\n    payment of self-insured losses\n   </em>\n   ... and administrative costs necessary to carry out risk management services....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (emphasis added). Glazer argues that the purposes of the Revolving Fund are limited to those listed. Because subsection (A) does not list \"payment of insured losses\" as one of the Revolving Fund's purposes, Glazer maintains that, based on the overall statutory scheme, \u00a7 41-622(F) applies only to uninsured or self-insured losses. She also notes that the title to \u00a7 41-622 refers to \"self-insured losses\" but not to \"insured losses.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 16 Glazer would interpret \"self-insured loss[ ]\" in subsection (A) to mean the loss, or portion thereof, that is paid with unreimbursed taxpayer dollars. We decline to read the statute so narrowly. No language in subsection (A) so limits the payments. Indeed, in this statutory context, a \"self-insured loss[ ]\" appears to refer to any liability that A.R.S. \u00a7 41-621 allows the State to self-insure, whether that liability is fully covered by the State's self-insured retention or is partially reimbursed by the excess insurance that \u00a7 41-622(A) permits the State to purchase from the Revolving Fund. As both parties agree, the entire judgment was a State obligation: Glazer has no relationship with, or claim against, the State's excess insurer. The State did not have coverage for Glazer's claim, nor was the State's excess carrier obligated to pay Glazer. The excess carrier, by the terms of its policy, was obligated to reimburse the State for only those claims the State paid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 17 Glazer's interpretation of subsection (A) creates unnecessary conflict with the language of subsection (E), which expressly contemplates that payments come from the Revolving Fund even if they are later reimbursed. It is therefore unreasonable to limit the reference to \"self-insured losses\" in subsection (A) to unreimbursed payments. The lower interest rate applies to all judgments against the State that are paid out of the Revolving Fund, including the portions of those judgments that may be later reimbursed by the State's excess insurer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 18 Finally, because the statute is unambiguous, we do not consider the interpretive value, if any, of the statute's title.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 1-212 (providing that section headings are not \"part of the law\");\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

It does this both by slowing the rate at which the self-insured retention is depleted and by decreasing the cost of insurance premiums. As the court of appeals acknowledged, a judgment for $7 million is subject to the lower rate, even though the interest accruing on that judgment will be later reimbursed by insurance.\n   <em>\n    Glazer II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310521\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/242/508/\">\n    242 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   395 \u00b6 15, 396 P.3d at 631. Because of the lower rate, the insurance company will incur fewer costs. Basic economics suggests that if the State is a less-costly client, its insurer may charge lower premiums. To apply the lower rate only to portions of the judgment falling within the self-insured retention is at odds with the statute's goal of saving the State money. Nothing in the statute's text or history suggests that the legislature intended such an incongruous result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 22 We agree with the court of appeals that \"the judgment against the State was paid ... out of the Risk Management Revolving Fund.\"\n   <em>\n    Glazer II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310521\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/242/508/\">\n    242 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   395 \u00b6 14, 396 P.3d at 630-31.
