This requires us to revisit a question that captured the nation's attention in 1999 because the meaning of section 30-3-5(10)\"depends upon what the meaning of the word 'is' is.\" We conclude that the legislature intended that\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   should mean\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   and not\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    has been\n   </em>\n   . We reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 Jillian Scott (Wife) and Bradley Scott (Husband) divorced in 2006. Under the terms of their divorce settlement and decree, Wife would collect $6,000 a month in alimony from Husband for the number of years they had been married: twenty-five. The divorce decree provided, \"Alimony shall terminate upon the remarriage or cohabitation of [Wife].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 In October 2011, Husband moved to terminate alimony, claiming that Wife had cohabited with J.O., her ex-boyfriend. Husband argued that Wife had begun \"cohabit[ing] with an adult male ... on or about February 2011,\" that Wife had a relationship with her cohabitant \"akin to that generally existing between husband and wife,\" and that she and cohabitant \"shared a common residence for a significant period of time.\" Wife and J.O. had broken up months before Husband filed his motion. The statutory language\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   governing termination of alimony provides that alimony \"terminates upon establishment by the party paying alimony that the former spouse is cohabitating with another person.\" UTAH CODE\u00a7 30-3-5(10).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 The district court found that Wife and J.O. had cohabited and that their cohabitation terminated Husband's obligation to pay Wife alimony. The court stated that \"[Wife] and [J.O.] lived their lives in multiple homes and had extensive and constant travel, which does not lend itself to a traditional analysis of a couple, who without those resources, cohabitate in a single home.\" The court found it significant that Wife and J.O. had been \"together or staying in one of [J.O]'s homes approximately 87% of the time from December 2010 onward.\" Thus, considering the details of the couple's intimate and exclusive 30-31-month relationship ending sometime before April 2011, the district court found that the evidence before it established \"cohabitation and a relationship akin to a husband and wife.\" The court ordered Wife to return to Husband \"any alimony paid to her from December 22, 2010 to the present.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 Wife appealed and argued to the Utah Court of Appeals that the district court's interpretation of the statute failed to account for the present tense of the\n   <em>\n    to be\n   </em>\n   verb \"\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   \" in the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 30-3-5(10) (alimony should dissolve upon establishment that \"the former spouse is cohabitating\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Under Wife's reading, Husband could not establish that Wife\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   cohabiting, since she and J.O. had broken up months before Husband filed his motion. She argued that in order to terminate Husband's obligation under the plain language of the statute, Husband had to show that she was cohabiting at the time he filed his motion to terminate alimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 Husband contended to the court of appeals that Wife's statutory interpretation argument was not preserved in the district court. The court of appeals responded, however, \"that resolution of the question of whether Wife and J.O. cohabited requires us to interpret the Cohabitation Provision ...\"\n   <em>\n    Scott v.

The court explained that \"[t]he language of the Cohabitation Provision has never been parsed in this way, and our case law has not squarely addressed the issue. Accordingly, we utilize applicable canons of construction to ascertain the meaning of the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. The court of appeals then reasoned that, under a plain language reading, \"when the present-tense [\n   <em>\n    to be\n   </em>\n   ] verb is read within the context of the [statute] as a whole, the argument that its use demands that cohabitation be ongoing at the time of determination seems less persuasive.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32 (internal citation omitted). It reasoned that to read the statute in a way that gives independent meaning to the word\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   would undermine the final effect the statute requires: that alimony \"\n   <em>\n    terminates\n   </em>\n   upon establishment\" of cohabitation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added); UTAH CODE \u00a7 30-3-5(10). The court of appeals determined that, because the statute lacks a provision allowing for \"alimony reinstatement once cohabitation ends\" or a provision explaining \"that alimony is only suspended during cohabitation,\" \"the word 'is' cannot bear the burden of an interpretation that requires such a complex approach, and there is no other language in the statute to justify encumbering it with such a burden.\"\n   <em>\n    Scott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6810648\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/368/133/\">\n    2016 UT App 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 32,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6810648\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/368/133/\">\n    368 P.3d 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 The court of appeals also reasoned that the legislature \"could not have intended\" the result Wife's briefing described.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33 (citation omitted). The court acknowledged \"that requiring termination of alimony in [Wife's] circumstances does not entirely align with the general economic policies underlying alimony.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35. \"[C]ohabitation is qualitatively different from remarriage. Remarriage provides a legally binding substitute for alimony; cohabitation does not.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But the court explained that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   interpreting the [statute] to terminate alimony only during periods of active cohabitation could create an incentive for persons receiving alimony to simply cohabit rather than marry, so that if the new relationship does not endure, the alimony from the former spouse would resume. This could result in something of a statutory preference for cohabitation over marriage, which seems unlikely to have been the legislature's intent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. Relying on its conclusion that Wife and J.O. had shared \"a common abode\" that was also their \"principal domicile\" for \"more than a temporary or brief period of time,\" the court rejected Wife's argument and upheld the district court's conclusion that Wife and J.O. had cohabited.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16 -26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 9 Although the court of appeals agreed that Wife and J.O. had cohabited, it disagreed with the district court's timeframe.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. Instead of finding that Wife and J.O. began to cohabit on December 22, 2010, the court of appeals found that Wife and J.O. began to cohabit on February 17, 2011, \"because their vacations together before they moved to [California] still retained a temporary quality.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court of appeals therefore remanded the case to the district court for the limited purpose of adjusting Wife's payment to Husband to reflect the dates it found significant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 10 We disagree with the court of appeals' reading of the cohabitation statute. We instead conclude that the plain language of Utah Code section 30-3-5(10) requires the paying spouse to establish that the former spouse\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   cohabiting at the time the paying spouse files the motion to terminate alimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We also clarify an appellee's burden of persuasion on\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   when the court of appeals addresses an issue that the appellee claims was unpreserved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 11 We have jurisdiction under Utah Code section 78A-3-102(3)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 12 On\n   <em>\n    certioriari\n   </em>\n   , we review decisions of the Utah Court of Appeals for correctness.\n   <em>\n    Nichols v.

The Court of Appeals Erred when It Found That Wife and J.O. Cohabited\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 13 Before we reach the merits of the court of appeals' conclusion that Wife cohabited with J.O., we must address Husband's argument that Wife failed to preserve the statutory construction issue. Husband argued to the court of appeals that it should not address the meaning of the statute because Wife had not presented that question to the district court. The court of appeals declined to resolve whether the issue had been preserved and instead addressed what it believed to be the proper construction of the statute. The court explained that, \"[b]ecause we believe that resolution of the question of whether Wife and J.O. cohabited requires us to interpret the Cohabitation Provision, we address this argument regardless of whether it was properly preserved.\"\n   <em>\n    Scott v. Scott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6810648\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/368/133/\">\n    2016 UT App 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 27 n.8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6810648\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/368/133/\">\n    368 P.3d 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 14 The court of appeals appears to have believed that it was trekking down a path we marked in\n   <em>\n    Patterson v. Patterson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6985833\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/266/828/\">\n    2011 UT 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6985833\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/266/828/\">\n    266 P.3d 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Patterson\n   </em>\n   , we considered the application of a statute even though the parties had not preserved the issue before the district court. We recognized that \"our decision to reach [the] argument may undermine some of the policies underlying the preservation requirement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. But we concluded that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   consideration of the [statute] is necessary to a proper decision. As the state's highest court, we have a responsibility to maintain a sound and uniform body of precedent and must apply the statutes duly enacted into law. Refusing to consider [appellant's] statutory argument in this case would cause us to issue an opinion in contravention of a duly enacted controlling statute. This we will not do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. And the court of appeals believed that it was following this path when it reached the statutory interpretation question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 15 Our preservation requirement promotes a number of important policies. It encourages orderly proceedings by requiring a party to advise a trial court of potential errors so the trial court has the opportunity to correct them before they blossom into appellate issues. It also discourages a party from strategically ignoring errors in hopes of enhancing her chances of prevailing on appeal. Thus, we require a party to present an issue \"in such a way that the [district] court has an opportunity to rule on [it].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12 (second alteration in original) (citation omitted). We \"exercise wide discretion when deciding whether to entertain or reject matters that are first raised on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. And we have used that discretion to carve out a few exceptions to the preservation requirement. For example, \"we have reached matters not raised below under 'exceptional circumstances' or when 'plain error' has occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Stated differently, absent some exception, we do not normally address unpreserved issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 16 This case does not present the normal situation. We are not asked to address an issue that a party is raising for the first time on appeal. Rather, we are asked to address an issue that the court of appeals determined it needed to resolve, even if it were unpreserved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 17 Husband all but ignores the court of appeals' decision to reach the statutory construction\n   issue. He asserts simply that \"[Wife] failed to preserve this argument in the trial court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record, passim. Therefore it should not have been considered by the court of appeals.\" In essence, Husband invites us to look past the court of appeals' actual decision and affirm on the alternative ground that the court of appeals should not have touched the unpreserved issue in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 18 We have the ability to affirm a decision on any ground apparent on the record. \"[I]t is well established that an appellate court may affirm\" a judgment \"if it is sustainable on any legal ground or theory apparent on the record, even though such ground or theory differs from that stated by the trial court to be the basis of its ruling or action.\"\n   <em>\n    First Equity Fed., Inc. v. Phillips Dev.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    L.C.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11435700\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/52/1137/\">\n    2002 UT 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11435700\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/52/1137/\">\n    52 P.3d 1137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Dipoma v.

Thus, we could, in an appropriate case, affirm a court of appeals ruling where that court erroneously addressed an unpreserved issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 19 That is not to say, however, that an appellee may simply flag the preservation problem and expect that we will exercise our discretion to ignore the court of appeals' decision and affirm for a lack of preservation. Indeed, when the court of appeals decides to reach an unpreserved issue, and we hear a petition for\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   in the matter, an appellee would be well advised to do more than just point out that the issue was unpreserved in the district court. Sometimes we may need to be convinced that the court of appeals erred in tackling the unpreserved issue and that the error is \"apparent on the record.\" This is especially important in a case like this where the court of appeals explained its rationale for reaching the arguably unpreserved issue. In this circumstance, the party may want to argue that the unpreserved issue did not implicate plain error, did not present any exceptional circumstance, or that it was not necessary for the court of appeals to address the issue to reach a proper conclusion. Husband did none of these.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 20 Here, it is not apparent on the record that the court of appeals should not have reached the question of how the Cohabitation Provision should be interpreted. The court of appeals believed that even if the statutory argument was not preserved, it needed to construe the statute to properly resolve the matter. We can see arguments going both ways on whether this case presented the court of appeals with the same choice we were presented in\n   <em>\n    Patterson\n   </em>\n   . But in the absence of parties willing to develop those arguments, we are reluctant to wade in on our own. Simply stated, the decision to affirm on other grounds lies in this Court's discretion and Husband has provided us little reason to exercise that discretion on the record before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 21 As we previously stated, the resolution of this case turns on what the definition of\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   is. Utah Code section 30-3-5(10) provides that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   alimony to a former spouse terminates upon establishment by the party paying alimony that the former spouse\n   <em>\n    is cohabitating\n   </em>\n   with another person.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   (Emphasis added). Wife argues-both to us now and previously to the court of appeals-that the statute's use of \"is\" requires that cohabitation be ongoing to terminate alimony under the plain language of the rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   She contends that the court of appeals erred when it interpreted\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   to mean\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   . The court of appeals understood Utah Code section 30-3-5(10) to permit a showing that the spouse collecting alimony\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    had been\n   </em>\n   cohabiting at some previous date, regardless of whether the spouse was actually cohabiting at the time of filing.\n   <em>\n    Scott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6810648\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/368/133/\">\n    2016 UT App 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 27-37,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6810648\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/368/133/\">\n    368 P.3d 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, the court believed the statute's later use of the verb\n   <em>\n    terminates\n   </em>\n   \"precludes an interpretation that alimony might then be reinstated should the cohabitation ... end.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.

We agree: the strongest support for Wife's interpretation of the statute is, indeed, the language itself. The language of the statute provides that alimony terminates upon establishment \"that the former spouse\n   <em>\n    is cohabitating\n   </em>\n   with another person.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 30-3-5 (10) (emphasis added). \"Is cohabiting\" is a verb phrase comprised of two verbs: the present tense auxiliary \"is\" and the present participle \"cohabiting.\"\n   <em>\n    Be\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    cohabit, -ing,\n   </em>\n   OXFORD DICTIONARY OF ENGLISH IPHONE APP VERSION 9.0.2 (2017).

It is true that a couple who has been warned a paying spouse is planning to move to terminate alimony could choose to stop cohabiting to avoid the termination. And, if that occurs, the continued payment of alimony would square with the policy behind alimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

Wife Is Not Entitled to Attorney Fees in Defending Husband's Petition to Terminate Alimony\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 32 Wife also asks this court to remand to the district court for the purpose of awarding Wife attorney fees both at trial and on appeal under Utah Code section 30-3-3. The statute provides for an award of attorney fees \"in any action to\n   <em>\n    establish\n   </em>\n   ... alimony\" or \"[i]n any action to\n   <em>\n    enforce\n   </em>\n   an order of ... alimony\"; it does not provide for attorney fees to defend an action to\n   <em>\n    terminate\n   </em>\n   alimony. UTAH CODE \u00a7 30-3-3(1), (2) (emphases added). Here, there is no allegation that Husband failed to continue to pay alimony. This is not a situation where the paying spouse stops paying and the receiving spouse must petition the district court to intervene and enforce its order. Thus, Wife's efforts to resist Husband's motion to terminate alimony are not compensable under Utah Code section 30-3-3's plain language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 33 We conclude that Utah Code section 30-3-5(10) requires the paying spouse to establish that the former spouse\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   cohabiting at the time the paying spouse files the motion to terminate alimony. We clarify that an appellee wishing to contest our review of an arguably unpreserved issue already reached by the court of appeals has an obligation to explain how the court of appeals erred in reaching the unpreserved issue. Finally, defending a motion to terminate alimony does not entitle the defending spouse to an award of attorney fees under Utah Code section 30-3-3.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    The court of appeals' opinion correctly noted:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n    The parties' decree of divorce differs from the language contained in Utah Code section 30-3-5(10)....

First, as written, the statute does not suspend alimony during cohabitation. The statute's plain language does not require the resumption of alimony payments after the paying spouse establishes cohabitation, even if the cohabiting later ends. The seemingly anomalous result the court of appeals assails will occur only when the cohabitation begins and ends before the paying spouse can file a termination petition. Second, although we whole-heartedly agree with the court of appeals that the legislature could have been clearer, we are not justified from departing from the plain language of the statute just because we can envision a manner in which the legislature could have expressed its intent more clearly.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Of course, parties unhappy with this statutory default may choose instead to agree to a divorce decree that terminates alimony upon cohabitation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
