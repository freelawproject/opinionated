On the evening of May 29, 2009, Junior Flores, his wife, Gina Gonzales, and their daughter, Brisenia, were at their home while the couple's other daughter spent the night with a relative. After Junior and Gina went to bed, and as Brisenia slept on the living room couch, Junior woke Gina to tell her law enforcement officers were at their door. Gina rose from bed and joined Brisenia, who was still asleep on the couch, while Junior went to the door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Gina heard two voices, a male and female, order Junior to open the door so they could enter to \"take a look.\" Junior complied, and a man and woman entered the Flores's home. The man was tall, wore camouflage and black face paint, and carried a handgun and a longer gun covered with duct tape. Junior pressed the intruders for identification and asked the man why one gun was covered in duct tape. The man responded, \"Don't take this personally but this bullet has your name on it,\" and shot Junior in the chest. The man then turned the handgun on Gina and shot her in the shoulder and thigh. After Gina fell to the floor, the man focused again on Junior, who was yelling, \"Stop shooting my wife,\" and killed him with additional shots.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Lying on the floor feigning death, Gina heard two more men, both Spanish-speaking, enter the home. Brisenia awoke, began crying, and asked the armed man why he shot her father. He told Brisenia everything would be okay, that nobody would hurt her, and asked about her sister's whereabouts. Brisenia said her sister was spending the night with a relative. Gina then heard the man load his gun while Brisenia repeatedly begged, \"Please don't shoot me.\" Despite her pleas, the man fatally shot Brisenia twice in the face at point-blank range.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 After hearing the female intruder tell the group to leave, Gina called 911 and attempted to aid Brisenia, who was shaking and struggling to breathe. The female intruder then returned, saw that Gina was still alive, and ordered someone to \"go back and finish her off.\" Gina immediately rushed to the kitchen, grabbed a gun Junior kept there, and collapsed on the kitchen floor. Meanwhile, the tall man with black face paint reentered the home and began shooting at Gina, who returned fire. Gina heard the man cry out in pain before leaving the home. When another man entered, Gina yelled, \"Get the hell out,\" and \"That is enough,\" which prompted the man to leave. Gina returned to the phone, which was still connected to the 911 dispatcher, and waited for police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 Law enforcement officers identified Albert Gaxiola as a suspect in the murders and, after obtaining a search warrant, discovered Bush's DNA, fingerprints, and other incriminating items at Gaxiola's home. Officers located Bush ten days later at the residence he shared with his girlfriend. Bush, who had been wounded by Gina's gunfire, told his\n   girlfriend that he had been shot in the leg while working for the military as an undercover immigration operative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 After arresting Bush on June 11, 2009, officers questioned him at the Mohave County Sheriff's Department for approximately four hours. Though initially denying any involvement in the murders, Bush eventually confessed to shooting and killing Junior and Brisenia, claiming that his accomplices threatened to kill him and his family if he did not do so. In addition to making numerous incriminating statements, Bush drew a diagram of the Flores's home and marked where each victim was when he shot them. The State charged Bush with two counts of first degree murder, A.R.S. \u00a7 13-1105, attempted first degree murder, A.R.S. \u00a7 13-1001, two counts of aggravated assault, A.R.S. \u00a7 13-1204, first degree burglary, A.R.S. \u00a7 13-1508, armed robbery, A.R.S. \u00a7 13-1904, and aggravated robbery, A.R.S. \u00a7 13-1903.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68 A jury found Bush guilty on all counts. For the murder convictions, the jury found three aggravating circumstances: Bush was convicted of a serious offense, committed multiple homicides on the same occasion, and murdered a person under the age of fifteen.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 13-751(F)(2), (8), (9). Considering those factors and the mitigation evidence, the jury sentenced Bush to death for each murder. For the non-capital convictions, the trial court sentenced Bush to prison terms totaling seventy-eight years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The court indicated it would explore Bush's concerns if the voir dire process failed to \"yield an impartial jury.\" Bush unsuccessfully moved for a mistrial after jury selection but did not renew his motions for a change of venue or continuance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 Our review of pretrial publicity issues \"entails a two-step inquiry to decide 'whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the publicity attendant to [the] defendant's trial was so pervasive that it caused the proceedings to be fundamentally unfair.' \"\n   <em>\n    Forde\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3856521\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/233/543/\">\n    233 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   553 \u00b6 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3856521\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/233/543/\">\n    315 P.3d at 1210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

Before trial, each juror received and completed an eighteen-page juror questionnaire containing many questions probing the juror's ability to deliver a fair and impartial verdict. In various ways, the questionnaire delved into the prospective jurors' views on capital punishment, and some questions sought to identify jurors who might harbor death-favorable views. The State and Bush's defense team received copies of the prospective jurors' completed questionnaires.

Instead, after the prospective jurors received, completed, and submitted their questionnaires, but before voir dire began, Bush moved for a mistrial on the ground that question 27 \"engrained in [the jurors] that it is appropriate at some level for them to consider\" the \"improper and impermissible\" non-statutory aggravating factors it lists. The trial court denied the motion but instructed the potential jurors that they were not to consider the factors listed in question 27. The court also asked the potential jurors whether they would disregard that instruction, but no juror indicated any such intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b622 The trial court's instruction and follow-up query notwithstanding, defense counsel still \"ask[ed] each [potential juror] individually\" about whether they could \"put those [reasons listed in question 27] aside\" as non-factors and be fair and impartial. But in his further probing of the prospective jurors, counsel confusingly stated he was not \"saying [they] can't think about these [factors].\" The trial court later clarified that defense counsel's follow-up questioning was meant to determine whether the factors listed in question 27 are \"still going to be something that you consider even if the Court instructs you [otherwise].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b623 In response to Bush's questioning, and contrary to their prior statements that they would follow the trial court's instructions on this point, petit Jurors 9, 11, and 13 indicated by raising their hands that they would consider a factor listed in question 27. Even so, and despite insisting he would move to strike any jurors who indicated they would consider question 27's factors, Bush did not move to strike any of these jurors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b624 Arizona law provides fourteen \"aggravating circumstances\" that, if alleged by the state, a capital case jury shall consider \"in determining whether to impose a sentence of death.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 13-751(F). Bush contends that \"question 27 called jurors' attention to non-statutory aggravating factors\" and that he is entitled to a new trial because the final response of Jurors 9, 11, and 13 during voir dire indicates that \"at least [their] verdicts were influenced by improper considerations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b625 We disagree. On its face, question 27 does not instruct jurors that the reasons it lists are aggravating factors, but rather expressly states that its purpose is to determine what reasons would lead a particular juror to \"favor the death penalty\" if given that sentencing option. Moreover, the trial court and the parties explained several times that each juror must follow the court's instructions generally and that jurors were not to consider the factors question 27 mentions. We presume the jurors heeded those instructions,\n   <em>\n    Cruz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3424627\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/218/149/\">\n    218 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   158 \u00b6 25,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3424627\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/218/149/\">\n    181 P.3d at 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and Bush's assertion that the reasons listed in question 27 influenced any juror's deliberation or decision is purely speculative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b626 Bush nevertheless contends that the post-instruction, show-of-hand responses made by Jurors 9, 11, and 13 indicate inadequate\n   rehabilitation. But those conflicting responses at most suggest the jurors did not understand the purpose or substance of defense counsel's questioning. And to the extent there was confusion, it was at least partially attributable to counsel's misguided statement to the prospective jurors that \"we're not saying you can't think about these [factors].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b627 In any case, later in the jury selection process the trial court asked if any prospective jurors \"would be unable to follow the law\" as given in the court's instructions, \"disregarding [their] own notions of what the law is\" or \"ought to be.\" No juror responded or expressed any concern. In addition, during voir dire and later in the aggravation phase the prosecutor and the trial court clearly explained the separate phases of a capital case trial, the distinct issues the jurors would have to decide in each phase, and the three aggravators the State alleged. The court's aggravation-phase instructions expressly stated that \"the State has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt the aggravating circumstances it has alleged,\" all of which are listed in \u00a7 13-751(F). Bush fails to rebut the presumption that the jurors followed the court's instructions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Nonetheless, we see little purpose for, and a potential risk of confusion and possible prejudice created by, a question such as question 27. We therefore disapprove of its future use in capital case pretrial juror questionnaires.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Bush cites A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3988(A) in passing, but that statute does not support his argument. Section 13-3988(A) provides that before a \"confession is received in evidence, the trial judge shall, out of the presence of the jury, determine any\n   <em>\n    issue\n   </em>\n   as to voluntariness.\" (emphasis added). We interpret this statute to mean that, consistent with\n   <em>\n    Wainwright\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Alvarado\n   </em>\n   , a trial court must address the issue of voluntariness if a defendant raises it. Our interpretation of Supreme Court precedent, our previous opinions that analyze this issue, and \u00a7 13-3988(A) harmonize a defendant's due process rights with the procedural requirements necessary to effectuate those rights. Simply put, \u00a7 13-3988(A) does not create a substantive right to a sua sponte voluntariness hearing when a question as to voluntariness is merely raised by the evidence. (On the other hand, if a trial court is aware of facts indicating that a confession was involuntary, the court, in its discretion and even absent a request, may order a voluntariness hearing.) Therefore, on this record, we reject Bush's argument that Arizona law required the trial court to sua sponte conduct a voluntariness hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

In the ensuing discussion, Bush stated without elaboration that he did \"not agree the jury should be even advised as to the possibility of release,\" and assured the trial court he would follow up on that point later. He never did. The trial court, after denying Bush's oral motion for a mistrial on a different ground, and without objection, instructed the first pool of prospective jurors that if they were to find the defendant guilty, find one or more aggravating circumstances, but nonetheless \"unanimously agree[ ] that ... life in prison is the appropriate sentence, the Court will sentence the defendant to either life imprisonment without the possibility of release or life without the possibility of release until at least 35 calendar years have been passed [sic].\" The court repeated that same incorrect instruction the next day, again without objection, before a different panel of prospective jurors.

The court explained that if the jury returned a life sentence, \"then the judge will sentence [Bush] to either life imprisonment without the possibility of release or life imprisonment with the possibility of release after 35 years.\" \"Life without possibility of release from prison,\" the court stated, \"means ... [Bush] would never be eligible to be released from prison for any reason for the rest of his life.\" Although Bush objected to this instruction, he did so only to \"the order in which [the potential sentences] are put.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b666 Unless\n   <em>\n    Simmons\n   </em>\n   error is structural, Bush's failure to object on\n   <em>\n    Simmons\n   </em>\n   grounds at trial limits our review to fundamental error.\n   <em>\n    State v.

But these counts also satisfy the identical elements test because the elements of the relevant crimes, as with the facts underlying those crimes, are not identical. Indeed, Bush and his accomplices ransacked Gina's home after the initial shootings and before Bush returned, at Forde's command, to kill Gina. Moreover, robbery involves the unlawful taking of another's possessions, which is a harm distinct from an unjustified attempt to kill.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13-1902, -1903,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 13-1001, -1105.

For both murders, the prosecution alleged, and the jury found, that Bush committed multiple homicides on the same occasion and after having been convicted of another serious offense \"committed on the same occasion as the homicide[s],\" which are aggravating circumstances under \u00a7 13-751(F)(2) and (8).

Strangely, however, the dissent disregards our state's pertinent history and case law directly bearing on article 2, section 15, and instead relies largely on Supreme Court cases-mostly dissenting and other non-majority opinions-interpreting the Eighth Amendment to support its view.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 124, 126, 129-30, 136.

I concur with the majority's analysis and resolution of the procedural and substantive issues raised in this appeal. I depart from my colleagues, however, on the issue of imposition of the death penalty. On that basis alone, and for reasons set forth below, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   \u00b6117 The historical implementation of the death penalty bears little resemblance to its current administration. In distant times when the death penalty was quickly imposed, the execution was open for public viewing, and there was minimal evidence to contradict the accuracy of a defendant's conviction, the death penalty may have served as an efficient method of not only enforcing criminal law but also advancing legitimate policy goals. Society, however, has evolved and no longer administers the death penalty in this manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   \u00b6118 Instead of taking weeks, prisoners on death row, and the victim's families, often wait for decades for the sentence to be administered. Further, over the years, numerous\n   studies have criticized the death penalty as disproportionally affecting defendants of color and, with increasing frequency, in part due to advancements in technology, we have become aware of defendants who have been wrongly convicted and whose death sentences have ultimately been commuted-either due to their own actual innocence or because of incurable procedural flaws from their trial. Some of these wrongful convictions were obtained because of overzealous prosecutors who pursued conviction and imposition of the death penalty at the expense of candor; some convictions were obtained because of the failures of defendants' resource-deprived appointed counsel; some convictions were obtained because of jurors' biases; and some may have been fortuitously imposed simply because of the county in which the defendant committed the crime. Each conviction obtained through these means highlights the flaws in administering the death penalty, and our historic inability to devise a method to implement the death penalty free from human bias and error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   \u00b6119 Additionally, the death penalty has not been conclusively shown to deter criminal behavior, a primary rationale of criminal law and sentencing. Moreover, taxpayers are spending millions of dollars to prosecute, convict, and sentence defendants to death. As further explained below, the death penalty has been shown to be cruel and unusual, to not have any notable deterrent effect, to impose unintended trauma on the victim's family and friends, and to be cost prohibitive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   \u00b6120 Although current United States Supreme Court jurisprudence rejecting Eighth Amendment attacks on the death penalty preclude a state court from interpreting the United States Constitution to provide greater protection than the Court's own federal constitutional precedents provide,\n   <em>\n    Arkansas v.
