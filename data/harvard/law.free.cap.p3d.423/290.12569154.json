Glover's conviction for second degree burglary, the sentencing court imposed $2,900 in legal financial obligations (LFOs), including $2,100 for court-appointed attorney fees. Glover appeals, arguing that the sentencing court erred because it failed to adequately inquire into her ability to pay before imposing the discretionary LFO.

Glover received a standard range sentence of 63 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Regarding LFOs, the sentencing court inquired whether there was \"any physical or other reason why you [Glover] can't work and have a job, earn an income,\" to which Glover answered, \"No.\" Verbatim Report of Proceedings (VRP) (Jan. 30, 2017) at 242. The sentencing court then asked Glover about any job history, and Glover responded that the last time she had held a job was 30 months before sentencing.

INADEQUATE INQUIRY UNDER\n   <em>\n    BLAZINA\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 13 At sentencing, the court conducted a limited inquiry into Glover's ability to pay: the court asked only about Glover's work history and whether there was any reason she could not work. Glover told the sentencing court that there was no reason she could not work, that the last time she held a job was 30 months before, and that she sporadically worked \"[u]nder the table\" for a friend's company. VRP (Jan. 30, 2017) at 242.

The court also failed to examine her financial situation, such as the extent of her assets. And Glover was later found to be indigent, calling into question her ability to pay. The record contains no other information to support that the sentencing court engaged in the required consideration of the \"important factors\" referenced in\n   <em>\n    Blazina\n   </em>\n   , beyond the court's minimal questioning about Glover's employment potential. 182 Wash.2d at 838,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=344%20P.3d%20680\">\n    344 P.3d 680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

To apply an abuse of discretion standard in this case would be to defer to the trial court's interpretation of\n    <em>\n     Blazina\n    </em>\n    's holding.
