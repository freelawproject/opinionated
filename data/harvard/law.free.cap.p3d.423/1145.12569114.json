We affirm the court of appeals and hold that the payment error did not affect the timeliness of the Marziales' filing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 2 The Marziales submitted a complaint against the City alleging that Ms. Marziale was injured from a fall at the City's sports complex on July 11, 2011. The Marziales first submitted a complaint in the Spanish Fork division of the Fourth Judicial District through the court's e-filing system at 4:10 p.m. on August 2, 2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Their complaint, however, did not include a notice of undertaking as required by the Governmental Immunity Act of Utah and was automatically rejected in a matter of seconds by the e-filing system. A printout of the \"filing status\" for this complaint from the Utah State Bar's \"eFiling portal\" stated that the system \"returned a 'failure' status during the validation step\" because \"this court accepts only claims 20000 or less; you submitted 'unspecified.' \" The Marziales contend that they did not receive this notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=3%20A.%204\">\n    3 At 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   :20 p.m. that same day, the Marziales filed the same complaint against the City, but this time with an undertaking and in the Provo division of the Fourth Judicial District. The status history of this complaint shows that it was \"submitted by\" counsel for the Marziales on August 2, 2013, at 4:20:08 p.m., and the status history showed both \"approved\" and \"receipt issued\" at 4:41:56 p.m. The status history also showed that a clerk manually rejected the filing at 4:41:56 p.m., setting the status to \"invalid.\" The rejection contained the contact information for the clerk and a message that said, \"A credit card error has occurred; please resubmit filing with valid credit card information for fee payment. You may want to try re-entering the credit card information, or a different credit card, before resubmitting.\" The Marziales state that they did not receive this notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 The statute of limitations for the Marziales' claim expired on September 6 or 7, 2013. On September 10, 2013, counsel for the Marziales was unable to locate the filings on the court's system and an employee of the law firm contacted the Fourth District Court. The Marziales state that this is when they\n   first learned the filings had been rejected. The Marziales refiled the complaint and undertaking in the Provo division on September 10, 2013, and it was accepted with proper payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 The City then filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction over the Marziales' action because the September 10 filing date was outside of the statute of limitations. The Marziales filed an opposition to the City's motion and a motion to correct the record, asking the district court to change the date of their filing from September 10, 2013 to August 2, 2013. The court granted the City summary judgment and denied the Marziales' motion, finding that the Marziales' complaint had not been filed until September 10, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 The Marziales appealed. The Utah Court of Appeals reversed, holding that \"the complaint's electronic receipt was the meaningful equivalent of its acceptance\" and therefore the complaint was filed on August 2, 2013.\n   <em>\n    Marziale v.

The court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the complaint in the Spanish Fork division, the City argues, because that filing did not have an undertaking, which is a requirement under the Governmental Immunity Act. And, the City contends, the complaint filed in the Provo division was not valid because it lacked proper payment at the time of filing. We hold that the credit card error for the Marziales' filing in the Provo division did not affect the validity of their filing of the complaint. Because this means that the Marziales' lawsuit may proceed, we decline to decide whether the filing in the Spanish Fork division was valid because the question is moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   I. THE TIMELINESS OF THE PROVO COMPLAINT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 10 The Marziales' complaint in the Provo court was rejected solely on the basis of a credit card error-the type of dishonored payment that both our rules of civil procedure and case law say does not affect the validity of the filing of a complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 11 We begin our analysis with the plain language of the rules at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aequitas Enters. v. Interstate Inv. Grp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6985915\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/267/923/\">\n    2011 UT 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6985915\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/267/923/\">\n    267 P.3d 923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rule 3 of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure details the commencement of an action and states in relevant part that \"[d]ishonor of a check or other form of payment does not affect the validity of the filing, but may be grounds for such sanctions as the court deems appropriate,\" UTAH R. CIV . P. 3(a), and that \"[t]he court shall have jurisdiction from the time of filing of the complaint or service of the summons and a copy of the complaint,\" UTAH R. CIV . P. 3(b). Rule 5 states that \"[f]iling is complete upon the earliest of acceptance by the electronic filing system, the clerk of court or the judge.\" UTAH R. CIV . P. 5(e). Neither rule by its plain language requires valid payment for a complaint to be filed or accepted. In fact, rule 3(a) explicitly states the opposite-that dishonor\n   of payment does not affect whether the filing is valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 12 Despite the clear language of rule 3, the City argues that we should read into our procedural rules a requirement that filing fees must be paid at the time a complaint is accepted for the filing to be valid. The City points to Utah's court fees statute, which requires that \"all fees shall be paid at the time the clerk accepts the pleading for filing,\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 78A-2-301(1)(dd), and to language added in 2008 to rule 5 tying the completion of filing to the time of \"acceptance.\" The City argues that the use of \"acceptance\" in rule 5 and \"accepts\" in the court fees statute means that we should read the court fees statute's requirement of payment at the time of filing into rule 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 13 We rejected a similar argument in\n   <em>\n    Dipoma v. McPhie\n   </em>\n   , holding that rule 3 does not explicitly incorporate statutes-including the precursor to the court fees statute-that require payment of fees before court employees may perform their services.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9494869\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/29/1225/\">\n    2001 UT 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 10, 13 &amp; n.5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9494869\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/29/1225/\">\n    29 P.3d 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that statute providing that \"all fees shall be paid at the time the clerk accepts the pleading for filing\" was not incorporated in rule 3 for jurisdictional purposes). We reject the City's argument that the court fees statute is incorporated in rule 5 for similar reasons. The use of \"acceptance\" in rule 5 and \"accepts\" in the court fees statute does not mean that those provisions must be read together in the way the City urges, which is to say, in a way that directly conflicts with rule 3's statement that dishonor of payment does not affect the validity of filing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 14 Rather than requiring payment at the time of filing as a matter of jurisdiction, rule 3 provides that dishonor of payment \"may be grounds for such sanctions as the court deems appropriate, which may include dismissal of the action and the award of costs and attorney fees.\" UTAH R. CIV . P. 3(a). So while a party should pay fees \"at the time the clerk accepts the pleading for filing,\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 78A-2-301(1)(dd), dishonor of payment results not in an invalid filing but in court-determined sanctions, which may vary from case to case, UTAH R.

But\n   <em>\n    Dipoma\n   </em>\n   's holding was not tied to the complaint being stamped \"filed\" before the payment error was noticed. In\n   <em>\n    Dipoma\n   </em>\n   , the payment error, noticed after filing, did not undo the validity of the filing; here, the error was noticed before (or at the same time as, according to the e-filing status history) the clerk's rejection and cannot serve as a basis to find the filing untimely.\n   <em>\n    Dipoma\n   </em>\n   's holding-that payment of filing fees is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to a valid filing-does not depend on when the error is discovered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 18 We therefore hold that the dishonor of the credit card payment did not affect the validity of the filing for the Provo complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   II. THE TIMELINESS OF THE PROVO UNDERTAKING\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 19 Because the Marziales' payment also covered their undertaking, the City's argument that the late filing deprived the district court of subject matter jurisdiction also raises the question of whether the dishonor of payment affected the validity of the undertaking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 20 We note upfront that failure to timely file an undertaking under the Governmental Immunity Act \"is an affirmative defense\" and not a jurisdictional issue.\n   <em>\n    Hansen v. Salt Lake Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10384840\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/794/838/#p840\">\n    794 P.2d 838\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 840 (Utah 1990) (\"In contrast to other procedural requirements of the Governmental Immunity Act, failure to comply with [the undertaking provision] does not bar a suit.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   And we hold that the principle in rule 3 of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure -that dishonor of payment does not affect the validity of the filing-extends to the payment of an undertaking under the Governmental Immunity Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 21 Utah Code section 63G-7-601 provides that (1) actions under the Governmental Immunity Act are \"governed by the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure to the extent that they are consistent\" with the Act, UTAH CODE \u00a7 63G-7-601(1) ; and (2) an action must include an undertaking at the time of filing,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10384840\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/794/838/#p840\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 63G-7-601(2). Nothing in rule 3 is inconsistent with the Governmental Immunity Act. We therefore must determine how rule 3, which governs commencement of actions, applies to filings under section 601.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 22 Rule 3 explicitly applies only to complaints, which are a general requirement for civil actions. UTAH R. CIV . P. 3(a). But we believe that it is consistent with the Governmental Immunity Act to apply rule 3's principle-that dishonor of payment does not affect the validity of a filing-to an undertaking as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 23 Indeed, incorporation of rule 3 into the Governmental Immunity Act's undertaking requirement is proper as a matter of constitutional avoidance. This canon encourages courts to \"reject[ ] one of two plausible constructions of a statute on the ground that it would raise grave doubts as to its constitutionality,\" since we presume that the legislature enacts laws \"in the light of constitutional limitations.\"\n   <em>\n    Utah Dep't of Transp. v.

A holding that dishonor of payment affects the validity of the filing of an undertaking could have serious due process problems if-as is alleged here-the undertaking payment has been dishonored through no fault of the plaintiff and the plaintiff has received no notice of the dishonor of payment until after the statute of limitations has run. Timely notice of rejection is key because \"[t]imely and adequate notice\" is part of \"the very heart of procedural fairness.\"\n   <em>\n    Nelson v.

The City maintains that the court sent a notice of rejection after each of the Marziales' submissions.

The e-filing system indicates that at some point-either before or contemporaneous to the e-filing system's rejection-the Marziales' complaint was \"approved.\" Given that the filing was approved at some point, a dishonor of payment cannot form the basis for a rejection of the filing. We pause to note, however, that we may have reached a different conclusion regarding whether a filing occurred if the City had established that the complaint had never been accepted. But it was the City's burden to demonstrate that no genuine issue of material fact existed as to this issue. And the City has not carried its burden.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    <em>\n     Hansen v.
