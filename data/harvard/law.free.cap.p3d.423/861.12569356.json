Avista based its proposed rate increase in part on an attrition adjustment for both its electric and natural gas operations. The WUTC ultimately set rates significantly lower than Avista's initial request, basing its analysis on an attrition study and attrition adjustment. Whether to apply this attrition adjustment in setting Avista's rates is the fundamental dispute in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I.

Administrative Record (AR) at 3819. This process involved evaluating a historical test year\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and applying pro forma adjustments\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   to estimate the utility's rate base and operating expenses in the rate year. Pro forma plant adjustments provided the WUTC with a method of evaluating expected rate base changes between the historic model year and the rate year. The WUTC considered whether such adjustments were \" 'known and measureable' and 'used and useful' for service in Washington State.\" AR at 3820.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 9 When the historical test year relationship between revenues, expenses, and rate base does not hold during the rate year, erosion may \"deprive the utility of a reasonable opportunity to earn a fair rate of return.\" AR at 3836. This erosion of a company's rate of return over time is generally referred to as \"attrition.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   B. ATTRITION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 10 As described by the WUTC,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [A]ttrition occurs when the test-period relationship between rate base, expenses and revenues does not hold under conditions in the rate effective period, such that a utility's expenses or rate base grows more quickly than revenues, and a utility would likely have no reasonable opportunity to earn its allowed rate of return.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   AR at 703-04.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 11 An attrition adjustment, then, is \"a discrete adjustment to the modified historical test year that the [WUTC] may use when it determines attrition is present.\" AR at 704. When developing an attrition adjustment, parties first provide a revenue requirement analysis based on a modified historical test year to the WUTC. \"Parties then perform an attrition study to determine the utility's revenue requirement in the rate year. The attrition adjustment is the difference between the revenue requirement provided by the modified historical test year and the revenue requirement provided by the attrition study.\" AR at 704 n.60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 12 Attrition adjustments were frequently used in Washington as a WUTC ratemaking tool \" 'during the early 1980's in an environment of exceptional inflation and high interest rates.' \" AR at 706 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Wash.

The last time the WUTC addressed attrition in a fully litigated rate case was in 1993. AR at 705. It denied the request and announced that attrition adjustments were only appropriate in \" 'extraordinary circumstances' \" when \" 'without such an adjustment, the company would have no reasonable opportunity to earn its authorized rate of return.' \" AR at 705 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Wash. Utils. &amp; Transp. Comm'n v. Wash. Nat. Gas\n   </em>\n   , Docket UG-920840, Fourth Supp. Order at 30 (Sept. 27, 1993). Before the present case, the WUTC had not\n   directly authorized an attrition adjustment since the 1980s. AR at 723.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 14 In 2012, for the first time in almost twenty years, the WUTC suggested the use of an attrition adjustment in a ratemaking case for Puget Sound Energy. AR at 706. In that case, the WUTC observed that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \" '[A]ttrition' in the context of utility ratemaking is limited to circumstances in which key assumptions that underlie ratemaking theory fail to hold in reality. Regardless whether an historical or budgeted test-period is used, the relationship between rate base, expenses and revenues is used to represent the future and to set prospective rates adequate to allow a reasonable return. Ratemaking rests on the key assumption that the test-period relationships will accurately represent relationships in the future. If this assumption fails, cost of service may increase more rapidly than revenues and the rates approved based on test period conditions may not be adequate to achieve the allowed level of return under future conditions.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   AR at 706 (quoting PSE Order 08 at 180). The WUTC also discussed attrition in Avista's last two rate-setting cases. AR at 706.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 15 In Avista's 2012 ratemaking case, the WUTC opined that consideration of attrition was appropriate in setting 2013 rates, despite it being \" 'caused substantially by Avista's ongoing capital investment program' \" and that the WUTC \" 'ha[d] no absolute assurance that Avista [would] complete the projects described in its plan for 2013.' \" AR at 707 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Wash. Utils. &amp; Transp.

AR at 708. In accepting the settlement, the WUTC noted \" 'that the testimony and trending data offered in support of the proposed rate increase for 2014 are substantially less precise than we would require in a fully-litigated rate case.' \" AR at 708 (quoting Avista Orders 09 and 14 at 27) (emphasis omitted). It made clear that it was \" 'not endorsing the specific attrition methodologies, assumptions, or inputs' \" but did endorse the view \" 'that an attrition adjustment should not be limited to circumstances where the utility can demonstrate extreme financial distress.' \" AR at 709 (quoting Avista Orders 09 and 14 at 30). The WUTC announced its intent \" 'to clarify the conditions wherein attrition should be considered when setting rates,' \" but it felt limited in its ability to do so by the settlement. AR at 709 (quoting Avista Orders 09 and 14 at 30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 17 The current case presented the WUTC with the opportunity to address attrition in a \"fully-litigated rate case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   III. MULTIPARTY SETTLEMENT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 18 Avista, Staff, PCU, NWIGU, and ICNU came to a multiparty settlement pursuant to WAC 480-07-730.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result of the settlement, Avista reduced its requested rate increases from $33.2 million to $17 million for electric and from $12 million to $11.3 million for gas. The settling parties agreed that Avista should receive a 9.5 percent return on equity and a 7.29 percent rate of return. The parties did not come to any agreement regarding attrition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   IV. EVIDENTIARY HEARING\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 19 On October 5, 2014, the WUTC commenced an evidentiary hearing to address the issues not resolved by the settlement. The disputed issues included whether to apply an attrition adjustment and, if so, the proper methodology for an attrition study.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   A. AVISTA TESTIMONY AND ATTRITION STUDY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 20 Scott Morris, Avista's Board Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, testified that Avista required a rate increase because net plant and operating expenses continued to grow, while customer and sales\n   growth remained stagnant. Kelly Norwood, Avista's Vice President of State and Federal Regulation, testified that Avista had earned less than its authorized return on equity from 2008 until 2013. It earned 9.5 percent in 2013 and 9.9 percent in 2014, both near its authorized return of 9.8 percent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 21 Based on Morris's calculated needs for a rate increase and projected increases in plant investment and operating expenses, Avista presented an attrition study for both its electric and natural gas operations. During its rebuttal, however, it abandoned its own attrition study. Instead, it adopted the one proposed by Staff with several changes to the methodology used to calculate historical operations and maintenance costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   B. STAFF TESTIMONY AND ATTRITION STUDY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 22 Staff presented testimony of WUTC employee Chris R. McGuire. AR at 3808. McGuire explained that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   The [WUTC's] standard ratemaking practice requires companies filing for revised rates to start with an historical test year, and typically with an average of monthly averages rate base balance. The [WUTC] also allows pro forma adjustments to rate base and expenses that often extend beyond the end of the test year. Such pro forma adjustments are what characterize Washington as a \"hybrid\" or \"modified\" historical test year state.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   AR at 3819 (footnotes omitted). He also discussed the various requirements that go into what specific pro forma plant adjustments the WUTC considers in setting rates using this method.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 23 McGuire testified that, to be included in pro forma plant adjustments under the traditional modified historical test year analysis, a given pro forma plant must: \"1. Be in service as of June 30, 2015; 2. Meet a reasonable definition of 'major'; 3. Demonstrate 'quantifiable' benefits to ratepayers in Washington State; and 4. Include only costs that were prudently incurred.\" AR at 3822. He testified that 14 pro forma plant adjustments met these criteria.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   AR at 3823.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 24 McGuire also testified as to when the WUTC should allow a utility to receive an attrition adjustment. He noted that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   [T]he [WUTC] has historically allowed attrition where extraordinary circumstances beyond the regulated company's control will cause the relationship between revenues, expenses, and rate base to change in a manner that impedes the company's opportunity to earn a fair return. The [WUTC] historically has provided attrition allowances to companies during times of rapid growth in utility plant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   AR at 3824 (footnote omitted). Applying these criteria to Avista's situation, he testified that \"Avista's low load growth is well-documented and its net plant has increased in recent years.\" AR at 3824. However, he found that \"the attrition evidence presented by [Avista] [did] not conclusively demonstrate that the circumstances currently facing [Avista] [were] sufficient to warrant an attrition allowance.\" AR at 3824. Despite this conclusion, his attrition analysis \"show[ed] that [Avista] [would] likely under-recover in the rate year at rates established using only a modified historical test period approach.\" AR at 3824.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 25 McGuire further testified that \"rates calculated using a modified historical test year approach [would] likely be insufficient to provide [Avista] with a fair opportunity to earn the Settlement rate of return.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   AR at 3813. McGuire prepared two exhibits representing Staff's attrition study.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 26 In calculating Avista's revenue requirements, Staff's attrition study \"estimate[d] the revenue required to provide Avista with a fair opportunity to earn the settlement rate of return in 2016.\" AR at 3817. Because it determined that the revenue\n   requirement calculated with a modified historical test year approach would yield insufficient revenue, Staff recommended that the WUTC approve an attrition adjustment to Avista's rates. However, McGuire also noted his concerns with Avista's rapidly increasing investment in distribution plant and accused Avista of failing to provide a substantive explanation or any evidence justifying the rapid expansion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 27 McGuire summarized Staff's findings using both a modified historical test period approach and the results of Staff's attrition study. Staff's analyses concluded that the modified historical test year approach would yield a rate short of Avista's attrition-adjusted revenue requirement. Accordingly, McGuire recommended a $14.5 million attrition allowance for electric operations and a $6.7 million attrition allowance for natural gas operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 28 To perform his attrition study and calculate Avista's electric rate base, expenses, and other non-retail revenue in 2016, McGuire \"relied upon historical, normalized data ... to estimate rates of growth for 1) net plant after deferred income taxes; 2) operating expense; 3) total depreciation/amortization; 4) taxes other than income; and 5) other non-retail revenue.\" AR at 3845. Once he had established the growth rates, he applied them to the 2014 levels of each category. McGuire calculated an escalation factor of 7.83 percent and applied that rate to each category of Avista's 2014 rate base. McGuire thus calculated Avista's projected 2016 rate base by applying this escalation factor to its 2014 rate base and applying various other factors and adjustments. McGuire used the same process to perform his attrition study for Avista's natural gas rates, with an escalation factor of 16.86 percent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 29 On cross-examination by ICNU counsel, McGuire stated that he was \"not testifying to the used and useful nature of any specific plant beyond July of 2015.\" 5 WUTC Transcripts at 457. He further clarified that \"an attrition allowance is an undistributed increase in revenue\" and that the attrition study was \"not any acceptance of some specific plant addition in the future.\" 5 WUTC Transcripts at 457. McGuire also stated that his attrition study did not purport to make \"any assessment of whether or not any investment is prudent or imprudent or will or will not be used and useful.\" 5 WUTC Transcripts at 445. Rather, he characterized the attrition allowance as \"an undistributed increase in revenue not associated with any specific plant\" and stated that he was \"not making assessments of individual plant in an attrition study.\" 5 WUTC Transcripts at 445.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   C. OTHER TESTIMONY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 30 ICNU presented testimony from Bradley Mullins, a consultant representing industrial customers. He testified that if \"the [WUTC] were to disregard the pro forma cross check study, and instead establish revenue requirement solely on [Avista's] proposed trending methodology,\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   it would allow [Avista] to earn a return on capital expenditures that have not been determined to be prudent and in the public interest.\" AR at 6457. He also warned that \"[i]f a trending analysis is used ... the undistributed increase in rate base resulting from the reliance on historical trends would not represent known and measureable capital items, nor could it be determined whether the increase was the result of capital that is used and useful.\" AR at 6457.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   D. POST-HEARING BRIEFS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 31 Avista, The Energy Project, NWIGU, ICNU, Staff, and PCU all filed post-hearing briefs arguing their various positions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 32 Avista requested an increase of $3.6 million for its electric rates and an increase of $10 million for its gas rates, predicated on an attrition analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 33 ICNU argued in its brief that \"Avista's attrition adjustment proposal falls well short of meeting\" the \"known and measurable\" standard. AR at 451. It further cited case law for the proposition that \"the unknown and unmeasurable future capital expenditures\n   represented by [Avista's] proposed attrition adjustment do not satisfy the statutory 'used and useful' requirement.\" AR at 452.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 34 Staff described attrition as \"an extraordinary mechanism used only when extraordinary future circumstances can be demonstrated to negatively impact a utility's financial integrity during the rate effective year.\" AR at 508. Given that Avista had earned at or above its approved rate of return in 2013 and 2014, Staff argued that it had \"a reasonable opportunity to earn its allowed rate of return-even without an attrition allowance.\" AR at 509.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 35 Staff considered the WUTC's test: \"whether the company is facing extraordinary circumstances beyond its control.\" AR at 510. Though Staff suggested that Avista had likely not shown that attrition should apply, it did present an attrition study. Staff described its attrition study as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   It is built upon historical data that is used to project nominal amounts of both net plant and expenses for the rate effective period. Mr. McGuire's attrition proposal\n   <em>\n    is not\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    should not\n   </em>\n   be construed to represent a pro-forma examination of specific future capital expenditures. Rather, it is based on his judgment and analysis of [Avista's] historical trends, including forecasted capital spending not otherwise accounted for in Staff's case. Importantly, he did not examine the likelihood of Avista's specific forecasted capital projects actually going into service in the rate year. Nor does Avista's recent earnings history affect the results of Staff's attrition study given that Mr. McGuire's attrition analysis is forward looking. Mr. McGuire also does not address whether Avista can control its forecasted costs during the rate year.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   AR at 511-12 (footnotes omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 36 In determining whether Avista should receive an attrition adjustment, Staff pointed out that Avista's witnesses did \"not explain the actual cause of why distribution plant expenditures are growing so quickly.\" AR at 516. Though Avista demonstrated \"a narrative of its capital budget,\" it did not offer \"a clear explanation of an extraordinary cause.\" AR at 516.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 37 PCU urged the WUTC to forego an attrition adjustment and set Avista's rates using the more established modified historical test year methodology. It argued that Avista's and Staff's attrition studies were both flawed and failed to demonstrate that Avista was experiencing extraordinary events warranting a shift in traditional ratemaking. PCU warned that an attrition adjustment \"cannot be a known and measurable change\" because it is based on historic trends and projected escalations, but it acknowledged that attrition is an appropriate response to a \" 'trend of under-earning due to circumstances beyond the [c]ompany's ability to control.' \" AR at 371, 373 (quoting PSE Order 08 at 180).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6 38 Within its criticism of attrition's inherent unreliability, PCU argued that \"[w]ith either Avista's or Staff's attrition analysis, the [WUTC] would be required to approve capital investments that have not been demonstrated to be used and useful and trends that are not known and measurable.\" AR at 378.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   V. FINAL AGENCY ORDER\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 39 On January 6, 2016, the WUTC issued Order 05-its final order in the case. It issued findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   A. WUTC ATTRITION ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   i. Historical Treatment of Attrition\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b6 40 Summarizing its historical treatment of attrition in ratemaking, the WUTC observed that \"the two most common sources of earnings attrition in Washington are abnormal or excessive inflation and exceptional and prolonged levels of plant additions.\" AR at 711.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b6 41 The WUTC declared that, unlike the previous two Avista ratemaking decisions in 2012 and 2014, \"it is clear there is no agreement on the extent to which Avista suffers from attrition in either its electric or gas operations, nor is there consensus between [Avista] and Staff on the exact method for determining the extent of any reasonable attrition adjustment.\" AR at 712. Therefore, it announced: \"we must conduct a closer examination\n   of the evidentiary record in determining whether and how to authorize an attrition adjustment.\" AR at 712.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b6 42 The WUTC determined that it must resolve three primary issues with regard to attrition in this case: \"1) the appropriate criteria for determining whether an attrition adjustment is warranted; 2) the appropriate methodology for an attrition study; and 3) whether Avista has met its burden of proof to justify granting an attrition adjustment for both electric and natural gas rates.\" AR at 725.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   ii. New Attrition Test\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b6 43 In \"the early attrition cases,\" the WUTC acknowledged that it \"found extraordinary circumstances that supported the use of attrition in periods of high inflation and extraordinary levels of investment in production plant, among other criteria.\" AR at 725. It acknowledged that no such circumstances were present in this case. However, it found that \"Avista is making increased capital investments in non-revenue generating plant (primarily on the distribution system) in an environment of low load growth.\" AR at 725. The WUTC characterized Avista's circumstances as the \"new normal.\" AR at 725.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b6 44 In considering its recent statements about attrition adjustments, the WUTC stated it had \"not established a different standard or criteria for attrition adjustments in more recent cases,\" but had indicated \"that 'an attrition adjustment should not be limited to circumstances where the utility can demonstrate extreme financial distress.' \" AR at 726 (quoting Avista Orders 09 and 14 at 30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b6 45 The WUTC decided that \"it is not necessary to require a finding of extraordinary circumstances to justify granting an attrition adjustment.\" AR at 726. Rather, it concluded that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   An attrition adjustment is yet another tool in our regulatory \"toolbox\" for utility ratemaking. However, we do require that utilities requesting an attrition adjustment demonstrate that the cause of the mismatch between revenues, rate base and expenses is not within the utility's control. Without such a standard, a utility could plan for a level of expenditures that would exceed revenues and rate base recovery, creating the need for an attrition adjustment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   AR at 726. The new test announced by the WUTC required only that the utility seeking an attrition adjustment demonstrate that the attrition it was experiencing be outside its control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   iii. Attrition Study Methodology\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b6 46 The WUTC next articulated its perspective on the appropriate methodology for an attrition study. It found that Staff's approach, with some of Avista's modifications, \"provide[d] the most appropriate methodology in this docket for supporting an attrition adjustment.\" AR at 726. It concluded that the proper methodology \"begins with development of a modified historical test year with pro forma plant additions, even subsequent to a test year. An attrition study is based on the resulting projected earnings and revenue requirements, and the attrition adjustment is added only if the study shows a mismatch of earnings and expenditures.\" AR at 726.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b6 47 The WUTC made two adjustments to Staff's attrition study. First, it adopted Avista's 2007-2014 time period, rather than Staff's 2009-2014 period to calculate growth trends. Second, it rejected the operating and maintenance (O&amp;M) expense growth rates provided by both Avista and Staff and opted for one between the two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   iv. Application of New Attrition Test\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b6 48 Finally, the WUTC set about determining whether Avista had met its burden of proof to justify an attrition adjustment: to demonstrate persuasively that the attrition occurring was outside of its control. In applying its new attrition methodology to Avista, the WUTC decided it was critical to determine whether \"it [was] necessary for Avista ... to demonstrate that its need to invest in non-revenue generating plant, particularly distribution plant, [was] so necessary and immediate as to be beyond its control.\" AR at 727-28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b6 49 In an effort to address concerns about the \"Averch-Johnson effect,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   the WUTC declared that, although it no longer required a showing of extraordinary circumstances to justify attrition, it still required a persuasive demonstration \"that the attrition occurring is outside of [the utility's] control.\" AR at 728.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b6 50 In applying its new methodology to determine whether Avista should receive an attrition adjustment for its natural gas services, the WUTC noted that Avista had \"reasonably demonstrated that it is making significant investments in non-revenue generating plant for the purposes of safety and reliability.\" AR at 729. It found that Avista had \"established that the need for its capital investments in natural gas operations are beyond its control.\" AR at 730. Accordingly, it \"authorize[d] an attrition adjustment in accordance with the methodology advocated by Staff\" with some exceptions. AR at 730. The WUTC granted an attrition adjustment of approximately $6.8 million for Avista's natural gas operations, resulting in an overall increase in revenue requirement of $10.8 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b6 51 In applying the new attrition methodology to Avista's electrical services, the WUTC found that the evidence did \"not convince [it] that Avista's projected electric distribution investments [we]re entirely outside of its control, or [were] required for the safe and efficient operation of its system.\" AR at 732. Because there was \"some, but not complete, evidence\" that the attrition was outside Avista's control, the WUTC decided that it \"retain[ed] broad discretion to consider other factors, such as [Avista's] intent to file another rate case within the next year, and the analysis under\n   <em>\n    Hope\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   <em>\n    Bluefield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Permian Basin\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   AR at 733. The WUTC announced that it believed it could \"exercise broad discretion to consider such seminal cases using [its] informed judgment in deciding whether or not an attrition adjustment is warranted given the specific facts and circumstances in a rate case.\" AR at 733.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b6 52 The WUTC noted that, if it were to reject the attrition adjustment for electric revenue, Staff's modified historical test year analysis would reduce Avista's electric revenue requirement by more than $20 million. Although PCU and ICNU recommended higher reductions than that, the WUTC determined that it could not \"reasonably conclude such an end result would be appropriate under the standards in\n   <em>\n    Hope\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Bluefield\n   </em>\n   .\" AR at 734. It announced that its ratemaking responsibility \"turns not on the particular rate making methodology it selects,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , modified historical test year or attrition, but on its outcome, or 'end results.' \" AR at 734 (citing\n   <em>\n    Hope\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6143691\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/320/591/#p605\">\n    320 U.S. at 603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6143691\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/320/591/#p605\">\n    64 S.Ct. 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The WUTC then quoted the Washington Supreme Court's analysis of\n   <em>\n    Hope\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Permian Basin\n   </em>\n   , to conclude that \" 'within a fairly broad range, regulatory agencies exercise substantial discretion in selecting the appropriate rate making methodology.' \" AR at 735 (quoting\n   <em>\n    POWER 85,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1201372\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/104/798/#p808\">\n    104 Wash.2d at 812\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=711%20P.2d%20319\">\n    711 P.2d 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b6 53 The WUTC concluded that \"[a] drastic rate reduction, such as proposed by parties that urge us to reject an attrition adjustment, would run afoul\" of the ratemaking principles discussed in\n   <em>\n    POWER 85\n   </em>\n   . AR at 735. Based on its interpretation of\n   <em>\n    POWER 85\n   </em>\n   and its analysis of\n   <em>\n    Hope\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bluefield\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Permian Basin\n   </em>\n   , the WUTC granted Avista an attrition adjustment for its electric operations using Staff's attrition analysis, with two modifications. First, because Avista could not show that its proposed elevated investments in distribution plant were beyond its control, the WUTC removed all escalation of distribution\n   plant in calculating Avista's rate base. Second, it rejected both Avista's and Staff's calculation of the O&amp;M escalation rate, instead calculating the escalation rate itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \u00b6 54 The WUTC applied an attrition adjustment of $28.3 million and concluded that Avista's electric services revenue requirement should be reduced by approximately $8.1 million. Despite having granted Avista the attrition adjustment, the WUTC expressed frustration \"about continuing to authorize recovery for these significant capital investments, absent a complete demonstration by [Avista] of quantifiable benefits to ratepayers.\" AR at 737.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   B. FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b6 55 The WUTC found that \"[t]he evidentiary record support[ed] a finding that Avista [would] experience attrition in its electric and natural gas operations over the rate effective year\" and that \"[a]bsent an attrition adjustment, [Avista] may not have an opportunity to achieve earnings on electric operations at or near authorized levels.\" AR at 773.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b6 56 The WUTC concluded that Avista had met its burden to demonstrate that its gas rates were insufficient to yield reasonable compensation and required an upward adjustment, but that it failed to meet its burden to show the same for its electric rates. To set new rates, the WUTC \"accept[ed] and modif[ied] Staff's attrition methodology for the purposes of setting rates for Avista's natural gas operations as reasonable.\" AR at 776. It also accepted Staff's attrition methodology for setting electric rates, but \"remove[d] any escalation of projected capital investments for distribution plant\" because distribution plant costs had not been demonstrated \"as necessary or beyond [Avista's] control.\" AR at 776. It also modified the electric O&amp;M expense escalation rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b6 57 Avista filed tariff sheets reflecting the changes in rates. The new rates went into effect on January 11, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b6 58 PCU petitioned the Thurston County Superior Court for judicial review of the WUTC's decision and then applied for direct review by this court. The Superior Court certified the case to us for direct review pursuant to RCW 34.05.518.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   I. WAIVER\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b6 59 PCU assigns error to the WUTC's use of an attrition adjustment in determining Avista's rates because it relied on estimates that were not associated with any particular \"used and useful\" Avista plant. The WUTC contends that this challenge is untimely because PCU never made this argument before the WUTC and thus may not raise it on appeal. Because ICNU raised the issue before the agency, we consider its merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   A. LEGAL PRINCIPLES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \u00b6 60 The Washington Administrative Procedure Act (APA) provides that \"[i]ssues not raised before the agency may not be raised on appeal\" unless a specific exception applies.

Its argument was a single-sentence conclusory paragraph and its brief did not discuss the issue further. It cited ICNU witness Mullins's testimony on cross-examination that the attrition study would require reliance on capital that was not used and useful.

Therefore, if the attrition study and attrition adjustment was a methodology for determining Avista's used and useful rate base and O&amp;M expenses, the WUTC did not exceed its authority by using it.

In that study, McGuire calculated Avista's electric rate base for 2016 by determining its average rate of growth from 2009 to 2014\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   and applying that rate to the 2014 rate base. He then arrived at a rate base more than one hundred million dollars higher than the 2014 rate base. He used an identical process to calculate Avista's natural gas rate base, resulting\n   in a predicted 2016 rate base nearly fifty million dollars higher than the 2014 rate. McGuire acknowledged that he was \"not testifying to the used and useful nature of any specific plant beyond July of 2015.\" 5 WUTC Transcripts at 457.

In the tables it attached to its final order, it did not include any of McGuire's heightened attrition numbers in rate base. Rather, it included only the uncontested rate base adjustments and numbers reflecting planned capital additions for 2014 and 2015, based on the pro forma calculations. Then, after calculating rate base among other factors, it applied an attrition allowance it reached based on McGuire's attrition study, with the WUTC's modifications, at the end.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   \u00b6 90 Although the WUTC's final attrition analysis excluded all escalation of capital investment in distribution plant, McGuire's attrition analysis applied escalation to four other types of plant and several other categories of rate base,\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   none of which was excluded by the WUTC. Rather than assessing Avista's used and useful 2014 rate base, this process projected Avista's likely rate base in 2016 using historical trend data.
