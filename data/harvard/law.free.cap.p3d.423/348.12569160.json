We hold that the statute does not require ADWR to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 2 This case arises out of a 2013 adequate water supply designation by ADWR approving Pueblo Del Sol Water Company's (\"Pueblo\") application to supply water to a proposed development in Cochise County. Pueblo was formed in 1972 and received a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity (\"CC&amp;N\") from the Arizona Corporation Commission (\"Commission\") that year. Pueblo's service area covers approximately 4800 acres of land in Cochise County. Castle &amp; Cooke, Inc., which owns Pueblo, seeks to build a mixed-use development called \"Tribute,\" which would include about 7000 commercial and residential units near Sierra Vista. The proposed development site is located approximately five miles from the San Pedro River and is outside a statutory active management area (\"AMA\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 45-411(A) (identifying Arizona's AMAs).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 3 In 1988, Congress established the San Pedro Riparian National Conservation Area (\"SPRNCA\") and delegated management of SPRNCA to the Secretary of the Interior.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   16 U.S.C. \u00a7 460xx-1(a). The Bureau of Land Management (\"BLM\") manages national conservation areas, including SPRNCA, on behalf of the U.S. Department of the Interior. Congress also created an accompanying federal reserved water right to fulfill SPRNCA's conservation purpose and ordered the Secretary of the Interior to \"file a claim for the quantification of such rights in an appropriate stream adjudication.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 460xx-1(d). The right has a priority date of November 18, 1988, for purposes of establishing the federal government's priority in the seniority system that governs competing appropriation rights.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In addition to its federal reserved water right, SPRNCA has a 1985 state certificate-based surface water right and other pending state-based applications. SPRNCA's federal reserved water right will eventually be quantified in the Gila River General Stream Adjudication (the \"Gila Adjudication\") but remains unquantified after nearly thirty years of litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 4 Pueblo, which plans to provide the vast majority of Tribute's water services, calculated that it would need to increase its annual groundwater pumping from about 1430 acre-feet to 4870 acre-feet to meet Tribute's needs. When Pueblo applied to ADWR for an adequate water supply designation, BLM, Robin Silver, and Patricia Gerrodette (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") objected pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 45-108.01(B). ADWR then issued a draft decision and order finding that Pueblo's application satisfied the \"adequate water supply\" requirements under A.R.S. \u00a7 45-108(I) by showing that water would be \"continuously, legally and physically available\" to satisfy Tribute's water needs \"for at least one hundred years\" and that Pueblo possesses \"financial capability\" to construct necessary water facilities. Plaintiffs appealed, arguing, among other things, that the increase in Pueblo's groundwater pumping would affect the flow of the San Pedro River and would therefore conflict with BLM's federal reserved water right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 5 The administrative law judge (\"ALJ\") agreed with ADWR, concluding that Pueblo met its burden of demonstrating that water would be continuously, legally, and physically available. ADWR then issued an order affirming the ALJ's decision. Plaintiffs filed complaints for judicial review, which the superior court consolidated, but did not challenge the ALJ and ADWR's finding that Pueblo met the physical availability requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 6 The superior court vacated ADWR's decision, ruling that the agency erred in concluding that Pueblo's water supply is \"legally available.\" The court reasoned that ADWR was required to consider potential and existing legal claims that may affect the availability of the water supply, including BLM's unquantified federal water right. The court also awarded Silver and Gerrodette attorney fees\n   under A.R.S. \u00a7 12-348 and the private attorney general doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 7 The court of appeals vacated the superior court's decision and remanded the matter to ADWR.\n   <em>\n    Silver v.

The court held that the superior court erred in requiring ADWR to consider BLM's unquantified water right under ADWR's legal availability regulation, Arizona Administrative Code R12-15-718, and found that regulation consistent with A.R.S. \u00a7 45-108(I).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310174\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/131/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 141-42 \u00b6\u00b6 36-37,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310174\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/131/\">\n    384 P.3d at 824-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the court also concluded that, pursuant to ADWR's physical availability regulation, A.A.C. R12-15-716, ADWR \"must use its knowledge and expertise\" and apply its \"educated eye as to what the Gila Adjudication may eventually determine to be BLM's water right\" to consider the impact of BLM's unquantified water right on Pueblo's water supply.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310174\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/131/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 143-44 \u00b6 42,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310174\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/131/\">\n    384 P.3d at 826-27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 8 All parties filed petitions for review in this Court. We granted review because whether ADWR is required to consider unquantified federal reserved water rights when determining the adequacy of developers' water supplies presents an issue of statewide importance.

In fact, the statutory scheme is silent on the issue. It does not mention federal reserved water rights at all, nor does it define \"legally available.\" It is also not apparent from the term's plain language that it encompasses unquantified water rights that cannot be enforced now (or possibly ever) to enjoin a developer's groundwater pumping. \"Legally available\" could be interpreted as requiring ADWR to consider every conceivable water right that might someday affect a prospective developer's right to pump groundwater. Alternatively, it could mean that ADWR is only required to consider conflicting rights that are presently enforceable, or that a developer has a right to pump groundwater pursuant to the reasonable use doctrine. In other words, \"legally available\" is a broad phrase that could be interpreted in myriad ways. Indeed, it is a textbook example of a term that is \"[c]apable of being understood in either of two or more possible senses\" or \"[u]ncertain as regards course or outcome\"-the dictionary definitions of \"ambiguous.\"\n   <em>\n    Ambiguous\n   </em>\n   , Webster's Second New International Dictionary 81 (1949).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 24 Chief Justice Bales' dissent hinges on the premise that \"legally available\" is unambiguous and requires ADWR to consider unquantified federal reserved water rights. He reasons that \"[i]f the legislature had meant that a CC&amp;N alone could establish 'legal availability,' it could have easily said so.\"\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b654. However, the legislature could have also said that \"ADWR shall consider unquantified federal reserved water rights in making its legal availability determination.\" As previously noted, the legislature's silence on the issue evidences the statute's ambiguity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 25 But we are not left to guess the meaning of \"legally available.\" The history of \u00a7 45-108 and ADWR's regulations interpreting it shows that the legislature intended to adopt ADWR's definition of \"legal availability.\" Before 2007, \u00a7 45-108 gave the Director discretion to \"designate cities, towns and private water companies as having an adequate water supply,\" but did not define \"adequate water supply.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1994 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 203, \u00a7 1 (2d Reg. Sess.). The legislature apparently left that task to ADWR, which in 1995 construed \"adequate water supply\" as having three defined elements: physical availability, continuous availability, and legal availability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.A.C. R12-15-717(A)-(D) (Feb. 7, 1995). ADWR last amended the legal availability regulation in September 2006.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20Ariz.%20Admin.%20Reg.%203549\">\n    12 Ariz.

Importantly, when the legislature amended \u00a7 45-108 in 2007 to define adequate water supply, it adopted the same three elements-physical, continuous, and legal availability-without defining them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 45-108(I) ; 2007 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 240, \u00a7 8 (1st Reg. Sess.). These concepts are unique to ADWR's adequate water supply regulations. And any contention that the legislature was unaware of ADWR's definitions of physical, continuous, and legal availability falls\n   flat. Notably, the legislature ordered ADWR to make specific amendments to its physical availability regulation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2007 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 240, \u00a7 10 (1st Reg. Sess.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 26 Given that ADWR's definition of adequate water supply predates the legislative enactment by twelve years and was adopted by the legislature without change in 2007, we interpret the term \"legal availability\" according to ADWR's construction as of 2007.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Scalia &amp; Garner,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 322. The prior-construction canon applies with even greater force here because the legislature did not merely reaffirm an existing statutory definition in light of a new agency interpretation; it amended \u00a7 45-108 to add the precise language that originated in ADWR's regulations and that operationalized its adequate water supply regulatory scheme twelve years earlier. The fact that the legislature ordered ADWR to amend its physical availability regulation but not its legal availability regulation demonstrates that the legislature was aware of ADWR's regulations and capable of ordering amendments to the ones it found objectionable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2007 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 240, \u00a7 10 (1st Reg. Sess.). Consequently, we hold that ADWR's \"legal availability\" regulation is consistent with \u00a7 45-108 because the legislature amended the statute to adopt ADWR's definition of that term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 27 The dissents take issue with our application of the prior-construction canon to ADWR's definition of legal availability but express no similar qualms about the legislature's implicit adoption of the agency's definition of physical availability. In fact, they agree with the analysis above applying ADWR's physical availability regulation as written. Yet the dissents provide no principled reason, other than policy concerns, for accepting ADWR's definition of physical availability at face value while rejecting its definition of legal availability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 28 The dissents also contend that the prior-construction canon should not apply in light of the legislature's recent amendment of A.R.S. \u00a7 12-910.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b656-57, 82-83. That amendment requires Arizona courts to \"decide all questions of law, including the interpretation of a constitutional or statutory provision or a rule adopted by an agency, without deference to any previous determination that may have been made on the question by the agency.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2018 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 180, \u00a7 1 (2d Reg. Sess.) (effective Aug. 3, 2018). But the dissents' argument conflates judicial deference (also known as \"\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference\") with legislative adoption. The amendment prohibits courts from deferring to agencies' interpretations of law.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   (\"[T]he\n   <em>\n    court\n   </em>\n   shall decide all questions of law....\" (emphasis added) ). The amendment does not, however, prohibit the\n   <em>\n    legislature\n   </em>\n   from adopting an agency's interpretation of a term of art. The latter is what we have here, where the legislature amended \u00a7 45-108 to incorporate the term \"legally available\" from ADWR's regulation into the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 29 Moreover, in arguing that our interpretation of \u00a7 45-108\"renders 'legally available' meaningless,\"\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b653, or \"surplusage,\"\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b676, the dissents seem to overlook the bifurcated nature of Arizona's water management regime. Surface water rights are often subject to myriad competing legal claims because they are governed by the doctrine of prior appropriation.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b610. This explains ADWR's robust regulation addressing the legal availability of surface water.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.A.C. R12-15-718(E). But groundwater is subject to a very different legal doctrine-the doctrine of reasonable use-which provides that an overlying landowner has the\n   <em>\n    legal right\n   </em>\n   to \"capture as much groundwater as can reasonably be used upon the overlying land.\"\n   <em>\n    Gila III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"251932\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/195/411/\">\n    195 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   415 \u00b6 7 n.3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"251932\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/195/411/\">\n    989 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   743 n.3 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 45-453.

Without conducting such an analysis, the entire exercise of considering an unquantified federal reserved water right would be futile; the point is to determine whether the federal government's unquantified right could be enforced against Pueblo to prevent it from obtaining an adequate water supply. Because groundwater is subject to the reasonable use and the federal reserved water rights doctrines, not prior appropriation,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-13, only an injunction based on a federal reserved water right could legally inhibit Pueblo's right to pump.

As discussed above,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b614, a developer must demonstrate that it has a 100-year supply of water to obtain an adequate water supply designation. \u00a7 45-108(I)(1). The developer must also show that it has the financial capability to construct the necessary water supply facilities. \u00a7 45-108(I)(2). Counties, in turn, may automatically deny final plat approval to any developer who fails to satisfy any of \u00a7 45-108(I) 's requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 11-823(A). Far from leaving consumers at the mercy of \"shifty\" developers, this scheme, even without considering unquantified federal reserved water rights, provides consumers with considerable protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 40 Yet \u00a7 45-108 does not eliminate all water supply risk for consumers, nor was it designed to do so. The statute balances the reward of economic development with the mitigated risk that ADWR's water supply estimates will prove inaccurate or be subjected to revisions. The statutory scheme explicitly contemplates that a change in circumstances may result in the revocation of an adequate water supply designation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 45-108(F) (\"The director may revoke a designation made pursuant to this section when the director finds that the water supply may become inadequate.\"). It follows that the statute does not require developers to demonstrate absolute certainty of supply and that consumers who purchase land in reliance on an adequate water supply designation may have their expectations upended. Moreover, if the Director revokes an adequate water supply designation, consumers have no recourse against the state, the Director, or ADWR.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 45-108(G) (providing that \"[t]he state of Arizona and the director or department shall not be liable\" for issuing a designation, so long as it was \"prepared in good faith pursuant to this section\"). Any suggestion that the statute, as written, mandates a moratorium on development in the absence of an absolute certainty of a future water supply misconstrues its meaning and purpose.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 45-401(B) (stating that groundwater management is necessary to \"protect[ ] and stabiliz[e] the general economy and welfare of this state and its citizens\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 41 More fundamentally, neither \u00a7 45-108 nor A.A.C. R12-15-718 contemplates the issue of federal reserved water rights. Although\n   <em>\n    Cappaert\n   </em>\n   , which the United States Supreme Court decided in 1976, put the legislature and ADWR on notice that the federal government \"can protect its water from subsequent diversion[s]\" of groundwater,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174983\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/426/128/#p141\">\n    426 U.S. at 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174983\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/426/128/#p141\">\n    96 S.Ct. 2062\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , neither the statute nor the regulation requires ADWR to consider unquantified federal reserved water rights as part of its legal availability analysis.

We do not, nor is it this Court's prerogative to make this choice. Instead, we acknowledge and defer to the legislature's judgment. Whether the adequate water supply designation process should go further in protecting consumers is a matter for the legislature. As a threshold matter, the legislature could jettison the opt-in scheme and mandate counties' participation in the adequate water supply designation process. That the legislature did not make the process mandatory statewide further demonstrates the legislature's intent to provide only limited protection to consumers and simultaneously encourage development. If the scheme rigorously focused solely on consumer protection, as the dissents contend, we would expect it to be mandatory. Alternatively, the legislature could require ADWR, as Plaintiffs and the dissents urge, to engage in a comprehensive assessment of the potential impact of unquantified federal reserved water rights based upon speculative projections about litigation outcomes years or decades in the future. The legislature could in turn require ADWR to halt economic development by denying adequate water supply designations where unquantified federal reserved water rights cast any doubt on developments' 100-year water supplies. The legislature could also mandate developers to warn consumers that unquantified federal reserved water rights may impact the water supply of developments in Tribute's position.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the legislature has not done any of these things. In its current form, and in context, \u00a7 45-108 reflects the legislature's decision to adopt ADWR's definition of legal availability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 43 For all these reasons, we conclude that A.A.C. R12-15-718 is consistent with \u00a7 45-108 and that neither requires ADWR to consider unquantified federal reserved water rights as part of its legal availability analysis. In so holding, we need not decide whether ADWR must consider\n   <em>\n    quantified\n   </em>\n   federal reserved water rights. ADWR conceded at oral argument that it would have to acknowledge a quantified federal reserved water right if the federal government could prove, likely through an injunction proceeding, that an applicant's prospective groundwater pumping would infringe upon that right. ADWR's concession arises from the fact that the federal reserved water rights doctrine restricts the otherwise permissible reasonable and beneficial use of groundwater, codified in \u00a7 45-453, to the extent required to preserve the waters necessary to accomplish the purpose of a federal reservation.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b613. As such, ADWR acknowledges that an applicant for an adequate water supply designation, like any groundwater user outside an AMA, is subject to the reasonable use doctrine, as modified by the federal reserved water rights doctrine, and an injunction may, of its own force, prohibit or require action by ADWR independent of the legal availability process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 44 We readily acknowledge the consumer protection policy that animates the dissents. But this case is not about the wisdom of the policy underlying the adequate water supply statute. Our task is to discern the statute's meaning. The term \"legally available\" did not arise in a vacuum. The dissents ignore the determinative significance of the genesis of\n   the \"adequate water supply\" regulation and the context in which the legislature adopted it. For the reasons discussed, when the legislature adopted ADWR's regulation, it also imported ADWR's definitions operationalizing the scheme. We decline to recast the statute's meaning under the guise of interpreting it. Ultimately, the degree of acceptable risk to consumers' water supplies is a policy judgment best suited for the legislature.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Phoenix v.

In affirming ADWR's position, the majority relies on the canon of prior construction to conclude the legislature has endorsed ADWR's rule.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b625-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 51 The majority argues the statutory phrase \"legally available\" is ambiguous as to federal reserved water rights because it does not specifically mention them.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b623. This approach stands the normal understanding of language on its head: instead of assuming the general term includes the more specific (i.e., whether water is \"legally available\" embraces whether usage will be limited by prior and superior federal rights), the majority incorrectly posits that the general term is ambiguous because it does not expressly include the more specific. Because \u00a7 45-108 directs ADWR to \"evaluate\" if water will be \"legally available\" for Pueblo's proposed pumping, requiring ADWR to consider the SPRNCA's reserved rights reflects applying the statute by its terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 52 Having concluded that \"legally available\" does not mean what it says, the majority proceeds to conclude that the legislature implicitly intended to adopt ADWR's interpretation, even though, according to the majority,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b641, that interpretation does not even contemplate the impact of federal reserved water rights. But the congressionally reserved rights for the SPRNCA indisputably could, as a matter of federal and state law, limit prospective groundwater withdrawals for the subdivision. To allow ADWR to close its eyes to this fact in assessing if water will be legally available, the majority squints to find statutory ambiguity. Such interpretative myopia is not compelled by any canon of construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 53 Given the plain language and manifest consumer protection purposes of \u00a7 45-108, the majority's adherence to the canon of prior construction is perplexing. In the context of this case, ADWR's position impermissibly renders \"legally available\" meaningless. Counties outside active management areas, like Cochise, must opt in before developers are required to obtain an adequate water supply designation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 11-823(A), which includes the statutory requirement of legal availability. But this phrase has no force with respect to private water companies if it refers only to a CC&amp;N and beneficial use under A.R.S. \u00a7 45-453, as those requirements apply whether or not a county chooses to be in the adequate water supply program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 40-281 ;\n   <em>\n    Ariz.

If the legislature had meant that a CC&amp;N alone could establish \"legal availability,\" it could have easily said so. This point is not answered by\n   the majority's effort to characterize ADWR's rule as a \"longstanding interpretation\" that predated the 2007 amendments.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b625-26. Even ADWR does not think its rule fully defines \"legal availability,\" as it acknowledged in this Court that the phrase also requires compliance with \u00a7 45-453 (which is not specified in the rule). Thus, ADWR itself recognizes that a controlling background legal principle, such as the \"reasonable use\" requirement of \u00a7 45-453, can affect whether water will be \"legally available,\" and the same should be true for federal reserved water rights. If ADWR itself has not interpreted its rules as fully defining the term \"legal availability,\" then how can one impute to the legislature any intent to endorse such an interpretation as a matter of prior construction?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 55 The majority accuses the dissents of seeking to \"add\" to or \"recast\" \u00a7 45-108 to cover matters it does not address.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b631, 41, 44. This assertion falls flat: the majority inconsistently argues both that the statute does not apply as written and that the dissents' interpretation improperly seeks to rewrite it; relatedly, insofar as the majority contends that the dissents disregard the statute's language or intent, it presumes the correctness of its own interpretation, thus committing the logical fallacy of using a premise to support itself. Finally, the majority contends that if the legislature intended to require ADWR to consider federal reserved water rights in assessing legal availability, it failed to do so in \u00a7 45-108.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b644. Thus, the majority says it will not apply the statute by its terms even if doing so would further the legislature's intent, and this approach respects the proper role of the courts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   I disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 56 Finally, deferring to ADWR's interpretation of its rule seems contrary to the legislature's recent amendments to A.R.S. \u00a7 12-910, which directs:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   In a proceeding brought by or against the regulated party, the court shall decide all questions of law, including the interpretation of a constitutional or statutory provision or a rule adopted by an agency, without deference to any previous determination that may have been made on the question by the agency.

If it is objectionable to cede the power to interpret statutes or rules to an agency, isn't it even more objectionable to cede to an agency-as the majority effectively does-the very power to pass statutes by inferring, from legislative silence, an intent to enact preexisting agency regulations? Based on the \"prior construction\" canon, one might reasonably conclude that if courts have authoritatively interpreted a particular term (e.g., \"special weight\" or \"creditors\"), the term has the same meaning when later adopted in a statute concerning the same subject.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Marriage of Friedman &amp; Roels\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=244%20Ariz.%20111\">\n    244 Ariz. 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 115 \u00b6 14, 116 \u00b6 20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567668\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/418/884/#p888\">\n    418 P.3d 884\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 888, 889 (2018) ;\n   <em>\n    Moore v.

Therefore, ADWR cannot determine that Pueblo will have \"legally available\" water without evaluating whether the federal reserved rights will limit the subdivision's projected use. To be sure, directing ADWR to fulfill its statutory responsibilities does not determine whether the permit at issue should be approved. But ADWR should consider the SPRNCA's water rights before it grants Pueblo an adequate water supply designation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b6 66 Pueblo and ADWR argue, and the majority agrees, that consideration of unadjudicated rights is impermissibly speculative.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b632, 34, 36. They reason that ADWR will be forced to make several assumptions regarding the purposes of the reservation, whether those purposes require water, whether water supplies other than groundwater will be sufficient, whether there is a causal connection between groundwater pumping and adverse impacts to the reservation, and even whether BLM would seek to enforce its rights. But many of these \"assumptions\" have already been established. BLM has repeatedly sought to protect and enforce its water rights, as evidenced by its claims in the Gila Adjudication and its litigation here. Furthermore, the conservation area's purposes, reserved water rights, and priority date have already been established by federal law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 460xx, 460xx-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b6 67 ADWR-our state's department of\n   <em>\n    water resources\n   </em>\n   -has the expertise and resources necessary to analyze the physical interactions of water withdrawals and the legal interactions between water rights.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , A.R.S. \u00a7 45-105(A)(1)-(4). The consideration of the SPRNCA's unadjudicated water rights would be no more speculative than many of the calculations and estimations ADWR already makes in its 100-year adequate water supply evaluation. Given the degree of speculation attendant to any evaluation of a 100-year water supply, the fact that the SPRNCA's reserved rights are not yet quantified does not justify ADWR abdicating its statutory responsibility. ADWR, as the state agency empowered to \"[m]easure, survey and investigate the water resources of this state,\" A.R.S. \u00a7 45-105(A)(4), could conduct a hydrological study to determine whether Pueblo's proposed increase in groundwater pumping, when combined with existing groundwater pumping in the watershed, would infringe the SPRNCA's federal reserved water rights so as to defeat the purpose of the conservation area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b6 68 Pueblo and ADWR next argue that it would be inappropriate for ADWR to consider BLM's unquantified federal water rights because ADWR currently serves as a technical advisor to the Gila Adjudication, where BLM's rights are being litigated. Pueblo claims that this \"dual role\" as technical advisor and adjudicator would create separation of powers and due process concerns. Pueblo misapprehends the legal availability analysis. ADWR is not required to conclusively quantify the conservation area's water rights in assessing whether water will be legally available for Pueblo's proposed development. Instead, it must only consider the potential impact that Pueblo's groundwater pumping will have on the SPRNCA's water rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Any calculations ADWR would make regarding those rights, including any impact of Pueblo's proposed pumping, would have no precedential effect and would not usurp the Gila Adjudication's judicial authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b6 69 The majority prioritizes the interests of subdivision developers over those of homeowners, observing that the \"stakes of this speculative process would be exceedingly high, given that a finding of inadequate water supply precludes development.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b632. But the potential harm suffered by homeowners would be even higher if their property is one day rendered almost worthless due to an inadequate water supply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b6 70 Trial to quantify the conservation area's water rights is currently set to begin on January 28, 2019.\n   <em>\n    See In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    San Pedro Riparian National Conservation Area\n   </em>\n   , Contested Case No. W1-11-232, Scheduling Order, Maricopa County Superior Court (June 15, 2018). At oral argument, ADWR conceded that it could consider quantified federal reserved water rights in its legal availability analysis, but that it would do so only if \"the federal government could prove, likely through an injunction, that an applicant's prospective groundwater pumping would infringe upon that right.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b643. The majority seems to agree, summarily concluding that \"only an injunction based on a federal reserved water right could legally inhibit Pueblo's right to pump.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b636. This approach threatens to undermine both \u00a7 45-108 and the reserved rights Congress recognized for the SPRNCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b6 71 Problematically, the majority misapprehends the relationship between our prior case law and ADWR's granting an adequate water supply designation. The majority cites\n   <em>\n    Gila III\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that our caselaw \"disfavors consideration of unquantified federal reserved water rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b633. To be sure,\n   <em>\n    Gila III\n   </em>\n   described as premature the tribes' argument to \"immediately enjoin pumping that is depleting water beneath reservations\" because, \"[u]ntil federal rights are quantified, it cannot be determined which if any of the tribes are entitled to such relief.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"251932\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/195/411/\">\n    195 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   421 \u00b6 35 n.12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"251932\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/195/411/\">\n    989 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   749 n.12.

This interpretation defeats the adequate water supply provision's manifest purpose to proactively protect consumers in Arizona\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   they purchase property. The plain text of \u00a7 45-108(I) requires ADWR to prospectively evaluate a 100-year water supply, and not merely to evaluate what has already happened. Moreover, this interpretation could also damage the federally protected ecosystem by allowing diminishment of the base flow and groundwater levels.

Because the majority's construction renders\n   that command essentially meaningless, I respectfully dissent from that portion of the opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b6 75 Our task here implicates multiple canons of statutory interpretation, of which the majority hitches its outcome to mainly one. The first relevant principle is the presumption against ineffectiveness, which holds that a textually permissible interpretation that furthers rather than obstructs the statute's purpose should be favored. Antonin Scalia &amp; Bryan A. Garner,\n   <em>\n    Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts\n   </em>\n   63 (2012). As Scalia and Garner explain, \"This canon follows inevitably from the facts that (1) interpretation always depends on context, (2) context always includes evident purpose, and (3) evident purpose always includes effectiveness.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"251932\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/195/411/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, although we do not know from the text exactly what a determination of legal availability entails, we do know that such a determination is required. From the language and context, the evident purpose is to protect consumers against purchasing homes for which water supply may be insufficient. As a cardinal principle of statutory interpretation, we should favor an interpretation that gives substantive meaning to the statutory command rather than one that defeats or diminishes its evident purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b6 76 A second and related principle is the surplusage canon, which holds that if possible, \"every word and every provision is to be given effect,\" and that \"it is no more the court's function to revise by subtraction than by addition.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 174. Scalia and Garner observe that \"this canon prevents not [only] the total disregard of a provision, but an interpretation that renders it pointless.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 176. As the Chief Justice points out, that is exactly what the majority does here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b653.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   \u00b6 77 The majority decision rests largely on a third principle, the prior-construction canon, which holds that where a term is undefined, the legislature is deemed to have adopted a preexisting interpretation by, among other entities, an administrative agency.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b622-28. Here, the Arizona Department of Water Resources (\"ADWR\") had a preexisting regulation defining legal availability, and the majority assumes that by its definitional silence, the legislature implicitly adopted it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   \u00b6 78 The canon's legal foundation is solid and its application here is intuitively appealing. But where, as here, it collides with other fundamental interpretive principles, its application should be carefully considered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b6 79 As a threshold question, we should ask how far this principle logically extends. For instance, if the agency had issued a preexisting rule saying the Director should determine legal availability by eating a jelly sandwich, surely we would not apply that definition even if the legislature subsequently adopted the legal availability terminology without defining it. So too should we not adopt the preexisting agency definition here if it is inconsistent with the subsequent legislative enactment, given that agency authority derives entirely from express legislative delegation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ariz.

To determine legal availability, ADWR's regulation requires only one thing: that the applicant has secured a certificate of convenience and necessity (\"CC&amp;N\") from the Arizona Corporation Commission. Ariz. Admin. Code R12-15-718(C). The Commission has no jurisdiction over water. Its authority to grant CC&amp;Ns applies generically to public service corporations constructing any \"street railroad, [ ] line, plant, service or system.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 40-281(A). The CC&amp;N process entails no analysis whatsoever of water supply. Obtaining a CC&amp;N tells us absolutely nothing about the legal availability of water for a single day much less for the next\n   hundred years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   That is especially true here, where the CC&amp;N was obtained forty-six years ago, before either ADWR's regulation or the statute requiring a legal availability determination. The majority notes that the Commission could order construction of additional facilities in the public interest,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b630, but again, that has nothing to do with legal availability. Obtaining a CC&amp;N is thus completely unrelated to determining legal availability and would be highly unlikely to survive challenge had ADWR adopted it to implement the statutory command to determine legal availability. We therefore should not impute to the legislature an intent to define the statutory command in this manner, particularly when by so doing we would drain that command of any meaningful content.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \u00b6 81 Moreover, the statutory command to determine legal availability is directed to \"the director of water resources,\" \u00a7 45-108(B), (I)(1), suggesting that the legislature, in fact, meant for the Director to conduct the analysis, and not to outsource it to another agency. Ironically, in one breath, ADWR argues that the statute cannot mean what it says because it lacks the expertise to project legal availability; while in the next, it urges us to accept a CC&amp;N issued by the Arizona Corporation Commission before ADWR's regulation was even adopted as compliance with the statutory command.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   \u00b6 82 Further, as the Chief Justice observes,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b656, the legislature itself recently has categorically instructed that with regard to statutory interpretation, we should provide\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   deference \"to any previous determination that may have been made on the question by the agency.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 12-910(E) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   2018 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 180, \u00a7 1 (2d Reg. Sess.) (effective Aug. 3, 2018).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   ADWR's definition of legal availability is a \"previous determination ... on the question by the agency\" and therefore we should give it no weight. Whatever continuing vitality, if any, the prior-construction canon has in Arizona with regard to agency interpretations or definitions, it must yield to enforcement of the statute's language and context and the evident purpose that we derive from it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   \u00b6 83 The majority thwarts that purpose, creating a Swiss cheese statute with robust obligations on either side and a hole in the middle. As the majority describes it, ADWR's process to determine physical availability is rigorous, requiring among other things, a hydrology study and independent determination that the groundwater will be drawn from certain wells and at certain depths, taking into account projected declines in water level caused by existing uses.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b617;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Silver v. Pueblo Del Sol Water Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310174\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/131/\">\n    241 Ariz. 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 141 \u00b6 32,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310174\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/131/\">\n    384 P.3d 814\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 824 (App. 2016) (Analysis entailed \"consideration of the water already committed to approximately 200 area users.\"). Similarly, the obligation that the applicant demonstrate financial capability to construct the water facilities, including a delivery system and any storage facility or treatment works, \u00a7 45-108(I)(2), is substantial on its face. It would be incongruous for the legislature, in a list of prerequisites, to include two that relate directly and substantively to the provision of water supply and another that seems to on its face but in reality does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   \u00b6 84 The majority's interpretation similarly frustrates the statute's evident consumer protection purpose. It tries to assure us otherwise but fails. First, it points back at the very statute it has eviscerated to show that it \"provides consumers with vigorous protections against unscrupulous developers,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b639-but of course now\n   <em>\n    without\n   </em>\n   meaningful analysis that water will be legally\n   available. Then it notes that ADWR can revoke its availability determination, which of course is cold comfort to homeowners who purchase homes in reliance on that determination, especially when coupled with the fact that if the agency does so, \"consumers have no recourse against the state, the Director, or ADWR.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b640 (citing A.R.S. \u00a7 45-108(G) ). The majority acknowledges that the legislature could require a \"comprehensive assessment of the potential impact of unquantified federal reserved water rights based upon speculative projections about litigation outcomes years or decades in the future.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b642. Of course, speculation is inherent in any projection regarding water availability, legal or otherwise, \"for at least one hundred years,\" but that is exactly what the statute commands. \u00a7 45-108(I)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   \u00b6 85 Any analysis of legal availability necessarily includes known competing claims, even if they are not finally adjudicated. No one would purchase a residence that was subject to eminent domain proceedings, even if they were incomplete. The legislature plainly wanted ADWR to provide an analysis, as best it can given the inherent uncertainty, of the projected water supply's future legal availability. Certainly, that is a more logical inference than that the legislature wanted the developer to obtain a CC&amp;N from the Arizona Corporation Commission. If it did, it surely employed an odd term (\"legal availability\") to accomplish that purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   \u00b6 86 To recap: no legal availability determination was made in this case; no meaningful legal availability determination will be made in future cases; and consumers have no recourse under these statutes even if it would have been clearly foreseeable to ADWR that the water supply would not be legally available for the next hundred years. That could not have been what the legislature intended when it included legal availability within the requisite tripartite analysis. We can either read the obligation, in light of its plain language and evident purpose, to mean exactly what it says, or we can read it to mean essentially nothing. I opt for the former not because I prefer that policy result, but on the ground that we should never presume that the people's elected representatives meant to accomplish nothing when they enacted a statutory provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   \u00b6 87 I agree with the Chief Justice that ADWR's projection is not a predetermination of legal rights, has no precedential effect, and does not usurp the Gila Adjudication's judicial authority.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b668. The majority creates a straw man by suggesting that the dissenters would rewrite the statute,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b644, to \"mandate[ ] a moratorium on development in the absence of an absolute certainty of a future water supply.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b640. Quite to the contrary, our interpretation would enforce the statute as written, which in my view contemplates nothing more than a nonbinding analysis. The determination required of ADWR does not require exactitude; indeed, by its explicit terms, all it requires is good faith. \u00a7 45-108(G). By contrast, the majority's interpretation largely erases the statutory requirement, which absent a constitutional infirmity that is not suggested here, we are not empowered to do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   \u00b6 88 The legislature has justifiably reposed great confidence and responsibility in ADWR. We should effectuate its decision to do so. With great respect to my colleagues, I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   PELANDER, J., concurring in the partial dissents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   \u00b6 89 This is a close and important case, with good arguments on both sides. I join the Chief Justice's partial dissent because, viewed in context and in light of the statute's undisputed consumer-protection purpose, the phrase \"legally available\" in A.R.S. \u00a7 45-108(I)(1) is not ambiguous; therefore, ADWR's mandatory evaluation and determination under \u00a7 45-108(B) must include its consideration of federal reserved water rights. Given that unambiguity, I find persuasive the Chief Justice's reasoning and conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   \u00b6 90 But assuming the reference to \"legally available\" in \u00a7 45-108(I)(1) is ambiguous, as the majority concludes and Justice Bolick implies, I agree with the analysis and conclusion in Justice Bolick's partial dissent. Among other things, I find illogical the notion that issuance to Pueblo of a CC&amp;N by the Arizona Corporation Commission nearly\n   a half-century ago ipso facto satisfies the mandatory duty owed by ADWR now, decades later, to \"evaluate\" and \"determine whether there is an adequate water supply for the subdivision.\" \u00a7 45-108(B). That premise seems particularly unfounded inasmuch as any development, let alone one the magnitude of \"Tribute,\" was neither contemplated nor planned until long after the CC&amp;N was issued in 1972.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   \u00b6 91 Because the statutory interpretation issues here are of statewide interest and importance, the legislature should carefully and promptly consider the parties' arguments and our differing opinions. If the majority has it wrong, statutory clarification would be helpful to developers, consumers, water companies, ADWR, and many other entities and persons who care about and are affected by water issues in this state.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    Cochise County, acting pursuant to this statutory authority, requires developers to obtain an adequate water supply designation before it will approve a final plat for a subdivision.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Cochise County Subdivision Reg. 408.03.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    Therefore, it is simply incorrect to claim, as Justice Bolick does, that the CC&amp;N requirement has no effect after a CC&amp;N issues.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    \u00b680.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    To circumvent this speculative process, BLM contends that ADWR should consider its right at face value, as ADWR considers certain surface water claims elsewhere in the legal availability regulation.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    A.A.C. R12-15-718(E)(3). Face value consideration is not warranted here because the regulations do not contemplate its application to groundwater and no one can predict with any degree of certainty what quantified rights the Gila Adjudication, which is hotly contested, will assign to BLM.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    Justice Bolick claims that we mainly rely on only one canon of statutory interpretation-the prior-construction canon-and suggests that his interpretation is superior because he relies on two.\n    <em>\n     Infra\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b675-76. In fact, we also rely on the omitted-case canon and the ordinary meaning canon. For the reasons discussed above,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b629, 38-39, his application of the presumption against ineffectiveness and the surplusage canon is misguided because it arises from the erroneous premise that an interpretation of a statute that fails to give its purpose the most fulsome effect, rather than defeats or obstructs its purpose, necessarily renders the statute ineffective or surplusage.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    At oral argument, Pueblo conceded that regardless of what the law requires, it would \"have no problem\" giving notice to prospective homebuyers that the development's water rights may be adversely affected by the outcome of the Gila Adjudication.

The statute provides absolutely no guarantees or warranties, except that such an analysis will in fact take place.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
