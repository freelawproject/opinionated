In this case, the trial court admitted a booking video of defendant over an OEC 403 objection because the video bore on the central issue in the case-the identity of the person who had taken money from the victim's bank account. A divided Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's ruling, not because the trial court had abused its discretion in admitting the video but because it had failed to sufficiently explain the basis for its ruling.\n   <em>\n    State v.

We allowed the state's petition for review to consider that recurring issue. We now reverse the Court of Appeals decision and affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Three people-Debra, Michelle, and Charles-shared a house in Lincoln City. Defendant needed a place to stay, and Debra and Michelle agreed that defendant could \"crash\" at their house for a couple of days.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The weekend after defendant began staying at their house, Debra tried to withdraw money from her Wells Fargo bank account at an ATM but was unable to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On Monday morning, Debra checked with Wells Fargo and learned that someone had withdrawn $300 from her account at a Wells Fargo ATM and that the personal identification number (PIN) for her account had been changed. She also learned that, six or seven minutes after $300 had been withdrawn from the Wells Fargo ATM, someone had attempted to withdraw additional funds from her account at a nearby Bank of America ATM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After learning that information, Debra went home and found that her emergency ATM card, with her PIN attached, had been taken from the dresser drawer in her bedroom. She also realized that defendant had moved out of her house on Sunday rather than later, as he initially had planned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Debra notified the police, who obtained a surveillance video from the Bank of America ATM.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The police showed Debra and Michelle stills taken from the video, which depicted a person attempting to use Debra's ATM card at the Bank of America ATM and also walking away from the ATM. The stills either do not show the person's face or do not do so clearly. Despite that fact, both Debra and Michelle identified the person in the stills as defendant, based on the clothing that the person was wearing and the person's general physical resemblance (height and build) to defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   When asked at trial what stood out to her about the person depicted in the stills, Debra testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"The red gloves, the shoes he's wearing, the pants that he's wearing, uh, the coat. I mean, the stuff is what I had seen [defendant] in all the days that he had been staying at our house. A hoodie. A gray hoodie, which is underneath this.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Both Debra and Michelle described the red gloves pictured in the stills as distinctive; there is a print of a skeleton's fingers on the gloves, which were similar to gloves that Debra and Michelle had seen defendant wear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On cross-examination, defense counsel brought out that the person's face in the stills could not be seen clearly, that the clothes were relatively common, and that it was not completely clear from the stills how tall the person was. Defense counsel also elicited testimony from Debra and Michelle that they had had \"prior theft issues at the house,\" that their roommate Charles had a gambling problem, and that Charles had twice stolen the rent money. Both Debra and Michelle testified, however, that the person\n   in the stills did not resemble Charles, who had a moustache.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   To support its claim that defendant was the person depicted in the stills, the state offered a booking video of defendant taken approximately two weeks after the withdrawal from Debra's bank account. The state wanted to introduce the video to show that defendant was wearing the same or similar clothing in the booking video as the person\n   depicted in the Bank of America stills. Defendant objected to the video's admission, and the parties engaged in the following colloquy with the court outside the jury's presence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: [What] I'm expecting [the state] to show here is there's some, um, some video of [defendant] walking into the jail after he was arrested. So he's kind of, uh, in handcuffs, walking into the jail. There's no audio.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"* * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"I guess what my concern becomes is it's showing [defendant] in custody. Just as in trial here, um, you know, the jury's not to know custodial status, seeing him, you know, with the walk of shame, handcuffs on, being taken to the jail I think creates a, creates a problem for us. Even understanding the State's trying to show it for what he's wearing, nonetheless, it's, it's certainly showing him in, in police custody, and that's where my, um, my concern lies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"THE COURT: Is that an objection?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes.

First, relying on\n   <em>\n    State v. Mayfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2177086\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/302/631/\">\n    302 Or. 631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2177086\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/302/631/\">\n    733 P.2d 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987), defendant argued that the trial court should have provided a more complete explanation of its ruling; specifically, he argued that the trial court should have identified on the record the nature of the competing interests at stake and then explained how it balanced them. Second, defendant argued that, even if the trial court's explanation were sufficient, the court abused its discretion in balancing the probative value of the video against the danger of unfair prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Court of Appeals unanimously disagreed with defendant's second argument; it concluded that admitting the booking video did not constitute an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12411276\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/282/24/\">\n    282 Or. App. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   25 n. 1,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12411276\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/282/24/\">\n    386 P.3d 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, only a majority of the panel agreed with defendant's first argument-that\n   <em>\n    Mayfield\n   </em>\n   required a more complete explanation of the trial court's OEC 403 ruling. The majority was troubled by the trial court's reference to the video's \"relevance\" and explained that an OEC 403 analysis requires more than a determination of relevance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12411276\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/282/24/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12411276\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/282/24/\">\n    at 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12411276\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/282/24/\">\n    386 P.3d 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It noted that the trial court did not expressly identify the probative value of the booking video, consider the prejudice resulting from showing defendant in custody, or expressly balance the probative value of the evidence against its prejudicial effect.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12411276\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/282/24/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12411276\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/282/24/\">\n    at 29-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12411276\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/282/24/\">\n    386 P.3d 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Judge DeVore dissented, reasoning that the trial court's analysis, considered in the context of the parties' arguments, complied with\n   <em>\n    Mayfield\n   </em>\n   's requirement that a trial court make a record that reflects its exercise of discretion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12411276\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/282/24/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12411276\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/282/24/\">\n    at 34-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12411276\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/282/24/\">\n    386 P.3d 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (DeVore, J., dissenting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   On review, the state argues that the Court of Appeals misperceived what\n   <em>\n    Mayfield\n   </em>\n   requires. It notes that OEC 403 does not expressly require that trial courts make factual findings or state their reasoning on the record, as other evidence rules and statutes do.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   OEC 803(24) (requiring predicate findings); ORS 137.120(1) (requiring that the trial court state its reasoning on the record). And the state urges us to read\n   <em>\n    Mayfield\n   </em>\n   narrowly, which it contends focused on the merits of the OEC 403 ruling, not the sufficiency of the trial court's explanation. Finally, the state notes that a more comprehensive explanation is not required to permit meaningful appellate review. Defendant, for his part, reads\n   <em>\n    Mayfield\n   </em>\n   as part of a broader line of cases that have required trial courts to articulate the premises of their decisions to facilitate meaningful appellate review-a requirement that, he asserts, is uniquely appropriate in light of the complexity inherent in OEC 403 rulings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Given the Court of Appeals' reliance on\n   <em>\n    Mayfield\n   </em>\n   , we begin with that decision and explain why we conclude that the trial court's explanation was sufficient to comply with\n   <em>\n    Mayfield\n   </em>\n   . We then turn to the state's preservation argument and defendant's argument that a more extensive explanation was necessary to facilitate appellate review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The OEC 403 issue in\n   <em>\n    Mayfield\n   </em>\n   arose in an unusual posture. The state had charged the defendant in that case with sexually abusing his fianc\u00e9e's eight-year-old daughter. At trial, the defendant questioned the child's credibility because she had failed to mention any sexual abuse when a caseworker from the Children's Services Division (CSD) had interviewed her.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2177086\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/302/631/\">\n    302 Or. at 634\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2177086\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/302/631/\">\n    733 P.2d 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The child reported the abuse to her mother after the CSD interview, and the defendant argued that the reported abuse was part of a larger effort orchestrated by the child's mother to keep the defendant from gaining custody of the couple's two-year-old son.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2177086\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/302/631/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response to that defense, the state elicited evidence from the child that she had denied any sexual abuse to the caseworker because she feared that she would not see her mother again if she accused the defendant of abuse.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2177086\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/302/631/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The state also sought to introduce the child's testimony that she was aware (based on what she had seen and what her mother had told her) that the defendant had sexually\n   abused her younger sister. The state argued that that evidence was relevant for two reasons. First, the CSD caseworker was investigating alleged sexual abuse of the younger sister, and the child's knowledge of that abuse explained why the CSD caseworker was interviewing her.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2177086\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/302/631/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2177086\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/302/631/\">\n    at 634\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2177086\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/302/631/\">\n    733 P.2d 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, the state argued that, when the child learned that the defendant might gain custody of her younger brother, she became concerned that the defendant would sexually abuse her brother as he had abused her and her younger sister.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2177086\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/302/631/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2177086\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/302/631/\">\n    at 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2177086\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/302/631/\">\n    733 P.2d 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It followed, the state argued, that the child's knowledge that the defendant had sexually abused her younger sister was relevant to explain why the child came forward after the CSD interview and told her mother that the defendant also had sexually abused her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Initially, the trial court ruled that the first ground the state identified for admitting evidence of the younger sister's abuse was not sufficient.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2177086\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/302/631/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2177086\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/302/631/\">\n    at 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2177086\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/302/631/\">\n    733 P.2d 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It reasoned that the evidence was highly prejudicial while the state's interest in explaining why the CSD caseworker was interviewing the child was minimal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2177086\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/302/631/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, after further consideration, the trial court concluded that the state had a strong interest in rehabilitating the child (its primary witness regarding the charged crimes) by showing why she had reported the abuse to her mother after having denied any abuse to the CSD caseworker.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2177086\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/302/631/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2177086\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/302/631/\">\n    at 636-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2177086\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/302/631/\">\n    733 P.2d 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Rather, as\n   <em>\n    Turnidge\n   </em>\n   demonstrates, a court will make a sufficient record under\n   <em>\n    Mayfield\n   </em>\n   if the trial court's ruling, considered in light of the parties' arguments, demonstrates that the court balanced the appropriate considerations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   With that standard in mind, we turn to the parties' arguments before the trial court. As set out above, both parties focused on the probative value of the booking video, the danger of unfair prejudice, and the balance the court should strike. The prosecutor explained that, because defendant's clothing in the booking video was \"real similar\" to that worn by the person who had used Debra's ATM card, the video was \"very relevant to the State's case to prove identity,\" which the parties agreed was the central issue in the case. The prosecutor acknowledged that, although seeing defendant in handcuffs in the booking video had a potential for prejudice,\n   the prejudice was minimized by the fact that the jury would understand that booking is a process that everyone charged with a crime must go through. In light of that consideration, the prosecutor explained that she did not see how the booking video was \"so, um, prejudicial in this case, um, to exclude this highly, um, probative, relevant information.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Defendant took a different view. He acknowledged that the booking video had \"some relevance,\" but he contended that the prejudicial effect of seeing him in handcuffs in the booking video was essentially the same as seeing him wear prison garb during trial. As a result, he argued that the booking video was \"too prejudicial\" to be admissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In considering the parties' arguments, the trial court asked to see the part of the booking video that the state wanted to offer at trial. The trial court explained that, \"[f]rankly, it'll help me decide the balancing issue.\" The court watched the video once. It then asked if it could look at it again and asked if the state could stop the video \"when he's coming through the doorway there, just so I could take a look at the clothing.\" The court noted that it wanted to see the video where it showed defendant's pants and shoes. The prosecutor commented that the video showed defendant wearing \"the dark hoodie, the same fading type of jeans, and the same shoes.\" After clarifying that the booking video was taken closer in time than it initially had understood, the court ruled, \"Um, um, it's relevant. I'll give, uh, a cautionary instruction. So I'm going to overrule the objection.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Viewing the trial court's ruling in light of the parties' arguments, we conclude that the record demonstrates that the trial court assessed the probative value of the booking video. The probative value of evidence is a function of two variables: the degree to which evidence is relevant to prove or disprove an issue and the extent to which that issue is material to the resolution of the case. Here, the state argued (and defendant did not dispute) that the central issue at trial was identification: Was defendant the person pictured in the Bank of America stills? And the state argued that the booking video was \"very relevant\" and \"highly relevant\" to prove that issue, while defendant argued that the video had only \"some relevance.\" That is, the parties disputed the degree to which the booking video was relevant to prove that defendant was the person in the Bank of America stills, and that issue turned on the similarity between the clothes shown in the video and the stills.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The trial court sought to resolve that dispute by viewing the booking video twice and asking the state to stop the video so that the court could examine the clothes that defendant was wearing in the video-clothes that the state reminded the court were very similar to the ones shown in the stills. Read in the context of the parties' arguments, the trial court's statement that the video was \"relevant\" reflects its determination that the clothing was sufficiently similar to and possessed a sufficient degree of relevance on the central issue in the case to admit the video over defendant's OEC 403 objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   We agree with the Court of Appeals' observation that in some cases describing evidence as \"relevant\" will mean only that the evidence has a minimal tendency to prove or disprove an issue in a case. However, viewed in context of the parties' debate and the court's examination of the booking video, the trial court's use of the word \"relevant\" served as a shorthand way of describing the trial court's agreement with the state that the video was very relevant to prove a central issue in the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Similarly, the parties' arguments regarding prejudice fairly exhausted the subject. Defendant argued that a booking video showing him walking into the jail in handcuffs is effectively no less prejudicial than having him sit through trial in prison garb. The state argued in response that the jury would not place undue significance on seeing defendant in handcuffs in the booking video because the testimony would remind the jury that booking is an ordinary process that everyone charged with a crime must undergo. In asking to view the video, the trial court explained that doing so-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , seeing the degree of similarity between the clothing-will \"help me decide the balancing issue.\" In context, the trial court's statement is sufficient\n   for us to conclude that it balanced the probative value of the booking video against the danger of unfair prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   We appreciate the Court of Appeals' thoughtful opinions in this case. And it is true, as the majority in the Court of Appeals observed, that the trial court did not expressly assess the probative value of the booking video and the danger of unfair prejudice, nor did it expressly balance those two concepts. However, the same could be said about the trial courts' OEC 403 rulings in\n   <em>\n    Turnidge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Johanesen\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Barkley\n   </em>\n   , all of which this court upheld because we could determine from the record that the trial court had considered and weighed those factors. Put differently,\n   <em>\n    Mayfield\n   </em>\n   sets out the factors that trial courts should consider in resolving an OEC 403 objection, but it does not require that trial courts go through a checklist on the record in order to avoid a reversal or a remand. Rather, as\n   <em>\n    Turnidge\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Johanesen\n   </em>\n   make clear, in assessing the sufficiency of a trial court's explanation of its OEC 403 ruling, appellate courts should consider the trial court's ruling in light of the arguments that the parties made on the merits of the issues raised by an OEC 403 objection, as well as whether either party asked the court to provide a more complete explanation of its ruling. Considering the trial court's statements in light of the parties' arguments, we conclude that the record sufficiently reflects that the trial court balanced the probative value of the booking video against its prejudicial effect, particularly in light of defendant's failure to raise any issue at trial regarding the sufficiency of the court's explanation of its ruling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Turnidge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12165959\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/359/364/\">\n    359 Or. at 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12165959\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/359/364/\">\n    374 P.3d 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Having concluded that the record created in the trial court complied with\n   <em>\n    Mayfield\n   </em>\n   , we briefly address two other issues. The state renews its argument that defendant's failure to object to the sufficiency of the trial court's explanation at trial is a complete bar to his raising that issue on review. The state recognizes that\n   <em>\n    Mayfield\n   </em>\n   explained that a trial court errs if it fails to make a record reflecting its exercise of discretion. However, it argues that in\n   <em>\n    Peeples v.

As explained above, in\n   <em>\n    Turnidge\n   </em>\n   , the defendant failed to object to the sufficiency of the trial court's explanation of its OEC 403 ruling.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12165959\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/359/364/\">\n    359 Or. at 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12165959\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/359/364/\">\n    374 P.3d 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In this case, it is sufficient to hold that the trial court's explanation of its OEC 403 ruling complied with\n   <em>\n    Mayfield\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Turnidge\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Defendant raises one other issue that requires discussion. He contends that not only does\n   <em>\n    Mayfield\n   </em>\n   require an explanation of the trial court's OEC 403 rulings, but a more complete explanation is necessary to facilitate meaningful appellate review. To the extent that defendant argues that a further explanation than\n   <em>\n    Mayfield\n   </em>\n   requires is necessary to facilitate meaningful appellate review,\n   <em>\n    Peeples\n   </em>\n   provides the answer to that argument. As\n   <em>\n    Peeples\n   </em>\n   explained, ordinary preservation rules apply to claims that a trial court failed to make findings necessary for meaningful appellate review.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668783\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/345/209/\">\n    345 Or. at 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668783\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/345/209/\">\n    191 P.3d 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
