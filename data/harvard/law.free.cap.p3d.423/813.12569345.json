ORS 426.130. Appellant contends, in an unpreserved assignment of error, that the judgment should be reversed because the trial court failed to inform her, as required by ORS 426.100(1)(c), of some of the possible results of the hearing. The state concedes the error, and we agree that the court's failure to fully comply with ORS 426.100(1) constitutes plain error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Ritzman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"551923\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/192/296/#p298\">\n    192 Or.

We further conclude that it is appropriate to exercise our discretion to correct the error for the reasons stated in\n   <em>\n    State v. M. L.
