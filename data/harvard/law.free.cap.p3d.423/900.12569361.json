He signed a consent to care form in which he agreed to pay the balance due on his account. But instead of paying, he filed a lawsuit against EvergreenHealth, claiming that the consent to care agreement lacked a definite price term and was therefore unenforceable. As have courts across the country, we hold that the contract price term is supplied by EvergreenHealth's standard list of charges (its \"chargemaster\"). Because the price term is definite, the consent to care agreement is enforceable. Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 Stephen Pitell was admitted to EvergreenHealth with abdominal pain on January 2, 2015. At the time, he was uninsured and did not qualify for Medicare or Medicaid. Upon his arrival at the hospital, Pitell signed a consent to care form that stated, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   I agree, whether I sign as representative or as patient, that in consideration of the services to be rendered to the patient, I agree to be personally responsible for the balance due after any applicable insurance payment(s).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The consent form went on to state, \"You are responsible for payment of your account\" and \"At my request, staff will provide me with an estimate of the billed charges for services I\n   am likely to receive.\" Pitell did not request an estimate of charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 3 Following his treatment and discharge, EvergreenHealth billed Pitell $32,324. Given that he had over $50,000 in his bank account, Pitell's request for charity care status was denied. The hospital did, however, reduce the charge by 20 percent because Pitell was uninsured, which lowered the amount due to $25,859.20. For the same services, four of the five largest commercial insurers would pay more: $27,632, $28,157, $28,228, or $33,138.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 EvergreenHealth billed Pitell based on the hospital's list of charges, which is generally referred to as a \"chargemaster.\" Pitell did not pay the balance due on his account. Instead, he filed suit against EvergreenHealth on behalf of a class of similarly situated individuals. In his suit, he requested a declaratory judgment that the consent form is unenforceable. He also alleged causes of action for negligent and intentional concealment. EvergreenHealth counterclaimed to seek collection of the unpaid bill as well as for the expenses of defending a frivolous action. The trial court granted EvergreenHealth's motion for summary judgment, dismissing the case and ordering Pitell to pay the amount of the discounted bill plus costs and fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pitell appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 5 We review summary judgment de novo.\n   <em>\n    Hearst Commc'ns, Inc. v.

It includes over 16,000 line items that establish the standard charge for each service. Deductions from\n   these rates are common, resulting from negotiations with insurers, set government rates, charity care, prompt pay discounts, or uninsured discounts.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   In the context of a contract for the provision of and payment for medical services, a hospital's chargemaster rates serve as the basis for its pricing. Each hospital sets its own chargemaster rates, thus each hospital's chargemaster is unique. It is from these chargemaster prices that insurance companies negotiate with hospitals for discounts for their policyholders. And other reimbursement schemes are based in part on hospital chargemaster rates. Even the 2010 Federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act recognized the centrality of chargemasters to hospital billing practices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Timothy D.

Besides handing the patient an inches-high stack of papers detailing the hospital's charges for each and every conceivable service, which he or she could not possibly read and understand before agreeing to treatment, the form contract employed by St. Mary's is the only way to communicate to a patient the nature of his or her financial obligations to the hospital.

It would be cumbersome, and against patients' interests, to require hospitals to seek new authorization from a patient whenever some medical circumstance requires a new course of treatment.

Pitell agreed to pay \"the balance due\" and was informed that he was \"responsible for payment of [his] account.\" This reference to an \"account\" reflects that the parties understood that Pitell would be charged for the services received, and that the amount charged would be determined by an extant set list of prices. In addition, the contract notified Pitell that he could request an estimate of charges, which further acknowledged the existence of a list of prices from which an estimate could be constructed. The contract language demonstrates the parties' mutual understanding that the amount owed by Pitell was definite or capable of being made so by reference to an extant list of charges-in this case, the chargemaster.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 15 Pitell cites to a few cases in support of his argument that the contract's price term is indefinite and therefore unenforceable. None are persuasive. In\n   <em>\n    Washington Chocolate Co. v. Canterbury Candy Makers, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2586743\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/18/79/\">\n    18 Wash.2d 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=138%20P.2d%20195\">\n    138 P.2d 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1943), the sale price in a contract varied by buyer and was not tied to market rates. The court concluded that the price was left to the unrestricted and arbitrary determination of the seller, and was therefore indefinite. But here, EvergreenHealth does not have unlimited discretion to charge patients for services received. It does so based on the chargemaster, with departures from those rates set in advance by negotiation or regulation. Pitell also cites to\n   <em>\n    Heaton v.

But here, the parties did not attempt to incorporate a list of charges by reference.

Before his treatment at EvergreenHealth, Pitell was generally aware that hospitals billed uninsured patients\n   at different rates than insured patients. After reading an article in Time magazine and seeing a documentary, Pitell understood that hospitals used a set list of prices to calculate charges to their patients. He understood that uninsured patients did not benefit from lower rates negotiated by insurers, given that they had no insurer. At deposition, Pitell testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Q: ... So when you went in there as an uninsured patient, you understood that it was likely that you were going to be charged by the hospital using a chargemaster for the services you were receiving, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   A: Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 20 This testimony demonstrates the parties' mutual intent that, after accepting health care services, Pitell would be charged from an extant list of charges that provided the prices. Extrinsic evidence supports the enforceability of the consent to care agreement between Pitell and EvergreenHealth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 21 Pitell argues that the trial court erred in dismissing his causes of action for \"negligent and intentional concealment\" because EvergreenHealth had a duty to disclose the nature of its rates. These are recognized concepts in construction law, but not in the circumstances of this case. We therefore affirm their dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 22 Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   WE CONCUR:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Leach, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Appelwick, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Pitell claims that he was charged an unreasonable amount for the services received. However, in the trial court, he provided no evidence as to what amount would be reasonable. In addition, it is worth noting that, while he admits that he owes a reasonable amount, Pitell has never paid a dime for the services rendered-either to EvergreenHealth or into the registry of the court. At all times, he has had the ability to pay.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Pitell was required by law to have health insurance at the time in question. He had the means to purchase such insurance. Instead, he made an economic decision to forego compliance with the law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Pitell now argues that an equitable doctrine-quantum meruit-should govern the determination of the amount he owes. By making an economic decision to be uninsured, in violation of applicable law, Pitell clearly behaved inequitably. Whether equity can be invoked by one who behaved inequitably is an issue that appears at the forefront of this dispute. However, Pitell neither briefed nor even recognized this issue.
