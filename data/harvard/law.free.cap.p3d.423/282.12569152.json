VAGUENESS ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 12 The three primary dictionary definitions of \"congregate\" are (1) \"to collect together into a group, crowd, or assembly,\" (2) \"to come together, collect, or concentrate in a particular locality or group,\" and (3) \"become situated together or in proximity to each other.\" WEBSTER'S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 478 (2002). This second definition seems most appropriate in this situation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 13 But even that definition creates uncertainty and gives rise to several questions: (1) Must the children join together in a formal group to \"congregate,\" or is it sufficient that children be at the same place even if they are unconnected? (2) Similarly, must the children intend to join together with other children to \"congregate,\" or can they end up at the same place by happenstance? (3) How many children are required to congregate to invoke the condition? Is two enough, or is some unstated larger number required? (4) How often must children congregate in a place to invoke the condition? Is once enough, or is some unstated frequency required? (5) Assuming that children must\n   have actually rather than potentially congregated at a place to invoke the condition, how recently must they have congregated there? Is one prior instance of children congregating in a place sufficient regardless of when it occurred? These questions suggest that the condition does not sufficiently define the proscribed conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 14 Arguably, the condition here is less vague than in\n   <em>\n    Irwin\n   </em>\n   because it provides a short list of locations where Wallmuller knows he is not allowed to go. However, the condition contains the phrase \"such as\" before its list of prohibited places, indicating that frequenting more places than just those listed would violate the condition. As in\n   <em>\n    Norris\n   </em>\n   , this short list does not cure the inherent vagueness of the phrase \"places where children congregate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 15 \"[A] statute will be considered unconstitutionally vague if enforcement depends on a completely subjective standard.\"\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   , 190 Wash.2d at 679,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567081\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/416/712/#p677\">\n    416 P.3d 712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The community custody condition here invites a completely subjective standard for interpreting \"places where children congregate.\" As a result, we follow\n   <em>\n    Irwin\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Norris\n   </em>\n   and hold the condition is unconstitutionally vague.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 16 Division Three recently reached the opposite conclusion in a 2-1 decision in\n   <em>\n    State v.

At the resentencing hearing, the trial court did not order a new PSI, but Wallmuller did not object.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 22 The trial court imposed several community custody conditions, including a condition that required Wallmuller to \"at his/her own expense, submit to random urinalysis and/or breathalyzer testing at the request of the CCO or treatment provider.\" CP at 25. In addition, the court made a finding that Wallmuller \"does not have a significant ability to pay\" and struck the discretionary legal financial obligations (LFOs).

LACK OF NEW PSI\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 23 Wallmuller claims that the trial court erred in its statutory obligation to order a new PSI as required by statute before resentencing. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 24 The statute in effect at the time of Wallmuller's conviction provided: \"[T]he court shall,\n   <em>\n    at the time of plea or conviction\n   </em>\n   , order the department to complete a presentence report before imposing a sentence upon a defendant who has been convicted of a felony sexual offense.\" Former RCW 9.94A.500(1) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 25 Here, \"the time of plea or conviction\" was in 2014 when the trial court originally sentenced Wallmuller. The 2016 resentencing did not occur at the time of Wallmuller's plea or conviction. Therefore, RCW 9.94A.500(1) did not apply to the resentencing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   B. COMMUNITY CUSTODY CONDITION-TESTING AT DEFENDANT'S EXPENSE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 26 Wallmuller argues that because the trial court found him unable to pay LFOs, the court erred in imposing a community custody condition that requires him to pay for random urinalysis and/or breathalyzer testing. We decline to consider this argument because Wallmuller did not object to this condition in the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 27 Under RAP 2.5(a), we generally will not review claims raised for the first time on appeal, unless the party claiming the error can show the presence of an exception to that rule.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Community Custody Condition Not Unconstitutionally Vague\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b6 52 The majority relies on\n   <em>\n    Norris\n   </em>\n   . However, the condition at issue in\n   <em>\n    Norris\n   </em>\n   was problematic even under the\n   <em>\n    Irwin\n   </em>\n   holding because it did not use \" 'parks/playgrounds/schools' \" as an illustrative list of prohibited locations. 1 Wash. App.2d at 95,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=404%20P.3d%2083\">\n    404 P.3d 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, the condition read: \" 'Do not enter any parks/playgrounds/schools and or any places where minors congregate.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=404%20P.3d%2083\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The use of \"and or\n   any places\" suggested that \"parks/playgrounds/schools\" were separate from \"places where minors congregate\" and not an illustrative list of such places. Conversely, here, the condition uses parks, schools, and playgrounds as examples of locations where minors congregate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b6 53 Also problematic is that Division One's most recent approach in\n   <em>\n    Norris\n   </em>\n   would raise separate vagueness concerns. Modifying a community custody condition to read, \"Do not enter any parks/playgrounds/schools where minors congregate\" means a park is no longer an illustrative example of a kind of location where children congregate. Under\n   <em>\n    Norris\n   </em>\n   , the defendant is not prohibited from all parks, just those parks where children are known to congregate. The phrase \"parks where minors congregate\" suggests there are two types of parks-ones in which minors congregate and ones in which they do not. Perhaps these separate categories of parks do exist, but absent further clarifying language or an illustrative list of examples, a defendant may arguably be unable to distinguish between the two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b6 54 For these reasons, I would continue to follow\n   <em>\n    Irwin\n   </em>\n   and hold that an illustrative list of examples affords ordinary persons sufficient notice of the conduct proscribed.
