We reverse in part, affirm in part, and remand for further proceedings, addressing the following issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    1. Did the District Court err by holding Farmers could offset its UIM obligation to Cramer dollar-for-dollar with GEICO's entire UIM payment?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    2. Did the District Court err by holding the non-duplication clause in Farmers' policy is unambiguous and does not violate the reasonable expectations doctrine?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    3. Is Cramer entitled to attorney fees?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 2 Cramer was one of five passengers in a vehicle hit by an at-fault vehicle. Cramer stipulated that the total personal damages she sustained in that accident was $75,686.81. She was apportioned $27,000 of the tortfeasor's liability coverage limits for her bodily injury claims, as other passengers also sustained injuries, and thus the tortfeasor was underinsured by $48,686.81 as to Cramer's damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 3 The vehicle in which Cramer was a passenger was insured by GEICO. GEICO paid Cramer its individual UIM coverage limit of $25,000. Cramer carried personal vehicle coverage with Farmers, including medical payment (MedPay) coverage with a $100,000 limit, and UIM coverage with a $50,000 individual limit. Farmers paid Cramer $21,186.81 under her MedPay coverage. Thus, from these sources, Cramer received payments of $73,186.81, or $2,500 less than her total stipulated damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 Cramer made a claim under her UIM coverage with Farmers, and two disputes arose that led Cramer to file this declaratory action. First, the parties disagreed regarding how much of the $25,000 GEICO UIM payment Farmers could offset against its own UIM obligation to Cramer. Farmers' UIM coverage in Cramer's policy contained the following provisions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   We will pay all sums which an\n   <strong>\n    insured person\n   </strong>\n   is legally entitled to recover as\n   <strong>\n    damages\n   </strong>\n   from the owner or operator of an\n   <strong>\n    UNDERinsured motor vehicle\n   </strong>\n   because of\n   <strong>\n    bodily injury\n   </strong>\n   sustained by the\n   <strong>\n    insured person\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   2. The amount of UNDERinsured Motorist Coverage we will pay shall be reduced by the amount of any other\n   <strong>\n    bodily injury\n   </strong>\n   coverage available to any party held to be liable for the\n   <strong>\n    accident\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   3. If any other collectible insurance applies to a loss covered by this part, we will pay only our share. Our share is the proportion that our limits of liability bear to the total of all applicable limits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (Emphasis in original.) Likewise, the GEICO policy had a similar \"other insurance\" provision governing its UIM obligation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   If the\n   <strong>\n    insured\n   </strong>\n   has other insurance against a loss covered by the Uninsured Motorist provisions [including UIM coverage] of this policy, we will not be liable for more than our pro-rata share of the total coverage available.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (Emphasis in original.) Thus, under the \"\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   \" or \"proportional\" UIM obligations in both policies, GEICO's $25,000 limit and Farmer's $50,000 limit made GEICO responsible for a one-third share, and Farmers responsible for a two-thirds share, of the damages sustained by Cramer beyond the tortfeasor's payment. GEICO was thus obligated\n   to pay $16,228.94, and Farmers was obligated to pay $32,457.87, of Cramer's $48,686.81 UIM claim. However, for whatever reason, GEICO paid Cramer $25,000, or about $9,000 more than its\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   share of Cramer's UIM damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 5 Cramer asserted that, despite GEICO's excess payment, she was nonetheless entitled to collect the full two-thirds\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   share of her UIM damages from Farmers, or $32,457.87. Farmers contended it was entitled to offset the entire GEICO payment, even though it exceeded GEICO's UIM\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   responsibility, entitling Cramer to only $23,686.81 from Farmers. On this issue, the District Court determined that, under Cramer's theory, she would recover more than her stipulated damages, which the court reasoned was \"neither fair nor equitable and is not permitted under Montana law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 6 Secondly, the parties disputed whether Farmers could offset its MedPay payments against its UIM obligation to Cramer. A policy section entitled, \"Conditions,\" located at the end of Cramer's policy and applicable to all coverages, included the following non-duplication provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    9. No Duplication of Benefits\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Any amount paid under Coverage E-Medical Expense Coverage, will be applied against any other coverage of this policy applicable to the loss so that there is no duplication of Coverage E benefits. In no event shall a coverage limit be reduced below any amount required by law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (Emphasis in original.) This provision was further identified on page one of the policy, within the index, as \"No Duplication of Benefits.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 7 Cramer asserted the non-duplication provision was ambiguous and placed in an obscure location in the policy, thus violating the reasonable expectations doctrine, prohibiting Farmers from offsetting its MedPay payments, and entitling her to the full two-thirds\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   UIM share from Farmers, or $32,457.87. Farmers contended that the provision was neither ambiguous nor obscurely placed, but validly operated to offset Farmers' $21,186.81 in MedPay payments against its UIM obligation to Cramer. The District Court determined the non-duplication provision to be \"valid, enforceable and not contrary to Montana public policy.\" Holding in Farmers' favor on the two contested issues, the court entered summary judgment in favor of Farmers and ordered Farmers to pay the amount of $2,500 in UIM benefits to Cramer. Cramer appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 8 We review a district court's grant of summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , using the same M.

She contends that, applying the policy as written, she is entitled to the two-thirds\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   payment and that no exclusion in the policy permits Farmers to offset the entire GEICO payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 11 The District Court reasoned that \"[t]he purpose of UIM coverage is to make sure that a person injured in an automobile accident receives, as near as possible, full compensation for their damages when the tortfeasor fails to carry sufficient liability limits[,]\" concluding that \"[t]he insured plaintiff\n   is not entitled to recover more than the amount of his or her uncompensated damages.\" Similarly, Farmers argues Cramer's position \"is contrary to the intent and purpose of UIM coverage,\" because it would \"provide a windfall or allow a double recovery.\" Notably, however, Farmers cites no language in its policy that prohibits such a double payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 12 \"[A]n insurer's liability for underinsured motorist benefits in any given case arises from the terms of the insurance contract....\"\n   <em>\n    Mecca v.

Cramer and Farmers have stipulated Cramer's damages to be $75,686.81. Then, the policy permits Farmers to reduce its UIM obligation \"by the amount of any other bodily injury coverage available to any party held to be liable for the accident.\" Consequently, the $27,000 payment to Cramer from the tortfeasor's liability insurance is deducted, leaving $48,686.81 in damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 15 Lastly, the policy provides, \"[i]f any other collectible insurance applies to a loss covered by this part, we will pay only our share,\" and defines Farmers' share as \"the proportion that our limits of liability bear to the total of all applicable limits,\" which is here a two-thirds\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   share. As noted above, Farmers' two-thirds share of Cramer's damages is $32,457.87. Farmers points to no clear and unambiguous policy language authorizing a further offset to its UIM obligation by the amount GEICO paid in excess of GEICO's one-third\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   share, which would reduce Farmer's UIM obligation to\n   <em>\n    less than\n   </em>\n   its two-thirds share. Policy limitations that prevent double payments \"must be clear and unequivocal; otherwise, the policy will be strictly construed in favor of the insured.\"\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 13 (citation omitted). While Farmers argues generally that its policy prohibits duplication of payments, the non-duplication provision in Farmers' policy expressly mentions and prevents duplication only of \"Coverage E,\" the MedPay coverage, which is discussed below, and is not the issue here. Farmers is not entitled under these provisions to a dollar-for-dollar offset of the excess portion (more than one-third\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   share) of the GEICO UIM payment, and must pay its contractual two-thirds\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   share of Cramer's damages. There are no provisions that credit Farmers' UIM obligation for an overpayment by another insurer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 16 We conclude the District Court erred in applying a complete dollar-for-dollar offset instead of the\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   offset provided by Cramer's policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We thus reverse on this issue, holding that Farmers is not entitled to offset its UIM obligation to Cramer by the excess amount paid by GEICO.

Did the District Court err by holding the non-duplication clause in Farmers' policy is unambiguous and does not violate the reasonable expectations doctrine?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 18 Cramer argues that offsetting MedPay payments against Farmers' UIM obligation violates the reasonable expectations doctrine, because the non-duplication provision is ambiguous and placed obscurely within the policy, and that the District Court erred in its contrary conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 19 \"The reasonable expectations doctrine provides that the objectively reasonable expectations of insurance purchasers regarding the terms of their policies should be honored notwithstanding the fact that a painstaking study of the policy would have negated those expectations.\"\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 19 (citations omitted).

However, the provision is clearly identified in the index on page one of the policy, entitled \"No Duplication of Benefits,\" is found within a policy section entitled \"Conditions,\" and is identified with its own bold header.

Placement was not obscure because the provision prevents duplication of MedPay benefits against all coverages in the policy and, thus, was logically placed in the \"Conditions\" section relevant to all coverages. Under Cramer's argument, Farmers may\n   have been required to repeat the provision in every coverage section of the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 22 Cramer offers that the non-duplication provision reduces her coverage from the amounts listed on her declarations page because the offset decreases the amount of available UIM coverage, thus violating her reasonable expectations. However, in a more serious damage scenario, Farmers would potentially be obligated to pay the $100,000 MedPay limits and the $50,000 UIM limits for the claim, despite the non-duplication provision, and thus, the coverage is not \"defeated.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Newbury v.

We are unpersuaded by this argument, because the provision clearly and unequivocally provides there will be no duplication of MedPay benefits and \"any other coverage of this policy[.]\" This provision is not reasonably subject to two interpretations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 24 We affirm the District Court's determination to offset Farmers' UIM obligation to Cramer by its MedPay payments to her. Farmers is entitled to offset its $32,457.87 UIM obligation, established above, with its $21,186.81 in MedPay payments. Farmers is therefore obligated to pay Cramer the amount of $11,271.06 under her UIM coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 25\n   <em>\n    3.

Farmers answers that Cramer is not entitled to any fees unless she prevails on every claim she made in the entire lawsuit, and that because Cramer previously conceded an issue, she could never be entitled to fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 27 \"[A]n insured is entitled to recover attorney fees, pursuant to the insurance exception to the American Rule, when the insurer forces the insured to assume the burden of legal action to obtain the full benefit of the insurance contract[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Mt.

Because Cramer was forced to bring this action to obtain the full benefit of her insurance contract, she is entitled to recover attorney fees.
