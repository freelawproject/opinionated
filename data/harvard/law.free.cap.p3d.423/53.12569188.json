The officer approached the car and asked defendant for his license and registration. Defendant appeared to be very nervous and he was sweating heavily. A strong odor of marijuana emanated from the car. The officer's check of defendant's records revealed that defendant did not own the car, that the license plates on the car were registered to a different car, and that defendant was a state and federal parolee. While the officer questioned defendant, defendant repeatedly reached under the seat. Based on defendant's conduct in reaching under the seat, his nervous demeanor, the fact that he was on parole, and the odor of marijuana coming from the car, the officer became concerned that defendant was concealing a weapon\n   in the car. The officer asked defendant to step out of the car and then patted him down to check for weapons. The officer did not find any weapons on defendant's person, but he felt a small, thin pipe with a bulbous end and a two- to three-inch stem. The officer asked defendant if that object was a methamphetamine pipe, and defendant responded that it was. The officer removed the pipe from defendant's pocket and saw that it contained some burned residue in the bowl. The officer also found a small piece of wadded up plastic containing a powder residue. The officer believed that the residue in the pipe and plastic was methamphetamine. The officer arrested defendant and placed him in the patrol car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Because, in the officer's experience, users of illegal drugs often carry weapons and drugs in their cars, the officer then searched the car for weapons and other drugs. The officer found drug paraphernalia in the car and two packaged bags of marijuana in a backpack in the trunk. Finally, the officer searched defendant's wallet and found a small paper-fold containing a white powdered substance that the officer thought was methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant was charged with one count of delivery of marijuana, one count of possession of methamphetamine, and one count of possession of four ounces or more of marijuana. Before trial, defendant moved to suppress the evidence that was found in the search of his person and his car, as well as the statement that he made to the officer confirming the existence of the methamphetamine pipe in his pocket. Among other things, defendant asserted that the warrantless search of his car for contraband was not justified by the automobile exception to the warrant requirement. Defendant contended that the automobile exception applies only in cases in which a police officer encounters a moving vehicle in connection with the investigation of a crime. Therefore, defendant argued, because the officer had stopped defendant for a traffic infraction and only later, during the course of the stop, developed\n   probable cause to search the car for evidence of a crime, the exception did not apply and a warrant was required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The trial court denied the motion to suppress, ruling that, because the police officer lawfully stopped the car\n   and lawfully developed probable cause to search the car for evidence of a crime, the warrantless search of the car was justified under the automobile exception to the warrant requirement. The trial court also denied defendant's motion to suppress the evidence found on his person and defendant's statement concerning the methamphetamine pipe. The prosecutor dismissed the second and third counts against defendant, and, after a stipulated facts trial, the court convicted defendant of one count of delivery of marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant appealed his conviction to the Court of Appeals, repeating his argument that the automobile exception does not apply when a defendant has been stopped for a traffic infraction and not in connection with a crime. The Court of Appeals rejected that argument and affirmed defendant's conviction.\n   <em>\n    Bliss,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12412951\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/283/833/\">\n    283 Or.

Notably, defendant does not argue that the initial traffic stop was unlawful, nor does he dispute that the officer had probable cause to conclude, at the time of the search and based on his observations and interactions with defendant, that the car contained contraband or evidence of a crime. Rather, his sole argument is that the automobile exception does not apply when the initial stop is for a traffic violation, rather than for a criminal offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ORS 161.515 (defining \"crime\" as a felony or misdemeanor). Therefore, he argues, the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution establishes the right of the people \"to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable search, or seizure.\" That provision generally requires law enforcement officers to obtain a warrant before executing a search. As we have stated, warrantless searches are\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   unreasonable unless they fall within one of the few specifically established and limited exceptions to the warrant requirement.\n   <em>\n    State v. Blair\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12414910\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/361/527/#p534\">\n    361 Or. 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 534,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12414910\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/361/527/#p534\">\n    396 P.3d 908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017) ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

One of those exceptions, known as the automobile exception, was announced over 30 years ago in\n   <em>\n    State v. Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2178861\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/301/268/\">\n    301 Or. 268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2178861\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/301/268/\">\n    721 P.2d 1357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986). In that case, the court stated that the only two requirements for the automobile exception are \"(1) that the automobile is mobile at the time it is stopped by police or other governmental authority, and (2) that probable cause exists for the search of the vehicle.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 274,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2178861\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/301/268/\">\n    721 P.2d 1357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As articulated in\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , then, a warrantless search of a mobile vehicle is valid if the vehicle was lawfully stopped and there was probable cause for the search. The court in\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   \"reasoned that the mobility of the vehicle, by itself, creates an exigency because the vehicle can be quickly moved out of the locality or jurisdiction in which the warrant must be sought.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

As noted, there is no dispute in this case that defendant's vehicle was mobile at the time of the stop, that the vehicle was lawfully stopped for a traffic violation, and that the police had probable cause to search the vehicle for evidence of a crime at the time of the search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant makes a different argument. He notes that, in\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , the police officer stopped the defendant while he was driving because the officer planned to arrest defendant on criminal charges. He argues that the automobile exception should not extend to cases beyond the factual scenario in\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   . He contends that, in every case following\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   in which this court has applied the automobile exception, the police officer had probable cause to believe that the vehicle contained evidence of criminal activity at the time that the police encountered it, and, in fact, that this court often has stated that the\n   automobile exception applies only if the vehicle was mobile when the police officer encountered it \"in connection with a crime.\" Defendant urges us to hold that the automobile exception is a rule of\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   exigency that applies only when police lawfully stop a car that they have probable cause to search for evidence of criminal activity at the time they initiate the stop. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   is not as narrow as defendant suggests, and we decline to limit the scope of the automobile exception in that manner.\n   It is true that, in\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , the police officer had probable cause to search the defendant's car at the time he stopped the defendant to arrest him for a crime. However, the court did not identify that fact as important to its decision or otherwise indicate that the rule that it announced was limited to that factual scenario. Instead, the court referred to a \"lawfully stopped automobile,\" using plain words that apply equally whether the car was lawfully stopped for a traffic infraction or for a crime:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"[P]robable cause to believe that a lawfully stopped automobile which was mobile at the time of the stop contains contraband or crime evidence justifies an immediate warrantless search of the entire automobile for the object of the search, despite the absence of any additional exigent circumstances.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2178861\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/301/268/\">\n    301 Or. at 277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2178861\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/301/268/\">\n    721 P.2d 1357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, the court stated, \"the key to the automobile exception is that the automobile need be mobile at the time it is lawfully stopped. No exigent circumstances other than the mobility of the stopped vehicle need be demonstrated.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 276,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2178861\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/301/268/\">\n    721 P.2d 1357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Both in its reasoning and its articulation of the rule it announced,\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   focused on the mobility of the vehicle at the time of the stop and on whether police had probable cause to search the car at the time of the search. Although\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   also requires that the car have been \"lawfully\" stopped, nothing in the opinion suggests that a lawful stop for a traffic violation is not sufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Moreover, nothing in the court's rationale for adopting the automobile exception to the warrant requirement suggests an intention to limit the exception to cases in which the police have probable cause to search the vehicle at the time of the stop. Indeed, in focusing on the\n   <em>\n    mobility\n   </em>\n   of the vehicle as the exigency justifying the exception to the warrant requirement,\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   suggests the opposite. As we have already noted, the court in\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   stated that the exigency arises \"because the vehicle can be quickly moved out of the locality or jurisdiction in which the warrant must be sought.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 275,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2178861\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/301/268/\">\n    721 P.2d 1357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, the court stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"In the case at bar, the trial judge recognized that the mobility of the vehicle alone created the exigent circumstances necessary to satisfy\n   Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution, and he properly disregarded that the defendant was under arrest and in police custody and that the car was under police control when the search was conducted. As previously mentioned, under the 'automobile mobility' test it does not matter whether the passenger could have taken over the custody of the car (which he eventually did), whether the police had adequate personnel to back-up the arrest, whether a tow truck was available, whether a magistrate was available by telephone or otherwise, or whether a threatening crowd was gathered, etc. All the trial judge needed to find was what he did find: (1) the car was mobile at the time it was stopped by the police; and (2) the police had probable cause to believe that the car contained contraband or crime evidence.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2178861\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/301/268/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2178861\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/301/268/\">\n    at 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2178861\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/301/268/\">\n    721 P.2d 1357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote omitted). As we have stated, whether a car is\n   <em>\n    mobile\n   </em>\n   when the police first encounter it is unrelated to whether the police are investigating a traffic infraction or a crime, and it is unrelated to whether the police have probable cause to search at the time of the stop or develop probable cause based on circumstances that only later become apparent. Nothing in the reasoning, text, or logic of\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   supports the rule that defendant proposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We also note that, in\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , this court cited cases from other state appellate courts that it found persuasive, including cases from the Illinois and California Supreme Courts that upheld warrantless searches of automobiles\n   stopped for traffic violations.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2178861\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/301/268/\">\n    301 Or. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   276-77 &amp; n. 5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2178861\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/301/268/\">\n    721 P.2d 1357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    People v.

That reliance certainly indicates that the court in\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   was not contemplating or relying on the distinction defendant seeks to draw here between a lawful stop of a vehicle based on a traffic violation and a lawful stop based on probable cause to believe that the vehicle contained contraband or evidence of a crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Finally, the court stated that an important purpose of adopting the automobile exception is to provide police with\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \"clear guidelines by which they can gauge and regulate their conduct rather than trying to follow a complex set of rules dependent upon particular facts regarding the time, location and manner of highway stops.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2178861\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/301/268/\">\n    301 Or. at 277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2178861\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/301/268/\">\n    721 P.2d 1357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As the Court of Appeals stated below, that emphasis on clear guidelines for police officers suggests that the court intended the automobile exception to apply to all lawful roadside stops of mobile vehicles, and not just to some of them, dependent on the state of mind of the officer at the time of the stop.\n   <em>\n    Bliss\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12412951\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/283/833/\">\n    283 Or.

In such a circumstance, police may stop a driver because, for example, she has failed to stay in her lane, signal when required, or stop at a stop sign-all traffic violations-and may not develop probable cause to search the vehicle to investigate the crime of driving under the influence until they have interacted with the driver. Similarly, police may stop an erratic driver based on reasonable suspicion that the driver has committed either the violation of careless driving, ORS 811.135, or the crime of reckless driving, ORS 811.140.

The facts in\n   <em>\n    Meharry\n   </em>\n   were quite different.

According to defendant, the phrase \"encounter [the vehicle] in connection with a crime\" is a \"description of the probable cause component of\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   .\" That is, defendant argues that this court, in using that phrase, meant that the\n   automobile exception applies only when the police\n   <em>\n    stop\n   </em>\n   a vehicle \"in connection with a crime,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , with probable cause to search the vehicle for evidence of a crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   However, none of those cases addressed the issue that defendant argues here, and the passages defendant quotes simply describe the facts specific to those cases.

Those cases mention the fact that police were investigating crimes, but that was because the stops in those cases were based on criminal investigations, not on traffic violations, and the opinions reflect the context of each case. It is also possible that this court used the phrase \"in connection with a crime\" colloquially as referring to anything illegal, including traffic violations, rather than intending the statutory definition of a \"crime\" as a felony or misdemeanor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ORS 161.515 (defining \"crime\"). More significantly, as discussed at length above, no decision from this court has suggested that any aspect of the automobile exception turns on that phrase, the court has not elaborated on its use of the phrase, the court has used the phrase interchangeably with the term \"lawfully stopped\" (which clearly covers traffic stops), and defendant's interpretation is inconsistent with the stated rationale for the automobile exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As this court stated in\n   <em>\n    Kock\n   </em>\n   , the \"bright line\" that\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   established was simply that \"automobiles that have just been\n   <em>\n    lawfully stopped by police\n   </em>\n   may be searched without a warrant and without a demonstration of exigent circumstances when police have probable cause to believe that the automobile contains contraband or crime evidence.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2177056\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/302/29/\">\n    302 Or. at 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2177056\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/302/29/\">\n    725 P.2d 1285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

Rodgers/Kirkeby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670972\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/347/610/#p623\">\n    347 Or. 610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 623,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670972\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/347/610/#p623\">\n    227 P.3d 695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) (police permitted to stop and briefly detain motorists for investigation of noncriminal traffic violations, but conduct must comply with Article I, section 9, and must be limited in duration and reasonably related to the investigation). To ensure constitutional compliance, we would do well to require that officers who stop drivers for traffic infractions and who believe that they have probable cause to search their vehicles for evidence of a crime obtain permission from a neutral magistrate to do so or be ready to prove the existence of exigent circumstances or some other exception to the warrant requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Nakamoto, J., joins in this dissenting opinion.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
