O'Brien filed a petition for a writ of mandate with the Eleventh Judicial District Court, Flathead County, requesting that the court compel and command the Flathead County Treasurer to issue him a tax deed or appear and show cause why it should not do so. The District Court denied the petition. O'Brien appeals. We affirm the court's denial of a writ of mandate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 In July 2013, Flathead County purchased a tax lien on Lot 4,\n   Block 1, of Hillcrest Terrace after the property taxes became delinquent. The owner and occupant, James Ralph Connor, did not redeem the property within the thirty-six month redemption period. After the redemption period ended, the County assigned the tax lien to K&amp;J Investments, LLC. O'Brien is a member of K&amp;J Investments. The County sent notice to K&amp;J Investments in January 2017 that the company must provide the notice required under \u00a7 15-18-212(1)(b), MCA, within 120 days to the occupant of the property and to each party listed on a property title guarantee, or the County would cancel K&amp;J Investment's property tax lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 K&amp;J Investments mailed the required notice to the property owner, Connor, on February 17, 2017, and provided proof of notice to the County on March 1, 2017. The notice stated that the redemption period expired on April 21, 2017. K&amp;J Investments mailed the required notice to the occupant of the property on March 10, 2017, and provided proof of notice to the County on March 23, 2017. The notice to the occupant stated that the redemption period expired on May 17, 2017. Both notices were returned unclaimed. O'Brien explains that K&amp;J Investments sent two separate notices with different expiration dates because the County informed K&amp;J Investments that it must send a separate notice to the occupant of the property, even though Connor was both the owner and the occupant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 O'Brien alleged in his petition that on or about May 31, 2017, Flathead County Treasurer, Adele Krantz, allowed Connor to redeem the property. After Connor redeemed the property, K&amp;J Investments attempted to tender a check for the redemption proceeds and requested that a tax deed be issued. The County Treasurer declined to issue a tax deed, informing K&amp;J Investments\n   that the taxpayer has the right to redeem the property up until the time a tax deed is issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 In September 2017, K&amp;J Investments assigned its interest in the property to O'Brien. Two months later, O'Brien filed his petition for a writ of mandate, arguing that the County Treasurer had a statutory duty to issue a tax deed upon expiration of the time periods outlined in the notices from K&amp;J Investments to the owner and occupant. The District Court denied the petition. O'Brien then filed a motion for reconsideration under Rule 60, which the District Court also denied. O'Brien never served the County Treasurer in the District Court proceedings, and the County did not file any responsive briefing. The County has filed a brief on appeal, and O'Brien has replied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 We review a district court's decision to issue or deny a writ of mandamus for correctness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Victor Fed'n of Teachers Local 3494 v.

He maintains that \u00a7 15-18-211, MCA, requires the County Treasurer to issue a tax deed to the purchaser of a property tax lien if property is not redeemed within the time allowed under the statutes. Section 15-18-211(1), MCA (2015) (\"[I]f the property tax lien is not redeemed in the time allowed under 15-18-111, the county treasurer shall grant the purchaser a tax deed for the property.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   He argues that the period for redemption expired on April 21, 2017, or on May 17, 2017, and that after this time the County Treasurer was obligated to issue a tax deed for the property in question. O'Brien contends that a writ of mandate is appropriate because he does not have an adequate remedy at law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 \"A writ of mandamus compels 'the performance of an act that the law specially enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station.' \"\n   <em>\n    Victor Fed'n of Teachers Local 3494\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 13 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Citizens for a Better Flathead v.

Sections 70-28-101 through -113, MCA, provide for actions to quiet title to real estate generally, and \u00a7\u00a7 15-18-411 through -412, MCA, provide\n   specific procedures for quiet title actions involving property rights that a party claims to have acquired through a tax deed or tax lien sale.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Getter v. Beckman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2642894\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/236/377/#p380\">\n    236 Mont. 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 380,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2642894\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/236/377/#p380\">\n    769 P.2d 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 716 (1989). In a proceeding under \u00a7 15-18-411, MCA, a district court has the authority to order the delinquent taxpayer to make a deposit for the costs of the delinquency with the court and, if the taxpayer fails to do so, to enter a decree \"quieting the title of the purchaser as against the true owner.\" Section 15-18-412(2)(a), MCA. The district court also is authorized \"to order the department or any tax officer ... to do any other act necessary to enable the court to do complete justice.\" Section 15-18-412(7), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10 O'Brien maintains that \u00a7\u00a7 15-18-411 and -412, MCA, are applicable only in actions where a tax deed already has issued. He claims to have acquired an interest in Lot 4, Block 1, of Hillcrest Terrace through \"tax proceedings or a tax lien sale,\" but insists that \u00a7 15-18-411, MCA, provide him with no cause of action because the County Treasurer has not issued him a tax deed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 15-18-411(1)(a), MCA. The plain language of \u00a7 15-18-411, MCA, however, clearly contemplates an action either to quiet title to a tax deed\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   \"to determine the rights of a purchaser to real property claimed to have been acquired through tax proceedings or a tax lien sale.\" Section 15-18-411(1)(a), MCA. Thus, O'Brien may seek to quiet title through the processes provided in \u00a7\u00a7 15-18-411 and -412, MCA, and \u00a7\u00a7 70-28-101 through -109, MCA. The statutes provide the district court with sufficient authority to order the issuance of a tax deed \"to do complete justice.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section 15-18-412(7), MCA. The issues that O'Brien argues in his mandamus petition may be raised and developed in a quiet title action. A quiet title action provides O'Brien with a speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. The District Court correctly determined that O'Brien was not entitled to a writ of mandate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 11 The District Court order is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   INGRID GUSTAFSON, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   LAURIE McKINNON, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   DIRK M.
