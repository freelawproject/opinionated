The Jackson County board of commissioners (board) approved the application and adopted Ordinance No. 2017-9 approving a \" 'Reasons' Exception to Statewide Planning Goal 3.\" In that ordinance, the board explicitly found that the exception could be justified based on \"two alternative reasons: (1) The 'demonstrated need'/locational necessity reason authorized under OAR 660-004-0022(1)(a) ; and (2) The 'rural industrial development' reason under OAR 660-004-0022(3).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Specifically, with respect to OAR 660-004-0022 (1)(a), the board approved a Goal 13-related exception. The board determined that there was a demonstrated need for an approximately 80-acre facility based on the requirements of\n   Statewide Planning Goal 13 (Energy Conservation), which provides that its purpose is \"[t]o conserve energy\" and that \"[l]and uses developed on the land shall be managed and controlled so as to maximize the conservation of all forms of energy, based upon sound economic principles.\" The board concluded that \"Goal 13, State, and Federal energy policy establish a demonstrated need for the project consistent with OAR 660-004-0022(1)(a).\" That conclusion rested on the following finding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \"Goal 13, in the context of the policies set forth in the State's energy policy, as well as federal and state statutes, establish a general requirement to utilize renewable resources, including the in-State siting of renewable energy production facilities such as the proposed project, and therefore establishes a 'demonstrated need' as required under OAR 660-004-0022(1)(a).\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   With respect to OAR 660-004-0022(3)(c), the board concluded that the proposed facility was industrial development under OAR 660-004-0022(3) because the project met the definition of \"industrial use\" under Goal 9 (Economic Development), as \"employment activities generating income from the production, handling or distribution of goods.\" OAR 660-009-0005(3). The board noted that the project would generate income from the sale of electricity. The board further concluded that, \"[t]he proximity of Sage Substation [located inside the Medford UGB] provides a significant comparative advantage, would benefit the local economy, and as approved, does not involve a loss of resource lands\" and adopted additional findings on that comparative advantage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In its appeal to LUBA, 1000 Friends asserted that the county had erred in determining that (1) there was a demonstrated need for the project based on the requirements of Goal 13 under OAR 660-004-0022(1)(a) and that the project meets the locational requirements of OAR 660-004-0022(1)(a)(A) and (B); and (2) the proposed use meets the criteria for an exemption for rural industrial development and locational advantage under OAR 660-004-0022(3). In its brief before LUBA, Or Solar asserted that the demonstrated need requirement in OAR 660-004-0022(1)(a) for an oversized solar power generation facility was also satisfied by\n   the market demand for electricity created\n   under the power purchase agreement between Or Solar and PacifiCorp (the electrical utility providing service to the Medford area) and particular policies in the county comprehensive plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   LUBA concluded that a reasons exception was not justified under OAR 660-004-0022(1)(a) based on the \"requirements\" of Goal 13:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \"We disagree with the county and [Or Solar] that implicit in the Goal 13 requirement to 'conserve' energy is an affirmative obligation for counties to promote the development of renewable energy. While development of renewable energy is certainly consistent with the Goal 13 requirement to 'conserve' energy, the goal includes no express mandates regarding the development of renewable energy sources. The express requirement that '[l]and uses developed on the land shall be managed and controlled so as to maximize the conservation of all forms of energy' falls far short of including a requirement for cities and counties to promote the development of renewable energy. As the DLCD argues in its state agency brief, LCDC has defined the relevant terms 'conserve,' 'conservation' and 'develop' in ways that do not suggest that the Goal 13 requirement to 'maximize the conservation of all forms of energy' is intended to impose on local governments a requirement to promote the development of new energy sources in general, or renewable energy in particular.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   (Brackets in LUBA's order.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   LUBA further determined that the proposed development was industrial in character for purposes of the OAR 660-004-0022(3) exception, relying, as did the county, on the definition of \"industrial use,\" for the purpose of Goal 9, OAR 660-009-0005(3) (\"[E]mployment activities generating income from the production, handling or distribution of goods.\"), as well as the ORS 197.722(1) definition of \"industrial use\" for the purpose of designating regionally significant industrial areas, as including \"employment activities, * * * that generate income from the production, handling or distribution of goods or services.\" 1000 Friends argued that the one to three permanent maintenance jobs generated by the facility was insufficient to qualify the proposed facility as an employment activity. LUBA disagreed, holding that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \"while the number of permanent jobs created may be a factor to be considered and balanced under the standards at OAR 660-004-0022(3)(c), we do not see that a use that otherwise appears to be an industrial use must be regarded as something else, simply because it will generate only a relatively small number of permanent jobs.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   However, LUBA concluded that the county had failed to justify the locational advantage criterion in OAR 660-004-0022(3)(c) that \"the use would have a significant comparative advantage due to its location.\" The county had concluded that the Sage Substation, located approximately 1.5 miles away in the City of Medford, was an energy facility that gave the oversized use a significant comparative advantage because the solar power generation facility \"must be located near existing substations with available transmission capacity in order to be economically viable.\" LUBA reasoned, however, that locational attractor \"near existing industrial activity, an energy facility or products available from other rural activities\" described rural activities, so that the urban substation energy facility was not a sufficient locational attractor under OAR 660-004-0022(3)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In its disposition of the appeal, LUBA reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \" OAR 661-010-0071(1) provides that LUBA shall reverse a land use decision when the 'decision violates a provision of applicable law and is prohibited as a matter of law.' As discussed under the third assignment of error, the county misconstrued the applicable law with respect to the only two alternative reasons advanced to justify the proposed exception to Goal 3. Absent identification of a valid and sufficient reason under OAR 660-004-0022, the proposed reasons exception for a solar facility on the subject property is 'prohibited as a matter of law.' Accordingly, reversal is the appropriate disposition.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On review, Or Solar challenges LUBA's determinations under OAR 660-004-0022 and its disposition of reversal, instead of a remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   1000 Friends cross-petitions for review of LUBA's determination that the proposed facility was industrial development under OAR 660-004-0022(3)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   We begin with Or Solar's claim that LUBA erred in its determination that the ordinance could not be justified\n   on a reasons exception to Goal 3 based on OAR 660-004-0022(3)(c). As noted, under that rule, \"[f]or the siting of industrial development on resource land outside an urban growth boundary, appropriate reasons and facts may include\" that the use\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \"would have a significant comparative advantage due to its location (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , near existing industrial activity, an energy facility, or products available from other rural activities), which would benefit the county economy and cause only minimal loss of productive resource lands. Reasons for such a decision should include a discussion of the lost resource productivity and values in relation to the county's gain from the industrial use, and the specific transportation and resource advantages that support the decision.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As discussed, LUBA construed paragraph (3)(c) to require the locational attractor to be on rural land outside of a UGB so that the location of the proposed facility close to the Sage Substation-on urban land inside the UGB-was insufficient. Specifically, LUBA reasoned that locational attractor \"near existing industrial activity, an energy facility or products available from other rural activities\" described rural activities because the phrase \"other rural activities\" denotes that the other uses described in the sentence are also types of \"rural activities.\" If that were not the case, according to LUBA, the ending phrase would simply say, \"products available from rural activities.\" LUBA also reasoned that the context of OAR 660-004-0022(3)(a) and (b), requiring that the industrial use be significantly dependent upon a unique resource that is located on agricultural or forest land or that it cannot be located inside an urban growth boundary,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \"demonstrate a subsidiary concern that 'rural industrial development' potentially authorized under [ OAR 660-004-0022(3)(a) and (b) ] does not undermine the integrity and function of UGBs. As explained below, a broader reading of OAR 660-004-0022(3)(c), which would allow the requirement for a locational attractor to include a site or activity within a UGB, could easily result in development that undermines the function and integrity of that UGB.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   LUBA noted that exceptions are exceptional and not the norm. LUBA explained that an interpretation of\n   OAR 660-004-0022(3)(c) that would allow the hypothetical siting of industrial uses near the clustering of industrial land near the periphery of an urban area because of the advantage of locating on less constrained and less expensive resource land was to be avoided. Thus, LUBA concluded that the Sage Substation was not a sufficient locational attractor under OAR 660-004-0022(3)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   On review, Or Solar argues that the text of the rule does not limit a locational advantage to proximity to a rural land use, that the parenthetical examples do not state the exclusive types of locational attractors, and that LUBA's concern about intensive industrial uses adjacent to UGBs are not relevant to an exception to Goal 3 to allow a conditional nonfarm use under ORS 215.283(2)(g). We agree with Or Solar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   We discern the intended meaning of an administrative rule by examining the text of the rule and its context (including other provisions of the same rule, other rules\n   <em>\n    in pari materia\n   </em>\n   with the rule in question, the statute authorizing the rule, and other related statutes), together with any relevant statement of agency intent in the rule adoption process or in the application of the rule by the authoring agency in other proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Abu-Adas v.

As matter of textual analysis, \"an existing industrial activity\" and an \"energy facility\" are not necessarily \"rural activities,\" so that the reference to \"other rural activities\" in OAR 660-004-0022(3)(c) likely refers to rural activities other than the rural industrial activity being sited.

The county determined that an \"energy facility\" that employs persons in its construction, maintenance, or operation (as presumably all energy facilities do) is an \"industrial activity.\" That construction of OAR 660-004-0022(3)(c) makes an \"energy\n   facility\" synonymous with an \"industrial activity.\" As noted in\n   <em>\n    Crystal Communications, Inc. v.

Under the avoidance of\n   surplusage principle, the text of OAR 660-004-0022(3)(c) suggests that an \"energy facility\" of the type in question is something different from an \"industrial activity.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The overall context of relevant state and local laws also support that distinction in the rule. Under state and local law, distinctly different policies regulate the financing, siting, extent, and operation of industrial uses as opposed to those for energy or utility facilities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, ORS 197.712(2)(c), Goal 9, and the rules implementing Goal 9 in OAR chapter 660, division 9 require cities to \"provide for at least an adequate supply of sites of suitable sizes, types, locations and service levels for industrial and commercial uses consistent with plan policies.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   By contrast, ORS 197.712(2)(e) requires cities and counties to develop a public facility plan for sewer and water utilities and transportation projects for urban areas containing a population of greater than 2,500 persons. Statewide Planning Goal 11 (Public Facilities and Services), requires that \"[u]rban and rural development shall be guided and supported by types and levels of urban and rural public facilities and services appropriate for, but limited to, the needs and requirements of the urban, urbanizable, and rural areas to be served.\" The goal further defines \"[u]rban [f]acilities and [s]ervices\" to include \"energy and communication services.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Goal 5 (Natural Resources, Scenic and Historic Areas, and Open Spaces), requires local governments to inventory, assess, and protect certain \"significant\" resources, including \"energy sources.\" The goal guidelines specify that energy sources mean \"sites for the generation of energy (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   natural gas, oil, coal, hydro, geothermal, uranium, solar and others).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Finally, ORS 215.110(5) allows counties to include in their development codes \"limitations designed to encourage and protect the installation and use of solar and wind energy\n   systems.\" ORS 227.190 empowers cities to adopt and implement solar access ordinances.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   ORS 227.290(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Those general distinctions in the separate regulation of energy facilities and industrial land uses in LCDC rules and related state statutes reinforce the conclusion that, in OAR 660-004-0020(3)(c), LCDC intended a different meaning for rural industrial use and development as compared with energy facilities, including commercial utility facilities for the purpose of generating power for public use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Second, the relevant context for purposes of the application of OAR 660-004-0022(3)(c) to justify a goal exception is the goal to which an exception is sought. The meaning of \"industrial development\" might vary for an exception to Goal 3, Goal 4 (Forest Lands), or other resource goals not otherwise subject\n   to specific exception rules. In any application of OAR 660-004-0022(3)(c) to permit industrial development otherwise not allowed by an applicable goal, the meaning of industrial development would exclude the uses allowed by the goal. Otherwise, there would be no need for an exception. Here, there is no need to except to Goal 3 to establish an industrial use if the use is otherwise allowed under Goal 3 and its implementing rules. As noted, ORS 197.732(1)(b) and OAR 660-004-0005(1) define \"exception\" for the purposes of the exception criteria as a comprehensive plan provision that, among other things, \"[d]oes not comply with some or all goal requirements applicable to the subject properties or situations.\" Put another way, the exception process to an allowed or required use under a goal can only be used to justify a\n   <em>\n    different\n   </em>\n   use than the use allowed by the goal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Goal 3 requires that \"[a]gricultural lands shall be preserved and maintained for farm use\" and defines \"farm\n   use\" as the uses \"set forth in ORS 215.203.\" ORS 215.203(1) requires farmland to be used \"exclusively for farm use except as otherwise provided\" in ORS 215.283. And, as noted, ORS 215.283(2)(g) allowed the conditional establishment of the \"nonfarm use\" of \"[c]ommercial utility facilities for the purpose of generating power for public use.\" Those use classifications for purposes of the\n   <em>\n    allowed\n   </em>\n   permitted and conditional uses in Goal 3 are the relevant classifications in determining whether\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   land uses (here, \"industrial development\") should be allowed as a variance or exception to Goal 3 under OAR 660-004-0022. Necessarily, for purposes of applying OAR 660-004-0022(3)(c) to except to Goal 3, a conditionally allowed commercial utility facility use is a different land use than an excepted industrial use. Thus, the proposed commercial utility facility is not, for purposes of applying OAR 660-0022(3)(c), an \"industrial development.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The way that industrial uses are classified under other goals or rules is irrelevant to the application of OAR 660-004-0022(3) and the meaning of \"industrial development\" for purposes of a Goal 3 exception. The statewide planning goals and implementing administrative rules do not have an overarching definition of the term. The county in this case relied upon the definition of \"industrial use\" at OAR 660-009-0005(3), part of the rules adopted to implement Goal 9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   That rule defines \"industrial use\" \"for purposes of this division\"-that is, OAR chapter 660, division 9. That division, in turn, sets out rules for comprehensive plans within urban growth boundaries, OAR 660-009-0010(1), and Goal 9's requirement to \"[p]rovide for at least an adequate supply of sites of suitable sizes, types, locations, and service levels for a variety of industrial and commercial uses consistent with plan policies.\" The meaning of \"industrial land\" for purposes of inventorying and preserving an\n   adequate supply of employment land in urban areas is categorically different from the meaning of needed rural industrial land for purposes of justifying an exception to the Goal 3 requirement to preserve agricultural land. Urban industrial land is defined by its employment generation potential and relationship to urban employment needs, whereas rural industrial land under OAR 660-004-0022(3)(c) is determined largely by its relationship to rural resource land and other resources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Finally, as noted, OAR 660-004-0022(3) provides for the \"siting of industrial development on resource land outside an urban growth boundary.\" \"Site,\" as a transitive verb, means \"to provide with a site\n   <strong>\n    :\n   </strong>\n   LOCATE .\"\n   <em>\n    Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary\n   </em>\n   2128 (unabridged ed. 2002) (boldface in original). Or Solar sought to \"site\" a \"commercial utility facility for the purpose of generating power for public use\" as a conditional nonfarm use under ORS 215.283(2)(g). The commercial\n   utility facilities allowed under that statute and its implementing rule at the time of Or Solar's application could be up to 320 acres without an exception, depending upon the soil classification of the underlying EFU land. OAR 660-033-0130(38). Without regard to the acreage standard for the commercial utility facility itself, the EFU use in question, for purposes of the application of OAR 660-004-0022(3)(c), is a \"commercial utility facility for the purpose of generating power for public use.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The county exception proceeding under OAR 660-004-0022(3)(c) was not one to locate, provide for, or establish a site. Instead, it was to vary a facility site characteristic, to allow a commercial utility facility that covers approximately 80 acres of land instead of a commercial utility facility on 12 of those acres. A Goal 9 rule defines \"site characteristics\" for purposes of inventorying and demarcating a sufficient supply of urban employment land as\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   \"the attributes of a site necessary for a particular industrial or other employment use to operate. Site characteristics include, but are not limited to, a minimum acreage or site configuration including shape and topography, visibility, specific types or levels of public facilities, services or energy infrastructure, or proximity to a particular transportation\n   or freight facility such as rail, marine ports and airports, multimodal freight or transshipment facilities, and major transportation routes.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   OAR 660-009-0005(11). Because the proceeding was not one to \"site\" a proposed use, but, instead, was one to vary a site characteristic, ORS 660-004-0022(3)(c) did not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In sum, LUBA erred in concluding that the proposed commercial utility facility use was a \"industrial development\" under OAR 660-004-0022(3)(c) in light of the textual differences in the rule between \"energy facility\" and \"industrial activity\" and the necessary differences between a commercial utility facility and industrial development in the context of the application of an OAR 660-004-0022 (3)(c) to except to the uses allowed by Goal 3. Relatedly, the exception was not viable because the proceeding under that part of the rule was not one for the \"siting\" of industrial development, but instead was one for the varying of a site characteristic required by Goal 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   As noted, Or Solar also challenges LUBA's determination that a reasons exception was not appropriate under to OAR 660-004-0022(1)(a). As also noted, that rule provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   \"(1) For uses not specifically provided for in this division, or in OAR 660-011-0060, 660-012-0070, 660-014-0030 or 660-014-0040, the reasons shall justify why the state policy embodied in the applicable goals should not apply. Such reasons include but are not limited to the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   \"(a) There is a demonstrated need for the proposed use or activity, based on one or more of the requirements of Goals 3 to 19; and either [locational factors are satisfied].\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   As discussed, the county concluded that the need for a larger photovoltaic solar power generation facility was based on the requirement of Goal 13 to \"conserve energy.\" LUBA disagreed that Goal 13 required the development of photovoltaic facilities of any particular size.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   On review, Or Solar contends that Goal 13 requires that \"[l]and and uses developed on the land shall be managed and controlled so as to maximize the conservation of all forms of energy, based upon sound economic principles.\" The statewide planning goals define \"conserve\" as \"[t]o manage\n   in a manner which avoids wasteful or destructive uses and provides for future availability.\" \"Development\" is defined to be \"[t]he act, process or result of developing.\" From those definitions, and the text of Goal 13, Or Solar concludes that \"it can be reasonably inferred that LCDC intended the scope of Goal 13's energy conservation mandate to include the development of renewable energy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Or Solar also relies on inferences from the Goal 13 guidelines to buttress that conclusion. Under ORS 197.015(9), \"guidelines\" mean \"suggested approaches designed to aid cities and counties in preparation, adoption and implementation of comprehensive plans in compliance with the goals * * *. Guidelines shall be advisory and shall not limit state\n   agencies, cities, counties and special districts to a single approach.\" The \"planning\" guidelines appended by LCDC to the text of Goal 13 provide for particular plan and implementing measures to allocate land and regulate uses on land to \"assure achievement of maximum efficiency in energy utilization,\" \"minimize the depletion of non-renewable sources of energy,\" \"recycle and re-use vacant land and those uses which are not energy efficient,\" and to\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   \"consider as a major determinant the existing and potential capacity of the renewable energy sources to yield useful energy output. Renewable energy sources include water, sunshine, wind, geothermal heat and municipal, forest and farm waste. Whenever possible, land conservation and development actions provided for under such plans should utilize renewable energy sources.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Or Solar asserts that \"potential\" renewable energy sources \"(which includes solar energy) can only be interpreted to mean that the scope of Goal 13's mandate to conserve energy includes the development of renewable energy sources.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   We agree with LUBA's conclusion that Goal 13 does not require counties to develop or facilitate the development of energy facilities. Some of the goals do require the designation and development of land for various uses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Most of the goals pertain to the conservation of land for resource, scenic, historical, and recreational uses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Goals 1 and 2 pertain to the process for adopting plans and implementing measures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The remaining goals regulate the manner by which land is developed. Goal 6 (Air, Water and Land Resources Quality), requires planning entities \"to maintain and improve the quality of the air, water and land resources of the state.\" Goal 7 (Areas Subject to Natural Hazards), require localities to \"protect people and property from natural hazards\" by regulating, among other things, \"the types and intensities of uses to be allowed in the hazard area.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Goal 13 falls within this category of policies affecting the manner by which property is developed. The goal expressly states that it regulates the way land uses are \"managed and controlled.\" The planning and implementation guidelines for the goal pertain to \"land use planning\" and \"techniques and implementation devices\" in a comprehensive plan and map and its implementing development code and zoning map. Neither the text of the goal nor its guidelines \"require\" the county to develop or facilitate the development of any particular land use, much less large solar power generation facilities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, Goal 13\n   requires\n   that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   development on land be \"managed and controlled\" to conserve energy. The text of the goal and its guidelines do not directly or indirectly require the development of energy facilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Furthermore, even putting aside the necessity to base a reasons exception under OAR 660-004-0022(1)(a) on a goal requirement, and even if the goal inferentially supported the general development of renewable energy facilities, Goal 13 would nonetheless be immaterial to Or Solar's application for an exception. As noted earlier, the requested exception was not for the development of an energy facility. A \"[c]ommercial utility facilit[y] for the purpose of generating power for public use\" was allowed on the site by ORS 215.283(2)(g) and OAR 660-033-0130(38). Or Solar's exception request was to the requirement in Goal 3 that authorizes counties to approve \"farm uses and those nonfarm farm uses defined by [LCDC] rule\" and to the requirement in OAR 660-033-0130(38) that the facility be not more than 12 acres in size when located on high-value farmland. Thus, the exception was to justify an energy facility of a particular size, and Goal 13 has no bearing on that justification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   We turn, finally, to Or Solar's assertion that LUBA improperly interpreted its own rule, OAR 661-010-0071, in reversing, rather than remanding, the county's land use decision. ORS 197.835(1) requires LUBA to \"adopt rules defining the circumstances in which it will reverse rather\n   than remand and land use decision * * * that is not affirmed.\" Accordingly, LUBA adopted OAR 661-010-0071(1)(c), which provides that the board \"shall reverse a land use decision when * * * [t]he decision violates a provision of applicable law and is prohibited as a matter of law.\" OAR 661-010-0071(2)(d) further provides that the board \"shall remand a land use decision for further proceedings when * * * [t]he decision improperly construes the applicable law, but is not prohibited as a matter of law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   As noted, LUBA concluded that the requested land use decision was \"prohibited as a matter of law\" because \"the county misconstrued the applicable law with respect to the only two alternative reasons advanced to justify the proposed exception to Goal 3. Absent identification of a valid and sufficient reason under OAR 660-004-0022, the proposed reasons exemption * * * is 'prohibited as a matter of law.' \" On review, Or Solar argues that LUBA improperly interpreted the meaning of \"prohibited as a matter of law\" to mean prohibited under the exception actually sought from the county. Or Solar contends that an exception could be obtained under the general reasons exception criteria in OAR 660-004-0022(1) because the \"rule plainly contemplates that there may be other appropriate reasons, not listed in the rule, for justifying an exception to Goal 3 for the Project.\" Or Solar surmises that the demonstrated need for a reasons exception could be shown by various statutes related to energy needs, and, therefore, such an exception is not \"prohibited as a matter of law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Or Solar's focus is on the wrong part of the rule. The issue is whether\n   <em>\n    the decision\n   </em>\n   is prohibited as a matter of law. LUBA construed the meaning of \"decision\" in its rule to mean the land use decision under review, the one applied for and approved by the county. Whether a different decision or application would allow a different result is beside the point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   We ordinarily defer to an agency's construction of its own rules.\n   <em>\n    Don't Waste Oregon Com. v.

While the goal itself reflected that importance, it was accompanied by guideline language, full of 'shoulds.'

Or Solar's application and presentations to the planning commission and board of county commissioners asserted that the exception to Goal 3 was based on OAR 660-004-0022(1)(a) and the requirements of Goal 13. The application for the exception and limited use overlay zone stated the bases for the requested reasons exception-that \"the proposal advances several policies within Goals 3 to 19, most notably Goal 13, which is most explicit in support of these renewable energy projects,\" and that \"it is likely that OAR 660-004-0022(l)(a)(B) is most applicable; however, the reasons can be justified under that subsection or OAR 660-004-0022(3)(c).\" Before the county board of commissioners, Or Solar represented that the Goal 3 exception \"can be justified under two alternative reasons: (1) the 'demonstrated need'/locational necessity reason authorized under OAR 660-004-0022(l)(a) ; and (2) the 'rural industrial development' reason under OAR 660-004-0022(3).\" Or Solar further claimed that \"Goal 13's requirement to utilize renewable resources, including solar, 'whenever possible' is a proper basis upon which to consider siting such facilities under a Goal 2 exception.\" 1000 Friends disagreed \"that Goal 13 creates a demonstrated need for the proposed use.\" Or Solar countered that \"[i]t is not the intent of applicant to assert that Goal 13 creates a de facto priority over agricultural lands, only that it can justify why the policies in Goal 3 should not apply.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
