Husband challenges provisions in the decree and an incorporated decision letter that allegedly conflict with the district court's statements during trial. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ISSUES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We re-phrase the parties' issues as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   1. Was the district court prohibited from entering a written decision and a divorce decree that varied from the court's oral statements at trial about whether Husband was in contempt of court and how the court would divide the parties' property?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   2. Should this Court grant leave for the district court to hear and decide a motion under W.R.C.P. 60 pending this appeal?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b62] Wife filed a divorce complaint on July 16, 2016. During the proceedings, the district court ordered Husband to deposit $175,000 with the clerk of district court. The court entered its order on December 5, 2016, and gave Husband ten days within which to deposit the funds. On December 22, 2016, Husband deposited $135,000. The district court held Husband in contempt of court for failing to deposit the full required amount. As a\n   sanction for the contempt, the district court ordered Husband to pay Wife's attorney's fees incurred from seeking Husband's compliance with the December 5, 2016, court order. The court ordered Wife's counsel to submit an attorney's fee affidavit prior to trial and stated, \"the Court will consider the attorney fee request as part of the final equitable distribution of property and debt in this divorce.\" Wife timely filed an affidavit for attorney's fees, without objection from Husband. The court did not act on the affidavit before trial, which began about two weeks later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b63] After the parties' closing arguments at trial, Wife's counsel reminded the district court about the affidavit and asked the court to consider it when dividing the property. In its oral pronouncements a short time later, the district court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   I do not find, based on the circumstances of this case, I am not going to find Mr. Schmalz in contempt of court, based on hearing all of the evidence in the case, and I'll try to explain that when I get into the decision letter itself. The facts are different than I thought existed at that time, and that will be partially explained in it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b64] The district court issued its decision letter a couple of months later and, contrary to its statements at trial, the court did not reverse its original decision regarding Husband's contempt. Instead, the court noted its previous order finding Husband in contempt and awarded to Wife her contempt-related attorney's fees. As part of the property distributed to Wife, the court directed the clerk of district court to pay Wife the fees out of the funds held by the clerk. The district court incorporated the decision letter in a divorce decree. Husband timely appealed from the decree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b65] We apply an abuse of discretion standard when reviewing a district court's division of marital property.\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

By issuing a written decision contrary to its oral pronouncements, Husband argues the district court improperly modified its prior oral ruling distributing the parties' property. He asks us to reverse the district court's decree and letter based on our holding in\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10351697\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/851/4/\">\n    851 P.2d 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993). Alternatively, Husband suggests the district court may have created the discrepancy by mistake. Husband notes that W.R.C.P. 60(a) would allow the district court to correct an error, but he argues he was unable to simultaneously pursue a Rule 60 motion and comply with his deadline to appeal the divorce decree to this Court. He asks us to remand to the district court, or grant leave for the district court, to consider a motion under Rule 60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b67] Regarding Husband's first issue, Wife claims the court's oral statements were not a final order and, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Forbis v.

The district court found Husband in contempt at the end of the contempt proceedings and sanctioned him. Later, at the divorce trial, the court orally stated that it would not find Husband in contempt. And finally, in its written decision letter incorporated into the divorce decree, the court concluded Husband was in contempt and determined the amount of the sanction previously imposed. The district court had discretion to issue a decree that was inconsistent with the court's statements at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Forbis\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8158156\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/203/421/\">\n    203 P.3d at 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [\u00b611] Turning to Husband's perceived W.R.C.P. 60 dilemma, we have previously addressed how an appellant may timely appeal a judgment to this Court while also seeking relief under Rule 60(b).
