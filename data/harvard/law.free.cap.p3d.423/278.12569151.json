On appeal to the superior court, Hall did not dispute this conclusion, and instead raised new legal issues that he had not argued during the adjudicative process. The superior court affirmed the Department's decision, but remanded for fact-finding on the newly raised issues. The superior court denied Hall's request for attorney fees. Hall appeals the ruling denying attorney fees. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    FACTS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 Hall worked as a salesperson for C&amp;R Boger Construction for three months before he voluntarily quit. After quitting, Hall applied for unemployment benefits. The Department denied Hall's application for benefits after determining Hall did not have good cause to quit his job under RCW 50.20.050(2)(a). Hall appealed and an administrative law judge (ALJ) affirmed. Hall appealed the ALJ decision to the Department's commissioner. The commissioner affirmed, concluding Hall was ineligible for benefits because he did not have statutory good cause to quit his job. Hall filed a petition for review before the King County Superior Court under RCW 50.32.120 and RCW 34.05.570.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 On appeal, Hall did not challenge the commissioner's conclusion that he quit his job without good cause. Hall instead raised two new legal issues that he had not argued at the administrative level: (1) that Hall's job at his former employer is not covered employment under RCW 50.04.235 because Hall worked as an \"outside salesperson,\" and (2) that Hall's job as a commissioned salesperson was not \"suitable\" work under RCW 50.20.100 and 50.20.110. The Department objected to the introduction of the two new issues, arguing they were barred under RCW 34.05.554(1). The Department also argued the newly raised issues would not have changed the Department's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 The superior court affirmed the commissioner's findings and conclusions. However, the superior court remanded the matter to the Department to consider the two new issues raised by Hall pursuant to RCW 34.05.554(1)(a), (b), and (d).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After filing an unsuccessful motion for reconsideration, the\n   Department did not appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 Hall then requested attorney fees under the Employment Security Act, RCW 50.32.160. The superior court denied the request, reserving the issue of fees until after remand, but only if further judicial review is taken. Hall moved for reconsideration, arguing, in the alternative, that he was entitled to fees under the equal access to justice act, RCW 4.84.350. The superior court denied Hall's motion for reconsideration. Hall appeals the superior court's order declining to award attorney fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 Hall argues he is owed attorney fees and costs under RCW 50.32.160, or alternatively, RCW 4.84.350. Whether a statute authorizes attorney fees is a question of law that we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    Albertson's, Inc. v. Emp't Sec. Dep't\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1301289\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/102/29/#p45\">\n    102 Wash.

RCW 50.32.160 provides for an award of attorney fees and costs on appeal of a Department decision \"if the decision of the commissioner shall be reversed or modified.\" Hall argues that by remanding his case back to the Department for consideration of the new issues, the superior court effectively \"modified\" the commissioner's ruling. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 Judicial review of a decision of the commissioner is controlled by the procedural requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), chapter 34.05 RCW. RCW 50.32.120. RCW 34.05.554 precludes an appellant from raising issues before the superior court that they failed to raise before the agency, except under limited circumstances. If the superior court determines the appellant has shown sufficient reason for the new issue to be raised, the trial court \"shall remand to the agency for determination\" of that issue. RCW 34.05.554. Neither party disputes the superior court's decision to allow the new issues to be pled and to remand to the Department for fact-finding and consideration of the new issues pursuant to RCW 34.05.554. Thus, the sole issue in this case is whether remand for fact-finding to consider the newly raised issues is a \"reversal or modification\" of the commissioner's ruling under RCW 50.32.160. We conclude that it is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 A similar issue was considered in\n   <em>\n    Hamel v. Emp't Sec. Dep't of State of Wash.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"49054\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/93/140/#p148\">\n    93 Wash.

In\n   <em>\n    Hamel\n   </em>\n   , the superior court remanded the commissioner's decision for additional factual findings. The appeal returned to the superior court after remand and the court affirmed the commissioner's decision. Hamel requested attorney fees and costs. Division Two of this court held that Hamel was not entitled to fees because \"the superior court did not reverse or modify the decision of the Commissioner when it remanded the decision for additional factual findings.\"\n   <em>\n    Hamel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"49054\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/93/140/#p148\">\n    93 Wash.

Emp't Sec. Dep't\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1043656\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/82/745/#p753\">\n    82 Wash.

But, contrary to Hall's assertion,\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   does not stand for the proposition that a superior court's remand for additional factual findings is equivalent to a reversal or modification. In\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   , this court remanded for a new hearing because it held the commissioner made an error of law by concluding the decision to retire was automatically a personal decision, without considering \"whether Terry quit for sufficient work-related factors required under WAC 192-16-009.\"\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1043656\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/82/745/#p753\">\n    82 Wash.

The court specifically held that the commissioner erred and reversed that decision. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   , the superior court in this case did not hold the commissioner erred, but affirmed the commissioner's ruling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hamel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"49054\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/93/140/#p148\">\n    93 Wash.

Hall concedes that he did not raise these issues at the original hearing, but still argues the burden was on the Department to consider these claims on Hall's behalf. Hall's assertion is entirely without merit. The law unambiguously states \"[t]he burden is upon the claimant to establish his rights to the benefits under the act, and this burden of proof never shifts during the course of the trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Townsend v. Emp't Sec. Dep't\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1013568\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/54/532/#p534\">\n    54 Wash.2d 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 534,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=341%20P.2d%20877\">\n    341 P.2d 877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1959). This is even true for a pro se litigant.\n   <em>\n    In re Decertification of Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5752100\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/154/252/#p265\">\n    154 Wash.

Because Hall did not raise these issues before the commissioner, the commissioner did not err in not considering them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12 Finally, Hall cites\n   <em>\n    Albertson's\n   </em>\n   to support his argument. However,\n   <em>\n    Albertson's\n   </em>\n   is again readily distinguishable. In\n   <em>\n    Albertson's\n   </em>\n   , the commissioner concluded that the employee was not available for work but had not committed misconduct. The employer appealed the commissioner's decision that the employee had not committed misconduct and the employee cross-appealed the conclusion that she was available for work. The superior court reversed both of the commissioner's rulings in favor of the employee.\n   <em>\n    Albertson's\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1301289\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/102/29/#p45\">\n    102 Wash.

Because the employee was successful in her appeal and successfully defended against the employer's appeal, this court confirmed an award of attorney fees.\n   <em>\n    Albertson's\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1301289\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/102/29/#p45\">\n    102 Wash.

In remanding for additional fact-finding, the superior court did not hold that the commissioner erred in reaching its conclusion, or determine whether Hall had been erroneously denied unemployment compensation. Any modification of the commissioner's ruling will only occur after the Department performs the necessary fact-finding, and then only if the Department reaches a determination in favor of Hall on the new issues. \"Where a party has succeeded on appeal but has not yet prevailed on the merits, an award of attorney fees should abide the ultimate resolution of the issues in the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.
