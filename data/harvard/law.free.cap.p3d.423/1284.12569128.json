The McElhaneys appealed to the district court, which reversed the Council's decision. Moab City (Moab) and the Council seek our review. We first clarify that, contrary to what we have suggested in some cases, we review the district court's decision and not the Council's. We next conclude that the district court correctly recognized that the Council had not generated findings sufficient to support its decision but erred by refusing to send the matter back to the\n   Council for the entry of more detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Accordingly, we vacate the district court's decision and remand with instructions to the district court to remand the matter back to the Council.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 2 Mary and Jeramey McElhaney (collectively McElhaneys) submitted an application for approval of a conditional use permit for a bed and breakfast facility to be located on their property. The McElhaneys' property is located in an R-2 residential zone. An R-2 zone allows residential dwellings and limited commercial uses. MOAB, UTAH, MUN. CODE \u00a7 17.45.020 (2017). The Moab Municipal Code recognizes that a bed and breakfast facility may be allowed, in some circumstances, as a conditional use in an R-2 zone.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 17.09.530(B). The proposed bed and breakfast would be the only commercial property in a cul-de-sac of single-family residences.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the time of their application, the McElhaneys operated a child-care business on the street, which they planned to close once they opened the bed and breakfast.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 3 In September 2014, the Planning Commission (Commission) convened a public hearing to review the application. Several neighbors voiced their concerns at the hearing. Comments primarily addressed issues of traffic, noise, parking, lighting, storm water drainage, and general incompatibility with the neighborhood. The Commission directed city staff to investigate the concerns and report back. The McElhaneys wrote a letter to the Council to address the concerns raised at the public hearing. They indicated that the bed and breakfast would include off-street parking, decrease traffic once they closed the daycare, be constructed in a way that avoided drainage issues, and ultimately increase property values.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 The city staff investigated the complaints and the McElhaneys' proposed solutions. For example, the staff examined the concerns about increased traffic. The staff estimated that a bed and breakfast would generate up to 8.9 average daily trips per unit-fewer than a single-family residence's 10 to 12 average daily trips. It also found that the McElhaneys' plan included sufficient off-street parking to meet the Moab Municipal Code's requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 The Commission recommended approval of the conditional use permit, subject to the following conditions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   1. The bed and breakfast shall be reviewed each year for code compliance;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   2. All lighting shall be downward directed and full cutoff as required by [Moab Municipal Code] 17.09.660(H), Lighting Plan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   3. Fencing and/or landscaping shall be used to buffer the parking area and the entrance from the street....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   4. The daycare center will discontinue operations once the bed and breakfast facility is operational.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Commission found that the McElhaneys could mitigate the negative impact of the bed and breakfast if it abided by these conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 6 The Council, acting as the land use authority, considered the conditional permit application at a public hearing. Citizens again voiced a number of concerns. Increased noise and traffic were the most frequently aired problems. Many expressed unease that the bed and breakfast would attract tourists with loud Jeeps, utility task vehicles (UTVs), and all-terrain vehicles (ATVs). Nearly everyone who spoke at the Council meeting worried that visitors to the bed and breakfast would drive motorcycles or ATVs up and down the hill past their houses multiple times. Many also feared that the increase in traffic would endanger neighborhood children who frequently play in the streets. Several residents also commented that the presence of a commercial property would alter the integrity and dynamic of the neighborhood. A few people complained of potential light pollution, decreased property values, and possible road deterioration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 7 The Council denied the McElhaneys' application by a 3-1 vote at a Council meeting\n   in November 2014. The Council did not make explicit findings on whether the proposal met the requirements the Moab Municipal Code imposes. However, each councilmember explained the rationale behind his or her vote.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 8 Councilmember Kirstin Peterson voted against the permit. She suggested that the proposed use did not meet the criteria that it be \"consistent with the city of Moab general plan.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 17.09.530(H)(7). She noted that, under Moab's general plan, \"one of the five goals is to restrict commercial development in residential ... zones,\" and she believed that approval of the conditional use permit would effectively \"force a commercial business on a residential area that clearly is not interested in creating a commercial zone.\" Considering \"the unique characteristics of this neighborhood,\" Councilmember Peterson said the bed and breakfast is \"not an appropriate use.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 9 Councilmember Heila Ershadi also voted against the proposal. She stated that the \"number one concern\" among locals was \"the character of the town.\" She concluded that because locals worried that \"the tourism trade is just taking over and there's less and less space that belongs to locals,\" she could not support the McElhaneys' proposed use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 10 Councilmember Kyle Bailey was the third vote against grant of the permit. Bailey reasoned that \"the clear intent of [the minimal negative impact requirement] was to listen to the people in the neighborhoods and to do what the neighborhoods wished.\" He stated that the bed and breakfast \"is going to be an impact on the neighborhoods and I can't support this.\" Councilmembers Peterson, Ershadi, and Bailey did not speak directly to whether the McElhaneys could mitigate the potential adverse impacts or why the conditions the planning commission recommended would be insufficient to ameliorate the bed and breakfast's negative effects.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 11 Only Councilmember Gregg Stucki voted to approve the McElhaneys' conditional use permit. He spoke from his experience as a bed and breakfast owner. He first explained that the conditional use permit system operated by \"rules that are in place and not our own personal preferences or public opinion.\" He addressed \"some incorrect assumptions ... about the type of people that frequent [bed and breakfasts].\" He opined that \"[b]y and large, [bed and breakfast] guests are well educated, they're successful professionals, they tend to be active, health[-] and environmentally-conscious.\" Based on this observation, Stucki said that the McElhaneys would not likely \"be able to buck the trend and cater primarily or exclusively to ATV and motorcycle enthusiasts.\" He concluded that bed and breakfasts \"have not been, nor are they currently a menace or disruption to the regular flow of neighborhoods that some believe they could be.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 12 The McElhaneys appealed to the district court. At a hearing before the court, the McElhaneys argued that among the public's concerns of \"appearance, architecture, scale, design, noise, traffic, [and] parking,\" the key complaints included \"the traffic and the noise.\" At the hearing, the judge expressed dismay at the Council's failure to articulate the basis for its decision. The district court complained that in the Council's assumed role as fact finder, it didn't \"actually find facts.\" Moab responded that it believed the Council had produced an appropriate order, but that if the court identified \"any defect in [the decision] process ... the appropriate remedy ... is to remand for further findings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 13 The district court overturned the Council's decision. First, it held that speculative evidence \"d[id] not support a finding of undue increase in traffic.\" Because the record did not indicate the number of homes on Arches Drive, the court took judicial notice of a Google map.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court also found that\n   concerns about increased noise constituted \"mere speculation.\" It reasoned that any negative noise impact would be effectively mitigated by the McElhaneys' residence at the bed and breakfast and Moab's authority to deny renewal of the annual permit. The district court suggested that the permit might have been denied \"because of other negative effects that are not 'clearly minimal.' \" But it held that \"the City has a responsibility to articulate what those negative effects are likely to be\" and concluded that Moab had failed to do so. Because the McElhaneys met specified requirements for obtaining a conditional use permit, and since \"[t]he only contrary evidence is not substantial, but speculative only, based on the expressed fears of neighbors,\" the district court overturned the Council's decision to deny the McElhaneys' application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 14 Moab appeals the district court's decision. We have jurisdiction under Utah Code section 78A-3-102(3)(j).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 15 We have said that \" '[w]hen a lower court reviews an order of an administrative agency and we exercise appellate review of the lower court's judgment, we act as if we were reviewing the administrative agency decision directly' and 'do not defer, or accord a presumption of correctness, to the lower court's decision.' \"\n   <em>\n    Carrier v.

The parties disagree about what it means to \"review[ ] the administrative agency decision directly.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9040299\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/104/1208/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 16 The McElhaneys contend that we should review the Council's decision and not the district court's order. Moab, in contrast, attacks the district court's order and not the underlying Council decision. Moab argues that \"[l]ack of deference to a trial court judgment does not mean that the appellate court must ignore the trial court decision.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 17 The parties' difference of opinion nicely frames the two ways in which our case law can be read. If you focus on the part of the standard that states, \"we act as if we were reviewing the administrative agency decision directly,\" you could be tempted to conclude that we will ignore the district court's holding and act as if that proceeding never took place.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9040299\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/104/1208/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted). If you focus on the \"do not defer, or accord a presumption of correctness, to the lower court's decision\" portion, then the test looks more like how we review a court of appeals decision on a petition for certiorari.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9040299\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/104/1208/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 18 The statement that we review administrative decisions challenged on appeal \"just as if the appeal had come directly from the agency\" emerged from our holding in\n   <em>\n    Bennion v.

We stated that\n   <em>\n    Bennion\n   </em>\n   and its progeny were inapplicable there because while\n   <em>\n    Bennion\n   </em>\n   presented a case \"where the issue of expertise would pit judge against judge, where both are in an equal position to make a determination,\" the Executive Director had statutorily recognized technical expertise that we must consider.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   We continue to believe it is an important distinction, but not one that requires us to treat the review of other administrative decisions differently from our review of Department of Environmental Quality decisions. Now that we have been squarely presented with the question of how\n   <em>\n    Bennion\n   </em>\n   should be read, we see that the advantages of reviewing the district court's order for correctness outweigh the benefits of directly reviewing the administrative body's order without regard to what happened in the intermediate court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 24 As we recognized in\n   <em>\n    Utah Physicians\n   </em>\n   , disregarding the intermediate court decision undermines the integrity of our appellate process.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   (\"[R]egardless of how much deference we extend, any issue still must be preserved at both the fact-finding and intermediate appellate levels.\"). Moreover, reviewing the lower court's decision allows the appeal of administrative decisions to enjoy the same procedural safeguards as other appeals. Before the district court, the parties have an incentive to preserve, develop, narrow, and refine the arguments they may eventually make to an appellate court-an incentive that would not be as potent if the parties could anticipate getting a second, and entirely fresh, appeal of the administrative decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 25 We face similar considerations when we exercise certiorari review.

The problem with the decision before us is that in the absence of explicit findings of fact and conclusions of law, the reasoning behind the Council's decision is an amorphous target.

In other words, in the absence of a written and factually supported decision, the McElhaneys, the district\n   court, and now we, are left to try to divine what specifically a party seeking to overturn the Council's ultimate determination would have to show was unsupported by substantial evidence in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 32 And that raises the question, what does MLUDMA require of a municipal body, like a city council, when it renders a land use decision in an adjudicative capacity?

The court found that while the city council stated that the proposed use might be considered by neighbors to be a nuisance, \"the City Council\n   <em>\n    did not find that appellants' storage would actually constitute a nuisance\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. Furthermore, the court stated that the city council claimed that the use would be \"injurious to the goals of the city\" but that the city council had not investigated this claim (which was raised by neighboring property owners), nor had it stated why the use would be injurious.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 38 Other courts have required land use authorities to issue specific findings. The Supreme Court of Iowa concluded a land use authority needed to make written findings even though \"[t]here is no statutory requirement that the board do so.\"\n   <em>\n    Citizens Against Lewis &amp; Clark (Mowery) Landfill v. Pottawattamie Cty. Bd. of Adjustment\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10686477\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/277/921/#p925\">\n    277 N.W.2d 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 925 (Iowa 1979). It reasoned that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   [t]he practical reasons for requiring administrative findings are so powerful that the requirement has been imposed with remarkable uniformity by virtually all federal and state courts, irrespective of a statutory requirement. The reasons have to do with facilitating judicial review, avoiding judicial usurpation of administrative functions, assuring more careful administrative consideration, helping parties plan their cases for rehearings and judicial review, and keeping agencies within their jurisdiction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10686477\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/277/921/#p925\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted). And a leading treatise has recognized that \"[t]he failure to make findings may result in the zoning authority's decision not being upheld, or a remand of the case for preparation of written findings of fact.\" 8A MCQUILLIN MUN. CORP . \u00a7 25:369 (3d ed. 2017) (footnotes omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 39 Here, the Council concluded that the proposed bed and breakfast use did not meet the criteria set forth in Moab's Municipal Code but prepared no written findings of fact. Various councilmembers rejected the McElhaneys' application on the basis that (1) the proposed use was inconsistent with Moab's general plan and (2) the impact generated by the McElhaneys' proposed use would exceed the \"clearly minimal\" requirement in the Moab Municipal Code. Under the Moab Municipal Code, these are relevant considerations in assessing the approval of conditional use permits. However, the Council failed to support its conclusions with facts from the record. Further explanation from the Council is needed because without more, it is difficult to see how placing a bed and breakfast in an area zoned R-2-which specifically permits bed and breakfasts-is inconsistent with Moab's general plan. Similarly, a reviewing court needs to know which impacts the Council believed would be more than \"clearly minimal.\" Furthermore, and\n   perhaps more importantly, since we have no visibility into the Council's thinking on the topic, the Council made no finding at all on whether the McElhaneys' proposals sufficiently \"mitigat[ed] the reasonably anticipated detrimental effects of the proposed use.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 10-9a-507(2)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 40 The district court noted, and indeed, complained about the absence of findings. In response, Moab, without conceding a problem with its findings, asked the district court to remand to allow the Council to generate explicit findings. The district court did not. Instead, the district court valiantly attempted to fill the void by parsing the comments neighbors made at Council meetings. The district court also examined Google Maps and drew conclusions about the traffic that the bed and breakfast might bring. We commend the district court for its willingness to take on this project, but it was error because the analysis allowed the district court to base its conclusion on what it believed the Council's decision relied upon-increased traffic in the neighborhood. The district court framed the issue this way even though no councilmember explicitly cited traffic as the reason for the decision. The district court may have correctly read the tea leaves; traffic was a concern that many neighbors raised. But it was the Council's responsibility to define the basis for its decision, not the district court's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 41 Simply stated, if a city council is going to sit as an adjudicative body, it needs to produce findings of fact capable of review on appeal. By mandating that a reviewing court must uphold a city council's decision as long as it is supported by substantial evidence, the legislature has utilized a term of art that presupposes written findings. And as we have noted in the review of other agency decisions, adequately detailed \"findings of fact and conclusions of law ... permit meaningful appellate review.\"\n   <em>\n    LaSal Oil Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10368987\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/843/1045/#p1047\">\n    843 P.2d at 1047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). The Council must make additional findings of fact that are relevant to the legal standards that will govern its decision before a court can offer meaningful appellate review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 42 On an appeal of a district court's review of an administrative decision, we review the district court's decision. The district court correctly concluded that the Council failed to issue findings sufficient to support its denial of the McElhaneys' application for conditional use permit. But the district court erred in overturning the Council's decision without remanding to permit the Council to craft findings of fact and conclusions of law capable of appellate review. We vacate the district court's order and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    The Council amended Moab Municipal Code section 17.09.531(9)(B)(1) in 2017 to specifically prohibit bed and breakfasts \"on a cul-de-sac [or] dead end street.\" The parties have not asked us to opine on the impact of the amendment on this dispute.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Councilmember Peterson briefly remarked that certain uses might be compatible \"only if certain conditions are required that mitigate or eliminate detrimental impacts.\" However, she did not comment on how the McElhaneys had failed to propose ways to mitigate potential adverse impacts or the Commission's mitigation recommendations.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    The district court opined that it could take judicial notice of the map under Utah Rule of Evidence 201, which allows a court to take judicial notice of a fact that \"is not subject to reasonable dispute.\" We are not asked to review this decision.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Although we take this opportunity to clarify the standard, the outcome of this case would be the same if we reviewed the Council's decision directly.
