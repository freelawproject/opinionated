During the years 2009 through 2012, First United's then finance manager embezzled nearly $200,000. The theft was discovered by First United in an end-of-the-year review of finances in December 2012. An audit of First United's financial records revealed that at least $50,000 had been embezzled by the employee in calendar year 2011 and in calendar year 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 Four policies that included coverage for employee dishonesty were issued to First United by Philadelphia as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \u2022 Policy Number: PHPK514238\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Policy Period From: 1/01/2010 To: 01/01/2011\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \u2022 Policy Number: PHPK669064\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Policy Period From: 1/01/2011 To: 01/01/2012 [2011 Policy]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 Policy Number: PHPK812484\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Policy Period From: 1/01/2012 To: 01/01/2013 [2012 Policy]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 Policy Number: PHPK961370\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Policy Period From: 1/01/2013 To: 01/01/2014 [2013 Policy]\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 4 In addition to stating the policy number and policy period, each of the \"Common Policy Declarations\" for the individual policies states: \"In return for the payment of the premium, and subject to all the terms of this policy, we [Philadelphia] agree with you [First United] to provide the insurance as stated in this policy.\" It further states: \"This policy consists of the following coverage parts for which a premium is indicated.

Philadelphia conducted an investigation and ultimately paid First United the limit of liability under the 2013 Policy in the amount of $50,000. First United brought this action for breach of contract because it claims it has coverage under the separate insurance policies in 2011 and 2012, each with a limit of liability of $50,000 for the thefts that occurred during those policy years and discovered within the timeframe specified in the 2011 Policy and 2012 Policy. Philadelphia denies it is in breach and contends it has fulfilled its contractual obligation under the policy presently in effect, the 2013 Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 10 In its motion for summary judgment, Philadelphia argues the 2013 Policy, having an effective policy period of January 1, 2013, to January 1, 2014, succeeded the 2012 Policy, having an effective policy period of January\n   1, 2012, to January 1, 2013. It argues \"[i]n order to obtain coverage each year, a renewal contract was created.\" Philadelphia asserts it anticipates First United \"will argue the policies were merely renewed each year with no break in the coverage and as such, [First United] should be able to recover for every year in which a loss occurred. This argument, in addition to being contrary to the clear language of the policy, is also contravened by Oklahoma law,\" and cites Oklahoma cases in which it is stated that \"the renewal of an insurance policy is a new contract,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that \"[t]he term 'expiration' as used in an insurance policy, refers to the termination of the policy by lapse of time covering the policy period....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 11 Philadelphia argues the thefts occurred during a several year period from 2009 through 2012 and were not \"discovered\" until December 2012. The policies, it argues, provide a discovery period of one year, and because \"the embezzlement was discovered in calendar year 2012 and the acts giving rise to the claim occurred in 2008-2012 but not reported until 2013, only those claims occurring during 2012 would be recoverable, because they were not discovered within one year from the end of the policy period.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 12 Philadelphia asserts the \"ultimate issue\" is whether First United has coverage under more than one policy of insurance. It argues First United's attempt to apply the policy limits not only for the 2012 Policy but also the 2011 Policy \"is clearly and unambiguously prohibited by the policy of insurance,\" referencing Section F(11), the non-cumulation provision. It argues that although no Oklahoma decision has interpreted the \"non-cumulation\" provision, the decisional law from \"other jurisdictions agree policy limits do not accumulate from one year to the next.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Relying on\n   <em>\n    Business Interiors Inc. v.

However, contrary to Philadelphia's characterization of its argument, First United does not argue it is entitled to the limits of coverage in both 2011 and 2012 under the 2013 Policy; rather, it argues, it is entitled to recovery for the 2011 theft under the provisions of the 2011 Policy because the 2011 theft was discovered by it within the one-year limitation under the 2011 Policy. It also argues it is entitled to recovery under the 2012 Policy for the thefts that occurred in 2012 because that loss was discovered within 2012, and, therefore, within the one-year limitation under the 2012 Policy. It does not seek recovery for each act of theft-as a\n   separate \"occurrence\"-committed by its employee during either of those policy periods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 14 First United also asserts it has found no Oklahoma decisional law interpreting the language of the policy provisions at issue in the present case, but argues other jurisdictions have interpreted that language. It cites several cases from other jurisdictions in which the courts have found similar policy language to be ambiguous and have construed those policies to include, not exclude, coverage. First United also places great reliance on\n   <em>\n    E.J. Zeller, Inc. v. Auto Owners Insurance Company\n   </em>\n   , No. 4-14-04,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%205803028\">\n    2014 WL 5803028\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ohio Ct. App. Nov. 10, 2014) (unpublished), wherein the Ohio appellate court examined multiple provisions of insurance policies similar to the policies at issue in the present case, determined the policy provisions were unambiguous, and determined the insured had coverage under each of two separate policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 15 After a hearing on the motions, the court subsequently filed its Judgment granting First United's motion, denying Philadelphia's motion, and awarding First United $100,000, prejudgment and post judgment interest, and attorney fees and costs.

It asserts these provisions are unambiguous and must be interpreted according to their terms. Philadelphia contends the language of those provisions required it to pay $50,000 to First United for its employee's embezzlement, the amount it paid to First United. First United, on the other hand, argues the employee's embezzlement took place in three different years, under three separate policies and in three separate policy periods; thus, it argues, it is entitled to coverage for employee dishonesty during the period of each policy subject to the \"discovery\" and one-year recovery limitation stated in each policy. First United also contends the policy provisions do not clearly and unambiguously state that coverage under prior polices is excluded; thus, to the extent provisions of the policies are susceptible to more than one meaning, those provisions are ambiguous and must be construed against Philadelphia and in favor of First United.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 18 The Oklahoma Supreme Court recently explained that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Oklahoma law involving the interpretation of insurance contracts is well settled. Parties are at liberty to contract for insurance to cover such risks as they see fit and they are bound by terms of the contract, and courts are not at liberty to rewrite the terms of an insurance contract. In Oklahoma, the cardinal rule in contract interpretation is to determine and give effect to the intent of the parties. When policy provisions are clear, consistent, and unambiguous, we look to the plain and ordinary meaning of the policy language to determine and give effect to the parties' intent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    Porter v.

However, the Supreme Court further stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   When the language is susceptible to two constructions before applying the rules of construction, the policy is ambiguous. However, neither forced nor strained construction will be indulged, nor will any provision be taken out of context and narrowly focused upon to create and then construe an ambiguity so as to import a [more] favorable consideration to either party than that expressed in the contract. The whole of a contract is to be taken together, so as to give effect to every part, if reasonably practicable, each clause helping\n   to interpret the others. Insurance contracts are contracts of adhesion, which are interpreted most strongly against the party that prepared the contract. We will not impose coverage if it is clear from the policy language that loss from a particular risk is not covered.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13 (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 19 As most recently stated by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Serra v.

Both the District Court and the appellate court agreed with Aetna finding, \"the employee's fraudulent acts constituted a single loss for Business Interiors.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   However, the\n   <em>\n    Business Interiors\n   </em>\n   Court was concerned only with a series of thefts that occurred over seven months and within the policy year for which the insured sought coverage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court did not have before it the issue presented here and did not consider\n   the effect of \"occurrence\" in conjunction with the policy provisions involved in this case. Moreover, unlike the insured in\n   <em>\n    Business Interiors\n   </em>\n   , First United does not contest that all loss caused by the employee's acts of theft during a particular policy period was but one occurrence for that policy period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 21 Three other cases upon which Philadelphia relies, however, squarely treat the issues presented here; that is, was policy language, similar to the polices at issue here, ambiguous.

Thus, losses attributable to acts that occurred during prior policy periods would not be covered under the current policy. However, this provision does not clearly state that\n   <em>\n    coverage\n   </em>\n   under prior policies for those losses is excluded by the current policy.

As to \"prior loss,\" the\n   <em>\n    Zeller\n   </em>\n   Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   This provision specifically limits coverage for an individual loss that is covered under two policy periods. However, as discussed, each policy only covers losses caused by acts that occur inside of the policy period. Any loss attributable to acts that occur solely outside the policy period are automatically excluded under each policy. Thus, this provision cannot apply to an individual loss attributable only to acts inside the policy period of a single policy, as that loss will only be covered by one policy. Instead, this provision applies when acts occurring in two separate policy periods contribute to an individual loss. Under those circumstances, this exclusion would allow the insured to have the benefit of whichever policy provided greater coverage for that individual loss, but not be allowed to claim that loss under two different policies periods.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. The\n   <em>\n    Zeller\n   </em>\n   Court, unlike the courts who considered the meaning of comparable prior loss provisions in\n   <em>\n    Reliance\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Wausau\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Madison\n   </em>\n   , specifically emphasized the \"any loss\" language of the provision as applying to an individual loss instead of the \"all loss\" language defining occurrence. The court further stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   Notably, this provision does not utilize the term \"occurrence.\" It applies to individual losses, not to an aggregation of losses. Indeed, were this provision to apply when an \"occurrence\" was partly covered by two policies, then an occurrence would necessarily include losses covered under prior policies. However, as this provision is written, it only applies when a\n   <em>\n    loss\n   </em>\n   spans multiple policy periods. Thus, while this provision\n   <em>\n    limits recovery\n   </em>\n   for an individual loss that spans multiple policy periods, it\n   <em>\n    does not otherwise exclude coverage\n   </em>\n   under prior policies that are attributable to acts that occurred solely during that policy period.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b6 30 As to the non-cumulation provision, the\n   <em>\n    Zeller\n   </em>\n   Court observed that unlike other provisions of the insurance policy, \"this provision specifically applies to multiple policies. However, it does not operate\n   <em>\n    to exclude coverage\n   </em>\n   under prior policies.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). The court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   This provision is specifically limited to \"this insurance.\" While \"this insurance\" is not defined in the policy, when it is used elsewhere it is only in reference to the current policy, not to all policies issued by the insurers. Indeed, the Prior Loss exclusion operates when a loss was covered under \"this insurance\" and any prior insurance issued by the insurers. Thus, the definition of the term \"this insurance\" cannot include any prior insurance. As a result, the NonCumulation provision only operates in the event that \"this insurance,\" i.e. the current policy, is extended or otherwise covers multiple years. When each policy period is covered by a different contract for insurance, this exclusion does nothing to limit recovery to a single policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b6 31 The\n   <em>\n    Zeller\n   </em>\n   Court also stated that even if it \"were to find that this provision affects prior insurance policies, the result would not change.

The Supreme Court recognized the doctrine was \"a double-edged sword\" because both the insured and the insurer may rely upon their reasonable expectations,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12, and reiterated: that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   Generally, absent an ambiguity, insurance contracts are subject to the same\n   rules of construction as other contracts. However, because of their adhesive nature, these contracts are liberally construed to give\n   <em>\n    reasonable\n   </em>\n   effect to all their provisions. Our case law and the interpretive rules applied to insurance contracts demonstrate that Oklahoma law is consistent with the spirit and the policy of the reasonable expectations doctrine.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16 (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted). The Court, however, adopted a restricted version of the doctrine and held \"the doctrine of reasonable expectations may be applicable to the interpretation of insurance contracts in Oklahoma, and that the doctrine may apply to ambiguous contract language or to exclusions which are masked by technical or obscure language or which are hidden in a policy's provisions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. No argument is made, nor do we conclude, that the operative provisions of the insurance contracts are technical, obscure, or hidden. However, we do conclude there is ambiguity in the language of the insurance contracts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b6 37 While we do not agree with the conclusion reached by those courts who have found no ambiguity in similar contract provisions, we do not find Philadelphia's arguments concerning the non-cumulation provision unreasonable. Philadelphia argues the non-cumulation provision\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   restricts coverage for employee dishonesty to the definition of \"occurrence\" (\"all loss caused by, or involving\" an employee \"whether the result of a single act or series of acts\"); that is, to one occurrence (though the acts occurred over many years) regardless of the number of successive, separate policies the insured has purchased. According to Philadelphia's reasoning, the non-cumulation provision acts to restrict coverage to only the current year's policy and Limits of Liability (e.g., $50,000) and to exclude coverage under prior policies for an occurrence that took place within a prior year's policy period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   \u00b6 38 The\n   <em>\n    Zeller\n   </em>\n   Court's comprehensive analysis of multiple provisions of insurance contracts similar to those present here, however, is instructive and persuasive that another interpretation of the policy language-one that does not restrict recovery for an occurrence that occurs in separate policy periods to only one policy period-is also reasonable. Even if Philadelphia meant to limit recovery for occurrence spanning many years and multiple policies, as written the policy language can be reasonably interpreted to limit recovery to the aggregate of losses incurred within one policy period regardless of the number of thefts or dishonest acts by an employee, but does not preclude recovery for an occurrence within a particular policy period, and, thus, does not preclude recovery for an occurrence that also occurs in another policy period, even if the theft or dishonest acts are committed by the same employee. Consequently, because the provisions herein discussed are susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation, the terms are ambiguous, and are to be construed against Philadelphia, who crafted the contract language, and in favor of First United as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b6 39 We conclude the trial court did not err as a matter of law in interpreting the polices at issue and granting summary judgment to First United for the limits of liability under the 2011 Policy and 2012 Policy for the series of thefts committed by its employee during each policy period. Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b6 40\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   THORNBRUGH, P.J., and RAPP, J., concur specially.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   RAPP, J., concurring specially, with whom THORNBRUGH, P.J., joins:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The insurance policies here for each year are discrete policies of insurance. Each policy has a specific beginning and termination date; there is not a policy \"renewal\" or \"extension.\" Each policy has a separate premium\n   from the prior policies and provides that the insurer may change the premium, regardless of whether it actually did so. Each policy contains a different policy identification number. Regardless of whether the relevant policy provisions remained unchanged, that fact does not alter the fact that the 2011 and 2012 insurance policies are discrete, independent policies of insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Therefore, First United had employee dishonesty coverage, subject to policy limits and discovery provisions, separately for each year involved here. First United is entitled to recover for its loss under the 2011 policy, and separately under the 2012 policy.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    Thefts also occurred in 2009 and 2010, but those thefts are not part of First United's claims in the present case. According to the auditor's report, the employee issued unauthorized checks payable to herself, her husband, to her personal credit card account, and to various vendors, and she made unauthorized credit card purchases. Philadelphia also conducted an investigation which, like the First United audit, revealed the employee misappropriated $161,445.23 in checks, $6,703.84 in payroll checks, and $31,419.54 in credit card purchases during the period of 2009 through 2012, though it did not review claimed payroll checks or claimed credit card purchases \"due to policy limits.\" However, according to First United, more than $3,000 in misappropriated payroll checks was paid to the employee in 2011. The credit card purchases are not delineated by date of unauthorized use. According to the uncontested calculations of First United, the employee embezzled $48,986.17 in checks and payroll checks in 2011 (not including the unauthorized credit card purchases during 2011) and $78,727.01 in checks and payroll checks in 2012 (not including unauthorized credit card purchases during 2012). Philadelphia does not dispute that at least $1,013.83 ($50,000 minus $48,986.17) in unauthorized credit cards purchases was made by the employee in 2011.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    The end of the policy period for each policy is stated as \"at 12:01 A.M. Standard Time at [First United's] mailing address[.]\" While the complete policies for each of the four policies identified by First United are not part of the record on appeal, Philadelphia does not dispute that each of those policies contains the same operative provisions pertinent to the issues argued below and asserted on appeal. Therefore, we will refer to the policy provisions and pages of the insurance policy upon which Philadelphia relies with the understanding that those provisions are the same as those in the 2011 Policy and 2012 Policy.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    Further, the section dealing with employee dishonesty provides: \"As respects Employee Dishonesty coverage: 'Occurrence' means all loss caused by, or involving, one or more 'employees,' whether the result of a single act or series of acts.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    This \"loss sustained\" provision is not applicable to the issues presented on appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    Paragraph F(10) \"Loss Covered Under This Insurance and Prior Insurance Issued by Us or Any Affiliate\" (prior loss provision) provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n    If any loss is covered:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n    a.

The [\n    <em>\n     Wausau\n    </em>\n    Court] came to a contrary conclusion to that reached by the [\n    <em>\n     Spartan\n    </em>\n    Court] concerning whether the insured was able to recover under each successive policy year for fraudulent acts spanning those policy years.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-156\">\n    ... [We find the] analysis conducted by the [\n    <em>\n     Spartan\n    </em>\n    Court] is instructive and persuasive. [The\n    <em>\n     Spartan\n    </em>\n    Court] found that an identical definition of \"occurrence\" did not \"affirmatively indicate whether a series of acts included acts occurring outside the policy term.\" In addition, the Fourth Circuit noted that additional policy terms, again virtually identical to those at issue in this case, concerning non-cumulation and the effect of prior insurance coverage did not \"ameliorate the ambiguity in the definition of occurrence.\" [The\n    <em>\n     Spartan\n    </em>\n    Court] noted that the policies spanning two successive policy years were \"independent contracts, in that each required a separate single annual premium to be paid[.]\" [The insured's] five successive policies required different premiums to account for varied levels of coverage over different property, all of which indicate that each policy was independent. To interpret the successive polices as narrowly as suggested by the [insurer] would essentially render the coverage of successive policies and the payment of premiums meaningless. This Court finds that the same ambiguities identified in [\n    <em>\n     Spartan\n    </em>\n    ] are present in the [the insured's] policies, meaning that, pursuant to Maryland law, these ambiguities must be resolved against [the insurer] in favor of [the insured]. Therefore, construing the relevant policy terms, including the occurrence definition, non-cumulation provision, and the effect of prior insurance coverage section, against [the insurer] in favor of [the insured], [the insured] is permitted to recover under each successive policy during which [the employee's] dishonest acts occurred.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-157\">\n    <em>\n     Glaser\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9009150\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/364/529/#p537\">\n     364 F.Supp.2d at 537-38\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (footnotes omitted) (citations omitted).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"23\">\n   <p id=\"p-158\">\n    Although the cases that have restricted coverage for an occurrence spanning several policy periods have done so largely because of the definition of occurrence and the prior loss provisions not the non-cumulation provisions,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Reliance\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7455556\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/660/1136/\">\n     660 So.2d at 1137-38\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , Philadelphia has made no argument concerning the prior loss provisions of the policies at issue here.
