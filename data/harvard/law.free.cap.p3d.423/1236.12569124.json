Specifically, Goins argues that the court of appeals erroneously concluded the unavailable witness's testimony was properly admitted under rule 804 of the Utah Rules of Evidence. Goins contends that because article I, section 12 of the Utah Constitution limits preliminary hearings to establishing probable cause, his counsel did not have a similar motive to develop testimony at the preliminary hearing that she would have had at trial. We agree with Goins and hold that the court of appeals erred when it affirmed the admission of the witness's preliminary hearing testimony. To reach that conclusion, we disavow our holding in\n   <em>\n    State v. Brooks\n   </em>\n   that counsel always has the same motive to develop testimony at a preliminary hearing that she will have at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 Admission of preliminary hearing testimony constituted error with respect to Goins's misdemeanor conviction. But its admission was harmless as to Goins's felony conviction. We therefore affirm his felony conviction, reverse his misdemeanor conviction, and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 3 In July 2012, Goins was a man on a mission: to find Gabriel Estrada and recover the cell phone Goins believed Estrada had stolen from him. Goins found Estrada outside a Salt Lake City homeless shelter. Goins brandished a knife and confronted Estrada. Estrada denied that he had taken Goins's phone and fled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 Goins resumed his search for his phone in Pioneer Park. He found Jacob Omar, an Estrada associate, asleep on a blanket. Goins and his girlfriend, Star, awakened Omar. Star asked Omar if he had seen Estrada and, more specifically, if Omar had seen Estrada with a phone. Both Star and Goins began accusing Estrada of stealing Goins's cell phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 During this conversation, Goins began waving the knife at Omar and telling Omar that he \"better tell the truth because [Goins] knows that it was [Estrada] that took the phone from [Goins's] apartment.\" At some point, Goins stepped onto Omar's blanket. Omar testified, \"I don't allow anybody to step onto my blanket. So I got up and I pushed him off my blankets.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 Goins \"came back at\" Omar, and the two men \"started punching each other.\" Omar pinned Goins to the ground. Goins latched onto Omar's earlobe with his teeth, yanked his head back, bit off Omar's earlobe, and spat it on the ground. Both men got up and Omar began chasing Goins around his blanket. At some point, Goins picked up his knife, and when Omar and Goins were on opposite sides of the blanket, Goins lunged and stabbed Omar under his left arm. Police officers soon arrived and arrested Goins. Goins was eventually charged with one count of mayhem, a second-degree felony in violation of Utah Code section 76-5-105, and two counts of aggravated assault, both third-degree felonies in violation of Utah Code section 76-5-103.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 Both Estrada and Omar testified at a preliminary hearing. Goins's counsel cross-examined Estrada without objection by the State or apparent restriction by the judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 Two months after the preliminary hearing, the parties appeared for the first day of trial only to discover that they had no jury pool and could not proceed that day. The parties and the trial court agreed to continue the trial to the following day. The prosecutor then reported that Estrada had not appeared for trial and moved that he be declared unavailable and that his preliminary hearing testimony be admitted and read to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 The prosecutor explained that he had difficulty locating both Estrada and Omar and that the prosecution \"ha[d] gone to some lengths to try to procure [Estrada's] attendance\" at trial. The prosecution found Omar and Estrada for the pretrial hearing through the Salt Lake City Bike Police, who \"were able to find them mostly based on Jacob Omar's ... missing earlobe.\" Estrada and Omar had brought their pastor, Russ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   to the preliminary hearing. At the hearing, Estrada and Omar agreed to allow the prosecutor to \"go through Russ to contact them\" with details regarding the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10 In anticipation of trial, the prosecutor emailed Russ a subpoena for Estrada and Omar, which detailed the trial date and called for their presence at trial. Russ confirmed that he gave a copy of the subpoena to both Estrada and Omar. Sometime before trial, Russ left his position for a new job, and Jason\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   became the new community pastor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11 Both Russ and Jason informed the prosecutor that \"Estrada ha[d] come into some trouble\" and \"was in jail at one point.\" The prosecutor told the district court that he had checked the jail about a week before the October 23, 2013 trial. However, Estrada had been released almost a month prior, on September 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12 Jason lost touch with Estrada before trial. Although the prosecutor asked Jason to watch for Estrada, Jason did not see him in the days leading up to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 13 Goins accepted the prosecutor's proffer of his efforts to serve Estrada and procure his appearance at trial. Goins argued that the prosecutor's efforts to serve Estrada were insufficient under rule 804 of the Utah Rules of Evidence, which allows for the admission of former testimony when a witness\n   is unavailable. Goins also argued that permitting use of Estrada's preliminary hearing testimony would violate Goins's constitutional right to confrontation because the motive for cross-examination at the preliminary hearing differed from the motivation to cross-examine at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 14 The district court found that Estrada was unavailable under rule 804. Specifically, the court found that the State utilized a \"reasonable means of process\" as its efforts succeeded in actually informing Estrada of the trial dates. Estrada appeared at the preliminary hearing and knew that the proceedings were moving forward. Next, the court found that Goins enjoyed a meaningful opportunity for cross-examination at the preliminary hearing where his counsel actively examined Estrada without objection or restriction and asked about the \"exact incidents\" that were at issue at trial. The district court concluded that Estrada's preliminary hearing testimony could be used at trial without violating Goins's Confrontation Clause rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 15 Estrada failed to appear again at trial the next day. Goins unsuccessfully renewed his objection to admission of Estrada's preliminary hearing testimony, and the jury heard an audio tape of Estrada's preliminary hearing testimony relating Goins's encounter with Estrada.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 16 The prosecution presented separate evidence relating to Goins's altercation with Omar. The jury heard from three witnesses: Omar, an eyewitness, and a responding police officer. The prosecution also presented photos depicting Goins's and Omar's injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 17 The jury acquitted Goins of the mayhem charge. It returned a guilty verdict for the count of felony aggravated assault for the stabbing of Omar. The jury convicted Goins of the lesser offense of threatening with or using a dangerous weapon, a class A misdemeanor, in the fight with Estrada.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 18 Goins appealed to the court of appeals on two grounds. First, Goins argued that Estrada was not \"unavailable\" because the State made no good-faith effort to locate him and properly serve him with a subpoena. Second, Goins asserted that he did not have the requisite opportunity or similar motive to fully cross-examine Estrada at the preliminary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 19 The court of appeals held that the State made the necessary reasonable efforts to locate Estrada and affirmed the finding of unavailability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    State v. Goins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6804838\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/370/942/\">\n    2016 UT App 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6804838\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/370/942/\">\n    370 P.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The court of appeals held that the rule required the opportunity for cross-examination, not the exercise of that opportunity, and that a preliminary hearing provides \"an effective opportunity for confrontation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-17 (citation omitted).

However, the court found the argument foreclosed by our decision in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Goins's Counsel Did Not Have a Similar Motive to Develop Estrada's Testimony at the Preliminary Hearing That She Would Have Had at Trial\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 24 Goins argues that the court of appeals erred when it affirmed that Estrada's preliminary hearing testimony could be admitted at trial. He asserts that the introduction of preliminary hearing testimony violates both the Confrontation Clause of the United States Constitution and rule 804 of the Utah Rules of Evidence. Goins intertwines his constitutional and rule-based arguments. We see value in detangling the arguments and analyzing rule 804 separately from the Confrontation Clause. We have reasoned that judicial restraint counsels against reaching constitutional questions if we can resolve the case on non-constitutional grounds.\n   <em>\n    State v. Thurman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046407\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/846/1256/#p1262\">\n    846 P.2d 1256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1262 (Utah 1993).

Utah Rule of Evidence 804 provides an exception: preliminary hearing testimony may be admitted if (1) the potential witness is unavailable and (2) the testimony is given at a proceeding where the party against whom the testimony is now offered had \"an opportunity and similar motive to develop it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   804(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 26 Goins challenges the court of appeals' holdings that (1) Estrada qualified as an unavailable witness and (2) Goins had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony at the pretrial hearing under rule 804.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    A. We Assume Without Deciding That Estrada Was Unavailable to Testify at Trial\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 27 The rule 804 exception extends only to circumstances in which the declarant is considered unavailable. \"A declarant is considered to be unavailable as a witness if the declarant ... is absent from the trial or hearing and the statement's proponent has not been able, by process or other reasonable means, to procure the declarant's attendance.\" UTAH R. EVID. 804(a)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 28 The court of appeals reasoned that \"[b]ecause the prosecution made reasonable efforts to locate [Estrada], though perhaps not all efforts 'humanly possible,' ... the prosecution acted in good faith, and ... the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding [Estrada] to be unavailable for purposes of rule 804.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Goins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6804838\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/370/942/\">\n    2016 UT App 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6804838\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/370/942/\">\n    370 P.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Rule 804 Precludes the Admission of Preliminary Hearing Testimony at Trial as a Matter of Law\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 29 Prior testimony of an unavailable witness may be admitted only if it meets Utah Rule of Evidence 804(b). Under rule 804(b)(1), former testimony of an unavailable witness is \"not excluded by the rule against hearsay\" if it\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (A) was given as a witness at a trial, hearing, or lawful deposition, whether given during the current proceeding or a different one; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (B) is now offered against a party who had ... an\n   <em>\n    opportunity and similar motive\n   </em>\n   to develop it by direct, cross-, or redirect examination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   UTAH R. EVID. 804(b)(1) (emphasis added). Thus, preliminary hearing testimony is admissible against a defendant only if defense counsel had both (1) an opportunity and (2) similar motive to develop the testimony at the preliminary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 30 Goins argues that the limited nature of preliminary hearings results in a more limited opportunity for cross-examination than would take place at trial and that therefore the motive to cross-examine at a preliminary hearing differs from that at trial. The State counters that Goins's argument was raised and rejected in\n   <em>\n    State v. Brooks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10436109\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/638/537/\">\n    638 P.2d 537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Utah 1981). The State has a point. The\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   court rejected a defendant's assertions that a preliminary hearing is \"by its very nature ... different in motive and interest than a trial.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10436109\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/638/537/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10436109\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/638/537/\">\n    at 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, it held that \"cross-examination takes place at preliminary hearing and at trial under the same motive and interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . To reach that conclusion, the\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   court opined that \"[d]efense counsel's motive and interest are the same in either setting; he acts in both situations in the interest of and motivated by establishing the innocence of his client.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10436109\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/638/537/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We concluded that the rules of evidence do \"not preclude, as a matter of law, testimony given in a preliminary hearing from being admitted at trial.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10436109\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/638/537/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The State correctly asserts that\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   announced a per se rule under which preliminary hearing testimony is admissible so long as the requirements of unavailability and an opportunity to cross-examine are satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 31 However, subsequent changes to article I, section 12 of the Utah Constitution undermine one of\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   's key premises-that \"[d]efense counsel's motive and interest are the same in either setting.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10436109\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/638/537/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In 1994-more than a decade after we decided\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   -Utah voters amended article I, section 12 to limit \"the function of [preliminary] examination ... to determining whether probable cause exists.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   UTAH CONST . art. I, \u00a7 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 32 Since 1994, preliminary hearings-at least those that function as the amended constitution envisions-potentially limit the scope of cross-examination such that the blanket statement we issued in\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   no longer rings true. As Goins's trial counsel argued to the trial court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   the motive in developing testimony is different at a preliminary hearing than it is at trial. We frequently ask questions during preliminary hearings that we would not ask at trial because evidence ... admissible at ... a preliminary hearing [is not necessarily] admissible in a trial. The rules of evidence are different and ... we don't ask question[s] that we might ask at a trial because credibility determinations are not being made [at] a preliminary hearing. The court making the probable cause determination is not assessing the credibility of a witness, therefore we do not ask questions to get that information out.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 33 This statement perhaps slightly exaggerates the differences-magistrates can, in some limited ways, assess credibility at a preliminary hearing.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v. Virgin,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8415974\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/137/787/\">\n    2006 UT 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 25,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8415974\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/137/787/\">\n    137 P.3d 787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And there may be certain circumstances where the nature of a witness and her testimony is such that defense counsel will ask all the questions at a preliminary hearing that she would ask at trial. But by and large, article I, section 12 places most credibility determinations outside the reach of a magistrate at a preliminary hearing, so Goins's trial counsel's basic point is well taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 34 A defense attorney who assumes that the magistrate will conduct a preliminary hearing that comports with article I, section 12 does not have an incentive to prepare to thoroughly cross-examine on credibility. An attorney who believes that the magistrate will not permit questioning that goes beyond that necessary to establish probable cause has no guarantee that she can present or develop positive information concerning her client at the preliminary hearing. Nor does counsel have a motive to develop affirmative defenses at a preliminary hearing. In many, if not most, instances,\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   's conclusion either no longer aligns with the reality of practice, or places magistrates in the uncomfortable position of choosing between conducting preliminary hearings in fidelity with article I, section 12 and permitting the type of examinations that\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   presupposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 35 Goins asks us to not only disavow our holding in\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   , but to replace it with another blanket rule-one that provides that counsel never has the same motive to develop testimony at a preliminary hearing as at trial.

Clear rules provide better guidance. But they provide guidance at the cost of flexibility. That lack of flexibility could foreclose the potential for preliminary hearing testimony to be used in those circumstances where the nature of the case, or the testimony of the unavailable witness, is such that defense counsel really did possess the same motive and was permitted a full opportunity for cross-examination at the preliminary hearing. Although such cases might prove rare, we can envision scenarios where, for whatever reason, defense counsel possesses the same motive and is provided the same opportunity to cross-examine as she would have at trial.

Goins's petition for rehearing gives the word \"overlook\" a novel interpretation.
