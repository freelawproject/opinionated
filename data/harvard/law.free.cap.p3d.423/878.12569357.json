The clerk of this court determined that this statute applied to David A. Troupe's May 15, 2017 personal restraint petition (PRP) and ruled that the PRP would be dismissed unless Troupe paid a $250 filing fee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 Troupe seeks to modify our court clerk's ruling on the basis that our court clerk violated his due process rights and that RCW 4.24.430 violates equal protection. We hold that although RCW 4.24.430 is not unconstitutionally vague, procedural due process required our court clerk's letter ruling to identify the prior actions that our court clerk relied on when he determined that the statute applied. We also hold that Troupe's equal protection argument lacks merit. Accordingly, we grant Troupe's motion to modify our court clerk's ruling. We direct our court clerk to reissue his ruling and to specifically identify the strikes upon which he relies to require Troupe to pay a filing fee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 On May 15, 2017, Troupe filed a PRP in this court, alleging that the Department of Corrections (DOC) prevented him from receiving his mail in violation of his constitutional rights.

Because RCW 4.24.430 does not directly involve First Amendment rights, Troupe's argument is properly evaluated as an \"as-applied\" challenge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"425303\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/143/162/#p180\">\n    143 Wash.2d at 184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20P.3d%201012\">\n    19 P.3d 1012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But the parties overlook the context of the phrase \"frivolous or malicious\" in RCW 4.24.430 and that context provides the necessary clarity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 22 For RCW 4.24.430 's purposes, it is only a prior action or appeal \"that was dismissed by a state or federal court\n   <em>\n    on grounds that\n   </em>\n   it was frivolous or malicious\" that qualifies to be counted against the petitioner as a \"strike.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis added.) A \"grounds\" in the sense used in RCW 4.24.430 is a \"foundation or basis on which knowledge, belief, or conviction rests\" and a \"premise, reason, or collection of data upon which something ... is made to rely for cogency or validity.\" WEBSTER'S THIRD NEW INT'L DICTIONARY 1002 (2002). Accordingly, RCW 4.24.430 's plain language applies to those prior actions where a court dismissed the action because it was frivolous or malicious. RCW 4.24.430 requires us to look to the reason for a prior dismissal, not to make our own independent determination of the prior action's merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 23 Troupe does not dispute that on four occasions, a federal or state court has dismissed an action filed by Troupe and has included in its dismissal order an express ruling that the action was \"frivolous\" or \"malicious\" under RCW 4.24.430 or its federal counterpart,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   A person of common intelligence would know that\n   based on the reason for the prior dismissal, each of these dismissals qualified as an action \"that was dismissed by a state or federal court\n   <em>\n    on grounds that it was frivolous or malicious\n   </em>\n   .\" RCW 4.24.430 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 24 Even if a statute uses a term that when considered in isolation has no determinate meaning, the statute withstands a vagueness challenge if interpreted as a whole it has the required degree of specificity.\n   <em>\n    Haley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1373981\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/117/720/#p741\">\n    117 Wash.2d at 741\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=818%20P.2d%201062\">\n    818 P.2d 1062\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, reading \"frivolous or malicious\" in context and under the facts of this case, there is no question that RCW 4.24.430 applies to the four prior dismissals. Thus, as applied to Troupe, RCW 4.24.430 's \"frivolous or malicious\" language meets the definiteness requirement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   5. \" FRIVOLOUS OR MALICIOUS \": ENFORCEMENT REQUIREMENT MET\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 25 Troupe also argues that the \"frivolous or malicious\" language fails to meet the enforcement requirement. That is, he claims that the language is unconstitutionally vague because it provides no guidance to this court and thus relies on this court's subjective judgment about whether a prior action was \"frivolous or malicious\" within RCW 4.24.430 's meaning. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 26 In Troupe's case, RCW 4.24.430 's \"frivolous or malicious\" language did not require an inherently subjective determination by this court or invite an inordinate amount of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Spokane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1379087\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/115/171/#p179\">\n    115 Wash.2d at 181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=795%20P.2d%20693\">\n    795 P.2d 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather, the statute provided an objective standard: whether the prior dismissals specified that the action was frivolous or malicious. Again, here, at least four of Troupe's prior dismissals specified that the action was \"frivolous\" or \"malicious\" under RCW 4.24.430 or its federal counterpart. Accordingly, we reject Troupe's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   6. \" AN ACTION OR APPEAL \": DEFINITENESS REQUIREMENT MET\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 27 Troupe also briefly argues that the requirement that a qualifying dismissal be of \"an action or appeal\" failed to provide him with adequate notice that \"dismissal of PRPs constituted a 'strike.' \" Am. Mot. to Modify Ct. Clerk's Ruling Regarding Ct. Filing Fee at 12. He asserts that RCW 4.24.430 failed to inform him that a PRP was a \"civil\" action. Again, we disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 28 Regardless of whether the prior, dismissed action was criminal or civil, it counts as a strike under RCW 4.24.430, assuming it meets the other statutory requirements. RCW 4.24.430 does not say that this court only looks to whether a person brought \"a\n   <em>\n    civil\n   </em>\n   action or appeal that was dismissed by a state or federal court.\" The plain language of the statute supports that any \"action or appeal\" could form the basis for a strike. Troupe's argument reads into the statute an additional requirement and then challenges whether that requirement is void for vagueness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   7. CONCLUSION: NOT VOID FOR VAGUENESS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 29 Troupe fails to show that the \"dismissed ... on grounds that it was frivolous or malicious\" provision of RCW 4.24.430 violates either the definiteness or enforcement requirements of the void-for-vagueness doctrine. And he fails to show that the \"an action or appeal\" provision violates the definiteness requirement. Accordingly, we hold that Troupe does not meet his burden to show beyond a reasonable doubt that RCW 4.24.430 is unconstitutionally vague.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   B. FAILURE TO IDENTIFY STRIKES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 30 Troupe argues that our court clerk's letter ruling violated due process because it failed to specify the prior actions being counted as \"strikes.\" The State responds that the issue is moot because the State provided prior dismissals that could qualify as strikes. Alternatively, the State asserts that procedural due process does not apply here. We hold that the issue is not moot, that procedural due process applies, and that it was error for our court clerk's ruling not to specify the prior dismissals that counted as strikes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   1. MOOTNESS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 31 As a threshold issue, the State argues that the procedural due process issue is moot because the State has now provided Troupe with copies of potential strikes.
