On December 12, 2016, Woodward filed a petition in Snohomish County Superior Court to restore his firearm rights. In the petition, Woodward referenced his juvenile adjudication by cause number, court and adjudication date, but wrote \"SEALED\" for the name of the offense. Woodward's petition further declared that he had \"never been convicted of a class A felony or any felony within a maximum sentence of at least twenty years in any jurisdiction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 On December 19, 2017, the State responded that it did not object to Woodward's petition because he \"appears to meet all of the statutory requirements in order to be eligible for an order restoring his firearms rights.\" The State's response specified that its search of Woodward's criminal history found \"no prior felony convictions that would count in his offender score.\" On December 22, 2016, the juvenile court granted Woodward's motion to seal his juvenile class A felony adjudication. On January 5, 2017, the superior court entered an order restoring Woodward's firearm rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 On February 2, 2017, Woodward filed an application for a concealed pistol license (CPL) with the Snohomish County Sheriff's Office (Sheriff). The Sheriff searched Woodward's criminal history to determine whether he had any convictions that would make him ineligible to possess a firearm and therefore ineligible to obtain a CPL. This search revealed Woodward's sealed juvenile class A felony adjudication, as well as the order restoring his firearm rights. On February 8, 2017, notwithstanding the order, the Sheriff denied Woodward's CPL application on the ground that his class A felony adjudication rendered him ineligible to possess a firearm under state and federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 On March 24, 2017, the Sheriff moved to intervene in Woodward's firearm restoration case. The Sheriff then moved to vacate the order restoring Woodward's firearm rights, arguing that class A felons are ineligible to seek restoration of firearm rights even if the adjudication is sealed. Woodward argued that because a sealed juvenile record is treated as though it never occurred, he had no conviction that would prevent him from having his firearm rights restored. On April 13, 2017, the court granted the Sheriffs motion to intervene and motion to vacate on an alternative basis, finding that Woodward's petition materially misrepresented that the juvenile conviction was sealed when in fact sealing did not occur until 10 days later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 On April 27, 2017, Woodward filed an amended petition for firearm restoration. The Sheriff again objected to Woodward's petition on the ground that class A felons are ineligible for restoration of firearm rights even if the adjudication is sealed. On May 18, 2017, a superior court commissioner agreed with the Sheriff and denied Woodward's amended petition. Woodward appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 The superior court commissioner denied Woodward's amended petition based on her interpretation of RCW 13.50.260.

However, that statute expressly prohibits restoration of firearm rights to persons convicted of a class A felony. It is undisputed that Woodward's class A juvenile felony adjudication is a \"serious offense\" which caused him to lose his firearm rights. It is also undisputed that at the time Woodward filed his amended petition to restore firearm rights, his class A felony juvenile adjudication was sealed pursuant to RCW 13.50.260(6)(a). Once a court enters an order sealing a juvenile court record, \"the proceedings in the case shall be treated as if they never occurred, and the subject of the records may reply accordingly to any inquiry about the events, records of which are sealed.\" RCW 13.50.260(6)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 9 Woodward, relying on\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   , argues that his sealed class A juvenile adjudication does not preclude him from possessing a firearm.

In 2014, the legislature recodified RCW 13.50.050 into RCW 13.50.260, deleted sections that prohibited WSP from obtaining such information, and added a section that provides prosecutors access to information on the existence of sealed juvenile records. RCW 13.50.260(8)(c). In 2015, the legislature added a section that provides criminal justice agencies access to sealed juvenile records information. RCW 13.50.260(8)(d). The Sheriff contends that following these statutory amendments, it is no longer tenable to argue that sealed juvenile records should be treated as though they do not exist because the sealing statute does not treat them that way.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    \u00b6 18 We agree with the\n    <em>\n     Barr\n    </em>\n    court that these amendments do not render the holding in\n    <em>\n     Nelson\n    </em>\n    obsolete. Simply because RCW 13.50.260(8)(c) and (d) now require juvenile records to be accessible to prosecutors and criminal justice agencies, does not alter the fundamental holding in\n    <em>\n     Nelson\n    </em>\n    that under RCW 13.50.260(6)(a) once juvenile adjudications are sealed, they cannot be used while sealed. Requiring records be kept, even if they are sealed, is logical and necessary under RCW 13.50.260(8)(a) and (b) which mandate that sealed juvenile records be unsealed if the defendant is subsequently adjudicated of a juvenile crime or adult felony.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    \u00b6 19 Moreover, \" 'The Legislature is presumed to be aware of judicial interpretation of its enactments,' and where statutory language remains unchanged after a court decision the court will not overrule clear precedent interpreting the same language.\"\n    <em>\n     Riehl v.

According to the Sheriff, RCW 9.41.040 and RCW 13.50.260 address two separate topics: firearm possession and sealing of juvenile records. Therefore, the Sheriff contends RCW 13.50.260 cannot create a loophole for juvenile class A felons to evade application of RCW 9.41.040. But the\n    <em>\n     Barr\n    </em>\n    court disagreed, noting that the\n    <em>\n     Nelson\n    </em>\n    court rejected similar arguments in holding that \"because the plain language of the juvenile record sealing statute entitled Nelson to be treated as if he had not been previously convicted, there was no conviction to be examined under RCW 9.41.040.\"\n    <em>\n     Barr\n    </em>\n    , 4 Wash.

Under this rule, when two statutes governing the same subject matter conflict and cannot be harmonized, the specific statute prevails over the general statute.\n    <em>\n     O.S.T. ex rel. G.T. v.

But the\n    <em>\n     Barr\n    </em>\n    court noted that a sealed juvenile record containing a class A felony conviction \"is treated as if it never occurred\" and \"a CPL applicant with sealed adjudication has no convictions preventing firearm possession.\" 4 Wash.

Accordingly,\n    <em>\n     Barr\n    </em>\n    concluded that this rule did not apply because the firearm statutes and the sealing statute \"do not conflict\" and \"can be easily harmonized.\" 4 Wash.

Sess., ch. 7, \u00a7 101, at 2196, 2197. But as the Sheriff correctly acknowledges, reference to legislative history is unnecessary where, as here, the language of the statute is plain.\n    <em>\n     HomeStreet\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4001228\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/166/444/#p451\">\n     166 Wash.2d at 451\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=210%20P.3d%20297\">\n     210 P.3d 297\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . As discussed above, we agree with\n    <em>\n     Barr\n    </em>\n    that the plain language of RCW 9.41.040 and RCW 13.50.260 does not prohibit restoration of firearm rights.

The Sheriff notes that RCW 13.50.260(8)(a) provides that \"[a]ny adjudication of a juvenile offense or a crime subsequent to sealing has the effect of nullifying a\n    sealing order.\" Consequently, according to the Sheriff, allowing this statute to summarily result in loss of firearm rights without further judicial process or notice would be confusing and absurd. But the\n    <em>\n     Barr\n    </em>\n    court rejected this argument. It noted that \" RCW 9.41.047(1)(a) requires that a defendant be notified of his or her ineligibility to possess a firearm only under certain conditions, none of which are present here.\"\n    <em>\n     Barr\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     ,\n    </em>\n    4 Wash.

Barr was aware he was ineligible to possess firearms based on his sealed adjudications, and that the sealing order notified him that the order would be nullified if he committed another felony. Therefore, \"[i]t would not be absurd or unfair if the unsealing of these adjudications again rendered him ineligible to possess a firearm or a CPL.\"\n    <em>\n     Barr\n    </em>\n    , 4 Wash.

While we give considerable weight to opinions of the attorney general, they are not binding on this court and we give less deference when the opinion concerns statutory construction.\n    <em>\n     Skagit County Pub.
