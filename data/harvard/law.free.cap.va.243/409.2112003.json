Taylor challenges a special assessment levied against him by the Board of Supervisors of Northumberland County (the Board of Supervisors) for the construction of state secondary highway Route 820. The trial court ruled that the assessment was proper and affirmed the Board of Supervisors\u2019 action. Taylor appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Code \u00a7 33.1-72.1 provides for taking certain county streets into the secondary system of state highways. This section applies to \u201ca county in which the secondary system of the state highways is constructed and maintained by the Department of Transportation and which has adopted a local ordinance for control of the development of subdivision streets to the necessary standards for acceptance into the secondary system.\u201d Code \u00a7 33.1-72.1(B). \u201cStreet,\u201d as used in this section, means</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-8\">a street or highway shown on a plat which was recorded or otherwise opened to public use prior to July 1, 1980, at which time it was open to and used by motor vehicles, and which, for any reason, has not been taken into the secondary system of state highways and serves at least three families per mile.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">Code \u00a7 33.1-72.1(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">Code \u00a7 33.1-72.1 further provides that \u201c[s]uch street shall only be taken into the secondary system of state highways if the governing body of the county agrees to contribute from county revenue or the special assessment of the landowners on the street in question one-half of the cost to bring the [street] up to the necessary minimum standards for acceptance.\u201d Code \u00a7 33.1-72.1 (C). Furthermore, subsection (C) states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-11\">No such special assessment of landowners on such [street] shall be made unless the governing body of the county receives written declarations from the owners of seventy-five percent or more of the platted parcels of land abutting upon such street stating their acquiescence in such assessments. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>The basis for such special assessments, at the option of the local governing body, shall be either (i) the proportion the value of each abutting parcel bears to total value of all abutting parcels on such street as determined by the current evaluation of the property for real estate tax purposes, or (ii) the proportion the abutting road front footage of each parcel abutting the street bears to the total abutting road front footage of all parcels abutting on the street, or (iii) an equal amount for each parcel abutting on such street.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">In 1989, the Board of Supervisors adopted a policy whereby eligible streets would be recommended for acceptance into the secondary system of state highways if the landowners abutting such streets paid one-half of the cost to bring the streets up to the necessary minimum standards for acceptance. Thereafter, several owners of land on the street to be improved, Route 820, presented the County with a check for $32,500, representing 50% of the estimated construction cost. Upon receipt of the check, the Board of Supervisors requested the Department of Transportation to accept the street into the secondary system of state highways.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">After construction was completed and the street was accepted into the highway system, it was determined that there was a cost overrun of $6,822.31. Thus, one-half of the overrun, $3,411.15, was owed by the abutting landowners. Consequently, the Board of Supervisors levied a special assessment against various landowners to make up the overrun.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Taylor\u2019s land does not front upon or touch Route 820, but is located approximately 100 yards beyond the terminus of the route. Route 820, however, serves as the access road to the subdivision in which Taylor resides. Taylor did not desire to have the street taken into the state system and did not contribute to the cost thereof. The Board of Supervisors, nonetheless, levied a special assessment against Taylor of $874.84 as his part of the overrun.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Taylor contends, <em>inter alia, </em>that the assessment is invalid because his property does not abut Route 820. The Board of Supervisors contends, on the other hand, that because Taylor\u2019s property is \u201cserviced by\u201d or \u201caffected by\u201d the state highway, the term \u201cabut\u201d should be interpreted broadly to include land that is in close proximity to the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>Code \u00a7 33.1-72.1(C) speaks of the county agreeing \u201cto contribute from . . . the special assessment of the landowners <em>on the street in question.'\u2019'1 </em>(Emphasis added.) Further, the special assessment shall not be made unless the county board of supervisors \u201creceives written declarations from the owners of seventy-five percent or more of the platted parcels of land <em>abutting upon such street </em>stating their acquiescence in such assessments.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Additionally, apropos to the present case, the basis of the special assessment is \u201cthe proportion the <em>abutting road front footage of each.parcel abutting the street bears to the total abutting road front footage of all parcels abutting on the street.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Finally, special assessments under Code \u00a7 33.1-72.1(C) \u201cshall be conducted in the manner provided in Article 2 (\u00a7 15.1-239 et seq.) of Chapter 7 of Title 15.1, mutatis mutandis, for assessments for local improvements.\u201d Article 2, \u201cAssessments for Local Improvements,\u201d limits assessments to \u201cabutting property owners.\u201d Code \u00a7 15.1-239.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">The term \u201cabut\u201d is defined as \u201cto touch. To . . .be contiguous; join at a border or boundary; . . . border on. . . . The term \u2018abutting\u2019 implies a closer proximity than the term \u2018adjacent.\u2019 No intervening land.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>11 (6th ed. 1990). <em>See State Highway Commissioner </em>v. <em>Creative Displays, </em>236 Va. 352, 355, 374 S.E.2d 30, 32 (1988) (\u201c\u2018What is adjacent . . . may be separated by the intervention of some other object; what is contiguous must touch on one side.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">We think that, by consistently using the term \u201cabutting\u201d in Code \u00a7\u00a7 33.1-72.1 and 15.1-239, the General Assembly signified its intent to limit special assessments to owners of land bordering upon, and not merely adjacent or in close proximity to, the portion of the street that is being improved. Taylor\u2019s land does not border upon Route 820, and, therefore, the assessment levied against him is invalid.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Accordingly, we will reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment, vacate the assessment against Taylor, and enter final judgment in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b430-8\"> Having reached this conclusion, we need not address Taylor\u2019s other contentions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
