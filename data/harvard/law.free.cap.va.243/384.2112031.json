In 1990, after withdrawing an appeal of the convictions, the prisoner filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus naming appellant, Edward W. Murray, Director, Virginia Department of Corrections, as the respondent. In this collateral attack on the convictions, the convict asserted that his trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to personally interview a potential alibi witness. The habeas court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>found in favor of the prisoner and granted the petition. We awarded the Director an appeal from the May 1991 order, which required the Commonwealth either to retry the prisoner or to release him.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">At the criminal trial, the accused pled not guilty and, responding to the trial judge\u2019s questions, asserted that he was \u201centirely satisfied\u201d with the services of his court-appointed counsel. Additionally, the accused stated that all his witnesses were present in court except one, whose testimony was received by stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence showed that in April 1989 the victim, a 64-year-old man living alone, was brutally beaten in his home in rural New Kent County. After the beating, the assailant took the victim\u2019s wallet containing $107 in cash, \u201cturned all the burners on\u201d to a kitchen gas stove, and broke a light bulb hanging from the kitchen ceiling. The victim, who had seen the accused in the neighborhood on other occasions, identified him as the assailant both immediately after the beating and at trial. The victim described the accused to a neighbor, who took the victim to a hospital after the attack, and to the investigating police officer, as \u201cChuckie,\u201d a young man \u201cfive five in height . . . stout with reddish hair.\u201d According to the victim, the accused went \u201cin the direction of\u201d the home of another neighbor, Charles Lewellyn Stewart, after the attack. As the victim was being transported to the hospital, the accused\u2019s truck was observed parked in Stewart\u2019s driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">The defendant, who testified he was \u201cfive seven and a half\u201d in height, weighed 168 pounds, and had brown hair, denied committing the crimes. When interviewed several days after the incident, the accused told a police investigator that he knew nothing about it and that he had been at home, miles away from the scene, during the entire evening when the attack took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">During the criminal trial, the defense attempted to convince the court that another person, one Mark Allen Ries, actually was the perpetrator. Ries, age 20, six feet tall, and weighing 305 pounds, had a learning disability. The accused, and a number of his friends and relatives, testified that Ries had admitted to them that he committed the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">Ries testified that he did not commit the crimes, stating that he had been threatened by the accused and the accused\u2019s friends. They told him, according to Ries, that because of his disability \u201cnothing much would happen\u201d to him if he \u201ctook the blame\u201d for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>the offenses. Ries testified that the accused threatened him with a beating and even death if he did not tell the police that he was the perpetrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">At the trial, the accused and Stewart testified that the accused was at Stewart\u2019s home drinking coffee and watching television at the time the crimes were committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">During closing argument, defense counsel argued that the victim\u2019s identification of the accused as the assailant was unreliable and inaccurate, and contended that defendant\u2019s evidence established that Ries actually committed the crimes. Defense counsel did not rely upon the alibi evidence that the accused was visiting Stewart at the time of the crimes. Indeed, the prosecutor pointed out in rebuttal argument the inconsistencies in the evidence on that issue \u2014 the defendant stating immediately after the offenses that he was at home when the crimes were committed and producing evidence at trial that he was at Stewart\u2019s home at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The trial court, in finding the accused guilty of the offenses, stated that he believed the victim\u2019s identification testimony. According to the judge, the identification, together with the accused\u2019s inconsistent accounts of his whereabouts at the time of the crimes, rendered the defendant\u2019s denial of guilt unworthy of belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">At the habeas hearing, conducted by the same judge who tried the criminal case, the convict complained about trial counsel\u2019s failure to interview an alibi witness. The convict, through different counsel, submitted affidavits of one Joann Jernigan. In the affidavits, Jernigan claimed to have been at Stewart\u2019s home on the evening in question and stated she was prepared to testify that the accused was visiting there at the time the crimes were committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">The Director submitted an affidavit of trial counsel who represented that he did not know Jernigan\u2019s name until the filing of the habeas corpus petition. According to counsel, he had asked the accused\u2019s wife, who he knew worked with a potential alibi witness, to \u201cspeak with\u201d her \u201cabout the case.\u201d Counsel represented that the accused\u2019s wife told him \u201cthere were hard feelings\u201d between the witness and the accused\u2019s family \u201cand they did not have much to do with each other.\u201d Counsel stated that he \u201cgot the distinct impression\u201d that the witness \u201ccould easily turn on\u201d the accused. Counsel asserted that in view of Stewart\u2019s alibi testimony, he concluded that Jernigan\u2019s testimony would \u201cbe, at best, cumulative and perhaps damaging at trial.\u201d Thus, according to counsel, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>did not personally interview her, even though she was present in Stewart\u2019s home, asleep, when counsel talked to Stewart at Stewart\u2019s home prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">\u201cThe right to counsel which is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the Federal Constitution and made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment includes the right to effective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Virginia Dep\u2019t of Corrections </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>227 Va. 525, 533, 318 S.E.2d 399, 403 (1984). The constitutional guarantee of effective assistance of counsel \u201cincludes the right to the care and skill which a reasonably competent attorney would exercise for similar services under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Stokes </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>226 Va. 111, 117, 306 S.E.2d 882, 884 (1983). In other words, the accused is entitled to counsel who is a reasonably competent attorney and to advice that is within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases. <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">In a collateral attack on a conviction, however, \u201ca prisoner not only has the burden of proving ineffective assistance of counsel, but also must prove actual prejudice as a result.\u201d <em>Stokes, </em>226 Va. at 118, 306 S.E.2d at 885. <em>Accord Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">In the present case, the habeas court, in a memorandum opinion, stated that the \u201cthreshold question\u201d was whether trial counsel acted reasonably in failing to \u201cinterview an alibi witness based on the evidence presented in this case.\u201d The habeas judge said that he would \u201cnot review the trial strategy of counsel and hold that it was an error not to call Jernigan as a witness, but failing to interview her in order to form a sufficient basis for this tactical decision is another matter entirely.\u201d The court concluded: \u201cThere is simply no reason for counsel not to have at least spoken to this alibi witness in an \u2018alibi\u2019 type case.\u201d The court ruled that the \u201cattorney committed professional error when he failed to conduct the amount of pretrial investigation that was necessary to furnish effective representation\u201d to his client. Additionally, the court decided that the convict \u201cwas prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s professional errors\u201d because the court was \u201cconvinced\u201d there was a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that the result of the criminal proceeding \u201cwould have been different.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">We hold that the court below erred in ruling that trial counsel\u2019s conduct was not within the range of reasonable competence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Thus, we do not reach the question whether the convict was prejudiced by any alleged defective performance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">\u201cJudicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential\u201d when an attorney\u2019s performance has been attacked as constitutionally ineffective. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689. The \u201cdistorting effects of hindsight\u201d should be avoided and the habeas court \u201cmust indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Id. Accord Clark, </em>227 Va. at 534, 318 S.E.2d at 403. A ruling upon a claim of actual ineffectiveness \u201cmust judge the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct on the facts of the particular case, viewed as of the time of counsel\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">In order to furnish constitutionally effective representation, \u201ccounsel must conduct a reasonable amount of pretrial investigation\u201d so that counsel\u2019s trial decisions \u201cwill reflect informed deliberation.\u201d <em>Clark, </em>227 Va. at 534, 318 S.E.2d at 404. The degree of investigation that is \u201creasonable\u201d must depend \u201cupon various factors, including the number and relative complexity of the issues in the case, the strength of the prosecution\u2019s case, and the overall strategy of counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn any ineffectiveness case, a particular decision not to investigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances, applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel\u2019s judgments.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 691. Indeed, \u201cwhen a defendant has given counsel reason to believe that pursuing certain investigations would be fruitless or even harmful, counsel\u2019s failure to pursue those investigations may not later be challenged as unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Applying these principles to the present case, we are of opinion that the convict\u2019s trial counsel acted in a constitutionally reasonable manner in not personally interviewing Jernigan. A study of the criminal trial proceedings reveals that the so-called \u201calibi defense\u201d was but an incidental part of overall defense strategy, and properly so. Counsel had at least eight witnesses, including the accused, to testify that Ries had admitted to them that he had committed the crimes. In addition, defense counsel had determined that the victim briefly had been a patient in a \u201cmental institution\u201d and had been convicted of a felony; this information was used at trial to attack the credibility of the victim\u2019s identification of the accused as the perpetrator. The main thrust of the defense, therefore, was to eliminate the accused as the perpetrator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>by showing another person was the criminal agent and by attacking the validity of the identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">The \u201calibi\u201d that the accused was in a place different from the crime scene at the relevant time of the crimes was potentially unpersuasive in view of the inconsistencies between the accused\u2019s pretrial statement that he was at home and his trial testimony that he was at Stewart\u2019s home. Actually, it was to the prosecution\u2019s advantage to show that the accused was at Stewart\u2019s, in close proximity to the crime scene, near the time of the attack; indeed, the prosecutor in closing argument noted that Stewart placed the accused \u201cright there next door ... at Stewart\u2019s house\u201d during the evening in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Therefore, given all the circumstances of the case, including the unimportance of the alibi aspect of the defense, we cannot say that, as of the time of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, he acted unreasonably in failing to interview Jernigan. This is true especially since the accused\u2019s own spouse led counsel to believe the potential witness, whose testimony would have been merely cumulative, \u201ccould easily turn on\u201d his client and prove harmful to the defense if placed on the witness stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Accordingly, we will reverse the order granting the petition for a writ of habeas corpus and will enter final judgment here dismissing the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
