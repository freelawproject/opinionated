Maloney to obtain funds for the purchase of a truck. Upon Maloney\u2019s subsequent default, Davis paid the noteholder $10,541, which represented the balance due and owing on the note. Finding that Maloney had breached his contract with Davis as a result of his default on the note, the trial court awarded Davis judgment in the principal amount of $10,541.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">Pursuant to a writ of \u201cActual Levy\u201d issued by the trial court, the Sheriff of Fairfax County seized the truck, which was titled in Maloney\u2019s name. Following this seizure, Maloney filed for an exemption under Code \u00a7 34-26.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">At the exemption hearing, Maloney\u2019s employer, James Heslep, testified that Maloney needed the truck to perform his job as a master carpenter because his duties included the transport of workers and materials among various job sites. Heslep also testified that Maloney resided in Pennsylvania and that, during the work week, he slept each night at one of the job sites. The record also reveals that, in his request for an exemption, Maloney listed his address as RR #2, Box 355, Ligonier, Pennsylvania. Further, the sheriffs return on the levy shows that Maloney\u2019s truck was registered in Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">In a memorandum filed with the trial court, Davis argued that a person must be a resident of Virginia in order to qualify for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>exemption under Code \u00a7 34-26. Davis asserted that, based on the evidence presented, Maloney was not a resident of Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">The record before us does not show that the trial court ruled on the residency issue. Instead, it reflects that the court.held that Maloney\u2019s vehicle was a \u201ctool of the trade\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 34-26 and that, as such, it was exempt from seizure. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">In support of her argument that a debtor must be a resident of Virginia in order to qualify for an exemption under Code \u00a7 34-26, Davis cites the provision of that section which states that the exemption is available to \u201cevery householder.\u201d Further, Code \u00a7 34-1, which sets forth the definitions applicable to all of Title 34, provides that householder \u201cmeans any resident of Virginia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">We agree with Davis that this definition resolves our inquiry. Since Code \u00a7 34-26 specifically states that its coverage extends to \u201cevery householder,\u201d and it does not list any other category of persons entitled to protection thereunder, we conclude that in order to qualify for an exemption under Code \u00a7 34-26, a debtor first must be a resident of Virginia. The evidence before the trial court was uncontroverted that Maloney was a resident of Pennsylvania at the time he sought an exemption under Code \u00a7 34-26. Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand this case to it for sale of the vehicle as provided by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b519-11\"> Code \u00a7 34-26 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-12\">Poor debtor\u2019s exemption; exempt articles enumerated.
