Insofar as relevant to that issue, the facts are not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Buckingham Associates (Buckingham) obtained a loan from First Union National Bank of North Carolina (First Union) to finance construction of an apartment complex on its property in Chesterfield County. In April 1987, Buckingham executed and recorded a deed of trust on the unimproved land securing payment of that loan. In a contract executed in June 1987, Buckingham engaged George W. Kane, Inc. (Kane), as general contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-3\">Kane acquired a payment bond from Hartford Fire Insurance Company (Hartford Fire) and entered into three separate contracts for carpentry work with NuScope, Inc. (NuScope). As the construction project neared completion in September 1988, Kane discontinued progress payments to its subcontractor, and NuScope filed three memoranda of mechanic\u2019s liens for the unpaid balances of the subcontracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">In November 1988, the circuit court entered an order granting Kane\u2019s petition to file three bonds securing payment of the debts claimed in the memoranda of mechanic\u2019s liens. Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company (Hartford Accident) issued the bonds, Kane filed them in the office of the clerk of the circuit court, and the court ordered NuScope\u2019s three liens \u201creleased in accordance with the provisions of Virginia Code \u00a7 43-71.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Naming Kane, Hartford Fire, and Hartford Accident as defendants, NuScope then filed a \u201cBill of Complaint to Enforce Mechanic\u2019s Liens and for Ancillary Relief.\u201d NuScope did not ask that its liens be enforced by sale of the property. Rather, NuScope prayed that \u201c[t]he validity of its mechanic\u2019s liens be duly ascertained and confirmed . . . and the amount for which the liens would have been enforceable against the real estate be determined\u201d and that the chancellor enter judgment against Kane and Hartford Accident on the lien bonds. As ancillary relief, NuScope sought damages for breach of contract against Kane and Hartford Fire on the payment bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">A commissioner in chancery conducted an evidentiary hearing and filed his report. As relevant to this appeal, the commissioner found that all necessary parties were before the court; that NuScope\u2019s three liens were valid; and that \u201cKane and its mechanic\u2019s lien bond surety Hartford Accident are obligated for . . . the amounts contained in the bonds and the liens.\u201d The chancellor rejected all exceptions to the report and entered judgment in favor of NuScope for $97,439.06. We awarded Kane and its sureties (collectively, Kane) an appeal, limited to their chai<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>lenge to the chancellor\u2019s confirmation of the commissioner\u2019s finding that all necessary parties were before the court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Quoting from <em>Mendenhall </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>239 Va. 71, 74, 387 S.E.2d 468, 470 (1990), Kane argues on brief that \u201c \u2018[a] court is powerless to proceed with a suit unless all necessary parties are properly before the court\u2019 that the owner of the property encumbered by NuScope\u2019s liens and the beneficiary and the trustees of the deed of trust antecedent to those liens were necessary parties whose absence was fatal to the court\u2019s jurisdiction over NuScope\u2019s enforcement suit; and, hence, that we must reverse the judgment and dismiss NuScope\u2019s suit for failure to join Buckingham, First Union, and the trustees of the deed of trust as parties-defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Kane relies primarily upon <em>Mendenhall </em>and upon <em>Walt Robbins, Inc. </em>v. <em>Damon Corporation, </em>232 Va. 43, 348 S.E.2d 223 (1986). In <em>Walt Robbins, </em>the owner of an unimproved tract of land acquired a construction loan and executed a deed of trust securing payment of the note. Two mechanic\u2019s lienors filed suits to enforce their liens for labor and materials furnished the project. Applying due process principles, we held that the beneficiary of the deed of trust recorded prior to the commencement of the project was a necessary party because the beneficiary had \u201ca property right which entitle [d] him to notice and an opportunity to challenge the perfection of the mechanic\u2019s lien or to invoke the forfeiture provisions of Code \u00a7 43-23.1.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 47, 348 S.E.2d at 226. Concerning the trustee, we held that he was a necessary party to the suit seeking enforcement by judicial sale because, absent jurisdiction over his person, the chancellor could not enter a decree divesting him of legal title to the property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">In <em>Mendenhall, </em>we concluded that the rule in <em>Walt Robbins </em>applies not only to the beneficiary and the trustee of a deed of trust recorded prior to commencement of the improvements, but also to the \u201cowners of [the property] subjected to the mechanic\u2019s liens.\u201d 239 Va. at 75, 387 S.E.2d at 470. Because those parties had not been timely added as defendants to enforce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>ment suits filed by a subcontractor and a materialman, we entered final judgment reversing the judgment below and dismissing the bills of complaint. Thus, we concluded that the beneficiary, the trustee, and the owners were members of that class of necessary parties defined in <em>Bonsal </em>v. <em>Camp, </em>111 Va. 595, 598, 69 S.E. 978, 979 (1911), as those \u201cwhose interests in the subject matter of the suit, and in the relief sought, are so bound up with that of the other parties that their legal presence as parties to the proceeding is an absolute necessity, without which the court cannot proceed.\u201d We reaffirm the rules applied in <em>Mendenhall </em>and in <em>Walt Robbins. </em>However, the issue dispositive of this appeal was never raised in those cases. As a matter of first impression, we consider now whether those rules apply when a mechanic\u2019s lien has been released by posting a bond as provided by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-3\">Code \u00a7\u00a7 43-70, -71 are known in the construction and repair industries as the \u201cbonding-off\u201d statutes. In pertinent part, \u00a7 43-71 provides as follows where, as here, the bond is posted prior to the filing of the enforcement suit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-4\">At any time after the perfecting of any [mechanic\u2019s] lien and before a suit be brought for the enforcement thereof, the owner of the property affected thereby, the general contractor or other parties in interest may . . . apply to the court ... for permission ... to file such bond as prescribed in the preceding section .... Upon the granting of such permission . . . and the filing of such bond . . . the property affected thereby shall stand released from such lien ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\">Such . . . bond . . . shall be held under the control of the court, and shall be subject to the final judgment of the court adjudicating the lien or liens to be valid and determining the amount for which the same would have been enforceable against the real estate in any suit or action thereafter brought for the ascertainment of the rights of the parties in interest, with respect hereto ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">The sureties on any such bond, which may be involved in any suit or action brought under the provisions of this section, shall be made parties to such suit or action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Kane argues on brief that \u201c\u00a7 43-71 provides that when a bond releasing a mechanic\u2019s lien is posted before an enforcement suit is filed, the requisite proof and parties to the suit will be the same as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>if no bond had been posted, except that the surety on the bond must also be made a party.\u201d As Kane interprets the statute, the requirement that the court hear evidence and adjudicate the validity and the enforceable amount of a mechanic\u2019s lien mandates the joinder as parties-defendant of all those who would be necessary parties if the mechanic\u2019s lien had never been released. We think Kane\u2019s interpretation overlooks the function the General Assembly intended the bonding-off statutes to serve.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">The legislature was fully aware of the competing interests of those engaged in the construction industry. Typically, a landowner requires a loan to finance a construction project. The lender, the beneficiary of the owner\u2019s deed of trust on the property, requires a certificate insuring the title to that property. The general contractor requires the owner to make periodic payments to satisfy periodic claims of subcontractors and material suppliers. The owner must make serial requests of the lender for progress draws. As each new request is received, the lender must ask the title insurance company to issue an endorsement increasing the coverage of the title policy to include the new draw. To comply with that request, the title insurer must up-date its title search.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">If the search discloses a mechanic\u2019s lien lodged against the property since the last draw, the title insurer will decline to issue a new endorsement, the lender will permit no further draw by the owner, and no progress payments will be made to those who furnish the labor and materials. If the project is to be financed and completed and the debts due mechanics and materialmen are to be satisfied, the title defect must be cured. If, as provided in Code \u00a7 43-71, the encumbrance of the mechanic\u2019s lien is released by the posting of a bond, the title defect is cured, a new title endorsement can be issued, the progress draws and payments can be made, and the project can proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Reading \u00a7 43-71 in context with related sections of Title 43, Chapter 1, we think the legislative purpose was to facilitate the financing and expedite the completion of construction and repair projects by creating an alternative security device which provides those who supply the labor and materials to those projects protection equivalent to the protection afforded by mechanic\u2019s liens. The General Assembly accomplished that purpose by authorizing the courts to permit any party who could be adversely affected by the enforcement of a mechanic\u2019s lien, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cthe owner of the property affected thereby, the general contractor or other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>parties in interest\u201d, <em>id., </em>to file a bond securing payment of whatever claim otherwise could be enforced by judicial sale of the property. The legislature directed that, upon the filing of such a bond, the mechanic\u2019s lien would cease to exist, leaving the bond as the mechanic\u2019s sole recourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-3\">Concerning enforcement of that bond, the statute provides that, \u201cwith respect hereto\u201d, liability \u201cshall be subject to the final judgment of the court adjudicating the lien ... to be valid and determining the amount for which the same would have been enforceable against the real estate in any suit ... for the ascertainment of the rights of the parties in interest\u201d. <em>Id. </em>Hence, with respect to a bond enforcement suit, the party-plaintiff has the burden of proving the same elements of his claim that he would have had to prove in a suit to enforce the lien released by that bond. He may do so by calling whatever witnesses might claim interests adverse to his claim. The question we must decide here is whether, as Kane contends, some of such witnesses are necessary parties-defendant to the bond enforcement suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">In <em>Mendenhall, </em>we defined the term \u201cnecessary parties\u201d by quoting the following language used in two of our prior opinions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-5\">Where an individual is in the actual enjoyment of the subject matter, or has an interest in it, either in possession or expectancy, which is likely either to be defeated or diminished by the plaintiffs claim, in such case he has an immediate interest in resisting the demand, and all persons who have such immediate interests are necessary parties to the suit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">239 Va. at 75, 387 S.E.2d at 470; <em>Raney </em>v. <em>Four Thirty Seven Land Company, </em>233 Va. 513, 519-20, 357 S.E.2d 733, 736 (1987); <em>Gaddess </em>v. <em>Norris, </em>102 Va. 625, 630, 46 S.E. 905, 907 (1904).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Applying that definition in our resolution of the issue posed in this appeal, we enquire who \u201chas an interest . . . which is likely either to be defeated or diminished\u201d by NuScope\u2019s claim against the bond. <em>Id. </em>Once Kane posted the bond, NuScope\u2019s security for the claim underlying its mechanic\u2019s lien became the bond and not the real estate. When NuScope filed its suit demanding payment on the bond, Kane, NuScope\u2019s debtor and principal on the bond, acquired \u201can immediate interest in resisting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>demand\u201d. <em>Id. </em>The same was true of Hartford Accident, the surety on the bond. Both were necessary parties to that suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">But once the encumbrance on Buckingham\u2019s property was released and replaced by a substitute security, the owner no longer had an interest in its property \u201clikely either to be defeated or diminished\u201d by NuScope\u2019s suit on the bond. While, as in <em>Mendenhall </em>and <em>Walt Robbins, </em>the beneficiary and the trustee of the construction deed of trust would have acquired such an immediate interest if NuScope had sued to enforce its mech\u00e1nic\u2019s lien by a judicial sale of the property encumbered by that deed of trust, neither had such an interest once the mechanic\u2019s lien was released and NuScope sued to enforce its claim against the substitute security.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Buckingham and the beneficiary and the trustee of the construction deed of trust were members of \u201c \u2018a class of persons having such relations to the matter in controversy, merely formal or otherwise, that, while they may be called proper parties, the court will take no account of the omission to make them parties\u2019 \u201d, <em>Bonsal, </em>111 Va. at 597, 69 S.E. at 978, <em>quoting Barney </em>v. <em>Baltimore City, </em>73 U.S. (6 Wall.) 280, 284 (1867); <em>accord, Mendenhall, </em>239 Va. at 74, 387 S.E.2d at 470. Although, in the interest of judicial economy, all three could have been joined as proper parties-defendant to NuScope\u2019s suit on the bond, we uphold the chancellor\u2019s ruling that all necessary parties were before the court, and we will affirm the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b524-7\"> The chancellor\u2019s ruling on NuScope\u2019s prayer for ancillary relief is not before us, and in-light of our resolution of the issue framed on appeal, we need not address other questions discussed on brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b524-8\"> <em>See also James T.
