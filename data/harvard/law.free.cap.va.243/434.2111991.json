On July 6, 1989, in the early morning hours, Officer B.R. Darden of the Falls Church City Police Department found the Defendant [John T. Stevenson] inside of a motor vehicle asleep, behind the steering wheel. The vehicle was located on a 7-11 parking lot in the City of Falls Church. The key was in the ignition but it was not recalled whether the key was in the \u201con\u201d or \u201coff\u2019 position. The engine of the motor vehicle, and all of its other mechanical and electrical parts were off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-12\">2. It was not known how the motor vehicle arrived at the parking lot, and how long it had been at that location.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>3. Officer Darden awoke the Defendant, at which time it became apparent to her that he was intoxicated, and Defendant stipulated that he was intoxicated at that time. She then placed him under arrest and subsequently obtained a warrant [that charged Stevenson with a violation of the City of Falls Church drunk driving ordinance].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Upon his conviction of drunk driving by the general district court, Stevenson appealed to the Circuit Court of Arlington County. In a bench trial, that court also found him guilty, and Stevenson appealed to the Court of Appeals. In an unpublished opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed the circuit court, holding that Stevenson was the \u201coperator\u201d of his car within the proscription of Code \u00a7 18.2-266 because he was \u201cin actual physical control of the motor vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Initially, we review several well-established legal principles before considering Stevenson\u2019s argument that the proof is insufficient to establish his \u201cactual physical control of a motor vehicle\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 46.1-1(17). Those principles are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">Penal statutes are to be strictly construed against the Commonwealth and in favor of the citizen\u2019s liberty. . . . Such statutes may not be extended by implication; they must be applied to cases clearly described by the language used. . . . And the accused is entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt about the construction of a criminal statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-7\"><em>Martin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 224 </em>Va. 298, 300-301, 295 S.E.2d 890, 892 (1982) (citations omitted). And, those principles apply to our constructions of penal ordinances. <em>See Rollins </em>v. <em>Town of Gordonsville, </em>216 Va. 25, 26, 215 S.E.2d 637, 638 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">On brief, the city argues that this Court has not adopted \u201ca bright line test that requires some part of the car to be in motion \u2014 either the key to be turned \u2018on\u2019, wires being connected, or some other action like putting the car in gear.\u201d Expanding upon this, the city contends that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-9\">It does not matter whether the motor is running or idle nor whether the drunk is in the front seat or the back seat. His potentiality for harm is lessened but not obviated by a silent motor or a back seat position, provided, of course, he is the one in control of the car. It takes only a flick of the wrist to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>start the motor or engage the gears, and it requires only a moment of time to get under the wheel from the back seat. A drunk in control of the motor vehicle has such a propensity to cause harm that the statute intended to make it criminal for him to be in a position to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">Thus, according to the city, if an intoxicated defendant is in the car with the means of starting the engine, or of operating its mechanical or electrical equipment, he is \u201cin actual physical control of a vehicle\u201d and, therefore, is its operator within the meaning of the Falls Church drunk driving ordinance. In essence, the city invites us to apply a part of the definitional language of Code \u00a7 46.1-1(17) disassociated from the ordinary meaning of the words \u201coperator\u201d or \u201cdriver.\u201d We decline the invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Instead, we construe the words \u201coperator\u201d and \u201cdriver\u201d in the statute according to their ordinary meaning, given the context in which they were used. <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 680, 684, 292 S.E.2d 348, 350 (1982). An \u201coperator\u201d is defined in pertinent part as \u201cone that produces a physical effect or engages himself in the mechanical aspect of any process or activity: as . . . one that uses or operates a machine or device . . . sometimes used to distinguish the user of fixed devices from the driver of automotive devices.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1581 (1986). A \u201cdriver\u201d is defined in pertinent part as \u201cone that drives something: as . . .a person in <em>actual physical control of a vehicle (as an automobile).\" Id. </em>at 692, 292 S.E.2d at 348 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">And, we have applied the ordinary meaning of these two words in our constructions of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-266 and 46.1-1(17). In three cases, we have held that a vehicle occupant was in \u201cactual physical control\u201d of the vehicle within the meaning of Code \u00a7 46.1-1(17) when he was seated behind the steering wheel <em>and </em>performed certain acts. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>City of Petersburg, </em>216 Va. 297, 301, 217 S.E.2d 893, 896 (1975) (ran engine and made \u201cmotion\u201d to gearshift); <em>Nicolls </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 257, 258, 184 S.E.2d 9, 10 (1971) (activated headlights and heater and ran engine with car in high gear but lack of fluid in transmission made car inoperable); <em>Gallagher </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>205 Va. 666, 670, 139 S.E.2d 37, 38 (1964) (accelerated engine with car in gear although car immobile because stuck in ditch).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>In <em>Williams, </em>quoting <em>Gallagher, </em>we pointed out that \u201coperating\u201d a vehicle within the proscription of the drunk driving statute</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-4\">not only includes the process of moving the vehicle from one place to another, but also includes <em>starting the engine, or manipulating the mechanical or electrical equipment of the vehicle without actually putting the car in motion. It means engaging the machinery of the vehicle which alone, or in sequence, will activate the motive power of the vehicle.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 300, 217 S.E.2d at 896 (emphasis added) (citation omitted). As we said in affirming the <em>Williams </em>conviction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">From all of these facts [the motor of the car was running, upon being aroused, the defendant made a \u201cmotion\u201d to the gearshift], the trial court could properly find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was in actual physical control of the vehicle and that he had engaged the machinery of the vehicle which alone, or in sequence, would have activated its motive power. Therefore, the defendant was \u201coperating\u201d the vehicle within the meaning of the ordinance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 301, 217 S.E.2d at 896.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">We adhere to our holding in <em>Williams </em>and apply it here. It was \u201cnot recalled whether the key was in the \u2018on\u2019 or \u2018off\u2019 position.\u201d And, on appeal, we must assume that the key was in the off position.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">Because the presence of the key in the ignition switch in the off position did not engage the mechanical or electrical equipment of Stevenson\u2019s car, Stevenson did not \u201cdrive or operate\u201d the car within the meaning of the statutes that were incorporated by reference in the Falls Church ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals affirming the conviction, dismiss the warrant, and enter final judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b453-13\"> On July 1, 1989, Code \u00a7 18.2-266 provided (and still provides) in pertinent part that \u201c[i]t shall be unlawful for any person to drive or <em>operate any </em>motor vehicle . . . while such person is under the influence of any . . . self-administered intoxicant.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b453-14\">On July 1, 1989, Code \u00a7 46.1-1(17), in pertinent part, defined a vehicle \u201c[ojperator\u201d or \u201cdriver\u201d as \u201c[e]very person who either (i) drives or is in actual physical control of a motor vehicle upon a highway.\u201d By an amendment effective October 1, 1989, that definition was recodified as a part of the definitions in Code \u00a7 46.2-100. Acts 1989, c. 727.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b455-7\"> <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Petersburg, </em>221 Va. 10, 266 S.E.2d 880 (1980), has little to do with the issue in this case. Here, we are concerned with the issue of the <em>extent </em>of the accused\u2019s activity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>necessary to constitute \u201cactual physical control\u201d of a vehicle. <em>Lyons </em>deals with the sufficiency of the circumstantial evidence necessary to establish that an accused had driven his vehicle into a parked car.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>JUSTICE COMPTON, with whom CHIEF JUSTICE CARRICO and JUSTICE HASSELL</author>\n<p id=\"Agtq\">join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">In my opinion, when a drunk is sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of a parked, operable motor vehicle, and he is alone and has inserted the key in the ignition switch, he is in \u201cactual physical control\u201d of the vehicle, within the settled meaning of that statutory term as articulated in every case previously decided by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The Court has rendered opinions in five prior cases dealing with this subject in the last 28 years: <em>Gallagher </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>205 Va. 666, 139 S.E.2d 37 (1964) (drunk sitting at steering wheel of car stuck in ditch with motor running); <em>Nicolls </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 257, 184 S.E.2d 9 (1971) (drunk \u201cslumped\u201d over steering wheel of inoperable vehicle with motor running); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Petersburg &amp; Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 297, 217 S.E.2d 893 (1975) (drunk \u201cslumped\u201d over steering wheel of vehicle stopped in parking lot with motor running); <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Petersburg, </em>221 Va. 10, 266 S.E.2d 880 (1980) (drunk found behind steering wheel of wrecked vehicle which had collided with another); and <em>Overbee </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 238, 315 S.E.2d 242 (1984) (conviction reversed when defendant found standing in front of vehicle with engine not running and key not in ignition). In each of those cases, the Court employed the statutory definition (not a dictionary definition) of the terms \u201coperator\u201d and \u201cdriver,\u201d found in former Code \u00a7 46.1-1(17) (1986 Repl. Vol.), now Code \u00a7 46.2-100. The Court was construing the word \u201coperate\u201d as used in the drunk-driving statute, Code \u00a7 18.2-266, which makes it unlawful for a person to \u201cdrive or operate\u201d a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">As pertinent, the statutory words \u201coperator\u201d and \u201cdriver\u201d mean \u201cevery person who . . . drives or is in actual physical control of a motor vehicle on a highway.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-100. The Court has followed the view that the term \u201coperate\u201d is not limited to the movement of the vehicle but includes a defendant who is \u201cin actual physical control\u201d of the vehicle. <em>Nicolls, </em>212 Va. at 259, 184 S.E.2d at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">The reason for this liberal interpretation of the words \u201coperate,\u201d \u201coperator,\u201d and \u201coperating\u201d is obvious. A motor vehicle is recognized in the law as a dangerous instrumentality when in the control of a sober person; in the control of a drunk, the dangerous instrumentality becomes lethal. Therefore, until now, the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>has interpreted the drunk-driving statute in a way that kept drunks from behind the steering wheels of motor vehicles, even when the drunk needed to \u201csleep it off.\u201d <em>See Williams, </em>216 Va. at 299, 217 S.E.2d at 895.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Ordinary experience tells us that one in a drunken stupor in the driver\u2019s seat of a vehicle is likely to arouse abruptly, engage the motive power of the vehicle, and roar away imperiling the lives of innocent citizens. This sequence of events easily can occur where, as here, a drunk is sitting behind the steering wheel of a motor vehicle alone, with the key already in the ignition. From a mechanical standpoint, the vehicle is \u201ccapable of being immediately placed in motion to become a menace to the public, and to its drunken operator.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301, 217 S.E.2d at 896.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The majority labors to distinguish this case from <em>Williams </em>by saying that Stevenson\u2019s ignition key may have been in the \u201coff\u201d position. Ergo, the majority says, the defendant was not in actual physical control of the vehicle, and he did not \u201coperate\u201d the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">That is a distinction which makes no difference whatever. A motor vehicle can be started as readily with an ignition key in the \u201coff\u201d position as it can when the key is in the \u201con\u201d position.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Consequently, I would affirm the conviction, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
