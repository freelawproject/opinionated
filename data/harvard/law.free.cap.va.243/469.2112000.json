(Thorncroft), executed an agreement referred to as an \u201cexclusive hunting lease\u201d with Management Enterprises, Inc. (Management Enterprises).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The agreement, among other things, gave Management Enterprises the right to hunt, fish, and trap on approximately 619 acres of Thorn-croft\u2019s property, commonly known as the West End Farm tract and the Magnolia Farm tract, located in Northumberland County. Thorncroft conducted farm operations on certain portions of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>The agreement is for a term of 32 years commencing on March 1, 1981, and terminating on February 28, 2013. The \u201crent\u201d during the term of the \u201chunting lease\u201d is $49,520, payable in annual installments of $1,547.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-3\">In October 1986, Thorncroft executed a contract to sell to Mill Creek Limited Partnership the West End Farm tract, which was encumbered by the \u201chunting lease.\u201d Henry G. Thorndike, a director and officer of Thorncroft, learned from a title examination that the \u201chunting lease\u201d had been recorded and was considered a potential cloud on the title to the property. The Partnership refused to close on the property until the encumbrance was removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">Thorncroft and Management Enterprises engaged in extensive negotiations. The negotiations culminated with a written release agreement in which Thorncroft agreed to pay Management Enterprises $15,000 for the release of its rights to use the West End Farm tract as permitted by the \u201chunting lease,\u201d subject to certain conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">In July 1989, Thorncroft filed a \u201cPetition for Rescission of Lease And For Other Relief\u201d in chancery. Thorncroft sought: rescission of the \u201chunting lease\u201d alleging fraud, undue influence, unconscionability, and breach of the \u201chunting lease\u201d; an adjudication that paragraph two of the \u201chunting lease\u201d provided for a three-month written notice for termination; an adjudication that the release is void and unenforceable because of fraud, misrepresentation, and duress, and that the $15,000 payment made pursuant to the release should be refunded; and compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">At the conclusion of a bench trial, the chancellor held, among other things, that Thorncroft could terminate the \u201chunting lease\u201d at any time upon three-months written notice and that Management Enterprises must return the $15,000 it received from Thorn-croft because the release agreement is unconscionable and, therefore, null and void. We awarded Management Enterprises an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Management Enterprises argues that the trial court erred in holding that Thorncroft had the right to terminate the \u201chunting lease\u201d at any time by giving a three-month written notice to Management Enterprises.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">Paragraph' two of the \u201chunting lease\u201d states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-9\">2. A WRITTEN NOTICE OF THREE MONTHS shall be given by the Lessee should he desire to vacate at the ter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>mination of the lease; and should the Lessor desire possession a like notice shall be required; in the event no such notice is given by either party, then the lease shall continue in force from year to year at the same rent and subject to all the conditions and covenants herein contained. But if such notice shall have been given by either party, the Lessor, his agents or assigns, may advertise the premises for rent in one or more conspicuous places and may show the premises to any person desiring to rent the same for the purposes of game management.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">We have consistently followed the \u201cplain meaning\u201d rule when construing written agreements.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">[Wjhere an agreement is complete on its face, is plain and unambiguous in its terms, the court is not at liberty to search for its meaning beyond the instrument itself .... This is so because the writing is the repository of the final agreement of the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-6\"><em>Berry </em>v. <em>Klinger, </em>225 Va. 201, 208, 300 S.E.2d 792, 796 (1983) (quoting <em>Globe Company </em>v. <em>Bank of Boston, </em>205 Va. 841, 848, 140 S.E.2d 629, 633 (1965)). We have defined \u201cambiguity\u201d as \u201cthe condition of admitting of two or more meanings, of being understood in more than one way, or of referring to two or more things at the same time.\u201d <em>Berry, 225 </em>Va. at 207, 300 S.E.2d at 796 (quoting Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 66 (1976)). Additionally, we must interpret the agreement as written and we are not free to rewrite its terms. <em>Graphic Arts Mutual Ins. </em>v. <em>C.W. Warthen Co., </em>240 Va. 457, 460, 397 S.E.2d 876, 877-78 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">The plain language contained in the notice provision unequivocally and clearly specifies that if the lessee, Management Enterprises, desires to vacate at the termination of the \u201chunting lease,\u201d then it must give written notice three months before the termination date, which is February 28, 2013. Additionally, the plain language of the \u201cagreement\u201d requires that the lessor, Thorn-croft, give written notice three months before the termination date if it desires to end the \u201chunting lease.\u201d If either party fails to give such written notice, then the \u201chunting lease\u201d continues from year to year subject to the same rent, conditions, and covenants. Thus, we hold that Thorncroft, if it desired to terminate the \u201chunting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>lease\u201d utilizing the notice provision, could do so only by giving written notice to Management Enterprises three months before the termination date.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-3\">Next, Management Enterprises argues that the trial court erred by holding that the release agreement is unconscionable and, therefore, null and void and that Thorncroft is entitled to recover the $15,000 payment made to Management Enterprises.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">We stated in <em>Smyth Brothers </em>v. <em>Beresford, </em>128 Va. 137, 104 S.E. 371 (1920), the principles that we apply when determining whether a contract is unconscionable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-5\">While the jurisdiction undoubtedly exists in the courts to avoid a contract on the ground that it makes an unconscionable bargain, nevertheless an inequitable and unconscionable bargain has been defined to be \u2018one that no man in his senses and not under a delusion would make, on the one hand, and as no fair man would accept, on the other.\u2019 The inequality must be so gross as to shock the conscience.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 170, 104 S.E. at 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">As we have already observed, the \u201chunting lease\u201d gave Management Enterprises the right to hunt, fish, and trap on Thorn-croft\u2019s property for 32 years. Additionally, the \u201chunting lease\u201d conferred upon Management Enterprises numerous other rights including: the right to chain, lock, erect barriers or other movement restrictors on the property; the right to erect blinds on the property; and, the right to use rights of way, roads, and low water boundaries. Thorncroft recognized that Management Enterprises would \u201cexpend substantial money and resources to develop and manage a game program on the [property].\u201d Also, Thorncroft agreed that it would not give permission to \u201cindividuals, groups of individuals, clubs or corporations to hunt, fish, or trap\u201d on the property during the term of the \u201chunting lease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Even though the trial court considered Thorncroft\u2019s payment of $15,000 to Management Enterprises in return for its release of these rights as exorbitant, the record does not reveal an inequality so gross as to shock the conscience. Accordingly, we hold that the release is not unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">In view of our holdings, we will reverse the judgment and remand the matter for further proceedings because the trial court did not decide whether Thorncroft was entitled to the remedy of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>rescission of the \u201chunting lease\u201d on the basis of fraud and duress as alleged in its pleadings. We decline to accept Management Enterprises\u2019 invitation to hold as a matter of law that Thorncroft is precluded from seeking rescission because of waiver and laches. Usually, proof of waiver is a question for the trier of fact, <em>Link Assoc. v. Jefferson Standard, </em>223 Va. 479, 485, 291 S.E.2d 212, 216 (1982), and \u201cwhether under the circumstances of a given case a claim is barred by laches is primarily a decision resting within the discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Mosby, </em>227 Va. 517, 521, 317 S.E.2d 493, 496 (1984). If Thorncroft is not entitled to rescission of the \u201chunting lease,\u201d then the release agreement shall be binding upon the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b488-14\"> Even though the agreement is referred to as an \u201cexclusive hunting lease,\u201d it is actually a license because it does not convey a possessory interest in the property. <em>Compare Bunn </em>v. Offutt, 216 Va. 681, 683, 222 S.E.2d 522, 525 (1976) (license); and <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Harry, </em>182 Va. 410, 414, 29 S.E.2d 231, 233 (1944) (lease). <em>See also Church </em>v. <em>Goshen Iron Co., </em>112 Va. 694, 696, 72 S.E. 685, 685-86 (1911) (lease and license distinguished).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
