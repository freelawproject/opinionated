Justice. On August 6, 1982, this judgment was docketed in the clerk\u2019s office of the Circuit Court of Wise County.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">In November 1982, LSC filed a suit in the Circuit Court of Wise County seeking to set aside Justice\u2019s allegedly fraudulent conveyance of land in Wise County to his mother. Before the circuit court could rule on the issue, Justice filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy relief. Justice was ultimately discharged from personal liability upon LSC\u2019s judgment by a March 30, 1983 order of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">Justice\u2019s trustee in bankruptcy sought to have the conveyance set aside as fraudulent in an adversary proceeding in the bank<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>ruptcy court. After a hearing on the merits, the trustee\u2019s action was dismissed. The record does not indicate whether this dismissal was appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">On February 1, 1991, pursuant to the provisions of Code \u00a7 8.01-455, Justice filed a motion to have LSC\u2019s judgment marked \u201cdischarged in bankruptcy.\u201d LSC opposed this motion on the grounds that its judgment was a lien upon any land Justice may have owned in Wise County at the time he filed his petition in bankruptcy, and that the trial court could not release its judgment lien in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Because it found that \u201cLSC can cite no . . . real property owned nor recorded by Justice in Wise County, [other than the property that the trustee unsuccessfully claimed was fraudulently conveyed],\u201d the circuit court held that \u201cno judgment lien ever attached.\u201d Therefore, the circuit court sustained Justice\u2019s motion and \u201cordered the judgment released.\u201d LSC appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">LSC\u2019s judgment was \u201ca lien on all the real estate of or to which [Justice] is or becomes possessed or entitled, from the time such judgment is recorded on the judgment lien docket of the clerk\u2019s office of the county . . . where such land is situated.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-458. That lien is imposed on all of Justice\u2019s real property interests in Wise County that were acquired after LSC\u2019s judgment was recorded, <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>157 Va. 178, 190, 160 S.E. 203, 206 (1931), but Justice\u2019s discharge in bankruptcy made LSC\u2019s lien ineffective as to any real property interests in Wise County that Justice acquired <em>after </em>the commencement of his bankruptcy proceedings, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524(a)(3) (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">However, Justice\u2019s discharge in bankruptcy would not prevent LSC from a post-discharge enforcement of its lien upon his Wise County real property interests that were acquired <em>before </em>the commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings. <em>Id:, </em>3 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00a7 524.01(3) (Lawrence P. King, ed., 15th ed. 1992). Here, LSC\u2019s judgment was recorded in Wise County <em>before </em>Justice filed his bankruptcy petition. Therefore, the judgment continued to be a lien on any interest Justice may have had in land in that county despite his bankruptcy discharge from personal liability for payment of the judgment. <em>Dockery </em>v. <em>Flanary, </em>194 Va. 318, 323, 73 S.E.2d 375, 378 (1952). Otherwise stated, LSC\u2019s judgment <em>lien </em>was not \u201cpaid off or discharged\u201d in Justice\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings. Accordingly, the trial court erred in ordering that the lien be released under the provisions of Code \u00a7 8.01-455.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Furthermore, the trial court erred in two additional respects. First, the trial court could only determine those issues set forth in the statutory authorization for a court-ordered release of liens upon property. <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>142 Va. 412, 416, 128 S.E. 445, 446 (1925). In <em>Wagner, </em>we held that a trial court could not adjudicate a collateral issue of whether the payment of insurance proceeds on the secured property to the trustee of the deed of trust constituted the payment of the deed of. trust where the proceeding was brought under the provisions of Code \u00a7 55-66.5. In pertinent part, Code \u00a7 55-66.5 authorized a trial court to order the release of a deed of trust \u201cupon proof that it has been paid or discharged.\u201d Thus, in this case, the trial court could only have ordered the release of LSC\u2019s <em>lien </em>in a Code \u00a7 8.01-455 proceeding upon proof that it had been \u201cdischarged in bankruptcy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Second, Justice has the burden of proof as to his entitlement to relief under Code \u00a7 8.01-455. <em>See Hall Bldg. Corp. </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>142 Va. 209, 211, 128 S.E. 521, 522 (1925) (burden of proof on proponent of release of deed of trust under the predecessor to Code \u00a7 55-66.5). Hence, the trial court erred in imposing the burden on LSC to show that Justice had property in Wise County that was subject to its lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">For all these reasons, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and will dismiss Justice\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b460-12\"> As pertinent, Code \u00a7 8.01-455(A) provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AT94\">[a] defendant in any judgment . . . may, on motion, after ten days\u2019 notice thereof to the plaintiff in such judgment, . . . apply to the court in which the judgment was rendered, to have the same marked satisfied, and upon proof that the judgment has been paid off or discharged, such court shall order such satisfaction to be entered on the margin of the page in the book wherein such judgment was entered. . . . Upon a like motion and similar proceeding, the court may order to be marked \u201cdischarged in bankruptcy,\u201d any judgment which may be shown to have been so discharged.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
