Code \u00a7 18.2-31(4). In the second phase, the jury fixed King\u2019s punishment at death, based upon both the predicates specified in Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2, which, in previous opinions, we have termed \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d and \u201cvileness.\u201d The jury also convicted King of robbery, two offenses of forgery, and two offenses of uttering, with punishment fixed at life imprisonment for robbery and ten years\u2019 imprisonment for each of the other four non-capital offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">After considering a post-sentence report prepared by a probation officer, Code \u00a7 19.2-264.5, the trial court imposed the sentences fixed by the jury. King is before this Court for automatic review of his death sentence, and we have consolidated that review with his appeal of his capital murder conviction. Code \u00a7 17-110.1. We have also certified from the Court of Appeals King\u2019s convictions for the non-capital offenses with which he was charged, Code \u00a7 17-116.06, and we have given the entire matter priority on our docket, Code \u00a7 17-110.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The record shows that on October 1, 1990, King was released on parole from imprisonment for a prior offense. On October 8, he and Becky Hodges King, with whom he had entered into a bigamous marriage in January of 1989, stole a van from a used car lot in Chesterfield County. They then travelled to the home of King\u2019s mother in Christiansburg, where Becky had been staying during King\u2019s imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">On October 11, King and Becky rode in the van to Roanoke and went to a residential area known as Kings Chase. As they drove around, Becky wrote on a yellow pad the names and telephone numbers of three real estate agents whose signs were displayed on vacant houses. Carolyn Horton Rogers was one of the agents whose name and telephone number Becky wrote down.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">From a nearby shopping center and at King\u2019s direction, Becky used the name \u201cMrs. Keaton\u201d and telephoned Ms. Rogers\u2019 office. She told the person who answered that \u201c[she and her husband] wanted to see a house in Kings Chase.\u201d When informed Ms. Rogers was not in, Becky placed a call to the Rogers home. Ms. Rogers agreed to show the house in Kings Chase, and she left home about 10:00 a.m. to keep the appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>When Ms. Rogers did not return home or appear at her office, her son and two of her co-workers began looking for her. About 5:00 p.m., one of the co-workers entered the vacant house Ms. Rogers had agreed to show and found her body in the basement furnace room, lying face down in a pool of blood. She had been beaten, choked, stomped upon, and stabbed. A ring and an earring had been forcibly removed from her body and were missing, along with other jewelry. Ms. Rogers\u2019 automobile was found at a nearby shopping mall.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">On the afternoon of the same day, three checks, forged by King and drawn on Ms. Rogers\u2019 account, were presented and cashed by Becky at Roanoke area banks. On the same afternoon, Becky pawned Ms. Rogers\u2019 ring at a local pawnshop.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Four days later, King and Becky were arrested in the stolen van in New Philadelphia, Ohio. At the time of his arrest, King spontaneously told Ohio police officers: \u201c[Becky] doesn\u2019t know anything about this. I\u2019m the one you want.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">On October 16, James R. Lavinder, a detective with the Roanoke County Police Department, travelled to Carroll County, Ohio, where King and Becky were being held in jail. Lavinder carried with him a warrant charging Becky with the capital murder of Ms. Rogers, and Becky was returned to Roanoke and held for trial on that charge. King was returned to Virginia separately, but as a parole violator. He was not charged with the Rogers murder until January 4, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">ADMISSIBILITY OF STATEMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">In a pretrial motion, King sought to suppress statements he claimed \u201cwere illegally obtained.\u201d After a hearing, the trial court denied the motion, finding that the statements were made voluntarily and that \u201cthere was a knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver [of counsel] as to those statements which [King] made.\u201d King contends the trial court erred in its denial of his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">King listed in the motion to suppress statements he allegedly made to the police in Ohio on October 16 and in Virginia on November 1 and 9.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> King argues that the statements should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>been suppressed because obtained in violation of <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477 (1981), which held that an accused who expresses \u201chis desire to deal with the police only through counsel ... is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him, unless the accused himself initiates further communications, exchanges, or conversations with the police.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">King first contends he was improperly questioned by Detective Lavinder in Ohio on October 16 after \u201c[he] indicated that he wanted to talk with an attorney.\u201d As a result, King says, all statements he made following this indication, not only in the October 16 incident but in all subsequent interrogations as well, should have been suppressed. However, in argument following the close of evidence at the suppression hearing, defense counsel did not once mention the October 16 incident. Instead, he argued it was \u201cclear that ... the request for counsel took place on <em>November </em>1st\u201d and that \u201cthe statements given by Mr. King during [the] period after he requested [an] attorney on <em>November 1 . . . </em>should be suppressed.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney responded to King\u2019s argument concerning the incidents occurring on November 1 and 9, and, understandably, neither the prosecutor nor the trial judge made any comment concerning the October 16 encounter. Under the circumstances, we think King has waived the point concerning the incident of October 16, and, accordingly, we will consider only the events of November 1 and 9. Rule 5:25. King contends that, on each of these dates, he was interrogated by police after he indicated he wished to consult an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">\n<em>The November 1 Incident</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">The evidence taken at the suppression hearing shows that after King was returned to Virginia from Ohio, he was held as a parole violator at the receiving unit of the Powhatan Correctional Center. On November 1, 1990, Detectives K. W. Kern and Philip ' Patrone of the Roanoke Police Department travelled to Powhatan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>to execute an order to take King\u2019s fingerprints and to collect hair and blood samples from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">The detectives were escorted to an interview room where King had been placed. Upon the officers\u2019 entrance, and before they \u201ceven had the opportunity to show him the Court Order,\u201d King asked what was taking them \u201cso long.\u201d When they said, \u201cso long for what,\u201d he responded, \u201cto drop warrants on me, you know [Becky] didn\u2019t have anything to do with this, she\u2019d follow a puppy dog.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Detective Kern then read King the <em>Miranda </em>warnings and explained to him the import of the court order requiring the taking of his fingerprints and the collection of hair and blood samples from him. Without any questioning by the detectives, King told them they would not \u201cfind anything,\u201d that he was \u201ctoo good.\u201d At this point, King said that he wanted to make a statement but that he would make the statement only \u201cone time\u201d and \u201cwanted a lawyer [for himself there], . . . wanted Becky\u2019s lawyers there, [and] wanted the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorneys [and Detectives Kern and Patrone] there.\u201d Kern explained that because King had not been charged with Ms. Rogers\u2019 murder, Kern did not \u201chave any way of appointing him [an attorney] at [that] particular time\u201d but that King could \u201cretain an attorney if he wanted to.\u201d Later on during the detectives\u2019 visit, King repeated his request for a group encounter with the same cast of characters.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Although the detectives did not ask. King any questions concerning the Rogers murder, King volunteered the statement that the detectives should be fingerprinting three other individuals, Thomas Carello, Dean Smith, and someone called \u201cHollywood.\u201d When Kern, \u201ctrying to identify who this person was,\u201d asked whether \u201cHollywood\u201d was black or white, King replied that he was a white male. Kern told King he knew that only three people, Ms. Rogers, Becky, and King, were in \u201cthat house\u201d at the time of the murder, to which King responded that he did not intend by naming other people to indicate \u201cthey had anything to do with this offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">King asked the detectives whether \u201cBecky had a boy friend,\u201d and Kern told him he \u201chad no knowledge of Becky having a boy friend.\u201d Finally, King made the statement that if the detectives ever saw Thomas Carello they should tell him King was \u201cgoing to kill him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>For several reasons, we reject King\u2019s argument that the circumstances of the November 1 encounter constituted a violation of the <em>Edwards </em>rule. First, at the time of the November 1 incident, King\u2019s right to counsel had not attached with respect to the murder of Ms. Rogers because \u201c \u2018adversary judicial proceedings\u2019 had not yet been initiated on that charge.\u201d <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 236, 252, 397 S.E.2d 385, 394 (1990) (quoting <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>475 U.S. 625, 629 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Second, we said in <em>Eaton </em>that a <em>clear </em>assertion of the right to counsel is necessary to invoke the <em>Edwards </em>rule. <em>Eaton, </em>240 Va. at 253-54, 397 S.E.2d at 395-96. Here, King\u2019s assertion of his right to counsel was equivocal, being couched in terms of his willingness to make a statement conditioned not only upon the presence of his own attorney but also the presence of a cast of characters having no discernible relevance to the traditional atmosphere of confidentiality in which an attorney and client consult with one another.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Third, the detectives\u2019 encounter with King on November 1 did not constitute an interrogation within the meaning of either <em>Miranda </em>or <em>Edwards. </em>Contrary to King\u2019s assertion on brief that \u201cthe real purpose [of the detectives\u2019 visit to Powhatan] was to elicit further statements from [King],\u201d the stated purpose of the visit, <em>viz., </em>to .execute the court order directing the detectives to obtain specific forensic samples from King, was entirely legitimate. The officers did not deviate from that purpose. Before they had time to tell King the purpose of their visit or to give him the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, he asked them what was taking them so long \u201cto drop the warrants\u201d on him, and he volunteered the statement that Becky \u201cdidn\u2019t have anything to do with this.\u201d The only question the detectives asked King during the ensuing conversation related, not to Ms. Rogers\u2019 murder, but to the identity of someone called \u201cHollywood,\u201d a person King conceded had nothing to do with the murder and whose name King introduced into the conversation himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">\n<em>The November 9 Incident</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">The evidence presented at the suppression hearing shows further that on November 9, Detectives King and Patrone again travelled to Powhatan, this time with a court order to transport King to Roanoke to obtain foot impressions and handwriting samples. When King was \u201cpicked up,\u201d he was advised of his \u201crights\u201d under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number><em>Miranda </em>and informed of the purpose of the trip. En route to Roanoke, the officers asked King \u201cno questions,\u201d and he \u201cmade no statements regarding [Ms. Rogers\u2019 murder].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">In Roanoke, plaster casts were made of King\u2019s feet for comparison, and handwriting samples were taken from him for analysis. On several occasions during these procedures, King asked the detectives \u201cwhat it was all about and what [they] hoped to gain by all of this.\u201d When the procedures were completed, King again asked, \u201cwhat\u2019s all this for?\u201d Kern responded that there was \u201ca lot of lab work that needed to be done.\u201d Whereupon, King said: \u201c[I]f you got questions, just ask me.\u201d The detectives proceeded to ask questions, and King proceeded to answer them.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">King told the detectives he did not kill Ms. Rogers but \u201cwas there and involved in what happened.\u201d He said he did not see Ms. Rogers killed and did not know who killed her, although he proclaimed Becky\u2019s innocence. He claimed that there was \u201ca contract on [Ms. Rogers],\u201d that he was supposed to get her \u201cin one of the three houses for sale in that area,\u201d and that the \u201cguy who picked up the contract was supposed to be in the house when [King and Becky] got there.\u201d King stated he had earlier made a telephone call in which he \u201cspoke with Dude, who carried the [contract],\u201d but when he and Becky arrived at the house, Ms. Rogers was there, but Dude \u201cwasn\u2019t in the residence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">At this point, King said he wanted to make a statement but wanted to make it in the presence of \u201can attorney for himself, somebody from the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office, and Becky . . . and Becky\u2019s lawyers.\u201d Detective Kern told King that \u201che was not in custody on these particular charges, [the police] had not obtained any warrants for him, [the] case was still under investigation, and if he wanted an attorney, he could hire an attorney, that [Kern] had no way of appointing him an attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">King then asked to meet immediately with a representative from the office of the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney, and Edwin R. Leach, an assistant prosecutor, was summoned to the jail. King was \u201cagain advised of <em>Miranda </em>rights.\u201d Without any further interrogation, King repeated \u201cthe same story\u201d he had just told the detectives, and \u201cthat was the end\u201d of the November 9 encounter.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">We reiterate here what we said previously about King\u2019s assertion of his right to counsel being equivocal because his willingness to make a statement was conditioned upon the presence not only of his own counsel but also of an irrelevant cast of char<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>acters. Furthermore, the <em>Edwards </em>rule is not violated if \u201cthe accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police.\u201d 451 U.S. at 485. By his questions to the detectives about why they were gathering evidence and especially by his statement, \u201cif you got questions, just ask me,\u201d King clearly initiated the exchange which produced the admissions about which he complains.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-4\">A defendant\u2019s waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights is valid only if the waiver is made knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently. <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 475. Whether a statement is voluntary is ultimately a legal rather than factual question. <em>See Miller </em>v. <em>Fenton, </em>474 U.S. 104, 110, 106 S.Ct. 445, 450 (1985). Subsidiary factual questions, however, are entitled to a presumption of correctness. <em>Id. </em>at 112, 106 S.Ct. at 451. The test to be applied in determining voluntariness is whether the statement is the \u201cproduct of an essentially free and unconstrained choice by its maker,\u201d or whether the maker\u2019s will \u201chas been overborne and his capacity for self-determination critically impaired.\u201d <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 225 (1973). In determining whether a defendant\u2019s will has been overborne, courts look to \u201cthe totality of all the surrounding circumstances,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 226, including the defendant\u2019s background and experience and the conduct of the police, <em>Correll </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>232 Va. 454, 464, 352 S.E.2d 352, 357 (1987); <em>Stockton </em>[v. <em>Commonwealth], </em>227 Va. [124,] 140, 314 S.E.2d [371,] 381 <em>[cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 873 (1984)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-5\"><em>Gray </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>233 Va. 313, 324, 356 S.E.2d 157, 163, <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 873 (1987). Applying these standards, we think the evidence fully supports the trial court\u2019s finding that King\u2019s statements were voluntary and that \u201cthere was a knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver [of counsel] as to those statements which he made.\u201d Accordingly, we will not disturb the finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">SUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE OF GUILT</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">King contends the evidence is insufficient to show that he, rather than Becky, was the killer. Alternatively, he contends the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>evidence is insufficient to establish that the killing was premeditated. We reject both propositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">In addition to the evidence previously recited, the record shows that King and Becky met Ms. Rogers at the vacant house in Kings Chase and introduced themselves as \u201cDanny and Becky Keaton.\u201d Ms.. Rogers showed them through the house, and the three of them eventually reached the basement. There, Becky asked King for a cigarette. He said he did not have any, and he suggested she get one from their van. Becky left and was gone \u201ca few minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">What happened after Becky left was disclosed by the testimony of Vincent Austin Lilley, one of the attorneys appointed to represent Becky on her capital murder charge. On November 2, 1990, Lilley accepted a collect telephone call from King, who was calling from the Powhatan Correctional Center. King told Lilley that \u201c[t]his thing with Becky is insane . . . because [she] did not do what she\u2019s charged with.\u201d When Lilley pointed out that Becky had cashed Ms. Rogers\u2019 checks and that the police had Becky \u201con film doing that,\u201d King said \u201cshe cashed checks because if she wouldn\u2019t have, [he] would have broken her damn neck, or she believed that.\u201d King asked Lilley to visit him, saying that what he wanted to talk with Lilley about \u201cis the fact that [he, King, was] the one that should be charged with it.\u201d Lilley agreed to visit King, and he went to the correctional center on November 6 for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">On that date, King told Lilley that he was a member of \u201ca Hell\u2019s Angels . . . motorcycle gang\u201d and that Ms. Rogers\u2019 killing was a contract killing, a murder for hire, that was set up before he got out of the penitentiary. He said \u201ca guy named Smoky\u201d contacted him after his release from prison and asked for his help with \u201ca hit.\u201d Smoky knew Ms. Rogers was a real estate agent and he wanted to have her show a vacant house because she was \u201cthe focus of this murder for hire.\u201d Smoky \u201chad [already] been paid.\u201d However, Ms. Rogers was supposed to have at least $1,000 in her checking account and King \u201ccould get whatever he wanted off of Mrs. Rogers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">The plan was to have Becky call Ms. Rogers to arrange the meeting at the vacant house. King boasted to Lilley that he owned Becky, that she was his \u201cproperty,\u201d and that \u201c[if he] told her to do something, that was it.\u201d Lilley asked King how he knew Becky \u201cdidn\u2019t kill Ms. Rogers.\u201d At that point, King \u201ctook a little piece <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>of paper . . . and he wrote ... in capital letters I D-I-D . . . and . . . he said, I did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">According to the plan, Smoky was supposed to \u201ccome creeping down the stairs and get in the basement,\u201d then King was to get Ms. Rogers to the basement and \u201cknock her out to the point of unconsciousness,\u201d after which Smoky would \u201ctake her to another place and complete the contract killing.\u201d King told Lilley he did strike and choke Ms. Rogers until she was unconscious, but he did not stab her. Smoky appeared from the garage area and told King: \u201c[T]hat\u2019s good enough. You\u2019ve done your part.\u201d The last thing King saw was Smoky pulling Ms. Rogers\u2019 sweater \u201cup over her head.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">On December 6, Lilley, accompanied by John Gregory, Jr., Becky\u2019s co-counsel, and George Harris, III, Lilley\u2019s investigator, again visited King, this time at the Buckingham Correctional Center. After going over some forms with King, Lilley was about to introduce Gregory and Harris when King \u201cjust burst out, let\u2019s cut the b_s_, I stabbed Carolyn Rogers to death. Becky had nothing to do with it. Now, what do you want to know?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">King reiterated that Ms. Rogers\u2019 death was a result of a contract killing, and he described how a contract killing is arranged. He went on to say that after Becky left to get a cigarette from the van, he asked Ms. Rogers \u201csome question . . . and at that point he took his fist and hit her [on] the left side of her face.\u201d He continued striking her and then choked her and threw her against the basement wall. When she started falling to the floor, he grabbed her by the throat, \u201csqueezed very, very hard,\u201d and threw her to the floor. Ms. Rogers was \u201csemi-conscious [and] moaning\u201d and he grabbed her at the waist. When he pulled on her limp body, \u201ca sweater type ... of thing . . . came up, and ... he could see her brassiere.\u201d She must have thought he was going to rape her because \u201call of a sudden she reached . . . upward into his groin area . . . and squeezed hard.\u201d He then removed a knife from his boot and thrust it \u201cin an upward fashion . . . into her chest and that was how he killed her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">King directed Becky to drive Ms. Rogers\u2019 car to a nearby shopping mall and said he would be right behind her. When King reached the mall, he \u201cwiped down\u201d Ms. Rogers\u2019 car to remove any fingerprints. He and Becky then left the mall in the van and thereafter cashed the checks forged on Ms. Rogers\u2019 account and pawned the ring stolen from her.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>At trial, King took the witness stand in his own behalf. In contradiction of almost everything he had said earlier, he testified that the reason for the meeting at the vacant house was \u201c[s]o that Becky could get the money [Ms. Rogers] owed her\u201d for an outstanding drug bill. He claimed that Ms. Rogers had agreed to pay the bill for her son.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He said that when Becky returned from getting a cigarette, she conversed with Ms. Rogers some five or six feet away from where he stood. Becky then told him Ms. Rogers had said \u201cthe money is in the damn bank, she can\u2019t get it out because if she writes the check her husband is going to realize the money is gone [and] would be [angry].\u201d King said \u201cwell, [if] she thinks he\u2019s going to be [angry], watch this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">King \u201cwalked by [Ms. Rogers] and . . . turned around and . . . grabbed her . . . with [his] left arm around [her] neck and . . . swung her around to where her head hit the wall.\u201d He continued striking her and shoving her into the wall until \u201cshe quit trying to get up.\u201d He then went upstairs \u201c[t]o go through [Ms. Rogers\u2019] pocketbook,\u201d found her checkbook, \u201cstarted writing checks [and] wrote out three.\u201d Hearing a noise downstairs, he returned to the basement and found Becky \u201cstanding there with a knife in her hand and [Ms. Rogers] laying over against the other wall [with] blood coming [from] her stomach.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">King testified that to \u201cmake it look like somebody robbed [Ms. Rogers],\u201d he pulled a necklace from her neck. He denied, however, that he removed other items of jewelry.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">King denied stabbing Ms. Rogers, and he said he told Lilley he had stabbed her because he thought it was \u201cthe only way to save [Becky] from the electric chair.\u201d He admitted writing to Becky, however, and telling her that she was innocent and that he would not see \u201cthem punish [her] for nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">An autopsy revealed that Ms. Rogers had been stabbed twice in the chest. One stab wound went through the skin and struck a rib. The second went into the chest itself and through the lung, cutting at least one of the major coronary arteries and continuing all the way through the chest and terminating \u201cright beneath the skin.\u201d This second wound was fatal and, in the opinion of the medical examiner, could have been inflicted by a knife with a serrated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>edge. A knife with a serrated edge was found in the van occupied by King and Becky when they were arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Ms. Rogers\u2019 body bore bruises in \u201ca horseshoe pattern\u201d on the back of the head. An impressions expert determined that at least six impressions on the back of Ms. Rogers\u2019 head were made by the heels of King\u2019s boots or others exactly like them.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Other bruises found on the body were consistent with a blow from a blunt object such as a board or with the victim being \u201cslammed\u201d into a board, wall, or floor. Deep scratches or claw marks on the neck, consistent with finger nail marks, indicated the victim had been choked. Bruises on the left ring finger and right ear were consistent with the forcible removal of a ring and an earring, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">King argues that the evidence \u201cshows a situation where both [King and Becky] were equally involved in setting up the fatal encounter and willingly participating in it.\u201d Hence, King says, \u201cthe evidence left the ultimate question of who inflicted the fatal wound very much open to uncertainty and speculation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">When, however, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, as we must, there remains no uncertainty or speculation about the proposition that King was the \u201ctrigger man\u201d in the murder of Ms. Rogers. The jury was free to reject King\u2019s trial testimony that Becky stabbed Ms. Rogers and to accept, instead, his earlier statement made to the Ohio police that he was the one they wanted, his written \u201cI did [it]\u201d admission made to Lilley, and his \u201ccut the b_ s_, I stabbed Carolyn Rogers to death\u201d confession made to Lilley, Gregory, and Harris.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">At all times except his latter-day assertion at trial that Becky did the stabbing, King protested Becky\u2019s innocence vehemently, both orally and in writing. All in all, we think the evidence overwhelmingly establishes that it was King, and not Becky, who inflicted Ms. Rogers\u2019 fatal wound.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">We can make much the same observation about the evidence of premeditation. In the first place, if, as King asserted more than once, Ms. Rogers\u2019 killing was a murder-for-hire, the element of premeditation would have been conclusively established. But aside from that, the record shows beyond doubt that King, a much larger person than the victim and armed with a knife concealed in his boot, lured Ms. Rogers to an empty house with the motive to rob her and for the purpose of concealing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>crime and the victim until he could escape. He then made a viciously brutal attack upon her, including striking and stomping her repeatedly and stabbing her twice with a knife. Leaving her dead in a pool of blood, he \u201cwiped down\u201d her car to remove evidence that would link him to the victim, calculatingly cashed in on the fruits of his crime, fled the state, and then, unremorsefully, pointed the finger of guilt at a woman he professed to love.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">In <em>Epperly </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 214, 294 S.E.2d 882 (1982), we said that in determining whether premeditation and deliberation exist, the jury may consider several factors: (1) \u201cthe brutality of the attack, and whether more than one blow was struck\u201d; (2) \u201cthe disparity in size and strength between the defendant and the victim\u201d; (3) \u201cthe concealment of the victim\u2019s body\u201d; and (4) \u201cthe defendant\u2019s lack of remorse and [his] efforts to avoid detection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 232, 294 S.E.2d at 892-93. We also noted in <em>Epperly </em>that \u201c[w]hile motive is not an essential element of the crime, it is relevant and often most persuasive upon the question of the actor\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>Id., </em>294 S.E.2d at 893.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">All these factors, including motive, are present in the instant case. Accordingly, we hold that the evidence amply supports the jury\u2019s finding that the killing of Ms. Rogers was deliberate and premeditated.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">PAROLE ELIGIBILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">King contends the trial court erred in refusing to admit testimony in the sentencing phase of the trial which would have shown that he would not be eligible for parole until he had served at least thirty years of a life sentence. Citing <em>Skipper </em>v. <em>South Carolina, </em>476 U.S. 1 (1986), King argues that such testimony constitutes evidence which might serve \u201c \u2018as a basis for a sentence less than death.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5 (quoting <em>Lockett </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>438 U.S. 586, 604 (1978)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Refusal to admit the testimony, King maintains, was violative of art. I, \u00a7 8 of the Virginia Constitution, Va. Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4 (evidence which may be admissible in capital case includes facts in mitigation of offense), and the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>In an unbroken line of capital cases beginning with <em>Stamper </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 260, 278, 257 S.E.2d 808, 821 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 972 (1980), and continuing to <em>Yeatts </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>242 Va. 121, 126-27, 410 S.E.2d 254, 257-58 (1991), this Court has held that parole is not a proper matter for consideration by a jury. King, however, cites a number of our previous decisions and states that, in each, \u201cthe parole evidence ruled inadmissible was the defendant\u2019s eligibility for parole at some future unspecified date.\u201d Here, King says, he sought to present \u201cevidence of parole ineligibility.\u201d He asserts there is \u201ca critical distinction to be made between . . . telling a Jury that the Defendant might be released on parole at some future unspecified time and telling a jury that under no circumstances could the Defendant be considered for parole for at least thirty (30) years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">We disagree both with King\u2019s analysis of our previous decisions and his argument concerning a distinction between parole eligibility and parole ineligibility. In several of the cases cited by King, the defendants sought to place the question of parole ineligibility before the jury. For example, in <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 341, 385 S.E.2d 50 (1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>494 U.S. 1074 (1990), \u201cdefense counsel requested the [trial] court\u2019s permission to \u2018discuss with the jury the parole eligibility for [his] client so that they would know he would be in the penitentiary for a minimum ... of twenty years.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 351, 385 S.E.2d at 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The defendant in <em>Watkins </em>invited this Court to change its position on the question of the propriety of evidence or instructions \u201cinforming the jury of a defendant\u2019s parole eligibility in the event of a life sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court said it would \u201cdecline the invitation,\u201d and we reaffirm that decision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">PASSION AND PREJUDICE \u2014 EXCESSIVENESS AND DISPROPORIONALITY</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">In a capital case, this Court is required to consider and determine whether \u201cthe sentence of death was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor,\u201d Code \u00a7 17-110.1(C)(1), and whether \u201cthe sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant,\u201d Code \u00a7 17-110.1 (C)(2). King\u2019s entire argument on these matters is quoted from his brief as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>The penalty of death was excessive in this case in light of King\u2019s lack of prior record of violence and criminal conduct which resulted in injury to others. In addition, King\u2019s prison record reflected that he had adjusted fairly well to prison life and was not a future threat to society. [<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-4\">King\u2019s co-defendant, Becky Hodges King, received five consecutive twelve month sentences as a result of her involvement in the cases at issue herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-5\">The gross disparity between the sentence imposed upon King\u2019s co-defendant, Becky Hodges King, underscores the excessiveness of the Jury\u2019s verdict in this case and clearly supports the conclusion that the Jury\u2019s recommendation of death in this case was the result of passion, prejudice [or] other arbitrary factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The evidence submitted at the sentencing hearing shows that prior to 1976, King\u2019s criminal record consisted of a conviction for contributing to the delinquency of a minor. In 1976, he was arrested in Buckingham County for carrying a concealed weapon when he was found with a .25 caliber automatic pistol on his person, \u201cfully loaded, [with] one in the chamber.\u201d He was convicted of the weapons charge, but a companion offense of possession of stolen property was nolle prossed when it was discovered he was involved in more serious offenses in Powhatan County.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">In the latter county, King was charged with the 1975 robbery of the Bank of Powhatan. In that case, King abducted the bank manager at the point of a gun and forced him to drive King from the scene of the robbery to an isolated location. As a result of this incident, King was convicted and sentenced for robbery, abduction, and the use of a firearm in the commission of robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">King was also found guilty of several parole violations. One instance involved assault and destruction of property charges, while others concerned traffic offenses and technical violations of parole rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>In 1990, King was convicted of bigamy. This conviction was based upon his marriage to Becky in January of 1989 while still married to another woman.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">The record shows further that King was involved in certain unadjudicated criminal conduct. In 1976, he and two other men planned to rob a bank in Chesterfield County, and they made a fake bomb to use in forcing their way into the bank. King carried a .32 caliber pistol with him on the trip to rob the bank, but the trio abandoned the criminal scheme when \u201can armoured truck pulled up [with] five security guards in it, and [King] got scared.\u201d King later threatened to kill one of his co-conspirators in the frustrated bank robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">While imprisoned for the Powhatan bank robbery, King induced a girl friend to make drug deliveries to him in the penitentiary. He and another inmate acquired prescription forms, the other inmate filled them out, and King gave them to his girl friend to be filled.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">During January 1989, King and Becky went to the home of his legal wife, Gail King. King \u201cknocked [the] door in[,] jerked the phone out of the wall[,] threatened [Gail with] a pistol [and] shot it up in the air.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">During various periods of incarceration under the supervision of the Virginia Department of Corrections, King was found guilty of several institutional violations. These included unauthorized possession of United States currency in 1978, refusal to work, possession of drug paraphernalia, and possession of intoxicants in 1981, possession of marijuana in 1990, and being under the influence of intoxicants in 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">Finally, while a trusty at the Franklin County jail in 1982, King was convicted of four offenses of petit larceny. Each offense consisted of the theft of county property having a value of less than $200.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">We think this evidence belies King\u2019s assertion that he lacks a record of violent criminal conduct, contradicts his claim that he adjusted to prison life to the extent that he did not constitute a future threat to society, and, hence, negates two of the legs upon which he bases his charge of excessiveness. The other leg, <em>viz., </em>that a comparison of King\u2019s sentence with the punishment imposed upon Becky establishes the excessiveness and disproportionality of his death sentence, is one upon which King simply cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>A similar claim of excessiveness and disproportionality based upon disparity of a confederate\u2019s sentence was made and rejected in <em>Stamper </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra. </em>There, this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-5\">We cannot fairly determine whether a death sentence is excessive or disproportionate by comparing it with sentences imposed upon convictions [of a confederate] for lesser included offenses, reached perhaps by compromise verdicts, even where there may be similarities in the evidence. The test is not whether a jury may have declined to recommend the death penalty in a particular case but whether generally juries in this jurisdiction impose the death sentence for conduct similar to that of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">220 Va. at 283-84, 257 S.E.2d at 824.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Nor does the disparity in sentences involved in this case demonstrate, as King argues, that his sentence was \u201cthe result of passion, prejudice [or] other arbitrary factors.\u201d While Becky initially was charged with capital murder, she was not tried for that offense but for first degree murder, and she was convicted as an accessory after the fact. Any comparison qf King\u2019s sentence with hers, therefcre, wculd amcunt tc a ccmparison of apples and oranges.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">But, aside from what King argues, our independent examination of the record reveals nothing to indicate that the jury\u2019s sentence of death was the result of passion, prejudice, or other arbitrary factor, Code \u00a7 17-110.1(C)(1), or that the sentence is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant, Code \u00a7 17-110.1(C)(2). On the subject of proportionality, the test, as indicated in <em>Stamper, </em>is whether juries in this jurisdiction generally impose the death sentence for criminal conduct similar to that of the particular defendant whose case is being reviewed. 220 Va. at 283-84, 257 S.E.2d at 824.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">In making our proportionality review in a case where, as here, the jury has found the existence of both the \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d and \u201cvileness\u201d predicates, we review the records of all capital murder cases previously reviewed by this Court in which the death sentence was based upon both predicates. After considering those records, as well as cases where life imprisonment was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>imposed, we have no hesitancy in saying that King\u2019s death sentence is not disproportionate to sentences generally imposed by other sentencing bodies in this jurisdiction. <em>See George </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>242 Va. 264, 284-85, 411 S.E.2d 12, 24 (1991), for a collection of the previous cases involving imposition of the death sentence based upon both \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d and \u201cvileness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AL9\">Finding no error in any of the rulings questioned by King and no other reason to disturb the sentence of death, we will affirm each of the five convictions and sentences involved in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b375-10\"> King also listed in his motion to suppress a \u201c[statement taken November 2, 1990 . . . while Defendant was in custody of Virginia authorities.\u201d King concedes on brief, however, that he initiated the conversation of November 2 and that \u201c[njothing germane to the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>stant offenses was said in this conversation.\u201d Hence, we will not again mention the November 2 conversation in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">Further, King argues on appeal that a statement he made to the police on October 18, 1990, should have been suppressed. However, King failed to list this statement in his motion to suppress and did not include it in his argument at the suppression hearing. Hence, King has waived the point concerning the October 18 statement.
