If an attachment in another State may be pleaded in abatement, the defense as pleaded was insufficient, in that it was not. alleged that the seizure under the attachment was made before the commencement of the present action, or that it was still in force, or that the property attached was sufficient to satisfy any judgment that might be obtained in Maine (Citing Hadden <em>v. </em>St. Louis Iron Mountain, etc., 57 <em>How. Pr. </em>390; Marsh <em>v. </em>West Bradley and Cary M\u2019f\u2019g <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>Co., 46 <em>Super. Ct. </em>8; Douglass <em>v. </em>Phenix Nat.

The pendency of another action for the same cause \u2022of action cannot be pleaded in abatement, or as a bar where such suit is in the court of another State or of the United States; and the mere fa.ct that an attachment has been made in such an action, so long as it is not a foreign attachment or garnishment, can make no difference (Citing Bowne <em>v. </em>Joy, 9 <em>Johns. </em>221; Maul <em>v. </em>Murray, 7 <em>Term R. </em>470; Walsh <em>v. </em>Durkin, 12 <em>Johns. </em>100; Burrows <em>v. </em>Miller, 5 <em>How.

Though the mere pendency in another \u2022State of an action for the same cause between the same parties may not be a defense, yet when the pendency of such an action is pleaded with the additional fact of an \u2022attachment by plaintiff of defendant\u2019s, property, it is a good defense.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b187-18\">As to this question, see note in 26 <em>Abb N. C. </em>218.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b189-7\">Pryor, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Anz\">When a superior court exercises statutory powers in accordance with the customary form of common law or chancery procedure, the usual presumption as to its jurisdiction is entertained ; but when those powers are to be exercised in a special or summary manner, the record must show that the court had jurisdiction and proceeded in the way prescribed by the statute (12 <em>Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, </em>276; Ferguson <em>v. </em>Crawford, 70 <em>N. Y. </em>253, 259; Embury <em>v. </em>Connor, 3 <em>Id. </em>511, 522; Galpin <em>v. </em>Page, 18 <em>Wall, </em>350; Haywood <em>v. </em>Collins, 60 <em>Ill. </em>328). The process \u25a0of attachment is the creature of statute and subsists only in conformity with the statutory regulation <em>(Drake on Attachment, </em>\u00a7 83; <em>Waples on Attachment, </em>24; Haywood v. Collins, <em>supra). </em>\u2022 Hence, a plea of a pending attachment in a foreign jurisdiction must allege the 'statute by author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>ity of which it issues and exhibit the proceedings at large, \u201c that it may be seen that the right to attach the debt existed and that the law has been strictly pursued \u201d (Crawford <em>v. </em>Clute, 41 <em>Am. Dec. </em>92, 93; Wheeler <em>v. </em>Raymond, 8 <em>Cowen, </em>315, <em>note; </em>Holmes <em>v. </em>Broughton, 10 <em>Wend. </em>77; <em>Drake on </em>Attachment, \u00a7 705). The strictness of the former practice in pleading a dilatory defense still prevails (White <em>v. </em>Miller, 7 Hun, 427; Wigand <em>v. </em>Sickel, 3 <em>Keyes, </em>120).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Reciting nothing more than that in an action in the Supreme Court of Maine the plaintiff attached the defendant\u2019s property, the.plea in controversy is obviously invalid. The allegation of the attachment is but the statement of a legal conclusion, and so is not admitted by the demurrer (Douglas <em>v. </em>Phenix Ins. Co., 63 <em>Hun, </em>393, 398; aff\u2019d 138 <em>N. Y. </em>209).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Again, it is not apparent that the attachment in Maine-issued before the commencement of this action ; nor that the attachment is now pending; nor that the property attached is equivalent in value to the plaintiff\u2019s demand \u2014all which allegations are essential to the sufficiency of the plea (Hadden <em>v. </em>St. Louis Iron Mountain, etc., 57 <em>How. Pr. </em>390; Hecker <em>v. </em>Mitchell, 5 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>453,454; Marsh <em>v. </em>West Bradley &amp; Cary M\u2019f\u2019g Co., 46 <em>Super. Ct. </em>8; Embree <em>v. </em>Hanna, 5 <em>Johns. </em>101; Wheeler <em>v. </em>Raymond, 8 <em>Cow. </em>311).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Since, in any event, the order overruling the demurrer must be reversed, it is not necessary to consider the defense which the plea essays to interpose; but as, doubtless, if not determined now, the question involved will be presented again by an amended answer, we may properly dispose of it on the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">The question is whether the pendency of an attachment in an action in another State is pleadable in abatement of a subsequent action in this State by the same plaintiff for the same cause against the same defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">That the mere pendency of an action in another juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>diction will not abate an action here for the same cause between the same parties is settled beyond dispute (Douglas <em>v. </em>Phenix Ins. Co., 138 <em>N. Y. </em>209, 218). Why, then, should the added incident of an attachment work that result ?</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">\u201cA plaintiff is entitled to all the remedies provided by law for the collection of his debt, and need not be satisfied until he has had .such a judgment as will bind the defendant individually \u201d (Oneida County Bank <em>v. </em>Bonney, 101 <em>N. Y. </em>173, 175). The suit in Maine, not being an action <em>in </em>personam, cannot issue in a judgment binding upon the defendant and available to the plaintiff beyond the appropriation of the property attached (Cooper <em>v. </em>Reynolds, 10 <em>Wall, </em>368; Douglas <em>v. </em>Phenix Ins. Co., <em>supra). </em>Hence, the remedy by the suit in Maine is not commensurate with the remedy in the present action, and upon principle, therefore, the plaintiff should not be compelled to forego a complete for a partial redress.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Moreover, the rights secured by an attachment being provisional and contingent on a recovery by the plaintiff, it follows that a final judgment for the defendant <em>ipso facto </em>vacates the attachment, and restores the parties to their original condition before the service of the writ (Franklin Bank <em>v. </em>Bachelder, 39 <em>Am. Dec. </em>601, 609). And, pending the action, the inchoate lien of the attachment may be lost by a dissolution of the process for anyone of many causes (7 <em>Lawson's Rights, </em>etc., \u00a7\u00a7 3580-3589). Plainly, so precarious and inadequate a remedy as an attachment affords should not deprive the creditor of the security of a judgment conclusive of his claim, operative <em>in personam </em>and available always and everywhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">How stands the question upon authority?</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">Not a solitary decision, or dictum even, is cited to sustain the proposition that an attachment merely is a good plea in abatement. The adjudication below proceeds on the assumption of an analogy between garnishment and attachment; but the argument is fallacious.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Garnishment of the debt by a third person is pleadable in abatement of a suit by the creditor, because otherwise the garnishee might be subjected to a double recovery (Embree <em>v. </em>Hanna, 5 <em>Johns. </em>101). But the attachment before us \u201c is not analogous to the case of the pendency of a prior foreign attachment .by a third person, for here the defendant would not be obliged to pay the money twice, since payment at least, if not a recovery in one suit, might be pleaded <em>puis darrein continuance </em>to the other suit; and if the two suits should even proceed <em>pari passzc </em>to judgment and execution, a satisfaction of either judgment might be shown upon <em>audita querela </em>or otherwise in discharge of the other\u201d (Bowne <em>v. </em>Joy, 9 <em>Johns. </em>221; Trubee <em>v. </em>Alden, 6 <em>Hun, </em>75, 78).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Indeed, upon application by the defendant, trial of the second suit may be stayed until the determination of the first (Douglas <em>v. </em>Phenix Ins. Co., 138 <em>N. Y. </em>218), and an attachment in the second may be denied because of an attachment in the first (Trubee <em>v. </em>Alden, 6 <em>Hun, </em>75). It is, then, an illusory apprehension that, unless the plea in abatement be allowed, a defendant may be harassed by concurrent attachments in every State of the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">The defense interposed is insufficient in substance (Woodruff, J., in Hecker <em>v. </em>Mitchell, 5 <em>Abb. </em>Pr. 453, 454), and the demurrer should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">So much of the order and judgment as plaintiff appeals from reversed, and judgment ordered for plaintiff upon his demurrer, with costs in both actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">Daly, C. J., and BlSCHOFF, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
