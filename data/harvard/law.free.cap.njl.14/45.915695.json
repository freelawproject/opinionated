King, on a promissory note, executed by Walker to the said King, payable at the Chemical Bank of New York, and endorsed by the said King to the plaintiffs. The cause was tried at the Essex Circuit, before Justice Drake, and a verdict rendered for the plaintiffs. Several points were raised at the trial, which were again argued at bar on the return of the postea, and on the rule to shew cause why the verdict should not be set aside.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b55-9\">Dickerson, in support of the rule insisted,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Av\">that the judge, who tried the cause, erred in charging the jury, that putting the notice of protest in the post-office, was sufficient, even if the letter was detained, as was proved by the witnesses of the defendant.

The error could not have arisen by careless writing, for the mark is impressed entirely with types. A question was thoroughly discussed at the trial, whether this post mark had not been altered, by taking out the figure one in eighteen, and-inserting the figure two in its place, thus ehang-' ing the eighteen into twenty-eight. We cannot say that skill is incompetent to make such an alteration, by the application of another type. The probability of such alteration having been made, was fortified by the evidence of the Newark postmaster; who was of opinion that the mark is not genuine ; that its appearance differs from any office mark he ever saw before; that in the word twenty-eight, the figure two is done by a smaller type that the figure eight; and it was his belief that the two figures were not made at the same time; indeed, he thinks they are not the same shade of ink. The jury had the inspection of the instrument, and must have believed that the mark made by the post-office was eighteen, and not twenty-eight. The memorandum made by the. postmaster of Patterson, that the letter was received at his office on the 29th of the month, was not made till many days after that date, and if the post mark had been altered to the twenty-eighth, before he saw it, after delivery, it would naturally mislead him as to the time of being received. The verdict is founded on the date of the notice, and the positive oath of the notary, that he put it in the office on the eighteenth; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>as the contrary proof consists in circumstances which are full of mystery and uncertainty, the opinion of the jury is neither against evidence, nor the weight of it, sufficiently at all events to justify us in setting aside the verdict on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">But another objection is taken to the verdict. The note being protested 011 the 17th of October, notice was required by law to be given of it the <em>next day, </em>which was the eighteenth, on which day the mail closed at half past eight in the morning, and there was no evidence of notice being put in the post-office till <em>after </em>that hour; the notary swore heputitin the post-office that morning, but he declined to say it was as early as even ten o\u2019clock. This objection cannot possibly be maintained; for if the notice was put in the office any time the next day, it was done in sufficient time, whether before or after the departure of the mail. It is laid down in <em>Brayl. </em>220, that the holder of the note has the whole of the next day to write in, without reference to the time of closing the mail. <em>Saund. on Plead, &amp; Evidence, </em>297, has the same rule, and cites in support of it, <em>Bray </em>v. <em>Hadwen, </em>5 <em>Maul. &amp; Selw. </em>68; and in <em>Hawkes </em>v. <em>Salter, </em>15 <em>Eng. Com. Law. Rep. </em>125, or 4 <em>Bingh. </em>715; where a bill was dishonored on <em>Saturday, </em>it was holden, that the party has <em>all </em>the next day, Monday, to write in, and if the letter <em>went </em>by the mail of <em>Tuesday </em>it was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">The defendant finally insists, that putting a letter in the post-office, is not notice of the dishonor of a note; that it is no more than evidence of notice, which may be counteracted and overcome by proof, that the notice was lost on the way, or that it was never received. It has however been fully settled, that a written notice, to the party to be charged, addressed to him properly, and put into the post-office in due season, amounts to what is termed due diligence, even if the letter should never be received. The doubts that have been expressed in cases whore the residence of the party is remote from any post-office, have no relation to a case like the present. The cases that support the general positions are numerous, and will be found collected in 1 <em>Saund. on Plead, &amp; Evid. </em>297 ; and 2 <em>Starkie's Evid. </em>269, <em>note, </em>1. It cannot be necessary to review them. On the whole, there is no ground for disturbing the verdict.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b58-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>Drake, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Al\">I concur in the opinion, that the rule taken in. this case, ought to be discharged. The note was payable on the 17th of October. At the circuit, the jury were charged, that-it was incumbent on the plaintiffs to prove that notice of nonpayment was put into the post-office, in time to go by the mail of the eighteenth. On this point, the proof exhibited by the plaintiffs was of a very doubtful character. But the defendant produced the notice itself, by which it was evident that it had been mailed either on the eighteenth, or twenty-eighth. The jury have believed it to have been the former day. And there was so much evidence on both sides, that I consider it to have been a proper question for their decision. I therefore think that the verdict ought not to be disturbed; upon the supposition that the charge was correct. But upon the question, whether the holder had the whole of the eighteenth, to put his notice in the post-office, or should have done it previous to the closing of the mail of that day, I do not deem it necessary now, to give an opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">The Chief Justice having been concerned as counsel, delivered no opinion.
