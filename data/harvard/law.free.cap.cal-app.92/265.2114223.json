Brief excerpts, selected from other parts of the evidence, are set forth. While the brief is on the border line of insufficiency, it appears that the ends of justice will be best served by a decision on the merits rather than on the technical ground urged by the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">The motion is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
