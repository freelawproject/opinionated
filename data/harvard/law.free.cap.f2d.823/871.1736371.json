Daly has moved that the cause be remanded for consolidation with his pending 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate. We DENY Daly\u2019s motion to remand for consolidation, but we REMAND the cause for the district court to state findings of fact and conclusions of law relative to Daly\u2019s Rule 35 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-14\">In his Rule 35 motion, Daly requested that his 16-year sentence and fines be set aside as illegal; alternatively, he asked that the prison term be made subject to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4205(b)(2), making him eligible for parole at the discretion of the Parole Commission. The district court entered an order amending the judgment of conviction to include the \u00a7 4205(b)(2) provision, but did not advert to Daly\u2019s claims of illegality.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-15\">This Court consistently requires district ..courts to state findings and conclusions for their rulings on motions to vacate sentence filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Findings and conclusions \u201care plainly indispensable to appellate review.\u201d <em>Hart v. U.S., </em>565 F.2d 360, 362 (5th Cir.1978). Such findings are necessary \u201cunless the record conclusively shows that the petitioner is entitled to no relief.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Edwards, </em>711 F.2d 633, 633 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-16\">While Rule 35 does not expressly require findings and conclusions, when a defendant has alleged that his sentence is illegal, ordinarily they are no less \u201cindispensable to appellate review\u201d than in a \u00a7 2255 appeal. In Daly\u2019s case, we are unable to accomplish appellate review without such findings and conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-17\">Daly has moved that the cause be remanded for consolidation with his pending \u00a7 2255 proceeding. He asserts that the two proceedings involve interrelated issues. In his \u00a7 2255 motion, Daly alleged that his sentence violated his Sixth Amendment rights. He also made that allegation in his brief relative to his Rule 35 appeal. As the Government points out, however, Daly did not so allege in the Rule 35 proceedings in the district court. Therefore, this Court will not consider the issue upon appeal of the Rule 35 judgment. <em>E.g., U.S. v. Scott, </em>688 F.2d 368, 370 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-18\">Daly\u2019s motion to remand for consolidation is DENIED. The cause is REMANDED for findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
