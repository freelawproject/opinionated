McKennan and Lawson D. Welch against E. R. Mickelberry and others, praying a decree for the specific performance of a contract and for other relief.</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-7\" pgmap=\"461(175) 462(361) 463(370) 464(20)\">The bill, which was verified, was filed on June 16, 1906. It appears therefrom that plaintiff in error Frank B. McKennan and John Ziemens, one of the defendants in error, were the owners of a section and a half of land in Iroquois county, Illinois, subject to trust deeds securing the sum of $34,320, and other encumbrances amounting to about $5200. Defendant in error E. R. Mickelberry was the owner of an improved business property in the city of Clinton, DeWitt county, Illinois, and a valuable stock of merchandise located in and upon that property. The real estate in Clinton was subject to an encumbrance of $12,000. Mickelberry, on May 9, 1906, made a proposition, in writing, to exchange his said real and personal property in the city of Clinton, subject to the $12,000 encumbrance, for said lands in Iroquois, subject to the trust deeds thereon, for $34,320. McKennan and Ziemens accepted the proposition, and afterward arranged with the German American Bank of Bloomington, Illinois, for the money necessary to pay the encumbrances on the Iroquois county land other than the trust deeds, and, in contemplation of the acceptance by them of Mickelberry\u2019s proposition, they on May 9, 1906, agreed between themselves to a division of the property to be acquired from Mickelberry, whereby Ziemens was to have the real estate subject to the encumbrance and McKennan the personal property, the latter to pay to Ziemens the sum of $3000, and Ziemens and McKennan each to pay one-half of the indebtedness for which they were jointly liable. The Clinton real estate should be conveyed by Mickelberry directly to Ziemens, and the title to the personal property was to be conveyed by a bill of sale to a trustee, for the use of McKennan, until McKennan should comply with his obligations in reference to payments by him as above mentioned. It was also agreed between McKennan and Ziemens that McKennan should take the management of the mercantile business, giving it his personal attention, and out of the net earnings pay all of his said obligations as rapidly as possible, and that the business should be continued in the building acquired from Mickelberry and Ziemens should receive a monthty rental of $150. McKennan and Ziemens selected plaintiff in error Lawson D. Welch as trustee, and he agreed to act in that capacity. This agreement will hereafter be refered to as the contract of division. It was further agreed between McKennan and Ziemens that as soon as they ascertained the amount of the total liabilities, to be settled with money which was to be furnished by the German American Bank, a written memorandum of their agreement and of the terms and conditions of the trust should be prepared and signed by them for reference and for the use of the trustee. On the same day McKennan and Ziemens both signed a written acceptance of the proposition which had been made by Mickelbeny, and thereafter Mickelberry as first party, and Ziemens and McKennan as the second party, entered into a contract bearing date May 9, 1906, (hereinafter referred to as the contract of May 9,) which provided that the first party had sold and agreed to convey to Ziemens the Clinton real estate, with abstract of title showing a good, clear, fee simple title, subject to the encumbrance of $12,000, which realty was to be conveyed by Mickelberry to Ziemens by deed of warranty, subject to the encumbrance, with interest thereon from and after May 7, 1906. The contract further recited that Mickelberry \u201chas and does hereby sell, and agree to transfer by a good and sufficient bill of sale, free and clear of all claims and encumbrances of any kind whatsoever, except as hereinafter mentioned, to Lawson D. Welch, as trustee, for the said Frank B. McKennan\u2019s use, as provided in a certain contract between the said Frank B. McKennan and the said John Ziemens of even date herewith,\u201d the stock of merchandise and other property used in connection therewith, located in and upon the Clinton real estate. In consideration of the foregoing, Ziemens and McKennan agreed to convey the Iroquois land to Mickelberry by warranty deed, accompanied by an abstract showing a good, clear, fee simple title, subject only to the deeds of trust first hereinabove mentioned. The contract further provided that all deeds and papers necessary to the proper transfer of the properties should be executed within forty-eight hours and delivered to the German American Bank, to be held by it in escrow and delivered to the respective parties in interest as soon as the titles were shown to be satisfactory, as provided in the contract. The party of the first part was to be established in the possession of the lands as of the year 1906, and the second party and the trustee were to be established in the possession of the properties, which were to be conveyed to them as of the 7th day of May, 1906. Three copies of the contract were to be executed, each of which was to be considered as an original copy for all purposes. This contract was signed in triplicate by Mickelberry, Ziemens and McKennan. All the deeds and title papers necessary to make effective the transfers contemplated by the contract were duly executed, and, together with one copy of the contract, were delivered to the bank within forty-eight hours after the signing of the contract.</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-5\" pgmap=\"464(344) 465(373)\">It further appears from the bill that on May 10, 1906, it was agreed between McKennan and Mickelberry that the former should immediately take possession of the personal property at Clinton, but that one Savage, who had theretofore been the general manager of the business, should continue in that capacity and keep the books and control the funds derived from the business until such time as the contract was complied with by the presentation of evidence showing to the respective parties that the titles were as agreed upon, and under this arrangement McKennan took possession of the merchandise and so continued in such possession up to the time of the filing of the bill, but when the controversy hereinafter mentioned arose, Savage, under the direction of Mickelberry, refused longer to recognize McKennan\u2019s rights in the merchandise or his authority in the management and control of the business, and thereafter acted under the direction of Mickelberry, and the latter, operating through Savage, appropriated the proceeds of the business to his own use; that upon the deposit of the papers with the bank, McKennan within a short time caused an abstract of title to the Iroquois lands to be brought down to a date subsequent to May 9, 1906, and delivered the same to the bank; that this abstract showed a good, clear, fee simple title to the lands, subject only to the trust deeds and to the other liens, amounting to about $5200, which other liens were to be paid by the bank with money furnished by it; that between the time of the signing of the contract and the delivery to the bank of the abstract for the Iroquois lands, Mickelberry had failed to consummate a contemplated sale of those lands to a prospective buyer and thereupon became dissatisfied with his trade with Ziemens and McKennan, and that, acting through Charles I. Will, his attorney, who is one of the defendants in error, Mickelberry, by some means unknown to the complainants, secured the collusion and cooperation of Siemens for the purpose of defeating the final consummation of the exchange of properties contemplated by the contract of May 9; that Will, representing Mickelberry, accompanied by Ziemens, upon the pretext that they desired to ascertain the amount of money necessary to put the title to the Iroquois lands in the condition in which it must be to comply with the contract, obtained from the bank the abstract of title to this land, and thereafter retained the same against the will of McKennan and of the bank, thereby rendering it impossible for the bank to ascertain and satisfy the liens which the bank had agreed to remove; that Mickelberry and Will, with full knowledge of the contract and of the delivery of the title papers in escrow, and with full knowledge of the arrangement made by Ziemens and McKennan with the bank for the money necessary to pay off the liens other than the trust deed, procured Ziemens and wife, on May 29, 1906, to execute and deliver to Will, as trustee, a deed of trust upon the Iroquois county lands to secure the payment of a promissory note drawn to the order of John Ziemens, signed and endorsed by him, for the sum of $7500, and that said trust deed was recorded in the proper office on May 29, 1906; that McKennan learned of the execution of the trust deed on the same day, and thereupon on that day had a copy of the contract of May 9 recorded in the recorder\u2019s office of Iroquois county, and on May 30, 1906, had a copy of the same contract recorded in the recorder\u2019s office in DeWitt county, Illinois; that said trust deed so given by Ziemens to Will was and is a fraud perpetrated upon the rights of McKennan, and that the same was done with the knowledge and consent and approval of Mickelberry, with a fraudulent intention on the part of Ziemens, Will and Mickelberry to defeat the ultimate consummation of the contract for the exchange of properties; that in furtherance of that fraudulent purpose Mickelberry and Will prepared, and on May 29, 1906, mailed to McKennan, a letter in words and figures following:</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-4\" pgmap=\"466\">\u201cBloomington, Illinois, May 29, 1906.</summary><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AWd\" pgmap=\"466\">\"F.

No affidavit was filed showing necessity or excuse for amending the original, which, as has been heretofore stated, was verified. An amended bill was filed and later a motion to strike the same from the files was sustained, and the leave to amend was vacated and a decree was entered dismissing the original bill for the reason that no equity appeared on the face thereof, whereupon the complainants in the bill sued out from this court a writ of error.</summary><summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-4\" pgmap=\"468\">It is assigned that the circuit court erred in sustaining the demurrer to the original bill, in striking the amended bill from the files, in vacating the leave to amend and in dismissing the original bill.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b468-5\" pgmap=\"468\">Louis FitzHenry, and Welty, Sterling &amp; Whitmore, for plaintiffs in error:</attorneys><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b468-6\" pgmap=\"468\">It is just- as much the duty of courts of equity to decree specific performance of contracts for the conveyance of land in proper cases as it is the duty of courts of law to award damages for breaches thereof.

It does not appear, therefore, that the court erred in vacating the order granting leave to amend.</p> <p id=\"b472-7\" pgmap=\"472(96) 473(286)\">Defendants in error state that the bill was demurrable because it shows that the contract of division was to have been in writing and that Mickelberry was not able to make the conveyance of the personal property to the trustee as long as the contract of division had not been reduced to writing, and that to have made the conveyance to the trustee under such circumstances would have been to lay himself open to endless litigation and danger of loss. The same position was taken by Mickelberry in his letter of May 29, and his statement in that regard is plainly a mere subterfuge, as he had already made the conveyance to the trustee and deposited the document with the bank. When he desired to execute the bill of sale, the fact that the contract of division was not in writing occasioned no difficulty. When he wished, apparently, to avoid his contract that fact was seized upon as an excuse. The contract of May 9 does not recite or require that the contract of division was, or was to be, a written contract. The contract of May 9 refers to the contract of division as \u201cof even date herewith,\u201d and the bill avers that the latter contract had been made by McKennan and Ziemens on May 9, prior to the making of the contract which we refer to as that of May 9. It was not necessary that the contract of division should be in writing in order that it should be of even date with the contract of May 9. Mickelberry\u2019s obligation was to convey \u201cto Lawson D. Welch, as trustee, for the said Frank B. McKennan\u2019s use, as provided in a certain contract between the said Frank B. McKennan and the said John Ziemens of even date herewith,\u201d\u2014that is, of the date of May 9, 1906,\u2014and his obligation in that respect would have been entirely satisfied by a conveyance to Welch, as trustee, for McKennan\u2019s use, \u201cas provided in a certain contract between the said Frank B. McKennan and the said John Ziemens, of the date of May 9, 1906.\u201d Any controversy about the terms of the contract of division would have been between McKennan and Ziemens and would not have concerned Mickelberry.</p> <p id=\"b473-4\" pgmap=\"473(91) 474(115)\">It is contended that the bill- does not show that the complainant McKennan complied with his part of the contract by tendering to Mickelberry an abstract of title in accordance with the terms of the contract of May 9, in that the abstract as furnished showed the existence of the liens (other than the trust deeds) amounting substantially to the sum of $5200. The bill avers that those liens were satisfied two weeks prior to the time when McKennan demanded the delivery of the title papers, and that Mickelberry, through his attorney, Will, had knowledge of that fact. Inasmuch as Mickelberry was party to the transaction by which the abstracts were taken from the bank and wrongfully retained, we think the fact that the abstract was not made to show a satisfaction of those liens is a matter of no moment, in view of the further fact that Will, attorney for Mickelberry, knew they had been satisfied. It is also suggested that these liens were not satisfied with money furnished by the bank, in accordance with the original arrangement. This, also, is without merit. If the liens were removed it made no difference to Mickelberry by whom the money was paid.</p> <p id=\"b474-5\" pgmap=\"474\">It is also urged that there was no compliance with the contract by McKennan and Ziemens, for the reason that after the contract was made, and before McKennan demanded the exchange of the conveyances, the trust deed to Will had been filed of record. It is entirely evident, if the averments of this bill be true, that this as well as all other obstacles in the way of specifically enforcing this contract, aside from that presented by the rights of the judgment creditors, arise from collusive and fraudulent conduct of Mickelberry, Ziemens and Will, the attorney for Mickelberry, designed to make impossible a specific performance of the undertakings of the parties. A court of equity will not thus permit Mickelberry and Ziemens, by their own acts or by the acts of Will, to which they consented, to defeat the right of McKennan to have the contract carried out as made. To do so would be to allow them to take advantage of their own wrong.</p> <p id=\"b474-6\" pgmap=\"474(67) 475(288)\">So far as the judgment creditors are concerned, had Mickelberry and Ziemens acted with reasonable diligence and in good faith, the trade would, we think, have been consummated before the date when the first lien attached. Any security afforded these creditors by the Iroquois lands was obtained by them with constructive notice of the existence of the contract of May 9 and of McKennan\u2019s rights arising thereunder. If the facts be as alleged by the bill, the trust deed to Will should be canceled and removed of record and a specific performance of the contract should be decreed; the Iroquois lands should be discharged from any burden or lien in favor of the judgment creditors, and those creditors should be given such right in the property to be transferred to Ziemens and McKennan as will give to the judgment creditors as great security for the payment of their judgments as they now have by virtue of such steps as they have taken to subject the Iroquois lands to the payment of the judgment indebtedness due them; the rights of the judgment creditors should be made to attach to the proceeds of the exchange of the Iroquois lands instead of to the equities of Ziemens and McKennan in those lands, (1 Black on Judgments, sec. 438.) For the purpose of effectually protecting the interests of the various parties to this litigation, the court may, in addition to decreeing specific performance, appoint a receiver for the property which is to be transferred to Ziemens and McKennan and may direct the sale of any or all of that property. Mickelberry should be required to account in accordance with the prayer of the bill. If Mickelberry shall be compelled to comply with his contract and to account, the court will have ample power to enforce the rights of all the parties to this controversy by directing disposition or administration of the DeWitt county properties and distribution of the proceeds of the accounting, and should retain jurisdiction for the purpose of doing complete justice between the parties.
