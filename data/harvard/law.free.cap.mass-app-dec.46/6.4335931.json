Issue of fact.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b15-5\">Request 3:</p>\n<p id=\"b15-6\">\u2014\u201cThe liability of one using land for injuries caused to another whom he has invited to come upon the land for the purpose of transacting business with him does not depend upon the title that he may or may not have in the land but depends upon the obligation that the law imposes upon him because of the invitation.\u201d <em>Allowed but </em>see <em>finding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b15-7\">Request 4:</p>\n<p id=\"b15-8\">\u2014\u201cIf it is found that the plaintiff, Laura Huard, was admitted to the Eastern States Exposition grounds by reason of a paid admission ticket and that said ticket entitled her to visit that portion of the grounds on which she fell and was injured, her status at the time was that of an invitee of the defendant and the defendant is liable to the plaintiffs for the damage sustained by \"them regardless of the fact that title to and control of said premises was in another who negligently failed to keep said premises in a reasonable safe condition.\u201d <em>Denied.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b16-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>The court\u2019s finding was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b16-5\">\u2014\u201cThis is an action of tort resulting from a fall down on a sidewalk, between a building owned by the State of Connecticut and a building owned by the State of New Hampshire on the fairgrounds of the Eastern States Exposition on September 23, 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-6\">I find that the plaintiff was injured on the property of the State of Connecticut. I further find that the defendant was not the owner or in control of the premises in the area where the plaintiff was injured. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b16-7\">The trial court then dealt with the requests for rulings as above and found for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-8\">We find no error on the part of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-9\">A trial judge\u2019s action upon requests for rulings must show that he has made no error of law. <em>Home Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Savronsky, </em>307 Mass. 601, 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-10\">He is not required to make special findings of fact even though requested to do so. <em>Castano </em>v. Leone, 278 Mass. 429, 431. Though it often may be desirable for the judge voluntarily to make special findings of fact or rulings of law for the information of the parties and the presentation of the real question of law for review, failure to do so is not error. <em>Memishian </em>v. <em>Phipps, </em>311 Mass. 521, 523.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>The trial judge is required to make special findings of fact only when a ruling is denied as inapplicable to the facts found. (17 LEGALITE 202).</p>\n<p id=\"b17-5\">If a request is denied on any other ground, or without any statement of the ground, the judge is not required to set forth findings of fact. <em>Memishian </em>v. <em>Phipps, </em>311 Mass. 521, 523, 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-8\">The plaintiffs rely heavily on the cases of <em>Barron </em>v. <em>McLellan, </em>310 Mass. 778 and <em>Rouillard </em>v. <em>Canadian Klondike Club, </em>316 Mass. 11 in each of which cases it was shown that the defendant either had possession or control of the offending dangerous instrumentality or that the plaintiff reasonably assumed from the appearance of things (on which he relied) that the defendant had control over it.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-12\">In concessionaire cases, to establish liability a finding of reliance on the appearance of things is essential. <em>Federal National Bank </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>305 Mass. 559, 567. <em>Barron </em>v. <em>McLellan, </em>310 Mass. 778, 783. <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>Texas Co., </em>340 Mass. 606, 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-14\">There is no such finding in this case. It is elementary that damage caused by the condition of premises commonly depends upon control of the offending instrumentality, either through ownership or otherwise. <em>Marston </em>v. <em>Boston Publishing </em>Co., 271 Mass. 307. <em>Wright </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>v. <em>Sears, </em>242 Mass. 292. <em>Cassidy </em>v. <em>Welsh, </em>319 Mass. 615, 619. In this case the defendant was found not to be the owner of or in control of the area involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-5\">When there is no affirmative evidence of any negligent act or ommission on the part of the defendant which contributed to the injury of the plaintiff, a finding for the defendant is warranted. <em>Cronin </em>v. <em>Universal, </em>348 Mass. 645, 649. See <em>Underhill </em>v. <em>Schactman, </em>337 Mass. 730.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-6\">The present case is not one where the State of Connecticut has been shown to be concessionaire on premises of the defendant as in <em>Barron </em>v. <em>McLellan, </em>310 Mass. 778 or <em>Timmis </em>v. <em>Joslin, </em>303 Mass. 540. See <em>Buck </em>v. <em>Clauson, </em>349 Mass. 612, 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-7\">The fact that the plaintiff was injured by reason of a defective condition is not sufficient to entitle her to recover. She must go further and prove that her injuries were caused by some act of negligence on the part of the defendant. Even aside from the questions of control or appearance of control of the offending premises, and aside from the questions of contributory negligence and assumption of the risk, there is nothing in the reported evidence to show how long the defect (if there was one) had existed prior to the accident nor is there any evidence that the defendant (even if it had the duty to do so) knew or should by the exercise of reasonable care have known of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>existence of the alleged defect. See <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Quimby Co., </em>227 Mass. 93.</p>\n<p id=\"AcB\">The trial judge\u2019s disposition of the requests for rulings demonstrated that he had properly instructed himself on the law of the case. There was no error. Accordingly the report is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
