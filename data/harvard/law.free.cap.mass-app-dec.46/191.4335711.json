That justice interviewed counsel and the trial judge, and has concluded the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The trial judge determined at a hearing on the first draft report that all the material evidence was not set out in the draft report and ordered changes and additions.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">The petitioner did file an amended draft report which included evidence omitted from the first draft report, but failed to set out in full the material evidence as the trial judge had ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">The trial judge disallowed the claim of report and filed a disallowance setting out his reasons. The petitioner did not include evidence in the amended draft report as the trial judge remembered it and on which he based his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">This Division, as a result of the above and an inspection of the record in this case, must deny the petition to establish the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">An Appellate Division is empowered to consider only the first draft report filed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>the petitioner. <em>Hinckley </em>v. <em>Boston Elev.
