In that year the Town of Belmont assessed each defendant for real estate taxes for the year 1966, under the provisions of G.L. c. 59, \u00a7 3A. There was no evidence at the trial that the Commonwealth did not consent to this occupancy by the defendants of their homes and the trial court concluded that it was at least tacitly permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">The defendants having failed to pay the 1966 taxes, the town brought the present actions under the provisions of G.L. c. 60, \u00a7 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">The relevant portions of G.L. c. 59, \u00a7 3A provides \u201cBeal estate owned by ... . the Commonwealth \u2014 If used or occupied for other than public purposes shall be taxed to the lessee or lessees thereof .... or to the occupants or person in possession were the owners thereof in fee. . . .\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">The issue in this case is solely whether or not the occupancy by the defendants in 1966 of their respective homes after the 4 months grace period permitted under G.L. c. 79, $ 8B, constituted a use of the premises for other than public purposes and therefore taxable under G.L. c. 59, \u00a7 3A.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">We answer the question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">The leading case interpreting G.L. c. 59, \u00a7 3A, is <em>Atlantic Refining Company </em>v. Assessors <em>of Newton, </em>342 Mass. 200, 204. In that case the court referred to the \u201cpurpose of the occupant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>as the important, if not dominant, purpose to which the statute refers\u201d, and concluded that a business conducted for profit on land owned by the Commonwealth, although a convenience to the public resulted therefrom, was taxable under the 'Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">In the cases at hand, the use of premises by defendants, being non-profit and for residential purposes only, was a \u201creasonable incident to the [widening of Eoute 2] and of achieving its public purpose .... and must be regarded as for a valid public purpose and a legitimate part of the entire plan\u201d. <em>Cabot </em>v. <em>Assessors of City of Boston, </em>335 Mass. 53, 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">We note that Gr.L., c. 59, \u00a7 3A, was enacted in 1928 at a time when extensive land takings for highways and urban renewal projects were not contemplated and we think the leigslature did not intend the statute to apply to the factual situation presented in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">To be sure, the defendants, during their occupancy, would receive the benefit of the usual municipal services, without payment therefor. However, as was said in <em>Atlantic </em>at page 207 \u2014 \u201cIt is not unreasonable that the ultimate effect of Sec. 3A may be an allocation of revenues between the Commonwealth and the municipalities. New aspects of public purpose and new public activities call for new adjustments between the Commonwealth, the municipalities, and business conducted on publicly owned land\u201d. The dominant aspect of public purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>and activity controlling in this case is the residential occupancy by homeowners forced to relocate their homes. The mere fact that the grace period of this occupancy in this case is longer than that given to homeowners as a matter of right under section 8B of chapter 79 does not shift the burden under section 3A of chapter 59. The latter statutory provision stands on its own. We do not deem the residential occupancy under these circumstances for the period of time involved in this case to be for other than public purposes.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b32-6\">Ralph H. Willard, Jr. for Plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b32-8\">Viola Cronin for Defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">We conclude that the trial judge\u2019s finding for the defendants in each case was correct and his decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Report dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
