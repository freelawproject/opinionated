It is an action of contract, in which the plaintiff seeks to recover $4,346.13 under a written agreement alleged to be a guarantee wherein the defendant guaranteed the obligations of Norfolk Lumber, Inc. for the sale to it by the plaintiff of certain lumber goods. The answer is a general denial, denial of signature and demand for proof, no consideration, failure of consideration, and an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>allegation that no notice of the acceptance of the alleged guarantee was given defendant. The court found for the plaintiff in the sum of $4,346.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">At the trial there was evidence tending to show that an agent of the plaintiff had a talk with the defendant concerning the sale of lumber by the plaintiff to Norfolk Lumber, Inc.; that as a result thereof plaintiff sold and delivered to Norfolk Lumber, Inc. lumber in the amount of $4,346.13; that on April 23, 1969, an agent of the plaintiff made a demand on defendant for payment. The written guarantee was entered into evidence, the pertinent portion of which is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-5\">\u2018\u2018 Guarantee</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">For valuable consideration .... the undersigned guarantees due fulfillment to Blanchard Lumber Company .... of all obligations of Norfolk Lumber, Inc. to said Blanchard Lumber Company .... The undersigned waives presentment, demand, notice .... in connection with this guarantee .... Signed as a sealed instrument this 3rd day of January, 1966.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\">(s) John J. Tbainob</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AyZ\">John J. Tbainob\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">The defendant rested without offering testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">The case was reported because the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>claims to be aggrieved by the denial of his requests for rulings numbers 1 and 2 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">\u201c1. Upon all the evidence a finding for the plaintiff is not warranted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">2. Upon all the evidence a finding for the defendant is required.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">The only point argued by the defendant in his brief is that there is no evidence that the signature on the instrument is that of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">The written guarantee was admitted in evidence. The presumption of the validity of the defendant\u2019s signature thus became operative, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, required a finding for the plaintiff.
