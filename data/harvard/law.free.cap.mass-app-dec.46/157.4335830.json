According to the attested copy of a publication of the Public Works Department of Boston, Congress Street was a public way from 30 Dock Square to New York, New Haven and Hartford Bailroad. By agreement of the parties a sufficient notice was sent to the defendant city. Three photographs of the locus of the accident were received in evidence. There was a finding for the plaintiff. The defendant claims the locus of the accident was not a part of the public way.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">The right of action against a city to recover for property damage suffered on account of a defect in a public way is created by statute. G.L.c. 84, \u00a715. <em>Hurlburt </em>v. <em>Great Barrington, </em>300 Mass. 524. <em>Longley </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>304 Mass. 580. <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>Worcester Electric </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Light., 307 Mass. 169, 174. The statute creates a limited right of action and not an unrestricted liability. The plaintiff must bring himself within the terms of the statute. <em>Ansel </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>254 Mass. 208, 213 (City was not liable where pedestrian was not on public way when injured by defect, but was outside street lines, on paved approach to fire station) <em>Abihider </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>277 Mass. 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The liability of a municipality for defects in a public way is limited to the area used by the public within the street lines. No action lies against a municipal corporation for an injury which happened on a sidewalk built beyond the limits of a highway it was bound to keep in repair. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Attleborough, </em>140 Mass. 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The report has the statement, \u201cThis report contains all the evidence material to the questions reported.\u201d The evidence is the pictures and a certification by the Public Works Department of the city that Congress Street was a public way from 30 Dock Square to the tracks of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. The pictures show the location of the alleged defect at a point outside the street lines of the public way and at a point beyond the railroad tracks (there being one set of tracks) presumably under the control of the railroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">There is no evidence that the plaintiff suffered property damage while on any portion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>the public way, Congress Street. There is no evidence that the defendant had a legal duty to keep in repair as a public way that part of the area where the accident took place. The burden was on the plaintiff to prove that the locus of the accident was part of a public way.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AMM\">Arthur E. Robbins of Medford for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b166-5\">Philip G. Chesley of Boston for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">There was error in the court\u2019s refusal to grant defendant\u2019s request for ruling number 1 that the plaintiff \u201chas failed to prove that the locus of his accident was a part of the public way.\u201d Upon the evidence the plaintiff should be given the opportunity to prove that the locus of the accident was part of a public way. Finding for plaintiff vacated. New trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
