Another action, tried herewith as one, is based on a charge of conversion of certain fixtures and some articles of clothing, the subject of manufacture.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-20\"><bracketnum>[ 1 <em>]</em></bracketnum><em> </em>In regard to the larger item alleged to have been omitted from the account, plaintiff put in evidence a letter sent by a third party. The letter was highly important, as referring to the fact that the defendant had ordered the goods. It requires no explanation to demonstrate that the evidence was totally incompetent\u2014apart from other defects of proof as to its authenticity\u2014and should have been excluded. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Similarly, a receipt in favor of the same third person, apparently intended to prove that defendant had signed it, and a bill of such third person to the plaintiff for certain articles, were admitted over due objection, the court saying that it would take them \u201cfor what they are worth.\u201d It is quite evident that both papers were incompetent and inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Under ordinary circumstances, it might be possible to assume that they were admitted inadvertently, and, if merely cumulative proof, their admission might possibly be regarded as not prejudicial; but the remark of the learned court indicates that they were to be taken for \u201cwhat they were worth.\u201d As evidence, however, under our system of proof, they were worthless, and should have been excluded absolutely. Under these circumstances, therefore, their admission was reversible error. Similarly another bill was admitted \u201cto show title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">For these and other errors the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event as of one appeal.
