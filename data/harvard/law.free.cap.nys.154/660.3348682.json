Laws, c. 28) \u00a7 58, provides that every policy of insurance issued by any life insurance company doing business within the state shall contain the entire contract, that nothing shall be incorporated therein by reference to the application or other writings, unless they are indorsed upon or attached to the policy, and that all statements purporting to be made by the insured shall, in the absence of fraud, be deemed representations, and not warranties. <em>Held </em>that, if a policy was delivered in New York and was a New York contract, fraudulent representations in the application- as to insured\u2019s health, habits, and other insurance did not affect the insurer\u2019s liability, where the application or statements of insured were not attached to and made a part of the policy.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b694-17\">[Ed.

Defendant is a Pennsylvania corporation, and it appears from its answer that the policy was executed at its home office in Pittsburgh, but whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>delivered there or elsewhere is not alleged. It is alleged in the complaint that the policy was executed by defendant\u2019s officers at Pittsburgh, Pa., and delivered to Piotra Kurgan, without alleging where it was so delivered. The complaint also alleges that defendant \u201cwas and is duly authorized and licensed to transact its business within the state of New York\u201d; also \u201cthat on or about April 11, 1914, the defendant, in consideration of the payment to it by Piotra Kurgan, of the city of Lackawanna, county of Erie, state of New York, of the sum of one hundred nine dollars and sixteen cents, the annual premium paid in advance on the delivery of its policy of insurance, * * * insured the life of the said Piotra Kurgan,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-3\"><bracketnum>[2, 3]</bracketnum> We think these allegations \u00e1re not sufficient to show or raise the presumption that the policy was delivered in this state. It may have been delivered in Pennsylvania, or elsewhere than in New York; if so, the Insurance Law does not apply to regulate its form or legal effect. If it is not a New York contract, the defense pleaded may be perfectly good. It is proper, however, to say that, should it develop on the trial that it is, in fact, a New York contract, the defense pleaded, namely, fraudulent representations of the insured in his' application for the policy as to his health, habits, and other insurance cannot be sustained, inasmuch as the application or statements of insured are not attached to and made a part of the policy, as required by section 58 of the Insurance Law (Laws 1909, c. 33). We concur in the construction placed on this section 58 of the statute in Murphy v. Colonial Life Ins. Co. of America, 83 Misc. Rep. 475, 145 N. Y. Supp. 196; affirmed 163 App. Div. 875, 147 N. Y. Supp. 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">The order overruling the demurrer should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
