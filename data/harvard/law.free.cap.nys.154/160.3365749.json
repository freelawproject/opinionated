The driver of the truck, an experienced man, testified that he was driving one of plaintiff\u2019s trucks with two horses south on Second avenue. He was on the west side of the avenue, between the south-bound -track and the curb. As he reached the crosswalk at 122d street, he stopped in order to'allow a lady and child-to pass. He then looked north and south. He could see as far south as 121st street. He saw no car approaching in either direction. He then turned his horses east .and drove across the avenue. His horses were going at \u2022 what he termed \u201ca little trot.\u201d Pie had gotten across the south-bound .track and the - space between the tracks, and his horses and part of the truck had cleared the north-bound trade, when the hind end of the truck was hit' by a north-bound car and thrown against an elevated pillar, causing the injuries complained of. This was substantially corroborated by a police officer, who saw the car approaching rapidly. Another witness testified that he saw the car approaching, and that as it neared 122d street the motorman did not have his hand on the brake, but was. standing with his back partly turned towards the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>north and reaching up towards the roof of the car, apparently in an effort to turn the sign on top of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">None of the acts done by the driver constituted contributory negligence as a matter of law. Having looked in both directions as he was about to cross the street, and seeing no car in either direction, he had a right to continue his course, and to assume that a car approaching at least a block away would be under control when nearing the crossing.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The defendant claims that the recently decided case of Lopes v. This Defendant, 153 N. Y. Supp. 673, in the Appellate Division pf this Department, controls this case. In the Lopes Case the wagon was drawn by one horse with a load approximately eight tons in weight. The father of the plaintiff was driving, and they were proceeding north on the east side of Second avenue. As they were about to cross to the west side at Thirty-Sixth street, both the plaintiff and his father looked and saw a car approaching \u201cpretty fast.\u201d Without halting or changing their course they continued on their way, and just as they were \u201cabout to get on the track\u201d again saw the car at a distance of \u201cthree pillars\u201d of the elevated road away. The plaintiff then told his'father to \u201cgo ahead,\u201d which he did. Plaintiff again looked when the car was 125 feet away, with its speed unchanged, and at this time the horse and some part of the wagon was on the track, and plaintiff then told his father \u201cto whip the horse\u201d\u2014that the car was coming. Thus urged, the horse \u201ctried all he could with the heavy load he had,\u201d and succeeded in getting all but the back part of the wagon clear, when it was struck. The foregoing statement is taken from the opinion of the court in that case, and it can be seen at once that the facts are materially different than in the case at bar. There must be a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
