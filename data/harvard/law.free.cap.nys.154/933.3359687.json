Laws, c. 11, as amended by Laws 1911, c. 359, and Laws 1913, c. 742), forbidding the increasing of the salary or compensation of an officer during the term for which he is elected or appointed, although such would undoubtedly be the effect of such legislation. The general act of 1913 (chapter 367) did not, we think, repeal by implication or otherwise the special act of 1898\" (chapter 10, \u00a7 2) so far as the' county clerk is required to pay the court deputies and all other employ\u00e9s of his office from the salary provided by that statute, and that the said special act still remains in full force and effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-17\">Order affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
