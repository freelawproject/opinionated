It was shown that the lavaliere was delivered to the defendant on consignment to be sold by him, title to remain in the plaintiff until sold, and to be returned to the plaintiff on demand. The demand was proved, and the refusal of the defendant to give it up on the ground that \u201che was not through with it.\u201d The plaintiff testified that he personally demanded a return of the property several times, and the defendant never returned it. The defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the evidence showed \u201cthat the defendant was at liberty to dispose of the article as he wished,\u201d and \u201call plaintiff was interested in was to receive $874,\u201d was granted at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-19\"><bracketnum>[1,2]</bracketnum> I am of the opinion that this was error. It is true that under the terms of the contract whereby the goods were delivered to the defendant he was at liberty to sell them for any price he chose and to whomsoever he wished, so- long as he returned $874 to the plaintiff,</p>\n<p id=\"b165-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>and had the defendant sold the lavaliere before it was demanded of him by the plaintiff he would not be liable in conversion, but merely answerable for the sum of $874 under his contract. Herrman Furniture Works v. Hyman, 28 Misc. Rep. 567, 59 N. Y. Supp. 526. But there is no evidence in the record to show that the defendant had sold the goods before the demand was made to return them. This is a matter of defense, which it was not necessary for the plaintiff to negative by proof to the contrary. Thomas Mfg. Co. v. Symonds, 27 App. Div. 316, 50 N. Y. Supp. 695; Anker v. Smith, 87 N. Y. Supp. 479. The plaintiff made out a prima facie case of conversion, and the complaint should not have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-3\">The judgment is reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
