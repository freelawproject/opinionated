Samuels, of New York City (Ralph H. Blum, of New York City, of counsel), for respondents.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"pAeZ\">GUY, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aec6\">The complaint alleges the execution of a contract by the parties which the plaintiffs hired the defendant as their traveling salesman; that his commissions under the agreement amount to $1,450.47; that during the term of the contract the plaintiffs loaned and advanced to the defendant divers sums of money, and sold and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>delivered to him certain goods, wares, and merchandise, said loans and the agreed prices on said sales aggregating $2,440.51, which sum the defendant promised to repay to the plaintiffs; and they demanded judgment f,or $990.04, being the. excess of the alleged loans and sales over the commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">On the trial the plaintiffs gave no evidence of the alleged sales, nor of any express promise by the defendant to repay the alleged loans. They claim to have proved a cause of action against the defendant by simply putting the contract in evidence and showing how much money he drew during the contract period, and deducting from that sum the. commission to which he was entitled under the agreement; the balance being the amount for which the court directed a verdict in their favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The agreement provides for the payment to the salesman of 7% per cent, on the net amount of commissions received on sales in his territory, also for a commission of 2 per cent, on contract jobs, and then follow the clauses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">\u201cThe parties of the first part agree to loan and advance to the party of the second part $75 per week, which amounts shall be charged against and deducted from his commissions. The parties of the first part need not make any further advances when the account of the party of the second part has been overdrawn.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">The respondents contend that the use of the word \u201cloan\u201d requires the construction that the moneys drawn by their employ\u00e9 were loaned to him, and, the moneys thus drawn being in excess of\u00a1 the commissions, there is an implied promise for their repayment. But the language of the agreement is not simply that the employers were to-\u201cloan\u201d $75 per week to the employ\u00e9, but that they agreed to \u201cloan and advance\u201d him that amount, which sums are to be charged against and deducted from his commissions; and the employers need not make \u201cany further advances\u201d\u2014not \u201cany further loans\u201d\u2014when the employes account has been \u201coverdrawn.\u201d The intention - of the parties is thus evident that moneys paid to defendant under the contract should be treated as advances against his commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">This construction requires the application o\u00a3 the doctrine that where a contract of employment provides for \u00e1dvances to the employ\u00e9, which advances are to be charged to and deducted from the commissions agreed to be paid to him as the same may accrue, the employer cannot, in the absence of either an express or implied agreement or promise to repay any excess of advances over the commissions earned, recover from the employe such excess.
