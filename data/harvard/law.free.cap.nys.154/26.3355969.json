The summons was returnable on March 12, 1915, and was served on the defendant Realty Company on March 2, 1915, together with a verified complaint setting forth that the Realty Company was indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of $105 for broker\u2019s commissions for procuring a tenant for certain premises owned by said company. On March 4, 1915, the Realty Company made a motion for an order interpleading said Louis C. Schliep, and permitting said Realty Company to pay the amount of plaintiff\u2019s claim into court.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab\"><bracketnum>[ 1 ]</bracketnum> The affidavit upon which this order was based is wholly insufficient to authorize an order of interpleader. It alleges that a claim has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>been made upon the Realty Company by Schliep for payment of an amount of money equal to the sum claimed by plaintiff, but it utterly fails to show that this claim has the slightest foundation, or that the Realty Company cannot determine without risk to whom the fund should be paid. A mere assertion of a claim is not enough to sustain the order. Pouch v. Prudential Ins. Co., 204 N. Y. 281, 97 N. E. 731, Ann. Cas. 1913C, 1191. The affidavit also fails to show that plaintiff and Schliep were not claiming under separate contracts. Upon the hearing of the motion for the order of interpleader, the plaintiff appeared and filed an affidavit, in which it set forth by its president that Schliep was unknown to it, and so far as it knew had no connection with the transaction. There is nothing in the record before this court showing that Schliep appeared on the hearing, although it is shown that the \u201caffidavit and notice of motion\u201d were served on him on March 5, 1915. On March 12, 1915, an order was entered to the effect that upon payment into court by the defendant Ludin Realty Company of the sum of $105 and interest said Eouis C. Schliep be substituted as said defendant in the above action in place of the defendant Ludin Realty Company. It also provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-5\">\u201cOrdered, that the plaintiff have leave to amend the summons and complaint or to serve a supplemental summons and complaint herein in such manner as it may be advised within five (5) days after service upon its attorneys of a copy of this order with notice of entry, and that it serve a copy of the said amended summons and complaint upon said Louis C. Schliep; and unless the said Louis 0. Schliep, the substituted defendant herein, shall appear and answer the said complaint within six (6) days after service thereof, the said substituted defendant be debarred from all claim or title to the fund deposited as aforesaid. It is further ordered, that the above-entitled action be adjourned to the 23d day of March, 1915, upon the calendar of this court for trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">It nowhere appears in the return that any summons was ever served upon Schliep, and the return declares that upon the adjourned day \u201cthe plaintiff took judgment on the verified complaint.\u201d Apparently no one appeared for either the Realty Company or Schliep. It is undisputed that upon this judgment the plaintiff obtained the possession of the fund theretofore paid into court by the Realty Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\"><bracketnum>[2-4]</bracketnum> The practice in cases of interpleader is clear. \u201cThe order should require him to' appear and answer the complaint in the same time that a defendant is required to answer a summons.\u201d McElroy v. Baer, 13 Daly, 442; Greenblatt v. Mendelsohn, 46 Misc. Rep. 554, 92 N. Y. Supp. 963. And the order in this case expressly provided: \u201cAnd that it serve a copy of said, amended summons and complaint upon said Louis C. Schliep.\u201d By the failure to comply with this order and the entry of the judgment aforesaid, Schliep is foreclosed of his right to establish a claim to the fund, and the judgment so entered is absolutely void. A void judgment may be appealed from. Catlin v. Rundell, 1 App. Div. 157, 37 N. Y. Supp. 979; Wands v. Robarge, 24 Misc. Rep. 273, 53 N. Y. Supp 700. And a void judgment may be considered in existence for the purpose of permitting the Appellate Term to reverse. Loeb v. Smith, 24 Misc. Rep. 200, 52 N. Y. Supp. 677.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">Judgment and order reversed, with costs against the plaintiff, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>new trial ordered. The plaintiff is also directed to restore the fund to the custody of the Municipal Court within five days after the service of a copy of the order entered herein with notice of entry thereof. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
