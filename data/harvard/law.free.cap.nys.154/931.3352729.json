The plaintiff\u2019s physicians said that death was the result of spinal concussion resulting from the accident, while the defendant\u2019s doctors testified that death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>was due to the independent agency of erysipelas, accompanied by pneumonia. On cross-examination of Dr. Starr, a witness for the plaintiff, it clearly^ appeared that his conclusion was not wholly based upon the hypothesis contained in the question propounded, but that it was based upon the evidence given in his presence, upon the trial. An exception, taken to the refusal of the court to strike out the answer of the witness, presents a reversible error. See Marx v. Ontario Beach H. &amp; A. Co., 211 N. Y. 33, 105 N. E. <em>97.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">Judgment and order reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
