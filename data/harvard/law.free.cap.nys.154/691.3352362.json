After defendant\u2019s counsel had failed to have the trial judge charge that deceased had no right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>to assume as a matter of law that the car would be under control-as it approached him, and other similar requests, the judge leaving that question to the jury, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel requested the court to charge that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-5\">\u201cMr. Seney [the deceased] was not bound, as a matter o\u00ed law, although he saw the car coming toward him in the distance, to wait until it passed, but he had a right to rely upon the motorman exercising due and reasonable care to permit him to cross the track in safety.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">That was charged, and the defendant\u2019s counsel excepted. If Seney saw this car approaching, and it was so near and going so fast as liable to strike him before he could cross, it could not be said as a matter of law that he would have a right to rely upon the motorman exercising reasonable care. That question should have been left as it had been charged. It was for the jury to say whether, under all the circumstances, he had the right to rely upon the motorman exercising due care. Nardi v. Richmond Light &amp; Railroad Co., 153 App. Div. 388, 138 N. Y. Supp. 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">The judgment and order should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
