The complaint then goes on to state in detail the carrying out of this agreement as to 360 bales. It is then alleged that prior to the delivery of any of the 360 bales\u2014\u2022</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\">\u201cthe plaintiff and defendant agreed that they would include in their joint adventure or partnership another lot of camel\u2019s hair stock of the class known in the trade as \u2018Grade A,\u2019 which said purchase was to he made in the same manner as the other said purchase, viz., in the name of the defendant to be received, held, and disposed of for the joint account of the plaintiff and defendant and stored in the defendant\u2019s name, the plaintiff and defendant to share equally in the profits and losses thereof, and each to be interested in said account to the extent of an undivided one-half thereof.\u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Then follow allegations tending to show that defendant purchased in his own name and for his own benefit, concealing the fact from the plaintiff, a considerable quantity of the specified goods which he has resold and as to which he has refused to account. The prayer is the usual one for a dissolution of the partnership or joint adventure, an accounting, and judgment according to the outcome of the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The complaint, as we consider, sufficiently alleges a joint adventure between the parties, a relation which has been defined as a \u201climited partnership, not limited in the statutory sense as to liability, but as to scope and duration, and under our law joint adventures and partnerships .are governed by the same rules.\u201d Ross v. Willet, <em>76 </em>Hun, 211, 27 N. Y. Supp. 785.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> There being alleged a partnership as to the profits and losses, and a joint interest in the subject-matter of the adventure, an action in equity for an accounting is the appropriate remedy. Whether or not the defendant is accountable for the profits, if any, realized upon the purchase and sale of the goods, as to which he had refused to-account, will depend upon the proofs at the trial; but, if the facts be as alleged in the complaint, a clear case for an accounting as to these goods will apparently be made out.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">The order appealed from must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the demurrer overruled, with $10 costs, with leave to defendant to withdraw the demurrer and answer within 20 days, upon payment of costs in all courts. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
