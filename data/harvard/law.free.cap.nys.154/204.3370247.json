The goods were delivered, and the defendant paid on account thereof the sum of $200. In November following the sale, one of the plaintiffs had a conversation with the defendant, in which she asked to be allowed to return two or three of the garments sold, which she claimed did not fit. This request plaintiffs refused to grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Defendant\u2019s testimony upon this question is that she told plaintiffs she \u201ccould not dispose of the dresses because they were not made properly.\u201d This conversation she says occurred \u201cquite a few weeks later\u201d; that is, after the sale. Subsequently defendant sent a package to plaintiffs, and a statement showing a balance due plaintiffs of $3.28, and a check for that amount. The plaintiffs refused to accept the package, and returned the check, and brought suit for the $60. In the letter to plaintiffs on November 3, 1913, she states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-6\">\u201cWe have several dresses from your regular stock, bought from you early in the season, which are total misfits and are therefore unsalable. Will you kindly advise what you will do in the matter?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">We think that the retention of the goods by the defendant for so long a time after the purchase remits the defendant to her right to recover damages for breach of warranty, if any such right exists, and that she had no right under section 129 of the Personal Property Law to return the goods. That section reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-8\">\u201cThe buyer is deemed to have accepted the goods when he intimates <em>to </em>the seller that he has accepted them, or when the goods have been delivered to him and he does an act in relation to them which is inconsistent with the ownership of the seller, or when, after the lapse of a reasonable time, he retains the goods without intimating to the seller that he has rejected them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">See, also, Silberstein v. Blum, 153 N. Y. Supp. 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">Judgment reversed, and new'trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
