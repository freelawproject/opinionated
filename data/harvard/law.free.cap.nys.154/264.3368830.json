Plaintiff and defendant had been dealing together for about two years. Usually Mr. Isaac L. Miller, defendant\u2019s president, called personally at plaintiff\u2019s store and gave orders for the goods. In other transactions it was understood that Isaac L. Miller would call up over the telephone and then send a written order signed by himself. On several occasions George D. Miller, son of Isaac L. Miller, was sent with these written orders and received the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-14\">For the goods for which this action was brought, it is conceded that no prior telephone order had been received, and the goods were delivered on orders signed by George D. Miller, and in two instances written by George D. Miller on the plaintiff\u2019s stationery and in the presence of plaintiff\u2019s salesman. The receipts were signed in defendant\u2019s name, \u201cby George D. Miller.\u201d No proof was given that the goods were ever received by the defendant. On the contrary, George D. Miller testified that he received the goods himself and sold them and appropriated the proceeds to his own use.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-15\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> There was no proof of agency in George D. Miller, nor could any agency be presumed from the course of dealing between the parties. The plaintiff made no effort to have the orders confirmed prior to delivery. There would seem to be no legal ground for holding the defendant liable for the goods sold and delivered to George D. Miller.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-16\">Tudgment reversed, with costs, and complaint dismissed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
