See section 1722, Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-3\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> We think, however, that the chattels should not be delivered to either claimant without proper security that the chattels or their value will be returned to the other claimant, if he should be successful in establishing his claim thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">The order appealed from must therefore be modified, by requiring Julius Cahn, before the chattels are delivered to him, to give security, to be approved as to form and amount by a justice of the Supreme Court upon two days\u2019 notice to the plaintiff or his attorney, for a return of the chattels or their value to the plaintiff in case he shall establish his right to the possession thereof.
