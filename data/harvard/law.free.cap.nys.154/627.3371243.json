His compensation is at the rate of $1,920 per year, and he is paid $160 monthly.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">(14) An office boy, whose duty is to \u201crun\u201d (sic) errands and perform the other customary work of an office boy. His compensation is at the rate of $300 per year, and he is paid $25 monthly.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">(15) A telephone switchboard operator in defendant\u2019s office, who makes telephonic connections on a telephone switchboard. Her compensation is at the rate of $600 per year, and she is paid $50 monthly.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">(16) Aclerk in defendant\u2019s office, who performs general office work of a clerical nature. His compensation is at the rate of $1,080 per year, and he is paid $90 monthly.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-12\">All of the foregoing persons are paid in cash, with the exception of No. 7, the civil engineer.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-13\">The questions submitted for our determination are:</p>\n<p id=\"b663-14\">(1) Do all of the foregoing persons come within article 2, \u00a7 11, of the Labor Law? and (2) if not, do any of them, and, if so, which ones? (3) Does the payment of the civil engineer (No. 7) by check as hereinbefore recited constitute a compliance with section 11, art. 2, of the Labor Law?</p>\n<p id=\"b663-15\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> (A) Section 11, above referred to, requires every corporation (except such as operate steam surface railroads, as to which a different provision is made) to \u201cpay weekly to each employ\u00e9 the <em>wages </em>earned by him to a day not more than six days prior to the date of such payment.\u201d Section 2 of article 1 of the Labor Law defines the term \u201cemploy\u00e9\u201d to mean \u201ca mechanic, workingman, or laborer, who works for another for hire.\u201d I think it unnecessary, in view of this simple and precise definition, to have recourse to the decisions to which we are cited, where the terms used in statutes preferring, in cases of insolvency, the claims of various classes of wage-earners, workers, or other employ\u00e9s have been defined. This court has recently reviewed many of this class of decisions in Farnum v. Harrison (April 16, 1915) 152 N. Y. Supp. 835. Each statute must necessarily be largely a law unto itself, and its proper interpretation must depend upon its own particular language. The statutory definition, which we have here to guide us, prevents any peculiar force being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>attached to the terms \u201cwages\u201d and \u201cemploy\u00e9,\u201d and confines us to the simple inquiry whether, among the persons enumerated in the submission, there are any who are properly to be classed as .mechanics, workingmen, or laborers, as those terms are ordinarily and naturally used.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\"><bracketnum>[2, 3]</bracketnum> It scarcely needs argument to show that the following are not within the defined classes: Stenographer, accountant, typist, chain-man, levelman, civil engineers (7 and 9), booldceeper, draftsman, structural designer, and clerk. The case of the rodman is not so clear. His work is apparently largely of a manual nature; but, as his duty is to \u201cassist civil engineers\u201d in their work, I think that we may infer that he belongs to the engineering staff, although in an humble capacity, rather than among the workingmen or laborers, and is accordingly not within the statutory definition. The blueprinter is also on the border line; but I am inclined to think that he may, upon a liberal construction, be deemed to be a workingman, as is the office boy. The matron, upon a similar construction, should be classed as a workingwoman, as should the telephone switchboard operator. The chauffeur is (or ought to be) a mechanic, but in any case he is a workingman.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> (B) Section 10, above referred to, requires various classes of corporations of which defendant is one to \u201cpay to each employ\u00e9 * * * the wages earned by such employ\u00e9 in cash,\u201d and prohibits payment in scrip or store orders. The statutory definition of the term \u201cemploy\u00e9,\u201d to which I have hereinbefore referred, applies as well to section 10 as to section 11. It is clear, therefore, that the civil engineer (No. 7), inasmuch as he is not a workingman, mechanic, or laborer, is not within the statute, and payment of his compensation by check is lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> In respect of the form of the judgment to be entered, the submission is equivocal. The submission states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-10\">\u201cIt is agreed that, if <em>the questions </em>above stated be decided by the court in the affirmative, the plaintiff shall have a judgment for a penalty of $50, in accordance with section 12 of article 2 of the Labor Law, but, if said questions above stated be decided in favor of the defendant, the defendant shall \u2022have judgment to the effect that it is not liable to any penalty, and shall be entitled to a dismissal of the proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">Both parties waive costs. No provision, in terms at least, seems to have been made for a decision partly in plaintiff\u2019s favor and partly in favor of defendant. But inasmuch as we have no power to pass upon moot questions, or to act in an advisory capacity merely, I assume that it was the intention of the parties that defendant should be cast for a penalty of $50 in the event it was found to have violated the law in the case of any of the persons enumerated in the submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-12\">Therefore there should be judgment for plaintiff for $50. Settle order on notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-13\">INGRAHAM, P. J., and CLARKE and SCOTT, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"pAZd-\">DOWLING, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"AvW_\">The commissioner of labor heretofore gave notice to defendant to comply with section 21 of the Labor Law (chapter 36, Laws 1909) by paying the employ\u00e9s enumerated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>this submission weekly, instead of monthly. Having in mind the beneficent purpose which the Legislature had in view in the passage of the statute in question, of protecting employ\u00e9s from unscrupulous employers, who by deferring the payment of the wages due them might ultimately defraud them of the fruits of weeks of labor, amounting in the aggregate to large sums, such a construction should be given to the provisions of the law as will extend its protection to as wide a field of labor as possible, consistent with the language used therein. The statute is not a penal or preferential one, as was the case where the term \u201cemploy\u00e9\u201d .has been limited in its meaning, but is one involving an exercise of the police power of the state and should be liberally construed. So viewed, the definition (in section 2, art. 1, of the Labor Law) of an employ\u00e9 \u201cas a mechanic, workingman or laborer, working for another for hire,\u201d talcen in conjunction with the term \u201cwages\u201d used in section 11 thereof, appear to me to clearly indicate the employ\u00e9s whom the statute was intended to protect as those engaged in manual or mechanical labor,' as distinguished from those occupying professional or executive positions, and who were paid on the smaller scale of wages, rather than on the higher one of salary. It was these subordinates embraced in the first class, whose dependence on their toil made the loss of any of its recompense a serious matter to them, and whose comparative helplessness to assert their right to the prompt reward of their labor, whom the state was solicitous of protecting, rather -than the better paid and more independent members of the second class.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-3\">This being so, it would seem that the following employ\u00e9s of defendant are not within the scope of the statute: (H) A civil engineer, in charge of -elevated railroad improvements and -extension work, both office and field, at a yearly salary of $3,000. (J) A civil engineer, in charge of field work in constructing sections of elevated railway, at a yearly salary of $2,700. (L) A draftsman, who designs and drafts in connection with elevated railroad improvements and extensions, at an annual salary of $1,800. (N) A structural designer, drawing designs for elevated railroad structures, at an annual salary of $1,920.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">The remaining employ\u00e9s referred to in the submission I think all come under the scope of the statute, viz.: (A) A stenographer. (B) An accountant. (C) A typist. (D) A rodman, who assists civil engineers by carrying and holding graduated surveyor\u2019s rods used in their work. (E) A chainman, who assists civil engineers by carrying and measuring with a surveyor\u2019s chain. (F) A levelman, who assists civil engineers by using an engineer\u2019s level. (G) A blueprinter. (I) A matron, who assists a large staff of telephone operators in caring for their rooms, preparation of their food, and the like. (K) A bookkeeper. (M) A chauffeur. (O) An office boy. (P) A telephone switchboard operator. (Q) A clerk, doing general work.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
