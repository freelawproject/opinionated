Witte assigned to the plaintiff the certificate of indebtedness to the extent of $1,400, with interest from that date. Judgment has been given against this defendant, the Ferncliff Cemetery Association, in favor of the plaintiff, for $1,985 and costs, and in favor of defendant John C. Witte for $494.84.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-27\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> A cemetery association incorporated, as was the appellant, pursuant to Membership Corporation Raw (chapter 559, .Raws 1895) \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>54, has power to issue certificates of indebtedness \u201cif it be indebted for lands purchased for cemetery purposes, or for services rendered or materials furnished in preserving or improving its cemetery.\u201d In the case at bar, upon undisputed evidence, the certificate in suit was not issued for either of the purposes authorized by the statute, nor, so far as the evidence discloses, was any service rendered or thing sold or money advanced to the defendant association by John C. Witte for which it was indebted to him. Witte and certain associates purchased property and founded the Ferncliff Realty Company, to which, for $400,000 of the capital stock of said company, they transferred the property. The Ferncliff Realty Company then transferred this property to the defendant association.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The services seem to have been rendered by Witte in his own behalf in looking up and acquiring the land, for which he was apparently compensated by the receipt of stock in the Ferncliff Realty Company as for promotion expense of that company. Even if some part of the expenses may have been \u201cincidental expenses and liabilities of the corporation\u201d defendant, which might be paid out of the proceeds of the sales of the use of lots (section 50, c. 559, Laws 1895), there is no authority in the statute for the issuance of a certificate of indebtedness for such liabilities of the association. \u201cIn providing for the issuance of certificates of a certain nature and for a certain purpose, the statute impliedly prohibited such an association from issuing any others.\u201d Amer. Ex. Nat. Bank v. Woodlawn Cemetery, 194 N. Y. 116, 127, 87 N. E. 107. The issuance of the certificate in suit was therefore ultra vires of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The plaintiff, as assignee, takes with no better rights than were possessed by the assignor, as this certificate was a nonnegotiable promise to pay money. Amer. Ex. Nat. Bank v. Woodlawn Cemetery, supra, 194 N. Y. 127, 128, 87 N. E. 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">As plaintiff failed to allege or prove facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against the defendant, the judgment should be reversed, with costs to the appellant, and the complaint dismissed, with costs to the defendant association. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
