Goodstein the west half of store 356 West 125th street for 5 years at a rental of $1,200 for first year, $1,200 for the second year, $1,300 for third year, $1,400 for fourth year, $1,500 for fifth year. If candy naan takes rear as agreed, the rent is to be paid $100 per year less\u2014\u2022 rear to he 7 feet wide. Rent paid to July 31,1914.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">\u201cG. L. Lawrence, per A. Lucker.\u201d \u2022</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">The tenant produced the proposed lease submitted to .him by plaintiff, and admitted that he had declined to sign it.' He called no witnesses, and the landlord was precluded by the ruling of the court from showing any conversations between Lucker and the defendant leading up to the making of his agreement, upon the ground that such conversations were \u201cmerged in the terms of the instrument now in evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> It is perfectly clear that the written instrument offered by the tenant does not constitute a lease for five years. It is simply an agreement to make a lease and a letting of the premises to defendant from the time it was made until July 31, 1914, for the sum of $100. The words of the writing are not in prassenti. The only fixed term therein is for five years, but when the term begins or ends, or how the rent is to be paid, are not stated. It is not even signed by the tenant, and many essential elements of a lease are lacking. In Sherry v. Proal, 131 App. Div. 774, 116 N. Y. Supp. 234, Mr. Justice Scott, writing the opinion, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-10\">\u201cThe rule * * * is well established, and often enforced, that in a case wherein, under the statute of frauds, a tenancy can lawfully be created by parol, and the parties have orally agreed upon, all the terms, nothing being left to be done except to put them in writing, the letting will be deemed to be complete, although the stipulated written lease should never be executed. This well-recognized rule is, however, to be applied with caution, and is never applied unless it clearly appears that every material term of the contract was in fact agreed to, and that nothing remained for future negotiations and agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Applying this rule to the case at bar, it is idle to claim that the defendant herein had a valid subsisting 5-year lease of the premises, the term to begin on July 31st.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The respondent claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">\u201cIf it is an invalid or void lease for any reason, and this is by no means conceded, it is the contention of the respondent that since the tenant entered into possession of the premises with the consent of the landlord, and paid rent according to the terms of the agreement, and since the agreement provides for an annual rental, that there is an implied tenancy from year to year, which would be from May 7, 1914, when the tenant concededly entered into possession, to May 7, 1915, or that he was nothing less in any event than a tenant at will, and under such circumstances, since the property was located in the city of New York, that he became a tenant for an indefinite term by virtue of section 232 of the Real Property Law, and that his term therefore did not terminate until the 1st day of May next after his possession commenced under the agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">This point was not raised in the court below, and we would not now consider it, except, as there must be a new trial, the respondent should not be allowed to cloud the issue. The legal effect of the written instrument under which defendant entered into possession of the premises is that he had a right of occupancy thereunder for a definite term \u2014that is, from May 7th to July 31st\u2014for which he paid $100. When he overstayed, without a further leasing, he became a tenant at will or at sufferance, and at most was only entitled to 30 days\u2019 notice to surrender, and this he received.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> It was conceded that Tucker had no written authority to act as agent for the landlord; consequently he could not make a lease for five years. Real Property Law, \u00a7 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">Final order reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
