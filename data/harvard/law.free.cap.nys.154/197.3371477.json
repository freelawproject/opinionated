The motion was denied apparently for want of power.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-11\">While it has been held that the Municipal Court Act permits a party to raise an objection to the jurisdiction of the court over the person only at the trial, or, if he fails to appear, by appeal to this court under section 311 of that statute, and that the Municipal Court has no power to rule upon an objection to- its jurisdiction, except upon the trial (Friedberger v. Stulpnagel, 59 Misc. Rep. 498, 112 N. Y. Supp. 89; Review &amp; Record Co. v. Gilbreth, 65 Misc. Rep. 503, 120 N. Y. Supp. 100), nevertheless where a defendant, though appearing specially in order to preserve his rights to object to the jurisdiction of the court, seeks a trial at which the objection can be properly raised, the court may properly open the so-called \u201cdefault\u201d and set the case for traverse to the jurisdiction and then try the issues raised by the traverse (Roberts &amp; Lewis Co. v. Dale, 74 Misc. Rep. 392, 132 N. Y. Supp. 404).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-12\">Although the appellant did not specifically ask to have the case set down for traverse, under his prayer for other and further relief the court had power to follow the procedure referred to in the case cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-13\">Order reversed, with $10 costs, and motion remitted to the court below for action as herein indicated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
