At the close of the trial the court below gave a judgment for the defendant. It is clear that there was a material defect in plaintiff\u2019s proof. What relation William Thomas, who concededly indorsed upon the check the words \u201cCharles Thomas &amp; Sons,\u201d stood to these parties, in no way appears, nor was it shown that Charles \u2022 Thomas &amp; Sons transferred the check to the plaintiff. The judgment should be affirmed, without prejudice to a new action.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs, but without prejudice to a new action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
