All that was served upon him was a typewritten paper, with a typewritten signature and without venue. We do not think that that was a sufficient compliance with the provision of section 261 of the charter of the city of New York, which requires a verified statement showing in detail the property alleged to have been damaged or destroyed and the value thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-17\">The determination appealed from should therefore be affirmed, with costs. Order filed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
