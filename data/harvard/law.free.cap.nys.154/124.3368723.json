Sweeney, upon the plaintiff; the assault having taken place upon government property at Ellis Island, the defendant being the owner of a boat of which Sweeney was captain.</p>\n<p id=\"Arl\">The learned judge below submitted to the jury as one of the vital questions, if not the most important question, in the case, whether Capt. Sweeney was acting within the scope of his authority under his employment by the defendant. The verdict of the jury, as recited by the foreman, was :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-16\">\u201cWe find in favor of the defendant, and we also request that Capt. Sweeney be censured.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-17\">This request, which, of co\u00farse, was. superfluous and improper, is entirely consistent with the verdict for the defendant. In other words, the jury found that Sweeney was not acting within the scope of his authority, but desired to have him censured for personal misconduct. In that respect this case differs materially from Conrey v. Metropolitan St. R. Co., 73 App. Div. 518, 77 N. Y. Supp. 222, where the verdict was \u201cfor defendant, with recommendation to the court to award plaintiff $300 as compensation for her losses.\u201d The two clauses of this verdict were plainly inconsistent, and the verdict could not be understood. In the case at bar, it seems to me that the verdict was clearly for the defendant, and the superfluous recommendation should merely have been stricken out by the court, by way of correction, and disregarded. See Brigg v. Hilton, 99 N. Y. 517, 531, 3 N. E. 51, 52 Am. Rep. 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Order reversed, with costs; verdict reinstated and corrected, by striking therefrom \u201cand we also request that Capt. Sweeney be censured\u201d; and judgment directed to be entered thereon in favor of defendant, with costs in the court below. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
