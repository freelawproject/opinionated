C.

British &amp; Foreign Marine Ins. Co., Limited, 130 Fed. 860, 65 C. C. A. 344. I think that this objection was good and should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> But, apart therefrom, there is no evidence that any such parol agreement was made. The only witness on behalf of defendants testified that he had personally delivered these goods to plaintiff \u201cto deliver them to the consignee and to pay for the charges.\u201d This is far from establishing an agreement on the part of the plaintiff to accept the goods on condition of collecting the freight charges from the consignee.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Further, defendants claim, as the bill of lading contains a printed instruction, \u201cIf charges are to be prepaid, write or stamp here 'To be prepaid/ \u201d and there was no such stamp thereon, that this is proof of plaintiff\u2019s agreement; but the mere fact that charges were not to be prepaid does not establish an agreement on the part of the plaintiff to look to the consignee for payment of the freight.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur. .</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
