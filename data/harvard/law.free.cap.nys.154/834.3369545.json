Houge v. Woodruff (D. C.) 19 Fed. 136. As vendor of the cargo, plaintiff was entitled to hold the vendee for any loss occasioned by his delay in taking delivery of the goods. Personal Property Law (Laws of 1911, c. 571) \u00a7 132. Having a temporary possession of the brick barge, plaintiff could recover any damages for detaining the barge beyond a reasonable period for her discharge, since presumably he could otherwise employ the barge, or, if he chose, turn the barge back to its owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\"><bracketnum>[3, 4]</bracketnum> On November 17, 1913, defendant purchased this cargo. Up to January 1, 1914, weather conditions were favorable for discharging. But it was not till March 12th that the cargo was out. The question of the brick\u2019s quality, including its alleged rejection and defendant\u2019s repurchase of it in January, were left to the jury, with the controverted testimony as to the daily rate to unload such a cargo, as well as the effect of a trade custom for other dealers in brick to take and pay for portions of such cargoes, by delivery from the barge\u2019s rail.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-11\">Defendant urges that the court should have charged defendant\u2019s request that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-12\">\u201cIt was incumbent upon the plaintiff to protect the brick from the weather while it was on the barge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-13\">After remarking that there was no evidence on the subject, the learned court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-14\">\u201cI suppose it was the plaintiff\u2019s business to exercise reasonable care for the protection of the brick until it was actually taken in charge of by the defendant. * * * I will leave it to the jury to say in this case, from all the facts and circumstances, who, if either of these parties, was responsible for any damage done to the brick while on the barge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-15\">The answer had pleaded that after this alleged repurchase\u2014that is, while the. barge was at 133d street, Manhattanville\u2014there was severe cold and freezing weather, when the brick, being uncovered, froze to the deck. This was set up to excuse delay in' taking the brick at that time, and not as a counterclaim. But if defendant had not attempted to rescind the contract of purchase, and the discharge had gone on with ordinary dispatch, the cargo should have been all unladen before January 1st. After that, the vessel could be considered as on demur-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>rage; and, once a vessel is on demurrage, the obligation to pay is continuous, regardless of weather or holidays thereafter, until the discharge is completed. Baldwin v. Sullivan Timber Co., 142 N. Y. 279, 285, 36 N. E. 1060. Hence the request to charge in the abstract, as to the duty to protect the cargo, was not applicable. The instruction as given was as - favorable to defendant as its pleadings and proofs warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> The plaintiff proved payment of the hire of the barge at $5 a day, and $38 for extra towage in shifting the barge to three different unloading berths. The summons and complaint were served on March 31st, but this payment appears to have been receipted for on April 4th, five days after suit brought. The action, however, was not premature. Proof of detention, with a market value for use of such a craft, made out plaintiff\u2019s right of action. This receipted bill was evidence to protect defendant against a possible double liability to the barge owner. While the cause of action must arise before beginning suit, the evidence to sustain it need not then be complete. Gillies v. Manhattan Beach Improvement Co., 147 N. Y. 420, 42 N. E. 196. We cannot say that the weight of evidence is against the verdict, or that the damages found were excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">The judgment and order are therefore affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
