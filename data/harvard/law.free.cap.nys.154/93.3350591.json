Met. St. Ry. Co., 68 App. Div. 49, 74 N. Y. Supp. 267. That case did not involve the opening of a gate at all, and the elaborate discussion by the court of the particular facts there' at issue is sufficient to show that no possible analogy to the case at bar can be drawn therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">The respondent also contends that \u201cthe duty of defendant to give the plaintiff reasonable opportunity to board the car did not arise until the car had been brought to a stop,\u201d citing Schwartz v. N. Y. C. Ry. Co., 55 Misc. Rep. 214, 105 N. Y. Supp. 1; but a reference to that case shows that it involved only the language employed in the charge and has no bearing whatsoever on the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">Th,e judgment is therefore reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
