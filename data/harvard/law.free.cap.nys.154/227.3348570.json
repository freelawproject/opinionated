C. The defendant is a steamship line operating between New York and Norfolk, Va. The bill of lading which it issued for the goods provided that the company agreed to de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>liver it to the place of destination if on its line, \u201cotherwise to deliver to another carrier on the route to said destination.\u201d Charlotte, N. C., is not on the defendant\u2019s line, and the bill of lading was routed \u201cSeaboard Air Line,\u201d meaning that the defendant would deliver the shipment to that line at Norfolk, Va., for transportation to Charlotte, which is a point on the Seaboard Air Line.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">At the trial the defendant\u2019s attorney requested the court to charge the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\">\u201cThat the contract of the defendant, the bill of lading, was only to carry to Norfolk, Va., on the route to the destination of the shipment in question, and unless plaintiff shows that the shipment was not delivered in good condition by this defendant to the Seaboard Air Line Railway at Norfolk, Va., the next carrier at that point, the verdict of the jury must be for the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">This the court refused, and in another place charged the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\">\u201cThere is a federal statute, * * * and in that law it is provided as follows: \u2018Any common carrier, railroad or transportation company receiving property'for transportation from a point in one state to a point in another state, shall issue a receipt or a bill of lading therefor, and shall be liable to the lawful holder thereof for any loss damage or injury to such property caused by it or by any common carrier, railroad or transportation company to which such property may be delivered, or over whose line or lines such property may pass, and no contract receipt, rule or regulation shall exempt such common carrier, railroad or transportation company from the liability hereby imposed.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">The court further charged that for the purpose of this case the plaintiff need only prove that the damage to the goods occurred somewhere between New York and Charlotte, N. C.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">The statute quoted above and charged to the jury as the law in this case is a portion of section 20 of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended June 29, 1906. Section 1 of the act as amended by Act June 18, 1910, defines what carriers are subject to its provisions as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-11\">\u201cThat the provisions of this act shall apply to any corporation or any person or persons engaged in the transportation of oil or other commodity, except water and except natural or artificial gas by means of pipe lines, * * * and to any common carrier or carriers engaged in the transportation of passengers or property wholly by railroad (or partly by railroad and partly by water when both are used under a common contract, management or arrangement for a continuous carriage or shipment) from one state or territory of the United States or the District of Columbia, to any other state or territory of the United States or the District of Columbia. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-12\">In the case at bar, while the bill of lading shows an arrangement between the 'shipper and the defendant to receive the goods and deliver them to the Seaboard Air Line for further transportation to Charlotte, N. C., the record is barren of any evidence showing an arrangement of any kind between the defendant and the railroad company to whom the property was to be delivered, and it was therefore not brought by the proof within the terms of the act, which only applies to transportation by water under a common \u201ccontrol, management or arrangement for a continuous carriage or shipment\u201d with a railroad company. Mutual Transit Co. v. U. S., 178 Fed. 664, 102 C. C. A. 164. It is unnecessary here to consider what evidence might be sufficient to' es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>tablish a \u201ccommon arrangement,\u201d since there is a total absence of any such evidence. There is not even any evidence in the record as to the making of a joint rate by the defendant with the Seaboard Air Line to bring the case within the terms of U. S. v. Wood (D. C.) 145 Fed. 405, relied upon by the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">BIJUR, J., concurs.
