Among these is the vacatur of the election of the two directors who were unanimously elected, and the provision that at the new election the stock should be voted as it was owned at the date of the election ordered to be set aside. It is unnecessary, however, to discuss these provisions of the order. The question whether or not a new electibn should be had turns upon the right of Walter J. Conlon to vote upon the shares of stock held by him in trust for delivery to Wm. F. Haynie when he should pay for them. The precise terms of the resolution under which this stock was issued does not appear, but the statement of its purport, made by Haynie and not disputed is r</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">\u201cThat 30 shares of preferred and 30 shares of the common stock be issued to W. J. Conlon, to be held in trust by him for me until payment of the said 30 shares of preferred stock, whereupon the preferred stock paid for was to be transferred to me, together with share for share of said common stock.\u201d \u25a0</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">It appeared that before the election Haynie had paid to the company and it had accepted payment for 20 shares of the stock, and a 10 per cent, deposit on the purchase price of the remaining 10 shares. The justice at Special Term construed the resolution to mean that the whole 30 shares remained the property of the company, as unissued stock, until the full purchase price was paid for 30 shares. We do not so construe the resolution as recited by Haynie. Equitably, at least, he became the owner of and entitled to the beneficial use of the stock as he paid for it, unless it was expressly provided, as it does not appear to have been, that he should be entitled to none of the stock until he had paid for all. If we are right in this construction, at least 20 of the votes which Conlon tendered on account of this stock, in Haynie\u2019s interest, were properly received and counted, and these votes were sufficient to elect Haynie, Moran, and Regina Conlon, even if all the other votes condemned by the Special Term were thrown out.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">The order appealed from must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the proceeding dismissed, with $10 costs. All concur</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
