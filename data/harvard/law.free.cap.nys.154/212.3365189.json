This place in the ceiling subsequently fell, causing the injuries to Pasquale'\"s wife for which this action was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The defendant swore no witnesses, but offered in evidence a lease, which leased the premises from the defendant to Maria La Cagnina and Vincenzo Messineo. This lease ran from December 1, 1911, until the 1st day of December, 1914, and obligated the lessees to \u201ctake good care of the premises and make all repairs, inside and outside, at their own proper costs and expense.\u201d It will be seen that this lease covered the term when the ceiling fell. There is not the slightest testimony in the case that the defendant had retained possession or control of any portion of the demised premises, nor was it shown that she had assumed in any manner to make repairs. It follows that the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Judgment reversed, with costs, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant as of one appeal to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
