Simmelink v. Supreme Court, Independent Order of Foresters, 152 App. Div. 892, 136 N. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>Y. Supp. 527; Id., 162 App. Div. 934, 147 N. Y. Supp. 1141. That was a suit against_ this same defendant by a member of a local court of this state, to enjoin defendant from increasing the rate of the assessments, and judgment was rendered to that effect; but upon appeal to this court the judgment was reversed and a new trial ordered. While we held in that case that the action was prematurely brought, we also held that the right of the defendant to increase its rates is controlled by the laws of Canada, and not by the laws of this state. The case was again before this court after a new trial, and a judgment dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s complaint was affirmed on the authority of our former decision. 162 App. Div. 934, 147 N. Y. Supp. 1141. While the recent decision of the federal Supreme Court in the case of Supreme Council of the Royal Arcanum v. Green, 237 U. S. 531, 35 Sup. Ct. 724, 59 L. Ed.---, decided June 1, 1915, reversing the Court of Appeals (206 N. Y. 591, 100 N. E. 411), involved the question of the full faith and credit article of the federal Constitution (Const. U. S., art. 4, \u00a7 1), the reasoning of the opinion in that case, as well as the decision in Canadian Southern Ry. Co. v. Gebhard, 109 U. S. 527, 3 Sup. Ct. 363, 27 L. Ed. 1020, seem to support the view that the law of Canada is controlling upon the question involved in the case in hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">We are therefore of the opinion that we are required to reverse the judgment and dismiss the complaint, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
