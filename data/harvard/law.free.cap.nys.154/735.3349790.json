The letter was written after the accident, and after Sundquist had left the defendant\u2019s employ. While Sundquist was called by the defendant and gave testimony in its behalf, the letter related to new matter called out by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel upon cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> A party may not thus impeach his own witness (Power v. Brooklyn Heights R. R. Co., 157 App. Div. 400, 142 N. Y. Supp. 592), and this rule seems Jo hold good where a party upon cross-examination calls out new matter from a witness sworn by his adversary. The cases are collated and discussed in Deutschmann v. Third Ave. R. R. Co., 78 App. Div. 413, 79 N. Y. Supp. 1043, where it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-5\">\u201cThe rule Is well settled that where, upon-cross-examination, a party calls from an opposing witness matters not brought out on his direct examination, he makes the witness to that extent his own, and as to such new matters he cannot contradict him in regard to it, since the effect would be to permit one to impeach his own witness [citing cases].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-6\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The examination respecting the contents of the letter was not to refresh the recollection of a hostile witness, by whose testimony counsel had been surprised, as is sometimes permitted (Bullard v. Pearsall, 53 N. Y. 230; Coulter v. American Merchants\u2019 Un. Ex. Co., 56 N. Y. 585; People v. De Martini, 213 N. Y. 203, 107 N. E. 501; Iveson v. United Traction Co., 159 App. Div. 27, 143 N. Y. Supp. 1077), but, as was specifically stated by counsel, to affect his credibility. We hold that the contents of this letter was of no probative force to show the condition of the machine, and that it could not be received for the purpose of impeaching the witness or affecting his credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">The judgment and order should therefore be reversed, and a Hew trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
