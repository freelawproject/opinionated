Y. Supp. 1116. The referee, however, having in the course of the trial allowed the complaint to be amended, so as to claim damages for breach of contract, proceeded over defendant\u2019s objection and exception to report upon the whole case, including that introduced by the amendment allowed by him. He thus awarded plaintiff $20,000 damages, but stated that to hold the complaint as one for services would necessitate a finding for defendant. Having held that the complaint originally alleged a cause of action for compensation, and, as counsel for plaintiff then conceded, for compensation only, also that the referee was without power to allow an amendment changing the complaint (157 App. Div. 481, 142 N. Y. Supp. 572), we cannot sustain the judgment wherein plaintiff\u2019s recovery is wholly for a nonreferable cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-17\">The judgment is therefore reversed, and a new trial granted; costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-18\">. JENKS, P. J., and THOMAS, CARR, and PUTNAM, JJ., concur. RICH, J., votes for affirmance,.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
