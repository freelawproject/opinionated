On the other hand, the defendants consented to his leaving, and should not be allowed to retain the $50 deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-18\">The recovery should therefore be reduced to $62, the amount of the deposit, and $12 for the three days\u2019 work for which he received no pay, plus the costs and disbursements, and, as modified, affirmed, without costs to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
