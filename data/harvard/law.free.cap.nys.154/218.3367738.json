Plaintiff insists, and successfully maintained below, that to \u201cremove violations\u201d means to do the work required by the violations. He also maintains that, if the phrase be ambiguous, subsequent conversations between the parties, in one of which one of the defendants \u201cpromised me it would be fixed,\u201d became material, and proof that what was meant was actually doing the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-20\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> In the first place, I do not regard the phrase as ambiguous. A person who desires work, alterations, or repairs to be made to a house before he takes title can very readily express that requirement in natural terms. To express it in terms of \u201cremoving violations\u201d would be a circumlocution unreasonable and unnatural. But, however that may be, in this particular case one of the most important \u201cviolations\u201d was that certain alterations had been made in the house a year and a half before this agreement was made, and the violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>consisted of \u201cNo plans filed and approved.\u201d Consequently, on the very face of the paper, if any ambiguity existed, it was by the nature of the case resolved against plaintiff\u2019s contention. No^ amount of physical repairs or alterations could remove a violation which consisted of the fact that previous repairs had been made without the approval of the plans therefor. Defendants proved conclusively by the records and officials of the tenement house department that the four violations enumerated had been canceled of record in the department. What actually happened was that, six years later, plaintiff, having perhaps partly been urged thereto by a refiling of these violations by certain inspectors (for reasons which do not appear) determined to reconstruct part of the premises, and finding, under the Tenement House Daw as amended in 1912 (Laws 1912, c. 454), that this would have to be done with some slight reconstruction, desires to charge defendants with the expense therefor. I can see no basis for the claim, either under the contract alleged to have been broken or in any principle of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The learned judge below also submitted to the consideration of the jury, as one of the elements of damage, rents lost during the period of reconstruction. Plaintiff respondent concedes, as it must, that this was improper, but urges that it was not prejudicial, because the verdict was for less than the amount which plaintiff claims the repairs cost. In view of our opinion on the merits of plaintiff\u2019s claim, this error becomes immaterial; otherwise, it would have, of itself, required a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Judgment reversed, with costs, and complaint dismissed, with costs to appellant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
