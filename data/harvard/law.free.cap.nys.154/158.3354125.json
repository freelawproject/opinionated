Clause 24 of the bill of lading, in so far as material, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-5\">\u201cNotice of any claim arising under this bill of lading must be given by the consignee to the bteamer\u2019s agent at the port of destination within 48 hours after the landing of or failure to deliver goods, and the claim to be preferred within 90 days from the date hereof at the offices of the owner of the steamer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The vessel was discharged of her cargo July 4, 1914, and the plaintiff testified that on or about June 27, 1914, he notified the \u201cforeman at the; dock\u201d of the loss of the property. This testimony, however, is vague and indefinite, and entitled to little, if any, weight. On or about July 22d, within the 90-day period prescribed by the bill of lading, the plaintiff preferred a claim for the loss of the lemons in accordance with the bill of lading.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Most, if not all, of the cases cited by the respondent in support of the judgment are cases of damage, or of loss and damage, to goods. The importance and reasonableness of timely notice of damage to goods is at once apparent, for it gives the carrier an opportunity to examine them, so as to explain or meet any charge of neglect or breach of contract which may be made by the consignee. Where there is a total failure to deliver, however, as in this case, although it is desirable that early notice be given the carrier, there is no such necessity for prompt notice as in cases of damage. Here, as before stated, the plaintiff complied with the terms of the contract requiring a claim to be preferred within 90 days of the date of the bill of lading. Did he fail to observe the requirement that notice of any claim must be given \u201cwithin 48 hours after the landing of or failure to deliver goods ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">As the defendant does not claim that the goods were landed, the plaintiff, assuming the stipulation to be reasonable, was only bound to give the notice within 48 hours after the failure to deliver. The ship was discharged of her cargo July 4th; but, as the carrier had a reasonable time within which to make delivery, the failure to deliver down to July 4th was not necessarily a breach of the contract in that respect. Further, under the contract the defendant had the right to carry the lemons in the Manchester Merchant, the vessel named therein, or in the \u201cfollowing steamship or any other of the same line\u201d; so that, in the event of shipment and delivery by the following steamship, that fact would seem to be a defense to a claim for failure to deliver.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">Under the circumstances of this case, we are of opinion thati the claim given July 22d, within 90 days of the date of the bill of lading, not only answered the requirements of the contract as a claim preferred against the defendant, but that it was also sufficient notice of the loss of the property, that the plaintiff established a prima facie case, and that it was error to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
