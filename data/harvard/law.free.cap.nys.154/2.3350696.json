I was the last to get off. I commenced to get off, and he whistled, and I fell off.\u201d She subsequently stated that the person who whistled was the conductor, and then subsequently stated that \"she did not remember hearing the conductor whistle. The facts testified to were palpably insufficient to make out a prima facie case of negligence, no negligence of any kind was shown, and- the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">Judgment reversed, with costs, and complaint dismissed, with costs.
