Plaintiff testified in substance that defendant called upon him with this third person, and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-17\">\u201c \u2018Well, you know me. I don\u2019t want you to sue him. You can look to me for the payment. I will pay that sum of money; but that payment will be made in two payments, one in May and one in June.\u2019 I said to him: \u2018If you promise to pay me that, I will have no further business with Levine; it is agreeable to me. I am willing to give you the time to pay it, but you must pay me.\u2019 And I said: T won\u2019t sue Levine under those circumstances, but will look to you for payment.\u2019 And then he said to me, as Mr. Levine was going out, he said: T want you to insist upon getting paid by him, but you can look to me for the payment of that money.\u2019 And I said: \u2018All right\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-18\">It seems to me to be perfectly evident that the promise of defendant, as thus testified to, was purely collateral, and not original, and therefore, in order to be enforceable, should, under the statute of frauds, have been in writing. The question is not whether there was a consideration for defendant\u2019s promise, because, concededly, plaintiff\u2019s agreement not to sue the third party would have constituted such consideration. The point is, first, that the original debt was not extinguished, because the third person still remains liable; and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>second, that it is not shown that defendant\u2019s promise is \u201cfounded on a new consideration <em>moving </em>to the promisor, and <em>beneficial </em>to him.\u201d See White v. Rintoul, 108 N. Y. 222, at 227, 15 N. E. 318, reviewing Ackley v. Parmenter, 98 N. Y. 425, 50 Am. Rep. 693; also Raabe v. Squier, 148 N. Y. 87, 42 N. E. 516; Brumm v. Gilbert, 50 App. Div. 430, 64 N.
