But the charge here made was established by his having and possessing these revolvers in his bedroom, defendant not being a citizen. Penal Law, \u00a7 1897. Hence evidence of good character could have little weight. People v. Greenwall, 108 N. Y. 296, 302, 15 N. E. 404, 2 Am. St. Rep. 415. Further, such testimony was not directed to show defendant\u2019s peaceful and inoffensive traits, the only subject for such character evidence. Wigmore, \u00a7 59; People v. Van Gaasbeck, 189 N. Y. 408, 82 N. E. 718, 22 L. R. A. (N. S.) 650, 12 Ann. Cas. 745.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-19\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The good reputation, testified to, started into circulation and was built up after the defendant\u2019s arrest. Not being ante litem motam, it was subject to be swayed by the feelings which arose after his arrest, and therefore was incompetent. State v. Sprague, 64 N. J. Law, 419, 45 Atl. 788. Such testimony, having come in improperly, was rightly stricken out.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-20\">The judgment of conviction is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
