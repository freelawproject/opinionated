If the defendant asserts a common law conditional privilege, the\n   plaintiff bears the additional burden of overcoming that privilege to prevail on the defamation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   It is well established that, in a defamation action, a defendant may assert a qualified or conditional privilege.\n   <em>\n    SeeGohari v.

A common law conditional privilege arises from the principle that a defendant may not be held liable for an otherwise provable defamatory statement if publication of the statement advances social interests that outweigh a plaintiff's reputational interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marchesi v.

A defendant may also assert what has been described in case law as a First Amendment conditional privilege. The Supreme Court has stated that statements pertaining to public officials and to public figures on matters of public concern merit special protection in our society; thus, such statements are subject to a conditional privilege-the First Amendment conditional privilege-that is overcome only by actual malice,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"knowledge that [the statement] was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\"\n   <em>\n    New York Times Co. v.

If a conditional privilege is established, a plaintiff seeking to rebut the privilege must do so by demonstrating that the defendant made the alleged statement with malice, defined as \"a person's actual knowledge that his or her statement is false, coupled with his or her intent to deceive another by means of that statement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3705186\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/424/294/#p307\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3705186\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/424/294/#p307\">\n    at 307-08\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3705186\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/424/294/#p307\">\n    35 A.3d at 1148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations, brackets, and internal quotation marks omitted). The definition of malice-a person's actual knowledge that his or her statement is false, coupled with his or her intent to deceive another by means of the statement-does not cover the standard of proof necessary to overcome the conditional privilege. Case law demonstrates that the standard of proof that is required to overcome a First Amendment conditional privilege is clear and convincing evidence of knowledge of a statement's falsity or reckless disregard of whether the statement was false or not.\n   <em>\n    SeeNew York Times\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379234\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/254/#p279\">\n    376 U.S. at 279-80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379234\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/254/#p279\">\n    84 S.Ct. 710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, however, it is the standard of proof that an individual must satisfy to overcome a common law conditional privilege,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , to establish malice, in a purely private defamation action that is at issue. For the reasons stated below, we hold that, in a purely private defamation action, an individual asserting a defamation claim must overcome a common law conditional privilege by a preponderance of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The facts giving rise to this purely private defamation action are as follows. Katherine Seley-Radtke (\"Seley-Radtke\"), Ph.D., Petitioner, and Ramachandra S. Hosmane, Ph.D. (\"Hosmane\"), Respondent, were colleagues in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (\"UMBC\"). Hosmane was employed as a professor of chemistry at UMBC from 1982 until 2010,\n   when he resigned following allegations of sexual assault of a graduate student. Based on allegations that Hosmane had sexually assaulted one of his\n   graduate students, Brahmi Shukla (\"Shukla\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   UMBC officials conducted an administrative investigation and determined that Hosmane had violated UMBC's sexual harassment policy. In addition to allegations of sexual assault, UMBC investigated whether an e-mail sent to Shukla regarding the sexual assault, which Shukla characterized as threatening, had been authored by Hosmane. The e-mail was sent from a person named \"Nimmy Watson,\" a person unknown to Shukla; Shukla testified at trial that the contents of the Watson e-mail \"scared\" her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   According to Hosmane, on December 10, 2009, UMBC informed him of the results of the administrative investigation and provided him with three options: (1) submit to a two-year suspension without pay; (2) avail himself of the administrative appeal process; or (3) retire without the results of the investigation being made public. Hosmane selected the third option and resigned and retired, effective January 1, 2010. As a result, UMBC did not make public the findings of its investigation, nor was Hosmane sanctioned by UMBC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Office of the State's Attorney for Baltimore County, however, opened a criminal case against Hosmane stemming from the alleged sexual assault, and charged him with fourth-degree sex offense and second-degree assault in the District Court of Maryland sitting for Baltimore County, but subsequently nolle prossed the charges. Hosmane and Shukla entered into a settlement agreement (\"the settlement agreement\") concerning the sexual assault matter, in which Hosmane was to pay Shukla $10,000 and Shukla was to withdraw any civil and criminal claims against Hosmane related to the alleged sexual assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On December 10, 2010, Hosmane filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (\"the circuit court\") a complaint against UMBC and other defendants related to his resignation from UMBC (\"the UMBC case\"). While the UMBC case was pending, Hosmane submitted a Maryland Public Information Act\n   (\"public information\") request seeking documents from UMBC. In August 2011, Hosmane received a number of documents from UMBC as a result of the public information request. As a result, on July 6, 2012, Hosmane filed in the circuit court a two-count complaint against Seley-Radtke seeking damages for defamation and false light invasion of privacy. In the complaint, Hosmane alleged \"some of the numerous instances in which\" Seley-Radtke had defamed him:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   a. In 2009, [Seley-Radtke] told the chemistry department chair, at least one co-worker, general counsel for UMBC, and others, that [Hosmane] had keys to many offices in the chemistry department, that he had stolen private documents regarding [Seley-Radtke] out of said offices, and that he had even sold some of the documents for money. None of these assertions are true.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   b. In February 2010, after [Hosmane]'s employment with UMBC had come to an end, [Seley-Radtke] wrote an email to the chemistry department chair and general counsel for UMBC in which she stated, among several defamatory statements, that [Hosmane] \"is an unbalanced individual who has done some crazy and bizarre things, not to mention he's prone to sudden outbursts, and given the shootings in Alabama, I worry for my safety and for that of anyone around me ....\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   c. The same days she wrote the email referenced above, [Seley-Radtke] wrote another email to these same people and referred to [Hosmane] \"stealing documents\" and implied that [Hosmane] had falsely accused one of his students of trying to kill him. In this second email, [Seley-Radtke] also called [Hosmane] a \"nutcase,\" and said that \"it is not far-fetched that he could do something crazy at this point ....\" These assertions are all demonstrably untrue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   d. [Seley-Radtke] has additionally claimed in communicating with others that [Hosmane] was banned from campus following the end of his employment at UMBC and that he was also not allowed to meet with his former students. This is not true.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   e. [Seley-Radtke] has also claimed that [Hosmane], in speaking with his students, would make comments to them about [Seley-Radtke]'s body parts, particularly her breasts and buttocks. This is totally false.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   f. Moreover, [Seley-Radtke] has claimed that [Hosmane] tried to convince one of [Seley-Radtke]'s former post-doctorate students to file a formal complaint against [Seley-Radtke], even going so far as to offer the student a job if he would file the complaint. Again, this is entirely untrue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (Ellipses in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In her answer to the complaint, among other things, Seley-Radtke raised the affirmative defense of privilege, contending that \"[a]ny statements made by [her] were privileged and confidential communications.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On April 4, 2013, Hosmane filed an amended complaint naming UMBC and the State as additional defendants in the Seley-Radtke case. The circuit court subsequently consolidated the UMBC case and the Seley-Radtke case for the purpose of trial only. On April 29, 2014, the circuit court granted the State's and UMBC's motion for summary judgment as to Hosmane's claims for defamation and invasion of privacy in the Seley-Radtke case on the basis of sovereign immunity. The UMBC case and Hosmane's case against Seley-Radtke proceeded to a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Prior to trial, Hosmane filed a motion in limine concerning several evidentiary matters; a few days later, Hosmane filed a supplemental motion in limine. In relevant part, Hosmane sought to exclude documents and testimony concerning the settlement agreement between himself and Shukla, and to redact from two exhibits the following language from Seley-Radtke's e-mail: \"Btw ... I spoke to Det. John Taylor the other day and he mentioned that there are some potential new charges against [Hosmane], due to the harassing emails. Can't that keep him off campus?\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Ellipsis in original). During trial, the circuit court denied the motion in limine as to those two\n   matters. As such, during trial, Shukla was permitted to testify about the settlement agreement, and Seley-Radtke's un-redacted e-mails, containing the language that Hosmane sought to redact, were admitted into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At trial, due to a scheduling issue, Shukla was permitted testify first. Shukla testified about the settlement agreement. Specifically, during Shukla's direct examination, the following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [SELEY-RADTKE'S COUNSEL]: Now you also mentioned, a while back in your testimony, that there were criminal charges filed against [ ] Hosmane for the\n   assault? What happened with that criminal case?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [HOSMANE'S COUNSEL]: Objection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer the question.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [SHUKLA]: It was dismissed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [SELEY-RADTKE'S COUNSEL]: And why was it dismissed to your knowledge?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [HOSMANE'S COUNSEL]: Objection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer the question.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [SHUKLA]: Because there was a settlement of about $10,000 made, and therefore it was dismissed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [HOSMANE'S COUNSEL]: Objection. Move to strike.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   THE COURT: Overruled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Before closing arguments, the circuit court reviewed proposed verdict sheets and jury instructions with the attorneys. Hosmane requested that the circuit court give a jury instruction on the republication or repetition of defamatory statements. The circuit court declined to give the instruction. The circuit court, however, gave an instruction concerning opinions as defamation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   During review of the proposed verdict sheets and jury instructions, Seley-Radtke contended that her statements regarding Hosmane were protected by a common interest conditional privilege.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The circuit court ruled, as a matter of law,\n   that Seley-Radtke was entitled to a conditional privilege for the allegedly defamatory statements; Hosmane did not argue otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As to the standard for overcoming the conditional privilege, Hosmane requested that the circuit court give Maryland Civil Pattern Jury Instruction 12:12, which provides that, \"[i]n order to recover, the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant made the statement with actual knowledge that the statement was false, coupled with the intent to deceive another person by means of the statement.\" MPJI-Cv 12:12 (4th ed., 2013 Supp.). On the other hand, Seley-Radtke argued that the pattern jury instruction should be \"modified\" to use language that the standard of proof is clear and convincing evidence, not a preponderance of the evidence. The circuit court agreed with Seley-Radtke and determined that the applicable standard of proof to overcome the conditional privilege was clear and convincing evidence. The circuit court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   [T]he cases that have been cited so far, and I've reviewed them ... I have yet to find in any of the cases that have been cited in this court this morning and handed to the court, plus other cases I've read where there's a suggestion that the privilege is defeated by a preponderance of the evidence. I just haven't seen it. ... So, ... the instruction is gonna be by clear and convincing evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The circuit court instructed the jury as follows: \"In order to recover, the Plaintiff must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the Defendant made the statements with actual knowledge that the statement was false, coupled with the intent to deceive another person by means of the statement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On May 9, 2014, the jury found in favor of Seley-Radtke. Hosmane noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. On February 24, 2016, in a reported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals reversed the circuit court's judgment and remanded the case for a new trial.\n   <em>\n    SeeHosmane v.

The Court of Special Appeals explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Recognizing that malice means different things in different context, the Court [of Appeals has] adopted a \"uniform standard\" or definition of malice applicable to determining abuse of a conditional privilege and required the same to establish punitive damages. This did not change or elevate the burden of proof in common law defamation required to overcome the conditional privilege. No where [sic] did the Court of Appeals say that plaintiffs in a common law defamation action, involving private individuals, not implicating the First Amendment, were entitled to higher protection and hence the higher burden of proof....

Specifically, Seley-Radtke argues that the malice required for overcoming a common law conditional privilege and the malice required for establishing punitive damages are, by definition, the same, and, therefore, the standard of proof necessary to prove both should be the same. Seley-Radtke asserts that adopting the clear and convincing evidence standard as the standard of proof necessary to overcome a common law conditional privilege promotes the State's policy of\n   protecting free speech and furthers consistency in the law of defamation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Hosmane responds that the application of the preponderance of the evidence standard to overcome a common law conditional privilege is consistent with well-established Maryland case law. Hosmane contends that the statements in this case that are subject to a common law conditional privilege are already sufficiently protected by the definition of malice, which requires a plaintiff to prove \"that the defendant made his or her statement with malice, defined as a person's actual knowledge that his or her statement is false, coupled with his or her intent to deceive another by means of the statement.\" (Citation,\n   internal quotation marks, and emphasis omitted). Hosmane argues that this definition of malice sufficiently protects privileged communications and that the standard of proof need not be clear and convincing evidence. Hosmane asserts that applying the clear and convincing evidence standard of proof would significantly narrow the distinction between purely private defamation actions and those implicating the First Amendment, thereby providing fewer protections to private individuals who have been defamed. Additionally, Hosmane maintains that adopting the clear and convincing evidence standard would upend well-established case law and create confusion in Maryland defamation jurisprudence rather than provide clarity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   This Court reviews a trial court's giving of a jury instruction for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    SeeKeller v.

The instant case presents the question whether the New York Times'[s] knowing-or-reckless-falsity standard applies in a state civil libel action brought not by a public official or a public figure but by a private individual for a defamatory falsehood uttered in a news broadcast by a radio station about the\n   individual's involvement in an event of public or general interest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    Rosenbloom\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026680\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/29/#p30\">\n    403 U.S. at 30-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026680\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/29/#p30\">\n    91 S.Ct. 1811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (plurality opinion) (citations, footnotes, and internal quotation marks omitted).

We conclude that these considerations are as weighty today as they were when\n   <em>\n    Jacron\n   </em>\n   was decided, and we determine that the burden for a private individual seeking to overcome a common law\n   conditional privilege in a purely private defamation action should not be raised beyond requiring the plaintiff to demonstrate malice, already a heightened definition, and that the applicable standard is proof by a preponderance of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   We observe that Seley-Radtke's concern regarding juror confusion is largely alleviated by the Maryland Civil Pattern Jury Instructions on overcoming a common law conditional privilege. Whereas the jury instructions for punitive damages refer to \"malice\" and state the standard of proof is clear and convincing evidence, the instructions regarding common law conditional privilege do not use the word \"malice,\" but rather provide its definition: \"[i]n order to recover, the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant made the statement with actual knowledge that the statement was false, coupled with the intent to deceive another person by means of the statement.\" MPJI-Cv 12:12 (4th ed., 2013 Supp.). As the Court of Special Appeals explained, \"there should be no confusion in those cases where the jury is instructed as to the punitive damages malice standard, clear and convincing evidence, and overcoming the conditional privilege, preponderance of the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Hosmane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237507\" index=\"296\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/227/11/#p16\">\n    227 Md.App. at 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237507\" index=\"297\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/227/11/#p16\">\n    132 A.3d at 358-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In the Court of Special Appeals, Hosmane presented three questions pertaining to the order of witnesses and the admission of evidence at trial:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   [1].

In her opening brief in this Court, Seley-Radtke does not address the evidentiary matters. It is undisputed that Seley-Radtke did not raise the evidentiary matters as an issue for\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   review, except in the footnote above, or address the evidentiary matters in her opening brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Hosmane did not file a conditional cross-petition for a writ of\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   in this Court raising any issue as to the Court of\n   Special Appeals's determination on the evidentiary\n   matters, which was in Hosmane's favor. Hosmane also did not file a cross-petition for a writ of\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   raising any issue as to the evidentiary matters that were not addressed by the Court of Special Appeals-namely, allowing Seley-Radtke's witness, Shukla, to testify first and the circuit court's ruling on additional jury instructions. In his brief in this Court, Hosmane points out that Seley-Radtke did not challenge the determination reached by the Court of Special Appeals as to the evidentiary matters (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the redaction of e-mails and exclusion of testimony regarding the settlement agreement) and contends that, even if this Court reversed the Court of Special Appeals's judgment with respect to the common law conditional privilege jury instruction, he would nonetheless be entitled to reversal and a new trial based on the determination of the Court of Special Appeals. And, in his brief in this Court, Hosmane attempts to raise issues as to the evidentiary matters that were not addressed by the Court of Special Appeals-specifically, Shukla testifying first and additional jury instruction issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   In a reply brief, lumping the four evidentiary issues together, Seley-Radtke contends that Hosmane failed to preserve for this Court's review any issue as to the evidentiary issues by failing to file a conditional cross-petition for a writ of\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Having set out the parties' positions, we determine that the evidentiary issues that the Court of Special Appeals did not address-namely, Shukla testifying first and the additional jury instruction issues-are clearly not preserved for this Court's review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Md. R. 8-131(b)(1) (\"Unless otherwise provided by the order granting the writ of certiorari, in reviewing a decision rendered by the Court of Special Appeals or by a circuit court acting in an appellate capacity, the Court of Appeals ordinarily will consider only an issue that has been raised in the petition for certiorari or any cross-petition and that has been preserved for review by the Court of Appeals.\"). Given that the issues are not preserved for this Court's review, remanding to the Court of Special Appeals for a\n   determination on the evidentiary issues on which the Court of Special Appeals did not offer guidance is not warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   As to the remaining evidentiary issues, it is clear that the Court of Special Appeals deemed its holding with respect to the common law conditional privilege jury instruction to be dispositive of the case and, therefore, offered guidance only on the two evidentiary issues involving redaction of e-mails and testimony about the sexual assault settlement agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the other hand, had the Court of Special Appeals affirmed on the issue of the standard of proof required to overcome common law conditional privilege, it would have been necessary for the Court of Special Appeals to address the evidentiary issues and issue holdings as to them. In the strictest sense, the two issues on which the Court of Special Appeals offered guidance are not properly before this Court because: Seley-Radtke raised the issues only in a footnote in her petition for a writ\n   of\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   asking that this Court review the matters only to the extent necessary to resolve the case; Hosmane did not file a cross-petition; and the Court of Special Appeals did not issue a formal holding on the matters, but rather gave guidance. We could end discussion of the evidentiary matters here. But, nonetheless, to the extent that the Court of Special Appeals issued guidance on these evidentiary matters, and recognizing that the issues are likely to recur at the new trial, we note that we agree with the guidance offered by the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   We concur with the Court of Special Appeals that Seley-Radtke's un-redacted email referencing the \"potential\n   new charges\" for Hosmane and \"harassing emails\" allegedly sent by Hosmane and Shukla's testimony regarding the settlement agreement were not relevant to the defamation claim.\n   <em>\n    SeeHosmane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237507\" index=\"302\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/227/11/#p16\">\n    227 Md.App. at 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237507\" index=\"303\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/227/11/#p16\">\n    132 A.3d at 361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At trial, Hosmane stipulated that Seley-Radtke's e-mail references to the settlement agreement were not part of the defamation claims. Yet, the circuit court allowed Shukla to testify, over Hosmane's objections, to the settlement agreement's existence, its effect on the criminal charges filed against Hosmane, and the amount of the settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Put plainly, we fail to discern that Shukla's testimony regarding the settlement agreement bore any relevance to the instant case. Indeed, evidence is relevant only if it has \"any tendency to make the existence of any fact\n   <strong>\n    that is of consequence to the determination of the action\n   </strong>\n   more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\" Md. R. 5-401 (emphasis added). From our perspective, Shukla's testimony regarding the settlement agreement did not render any fact that was of consequence to the defamation action more probable or less probable. In the Court of Special of Appeals, Seley-Radtke argued that Shukla's testimony was offered to corroborate the portions of Seley-Radtke's e-mails referencing the settlement agreement, thereby making the truth of Seley-Radtke's other allegedly defamatory statements more likely.\n   <em>\n    SeeHosmane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237507\" index=\"304\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/227/11/#p16\">\n    227 Md.App. at 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237507\" index=\"305\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/227/11/#p16\">\n    132 A.3d at 360-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We, however, are unpersuaded that Shukla's testimony as to the settlement agreement has any bearing on the veracity of assertions contained in Seley-Radtke's e-mails.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Similarly, the two sentences of Seley-Radtke's e-mail referencing the \"potential new charges\" for Hosmane and \"harassing emails\" allegedly sent by Hosmane were also not relevant\n   to the defamation case. In the circuit court, Seley-Radtke's counsel argued that no redaction of the two sentences was appropriate because the two sentences were necessary to provide \"context\" for the other allegedly defamatory statements in the e-mails. Again, the determination as to relevance of evidence is based on whether its admission would render a determinative fact more probable or less probable. Plainly, the reference in Seley-Radtke's e-mails to Hosmane's alleged harassing e-mails and alleged new charges does not tend to make Seley-Radtke's other statements more probable or less probable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   In offering guidance, the Court of Special Appeals assessed the admissibility of the challenged evidence as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   The two sentences in the two February 23, 2010 emails referring to new charges against [Hosmane] and \"harassing emails\" he purportedly sent, and testimony by Dr. Shukla about any settlement agreement for an alleged assault, were not relevant to any issue in this defamation case. These two pieces of evidence were highly prejudicial and cast [Hosmane] in a very bad light,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   that he was a sex abuser who paid money to resolve such a claim, that he was the subject of unrelated charges and was sending harassing emails. The purported purpose for which these two pieces of evidence were offered was that if the jury believed that parts of the email were true then the jury could or should find that the remainder of the emails was true. The logic does not follow. Unrelated charges and alleged harassing emails, or that [Hosmane] may have in fact settled an unrelated civil matter, do not make the other allegations in the emails more likely or less likely true, and have no relevancy to this defamation action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   <em>\n    Hosmane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237507\" index=\"306\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/227/11/#p16\">\n    227 Md.App. at 32-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237507\" index=\"307\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/227/11/#p16\">\n    132 A.3d at 361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnotes omitted). We agree with the Court of Special Appeals's evaluation. Given the lack of relevance and prejudicial nature of this evidence-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the harassing e-mails, unrelated charges, and\n   Shukla's testimony regarding the settlement agreement-the evidence was not admissible at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

As the Majority opinion accurately notes, this Court has not yet determined the standard of proof of malice necessary to overcome a common law conditional privilege in a defamation case. There is nearly an even split among other American jurisdictions between a standard of preponderance of the evidence and a standard of clear and convincing proof.

However, whenever a conditional privilege exists-and it is undisputed that a conditional privilege applies in this case unless malice is proven-there are inevitably public or social interests at stake.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gohari v.

For example, those who report serious violations of the law or other wrongdoing to public authorities may rely on the public interest privilege-a common law conditional privilege. In this case, the common interest privilege is invoked in the context of what the defendant asserted was continuing wrongful conduct by one who had been found to have violated the university's rules against sexual harassment as a result of a complaint of sexual assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   The conditional privileges thus offer to those who come\n   forward to report wrongdoing some protection against attempts to discourage such reporting with the threat of a defamation lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   The interest relied upon by the Majority opinion, though an important one, is that of the plaintiff alone. The interests underlying the conditional privileges are not just those of the defendant, but of other individuals and sometimes society at large. In light of the public and societal interests at stake, I agree with those courts that have opted for a standard of clear and convincing evidence. Adoption of the clear and convincing standard would not mean that a conditional privilege could not be overcome-just that it would take more than a slight tip of the scales to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Judge Getty has indicated that he joins this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-158\">\n    \"Under Maryland law, to present a prima facie case for defamation, a plaintiff must ordinarily establish that the defendant made a defamatory statement to a third person; that the statement was false; that the defendant was legally at fault in making the statement; and that the plaintiff thereby suffered harm.\" Gohari v.

Furthermore, the plaintiff in Chesapeake Publ'g Corp., id.at 293, 661 A.2d at 1173, was a public figure; thus, this Court's requirement that the plaintiff prove malice by clear and convincing evidence was proper and distinguishable from the present case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-174\">\n    The Court of Special Appeals declined to address the first question, explaining that \"circumstances similar to those that gave rise to that question are unlikely to reoccur upon retrial.\" Hosmane,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237507\" index=\"328\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/227/11/#p16\">\n     227 Md.App. at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    16 n.1,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237507\" index=\"329\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/227/11/#p16\">\n     132 A.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    351 n.1. The record reveals that the decision to permit Seley-Radtke's witness, Shukla, to testify first stemmed from a scheduling issue. The circuit court provided the following explanation to the jury to assuage any concern that the jury might attach significance to Shukla being called as the first witness:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-175\">\n    Now folks, you'll come to find out as we progress in this trial that trials are dynamic things. There's little changes here and there. Ordinarily the Plaintiff, that is the party who brings an action, calls witnesses first, and when they're, they've presented their case the other side can call witnesses. But because trials are dynamic sometimes there's some flexibility necessary, and for scheduling purposes we're going to allow the defense to call Ms. Shukla out of turn. Ordinarily [Hosmane's counsel] would call all of his witnesses first, but we're going to allow the defense to call Ms. Shukla first. She will be directed, that is to say that they will get, they, the defense, will ask her questions first and then [Hosmane's counsel] will be permitted to ask cross examination questions. Ordinarily, and you should give no significance to this, it's just a scheduling change, ordinarily the Plaintiff would call all of their witnesses first and would ask them direct examination questions and the defense would cross examine, and then any witnesses the defense wanted to call, they would ask their questions first and then the other side, the Plaintiff, would be able to cross examine. I'm sure you all appreciate that and understand that. It's really a scheduling issue. So if you'll call Ms. Shukla we'll get her going.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-176\">\n    In his brief in this Court, Hosmane raises an additional jury instruction issue not addressed by the Court of Special Appeals. Specifically, Hosmane contends that the circuit court erred by declining to provide a jury instruction on the republication or repetition of defamatory material. Additionally, Hosmane argues that the circuit court's instruction regarding opinions as defamation was improper. On brief, Hosmane offers little information to this Court on these contentions, merely directing this Court to his filings in the Court of Special Appeals.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-177\">\n    The Court of Special Appeals reversed the circuit court on the premier issue of the standard of proof required to rebut a common law conditional privilege, which necessarily mandated a new trial. It was within the Court of Special Appeals's sound discretion to address, not address, provide guidance, or issue a holding on evidentiary issues where the Court had already determined that reversal and remand for a new trial would occur. The Court of Special Appeals was not required to issue a holding as to these additional evidentiary issues where it was remanding for a new trial on another issue, although it may be a good practice generally to do so.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-178\">\n    Seley-Radtke's e-mails make only general reference to the settlement agreement:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-179\">\n    \"The charges weren't really dismissed, he settled out of court and also with the university....\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-180\">\n    \"Look, we all know two deals were struck and I understand why that was done. I get it! But the charges were dropped because of those deals, but not because [Hosmane] was innocent....\"\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-181\">\n    Indeed, the Watson e-mail, to which Seley-Radtke makes general reference, was never formally attributed to Hosmane.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
