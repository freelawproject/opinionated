Specifically, the defendant claims that the board improperly affirmed the decision of the commissioner\n   that the plaintiff's hypertension and heart disease were separate diseases, each with its own one year limitation period for filing a claim for benefits. We disagree with the defendant and, accordingly, affirm the decision of the board.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. The plaintiff was hired by the defendant as a police officer in 1996 and remained a regular member of that paid municipal police department at all points relevant to the present case. When he was hired, the plaintiff passed a preemployment physical examination that did not reveal any evidence of hypertension or heart disease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On March 10, 2011, the plaintiff suffered a myocardial infarction. The plaintiff underwent an angioplasty and stent implantation following a diagnosis of heart disease. He remained hospitalized for approximately four days after the procedure and was out of work for three or four months. The plaintiff was prescribed several medications for his heart disease. On March 14, 2011, the plaintiff filed a claim for benefits under \u00a7 7-433c for hypertension and heart disease. The plaintiff listed the date of injury as March 10, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the hearing before the commissioner, Roy Kellerman, the plaintiff's physician, testified that he began treating the plaintiff in 1995 for an ankle injury. The commissioner found that Kellerman had diagnosed the plaintiff with hypertension in October, 2009, and had conveyed that diagnosis to him. The commissioner concluded, therefore, that the plaintiff's claim for benefits related to hypertension was untimely because it was\n   filed more than one year after he became aware of his diagnosis of hypertension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On the basis of the testimony of Kellerman and Martin Krauthamer, a physician obtained by the defendant, the commissioner determined that the plaintiff's preexisting hypertension was a significant contributing factor in the development of his heart disease. The commissioner further found, however, that there were additional significant contributing factors in the development of the plaintiff's heart disease, including his high cholesterol and his gender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Accordingly, the commissioner dismissed the plaintiff's claim for benefits related to his hypertension as untimely, but granted his claim for benefits related to his heart disease and myocardial infarction. The defendant appealed to the board, and the board affirmed the decision of the commissioner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"As a threshold matter, we set forth the standard of review applicable to workers' compensation appeals.

This proposition applies as well to the provisions of [\u00a7] 7-433c ... because the measurement of the benefits to which a \u00a7 7-433c claimant is entitled is identical to the benefits that may be awarded to a [claimant] under ...

It is also not disputed that the plaintiff's claim for benefits related to his hypertension was not timely because it was filed in March, 2011, beyond one year from his diagnosis of hypertension. See footnote 5 of this opinion. On appeal, the defendant asserts that the board improperly concluded that the plaintiff's claim for benefits related to heart disease was timely filed because the heart disease was significantly related to the prior diagnosis for hypertension. Specifically, the defendant claims that, because the commissioner determined that the plaintiff's hypertension was a \"significant factor\" in his heart disease and the plaintiff never filed a timely claim for benefits related to hypertension, the plaintiff should be precluded from filing a claim for benefits related to the heart disease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We begin with the text of the statute. Section 7-433c (a) provides in relevant part: \"Notwithstanding any provision of chapter 568 or any other general statute, charter, special act or ordinance to the contrary, in the event a uniformed member of a paid municipal fire\n   department or a regular member of a paid municipal police department who successfully passed a physical examination on entry into such service, which examination failed to reveal any evidence of hypertension or heart disease, suffers either off duty or on duty any condition or impairment of health caused by hypertension or heart disease resulting in his death or his temporary or permanent, total or partial disability, he or his dependents, as the case may be, shall receive from his municipal employer compensation and medical care in the same amount and the same manner as that provided under chapter 568 if such death or disability was caused by a personal injury which arose out of and in the course of his employment and was suffered in the line of duty and within the scope of his employment ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"It is settled that, because ... \u00a7 7-433c (a) does not set forth a limitation period for filing a claim but provides for the administration of benefits in the same amount and the same manner as that provided under [the Workers' Compensation Act] if such death or disability was caused by a personal injury which arose out of and in the course of his employment, the one year limitation period of [General Statutes] \u00a7 31-294c (a) governs claims filed under \u00a7 7-433c.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Ciarlelli\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hamden\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344259\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/299/265/#p277\">\n    299 Conn. at 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20A.3d%201093\">\n    8 A.3d 1093\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The defendant asserts that the one year limitation period for all of the plaintiff's claims began to run on the date he was diagnosed with hypertension because the hypertension and heart disease were related. The plain language of \u00a7 7-433c belies that claim. Section 7-433c uses the phrase \"hypertension or heart disease\" repeatedly. \"We have held that the use of the word 'or' in a statute 'indicates a clear legislative intent of separability.' \"\n   <em>\n    Sams\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dept. of Environmental Protection\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=308%20Conn.%20359\">\n    308 Conn. 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 404,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=63%20A.3d%20953\">\n    63 A.3d 953\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). Thus, because \u00a7 7-433c is written in the disjunctive, we conclude\n   that a plaintiff can file a claim for benefits related to either hypertension or heart disease. Furthermore, the use of the disjunctive term \"or\" in \u00a7 7-433c indicates that the legislature intended\n   for hypertension and heart disease to be treated as two separate diseases for the purposes of \u00a7 7-433c. Accordingly, we conclude that the plain language of the statute demonstrates that the failure to file a timely claim for benefits related to hypertension does not bar a later timely claim for heart disease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Moreover, the medical evidence in the present case supports the board's conclusion that the plaintiff's hypertension and heart disease were separate medical conditions. The plaintiff's physician, Kellerman, testified that the hypertension and the myocardial infarction were separate medical conditions. Furthermore, the physician obtained by the defendant, Krauthamer, also recognized that hypertension and heart disease are separate medical conditions. Krauthamer testified that, although the plaintiff's \"hypertension is a significant factor in the causation of his [heart disease ],\" other risk factors-including age, and male gender-also played a role in the plaintiff's development of heart disease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Nevertheless, the defendant asserts that \u00a7 7-433c bars the plaintiff's claim for benefits pursuant to \u00a7 7-433c in the present case because the commissioner determined that his hypertension was a significant factor in his heart disease and therefore, the two are causally connected. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The plain language of \u00a7 7-433c demonstrates that a uniformed member of a paid municipal fire department or a regular member of a paid municipal police department is entitled to benefits under the statute when the officer meets the following requirements: (1) has passed a preemployment physical; (2) the preemployment physical failed to reveal any evidence of hypertension\n   or heart disease ; (3) suffers either off duty or on duty any condition or impairment of health; (4) the condition or impairment of health was caused by hypertension or heart disease ; and (5) the condition or impairment results in his death or his temporary or permanent, total or partial disability. The statute contains no other requirements to qualify for its benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Indeed, as this court has previously explained, unlike traditional workers' compensation, \u00a7 7-433c does not require that the claimant prove that the injury was caused by his or her employment. Instead, as this court has recognized, \"the underlying legislative purpose [of \u00a7 7-433c ] was social rather than medical. More specifically, the legislature's intent was to afford the named occupations with a bonus by way of a rebuttable presumption of compensability when, under the appropriate conditions, the employee suffered heart disease or hypertension.\"\n   <em>\n    Malchik\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Division of Criminal Justice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2636426\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/266/728/#p740\">\n    266 Conn. 728\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 740,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=835%20A.2d%20940\">\n    835 A.2d 940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003). This court has further explained that \" \u00a7 7-433c payments constitute special compensation, or even an outright bonus, to qualifying policemen and firemen. ... [T]he outright bonus provided by the statute is that the claimant is not required to prove that the heart disease is causally connected to his employment, which he would ordinarily have to establish in order to receive benefits pursuant to the Workers' Compensation Act. ... Thus, although [the Workers' Compensation Act] is used ... as a procedural avenue for administration of the benefits under \u00a7 7-433c... an award under \u00a7 7-433c is not a workers' compensation award.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Carriero\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Naugatuck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"205250\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/243/747/#p754\">\n    243 Conn. 747\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 754-55,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=707%20A.2d%20706\">\n    707 A.2d 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998). Accordingly, the statute does not require the plaintiff to prove causation in order to make a claim for benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The defendant asserts that our resolution of the plaintiff's claim should be guided by\n   <em>\n    Suprenant\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    New Brit\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ain\n   </em>\n   ,618\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"716258\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/28/754/\">\n    28 Conn.App. 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=611%20A.2d%20941\">\n    611 A.2d 941\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992). Specifically,\n   the defendant asserts that, in\n   <em>\n    Suprenant\n   </em>\n   , the Appellate Court recognized that the legislature considered heart disease and hypertension interrelated. We disagree. In\n   <em>\n    Suprenant\n   </em>\n   , the Appellate Court affirmed a workers' compensation decision denying benefits related to heart disease pursuant to \u00a7 7-433c when the claimant's preemployment physical revealed evidence of hypertension, but not heart disease. Id., 754-56,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=611%20A.2d%20941\">\n    611 A.2d 941\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In doing so, the Appellate Court explained that, in order to qualify for any benefits under \u00a7 7-433c, a claimant must pass a preemployment physical that does not reveal evidence of either hypertension or heart disease. Id., 758-59,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=611%20A.2d%20941\">\n    611 A.2d 941\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Suprenant\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from the present case. In\n   <em>\n    Suprenant\n   </em>\n   , the Appellate Court explained that \u00a7 7-433c requires the claimant to pass a preemployment physical with no evidence of either hypertension or heart disease.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=611%20A.2d%20941\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   The claim in\n   <em>\n    Suprenant\n   </em>\n   failed because the claimant did not satisfy that condition precedent to filing a claim for benefits pursuant to \u00a7 7-433c. In the present case, there is no claim that the plaintiff did not pass his preemployment physical or that it revealed evidence of hypertension or heart disease. Instead, the plaintiff was diagnosed with hypertension after he was employed by the defendant. Nothing in\n   <em>\n    Suprenant\n   </em>\n   indicates that a prior diagnosis of hypertension while employed will bar a later claim for benefits related to hypertension.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In the present case, the facts demonstrate that the plaintiff clearly met the requirements for benefits related to heart disease pursuant to \u00a7 7-433c. Specifically, it is undisputed that his preemployment physical revealed no evidence of hypertension or heart disease. It is further undisputed that he suffered a myocardial infarction that was caused by heart disease and resulted in a surgical procedure, hospitalization and continuing disability. He filed his claim for benefits related to the heart disease within four days of its manifestation. Accordingly, we conclude that the board properly affirmed the commissioner's decision granting the plaintiff benefits pursuant to \u00a7 7-433c related to heart disease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The defendant also claims on appeal that the commissioner improperly denied its motion to correct in which the defendant sought to correct errors that it claimed were inconsistent with the commissioner's rules on proximate causation. The commissioner denied the motion to correct on the ground that \u00a7 7-433c does not require a claimant to prove a causal connection between heart disease and hypertension and his employment. As explained previously in this opinion, this court has long recognized that \"the special compensation, or the outright bonus, of \u00a7 7-433c is that the claimant is not required to prove that the heart disease is causally connected to [his or her] employment, which he [or she] would ordinarily have to establish in order to receive benefits pursuant to the Workers' Compensation Act.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    O'Connor\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Waterbury\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3961102\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/286/732/#p752\">\n    286 Conn. 732\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 752,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=945%20A.2d%20936\">\n    945 A.2d 936\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008).

In particular, the plaintiff asserts that the board's interpretation of \u00a7 7-433c as treating hypertension and heart disease as separate medical conditions is a time-tested approach. \"This court repeatedly has observed that an agency's reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous statute is entitled to deference only when that interpretation has been subjected to judicial review or the agency interpretation is both reasonable and time-tested.\"\n    <em>\n     Vincent\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     New Haven\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3958862\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/285/778/#p784\">\n     285 Conn. 778\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 784 n.8,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=941%20A.2d%20932\">\n     941 A.2d 932\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2008) ; see also\n    <em>\n     Longley\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     State Employees Retirement Commission\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3954965\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/284/149/#p163\">\n     284 Conn. 149\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 163-66,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=931%20A.2d%20890\">\n     931 A.2d 890\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2007). It is undisputed that whether a claim for benefits under \u00a7 7-433c related to heart disease is barred because a claimant failed to file a timely claim for benefits for previously diagnosed hypertension has not been the subject of judicial review. Although it is true that, since its decision in\n    <em>\n     Mayer\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     East Haven\n    </em>\n    , No. 4620, CRB-3-03-2 (March 3, 2004), the board has interpreted \u00a7 7-433c as treating hypertension and heart disease as separate medical conditions,\n    <em>\n     Mayer\n    </em>\n    was not decided until 2004. \"To satisfy the time-tested requirement of the rule according deference to an agency's interpretation of a statute, that interpretation must formally have been articulated and applied 'over a long period of time ....'\n    <em>\n     State Medical Society\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Board of Examiners in Podiatry\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"519109\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/208/709/#p719\">\n     208 Conn. 709\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 719,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=546%20A.2d%20830\">\n     546 A.2d 830\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1988) ; see also\n    <em>\n     Hartford\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Hartford Municipal Employees Assn.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"360067\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/259/251/#p262\">\n     259 Conn. 251\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 262,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=788%20A.2d%2060\">\n     788 A.2d 60\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2002) (deference accorded agency's reasonable interpretation of statute only when agency has followed that interpretation 'for an extended period of time').\"\n    <em>\n     Vincent\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     New Haven\n    </em>\n    , supra, 784 n.8,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=941%20A.2d%20932\">\n     941 A.2d 932\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Because\n    <em>\n     Mayer\n    </em>\n    is a relatively recent decision, we cannot say that the board's interpretation of \u00a7 7-433c is sufficiently long-standing to warrant judicial deference, especially in view of the fact that the board has applied this interpretation only in two previous cases.

Moreover, because we conclude that \u00a7 7-433c is not ambiguous, the board's interpretation would not be entitled to deference in any event.
