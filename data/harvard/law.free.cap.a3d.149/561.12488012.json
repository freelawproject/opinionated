Ms. Kirwan neglected to pursue substantive action in furtherance of the child's case after she was retained and failed to respond to her client's numerous requests for information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Attorney Grievance Commission (\"Commission\"), Petitioner, filed a Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action with this Court alleging multiple violations of\n   the Maryland\n   Lawyers' Rules of Professional Conduct (\"MLRPC\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After an evidentiary hearing, the hearing judge issued written findings of fact and conclusions of law to this Court, concluding that Ms. Kirwan violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4(a)(2)-(3) and (b), 1.16(d), 8.1(b), and 8.4(a) and (d) as charged by the Commission. We agree. Accordingly, we suspend Ms. Kirwan from the practice of law indefinitely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 27, 2015, the Commission, through Bar Counsel, filed a Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action with this Court against Ms. Kirwan. The Commission charged Ms. Kirwan with violations of MLRPC 1.1 (Competence), 1.3 (Diligence), 1.4(a)(2)-(3) and (b) (Communication), 1.16(d) (Declining or Terminating Representation), 8.1(b) (Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters), and 8.4(a) and (d) (Misconduct) arising out of her representation of Ms. T.S. (\"Ms. S.\") and her minor child, T.N.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-752(a), the Court designated Judge Cynthia H. Jones of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City to conduct an evidentiary hearing concerning the alleged violations and make findings of fact and recommended conclusions of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The evidentiary hearing was conducted on April 4, 2016, at which several witnesses testified including Ms. Kirwan. On May 12, 2016, the hearing judge issued a thorough memorandum opinion in which she made detailed findings of fact concerning the alleged violations, as well as findings concerning aggravating and mitigating circumstances. In her recommended conclusions of law, the hearing judge concluded that\n   Ms. Kirwan committed all of the violations charged by the Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Neither party filed any exceptions to the hearing judge's findings of fact and conclusions of law. On October 11, 2016, oral arguments were presented to this Court by Ms. Kirwan and the Commission, which primarily focused on the appropriate sanction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Facts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The hearing judge's factual findings are uncontested since neither party filed any exceptions. Therefore, we treat the hearing judge's fact findings as established. Md. Rule 16-759(b)(2)(A). Those findings are summarized as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Law Practice\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Ms. Kirwan was admitted to the Maryland Bar on December 30, 1983. At all times from October 2013 through the present, Ms. Kirwan has maintained a law office in Baltimore City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Representation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On October 7, 2013, Ms. Kirwan was retained to represent T.N., a minor child who suffered a broken wrist on a Baltimore City elementary school playground. T.N.'s mother, Ms. S, retained Ms. Kirwan to pursue a claim against Baltimore City Public Schools for the child's injury. Ms. S. signed a retainer agreement and forms authorizing Ms. Kirwan to have access to T.N.'s school and medical records. After the retainer was signed, Ms. Kirwan maintained contact with Ms. S. for two months regarding T.N.'s case, and Ms. Kirwan received a copy of T.N.'s medical records from Ms. S.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Beginning in December 2013, Ms. Kirwan became unresponsive to Ms. S. Between December 5, 2013, and May 29, 2014, Ms. S. called Ms. Kirwan and left four messages with Ms. Kirwan's answering service. The messages asked Ms. Kirwan to return Ms. S.'s calls, to provide an update on T.N.'s case and to notify her if Ms. Kirwan did not want to handle T.N.'s\n   case. On May 29, 2014, Ms. S.'s message stated she had called Ms. Kirwan numerous times without receiving a call back.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Ms. S. then attempted to communicate with Ms. Kirwan through email. Ms. S. emailed Ms. Kirwan twice on June 9, 2014, asking Ms. Kirwan to call her with an update on her child's case. Ms. Kirwan replied to Ms. S.'s email on June 10, 2014, indicating she would be in touch with Ms. S. later that day or the following afternoon. Ms. S. responded by providing her work and mobile phone numbers to facilitate this communication. However, Ms. Kirwan failed to make the promised phone call. So, Ms. S. sent Ms. Kirwan an email two days later stating she still had not received a call back and requesting Ms. Kirwan call her that day. Again, Ms. Kirwan did not respond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Ms. S.'s attempts to contact Ms. Kirwan continued. On June 12, 2014, Ms. S. emailed Ms. Kirwan asking what work Ms. Kirwan performed and whether Ms. S. should retain a new attorney. Ms. S. sent a second email on June 12, 2014, requesting an update on the case. On July 18, 2014, Ms. S. left another phone message with Ms. Kirwan's answering service requesting an update on the case and indicating that the call was urgent. Ms. Kirwan did not respond to Ms. S.'s emails or phone message.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On August 26, 2014, Ms. S. filed a complaint against Ms. Kirwan with the Commission. Ms. S.'s complaint stated, \"I have been calling and leaving messages. No response!!! I don't know what is going [on] with [T.N.'s] case against the Baltimore City School system.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In September 2014, Ms. S. unsuccessfully continued her attempts to reach Ms. Kirwan by leaving another phone message and visiting Ms. Kirwan's office in person, where she slid a note under Ms. Kirwan's office door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Failure to Respond to Bar Counsel\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On September 30, 2014, the Commission sent a letter to Ms. Kirwan indicating that a complaint, unrelated to Ms. S.'s complaint, against Ms. Kirwan was dismissed. However, the Commission issued a warning to Ms. Kirwan for failing to\n   respond to Bar Counsel's lawful demand for information in relation to the complaint, and stated that this conduct was a violation of MLRPC 8.1(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On October 9, 2014, the Commission sent Ms. Kirwan a letter indicating that Ms. S. filed a complaint against her and requesting a written response within 15 days. Ms. Kirwan did not respond to this request. The Commission sent a second letter on November 13, 2014, indicating it did not receive a response and requesting a response by December 1, 2014. Ms. Kirwan received the letter\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and did not file a response. The Commission sent a third letter on January 22, 2015, indicating that Ms. S.'s complaint was reclassified as a docketed complaint due to Ms. Kirwan's failure to respond and requesting a response by February 2, 2015. Ms. Kirwan did not respond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On March 4, 2015, Mr. Edwin P. Karr, a Commission investigator, spoke with Ms. Kirwan on the phone and confirmed that Ms. Kirwan received all three letters sent by the Commission. Mr. Karr advised Ms. Kirwan that her response was required within one week, by March 11, 2015. Ms. Kirwan did not respond. The Commission's Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Legal Malpractice Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On June 26, 2015, the Collins Legal Group LLC, through its counsel Ms. Tiffani S. Collins, Esq., sent a letter to Ms. Kirwan stating that it had been retained by T.N., through her mother Ms. S. The letter stated that the firm was representing T.N. in a legal malpractice claim against Ms. Kirwan and requested Ms. Kirwan's malpractice insurance information. The letter also asked Ms. Kirwan to forward the letter to her malpractice carrier. Ms. Kirwan did not respond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The hearing judge found by clear and convincing evidence that Ms. Kirwan violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4(a)(2)-(3) and (b), 1.16(d), 8.1(b), and 8.4(a) and (d). We review recommended conclusions of law without deference to the hearing judge. Md. Rule 16-759(b)(1). For the reasons that follow, we agree with all of the hearing judge's conclusions of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A.

Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.\" A lawyer violates MLRPC 1.1 when he or she fails to act or acts in an untimely manner, which results in harm to his or her client.\n   <em>\n    Attorney Grievance Comm'n v.

Ms. Kirwan spoke with Ms. S. in the two months after the retainer agreement was signed and received T.N.'s medical records, which were collected by Ms. S. Ms. Kirwan testified that she began drafting a letter to the City Solicitor to place the City on notice of her client's claim, though she presented no evidence of this letter's existence at the hearing. Ms. Kirwan also did not present evidence of any other substantive work performed on behalf of T.N. The hearing judge found that Ms. Kirwan's failure to act harmed her client since the statute of limitations lapsed and T.N. is now unable to pursue her claim against the City.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   For these reasons, the hearing judge found that Ms. Kirwan violated MLRPC 1.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We agree. Ms. Kirwan failed to take the necessary steps to further her client's case. Therefore, Ms. Kirwan violated MLRPC 1.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    MLRPC 1.3 (Diligence)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   MLRPC 1.3 states, \"A lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.\" A lawyer also violates MLRPC 1.3 when his\n   or her lack of preparation or thoroughness violates MLRPC 1.1.\n   <em>\n    Attorney Grievance Comm'n v.

Ms. Kirwan also spoke with a Commission investigator, who informed Ms. Kirwan that she was required to respond to the Commission's letters.

Additionally, Ms. Kirwan's failure to respond to Ms. S.'s complaint through the lawful requests of the Commission also demonstrate a violation of MLRPC 8.4(d).

Ms. Kirwan received a warning from the Commission in a letter dated September 30, 2014, for failure to respond to Bar Counsel in relation to an unrelated complaint filed earlier in 2014. The letter stated that Ms. Kirwan's failure to respond to the Commission was a violation of MLRPC 8.1(b) even though the complaint was dismissed. This letter was sent two weeks prior to the Commission's letter regarding Ms. S.'s case. As a result, the hearing judge concluded that Ms. Kirwan's actions supported a finding of a pattern of misconduct and multiple offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The hearing judge concluded that Ms. Kirwan's intentional failure to comply with rules or orders of the disciplinary agency supported a finding of bad faith obstruction of disciplinary proceedings. The hearing judge found that Ms. Kirwan intentionally failed to respond to the Commission since she spoke with the Commission's investigator on the phone and stated she would respond within one week, though she failed to do so. The hearing judge found that Ms. Kirwan's failure to respond to the numerous letters coupled with the phone call by the Commission supported a finding that Ms. Kirwan\n   intentionally failed to comply with the rules of the disciplinary agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Next, the hearing judge found that Ms. Kirwan had substantial experience in the practice of law and was familiar with the MLRPC. The hearing judge also noted that Ms. Kirwan served as a Peer Review panelist in the disciplinary system.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Finally, the hearing judge concluded that Ms. Kirwan was indifferent to making restitution. This finding was supported by Ms. Kirwan's failure to respond to requests for information from Ms. Collins, the attorney retained to pursue the legal malpractice claim. The hearing judge concluded that the only recourse Ms. S. and T.N. had after Ms. Kirwan failed to file the negligence claim against the Baltimore City Public Schools was a legal malpractice suit against Ms. Kirwan. Ms. Kirwan's failure to cooperate was a hindrance to the pursuit of the malpractice claim and demonstrated that she was indifferent to Ms. S. and T.N.'s recovery of just compensation for T.N.'s injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    Mitigating Factors\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The hearing judge did not find any mitigating factors\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Ms. Kirwan\n   did not offer any evidence for this Court\n   to reach a different conclusion. Therefore, we agree with the hearing judge that there are no mitigating factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    Sanction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In this case, our primary task is to determine Ms. Kirwan's sanction since the facts and violations are undisputed.

Our decisions in prior attorney discipline cases support suspending Ms. Kirwan indefinitely, with the right to apply for reinstatement. In cases similar to Ms. Kirwan's, where the attorney's disciplinary violations do not involve dishonesty, the sanction has often been indefinite suspension.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Attorney Grievance Comm'n v.

We do not believe that\n   <em>\n    Tolar\n   </em>\n   is similar to Ms. Kirwan's case. In\n   <em>\n    Tolar\n   </em>\n   , a reprimand was the appropriate sanction because the attorney was remorseful-a mitigating factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <em>\n    Tolar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11481817\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/357/569/#p585\">\n    357 Md. at 585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11481817\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/357/569/#p585\">\n    745 A.2d 1045\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, unlike\n   <em>\n    Tolar\n   </em>\n   , in this case there was neither a finding nor any basis for mitigating Ms. Kirwan's misconduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Attorney Grievance Comm'n v.

Indefinite suspension ensures that Ms. Kirwan is not permitted to practice law until this Court is satisfied that she is able to do so in a manner that is consistent with the MLRPC. We have reiterated that indefinite suspension is not permanent, so Ms. Kirwan may apply for reinstatement under Maryland Rule 19-752. However, we decline to set a minimum length for this indefinite suspension because there is nothing in the record that would allow this Court to \"divine an appropriate minimum 'sit-out' period.\"\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4024972\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/441/80/#p101\">\n    441 Md. at 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4024972\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/441/80/#p101\">\n    105 A.3d 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265506\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/447/253/#p267\">\n    447 Md. at 274-75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265506\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/447/253/#p267\">\n    135 A.3d 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Ms. Kirwan violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4(a)(2)-(3) and (b), 1.16(d), 8.1(b), and 8.4(a) and (d).
