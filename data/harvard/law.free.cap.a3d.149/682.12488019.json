Wilner,\n   <em>\n    The Maryland Board of Public Works: A History\n   </em>\n   (1984), at ix. Consisting\n   of the Governor, the Comptroller of the Treasury, and the Treasurer, the Board of Public Works has the constitutional authority to \"hear and determine such matters as affect the Public Works of the State, and as the General Assembly may confer upon them the power to decide.\" Md. Const. Art. XII, \u00a7 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A regulation promulgated by the Board of Public Works requires counties to obtain the Board's approval before disposing of former public school property. Separately, Baltimore County had agreed, in a covenant in a 1981 deed, that it would not convey a specific school property without the Board's consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2014 Baltimore County reached an agreement with a private developer to sell portions of that former school property. Before the Board of Public Works made a final decision to approve or disapprove the sale, the developer sought a declaratory judgment that the 1981 covenant was invalid. The State intervened, arguing that the Board of Public Works' regulations governed the proposed disposition of the property. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County declared that (1) the covenant was \"invalid and of no legal force or effect\" and (2) that the regulation was \"inapplicable to and unenforceable against the contract of sale\" between the County and the developer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We reverse that judgment. The regulation governs the transaction, and it requires the County to obtain the Board of Public Works' approval before disposing of the property. As a result of that determination, it is unnecessary to declare the parties' rights under the covenant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Transfer of Surplus School Property to Baltimore County\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the early 1950s, the Baltimore County Board of Education\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   purchased approximately 28 acres of land at the\n   corner of Merritt Boulevard and Wise Avenue in Dundalk. The property served as the site of North Point Junior High School until the school closed in 1981. The County Board of Education determined at that time that the property was no longer needed for school purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As of 1981, Maryland law placed a number of restrictions on the disposition of a \"surplus\" school by a county board of education. Md. Code (1978), \u00a7 4-114(c) of the Education Article provided: \"If, with approval of the State Superintendent [of Schools], a county board finds that any land, school site, or building no longer is needed for school purposes, it shall be transferred by the county board to the county commissioners or county council and may be used, sold, leased or otherwise disposed of, except by gift, by the county commissioners or county council.\" The Board of Public Works, under its powers to regulate matters related to school construction, had delegated authority to the Interagency Committee on School Construction (IAC)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   to \"review and approve ... all proposals for the ... disposition of school sites and buildings.\" Rule 8(b) of the Rules, Regulations and Procedures for the Administration of the School Construction Program (approved Sept. 7, 1977). More broadly, the Board of Public Works retained statutory power to impose conditions on transfers of State property to a county government, regardless of whether the property had been used as a school. Md. Code (1957, 1980 Repl. Vol.), Art. 78A, \u00a7 15 (\"[a]ny real or personal property of the State of Maryland or of any board, commission, department or agency thereof ... may be sold, leased, transferred,\n   exchanged, granted or otherwise disposed of ... to any county or municipality in the State subject to such conditions as the Board of Public Works may impose\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   According to an opinion of the Attorney General, this legal framework permitted a local board of education to transfer surplus school property to a local government only if: (1) the State Superintendent approved of the local board's finding that the school was surplus, and (2) both the IAC and the Board of Public Works approved of the disposition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   64 Md. Op. Att'y Gen. 118, 122-23 (1979); 65 Md. Op. Att'y Gen. 209, 212-13 (1980). In the exercise of its approval power, the Board of Public Works could direct the terms and conditions of any subsequent use or disposition of the property. 64 Md. Op. Att'y Gen. at 123. \"To safeguard the State's interests, the Board of Public Works may impose appropriate\n   conditions on the local jurisdictions, require that the conditions of its approval and appropriate termination provisions or covenants be included in the instruments of transfer and lease, and require that those instruments be recorded.\" 65 Md. Op. Att'y Gen. at 227.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Through a deed executed on October 22, 1981, the Baltimore County Board of Education disposed of the property that had been used as the site of North Point Junior High School. According to the deed, the County Board of Education had determined that the property was \"no longer needed for school purposes [.]\" \"[I]n consideration of the sum of Five ($5.00) Dollars[ ] and other good and valuable considerations,\" the County Board of Education agreed to convey the property to Baltimore County \"in fee simple.\" At the time of the conveyance, the State was still obligated in the amount of $89,808 on bond debt relating to the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The deed included the following covenant:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   AND, [Baltimore County], acknowledging the financial interest of the State of Maryland in the property herein described, does hereby covenant that it will not convey, by deed, lease or other means, any portion of or interest in said property without first having received written consent\n   thereto from the Board of Public Works of the State of Maryland. Such consent will not be unreasonably withheld.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The IAC reviewed the proposed transfer in accordance with the Board of Public Works' regulations. The IAC recommended that the Board approve the transfer subject to the understanding that Baltimore County would assume responsibility for $89,808 of the State's outstanding bond debt. The IAC also recommended that the following provision be incorporated into the transfer documents: \"[A]pproval of the Board of Public Works shall be obtained by Baltimore County prior to the transfer by it of any right, title, or interest in the school or site or any portion thereof, and the Board may attach such conditions to its approval, including the requirement that a pro-rata portion of the proceeds from the sale or lease of the school property be paid to the State, as it deems appropriate.\" In June 1982, the Board approved the transfer subject to those conditions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Baltimore County's Use and Proposed Disposition of the Property\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   By the end of 1988, Baltimore County had paid off the outstanding bond debt on the property. Meanwhile, Baltimore County converted the former school building into the North Point Government Center, which was used primarily by county agencies such as the police department, recreation and parks department, and health department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On the remaining portions of the property, the County maintained several athletic fields, including four baseball diamonds and three soccer fields. Those fields extend to the southern property line, which borders on additional athletic fields for an elementary school. This neighboring school, Grange Elementary School, has operated continuously since the 1960s.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   By 2012, county officials no longer desired to continue to use the North Point property as a local government center. Consequently, the County solicited proposals from private developers for redevelopment of the property. The County accepted\n   a proposal from Vanguard Commercial Development, Inc. (\"Vanguard\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   By a contract executed in December 2013, the County agreed to sell approximately 15 acres of the 28-acre property to Vanguard for $2,105,355. The development plans called for the construction of a commercial complex that included offices, restaurants, and retail shops.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Vanguard agreed to build a new recreation center and to upgrade athletic fields on the other portion of the property, which would continue to be owned by the County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After further negotiations, the County entered into an \"Amended and Restated Contract of Sale\" in November 2014. The new contract substituted Merritt Pavilion, LLC (\"Merritt Pavilion\"), an affiliate of Vanguard, as the purchaser. Merritt Pavilion agreed to purchase the approximately 15-acre portion of the property for a revised price of $7,600,000. The County agreed to assume responsibility for constructing the recreation center and for upgrading the athletic fields.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The contracts listed several conditions precedent to closing, including final approval of a planned unit development (PUD) that would permit commercial use of the property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The transaction was not conditioned on obtaining approval from the Board of Public Works.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In 2015 Merritt Pavilion secured approval of the PUD from local administrative bodies. Nonetheless, some nearby residents, including Ms. Karen Cruz, were dissatisfied by the\n   decision to permit commercial development on the property. Ms. Cruz and others petitioned for judicial review of the decisions authorizing the PUD. The Circuit Court for Baltimore County eventually heard the petition, but (as of the date of this opinion) the court has not yet issued a decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Baltimore County's Request for Approval by the Board\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In July 2015, the County Executive for Baltimore County wrote to the IAC, requesting approval to dispose of the property. The letter quoted the final sentence of the 1981 covenant, which stated that the Board of Public Works' consent would \"not be unreasonably withheld.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The IAC reviewed the request in accordance with Board of Public Works' regulations. Code of Maryland Regulations (\"COMAR\") 23.03.02.24(C) provides that \"[a] county government proposing to dispose of former school property shall submit to the IAC a request for approval to dispose. The IAC shall review the request and make a recommendation to the Board of Public Works.\" COMAR 23.03.02.24(D) states that, upon receiving the recommendation, the Board of Public Works \"may approve, disapprove, or conditionally approve the request to dispose of the former school property\" and \"may require that the disposition documents specifically incorporate the conditions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   One week after the County requested approval, Ms. Cruz and four other residents filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. Their complaint named Baltimore County, Vanguard, and Merritt Pavilion as defendants. Based on a variety\n   of legal theories, the\n   <em>\n    Cruz\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs contended that selling the property was an \"illegal\" and \"\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   act of the County Executive and the County Council.\" In Count One of their complaint, the\n   <em>\n    Cruz\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs asserted that both the 1981 deed covenant and COMAR 23.03.02.24 required the County to obtain the Board of Public Works' approval before disposing of the property. Other counts of the\n   <em>\n    Cruz\n   </em>\n   complaint alleged various\n   abuses in the contract bidding process and the PUD approval. The\n   <em>\n    Cruz\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs sought a declaration that the contracts were illegal and an injunction preventing the County from conveying or redeveloping the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Vanguard, Merritt Pavilion, and Baltimore County each moved to dismiss the\n   <em>\n    Cruz\n   </em>\n   complaint, primarily based on the issue of standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The IAC completed its review of the County's request in September 2015. The IAC concluded that the proposed transfer did not involve outstanding State bond debt and that the State was not entitled to receive proceeds from the sale. The IAC expressed concern, however, about the \"considerable\" amount of community opposition to the proposal. The IAC recommended that the Board of Public Works approve the disposition along with a recommendation that the County \"engage in further discussions with the stakeholders in an attempt to accommodate stakeholder preferences and concerns.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Board of Public Works placed the request on its agenda for a meeting on October 7, 2015. During that meeting, the Lieutenant Governor announced that the Governor's office had asked to pull the item from its agenda. He explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The reason that we asked that the North Point sale be pulled from the Agenda, [was] because there are a number of concerns raised by the community with regard to the deal that was put in place. And we're asking the county to work with the community to see if they can come up with a better plan. There are a lot of concerns in terms of the local usage of the facility. And so with that said we asked that they, the two parties come back together, work with the developer to come up with a better plan that meets the needs of the community.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Comptroller enthusiastically \"applaud[ed] the Governor for not voting\" and joined the Governor \"in sending this off the Agenda.\" Expressing his desire to deliver \"a strong message for the citizens of Dundalk,\" the Comptroller announced that the project would not be approved unless it had \"the\n   support of every local official\" and \"every citizen group.\" The Treasurer commented that she supported the efforts to \"work through a solution,\" but \"really d[id]n't think zoning decisions should be made at the Board of Public Works.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Over the next several months, the Board of Public Works did not take further action to approve, disapprove, or conditionally approve the request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     The Declaratory Judgment Action to Invalidate the Deed Covenant\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On January 7, 2016, Merritt Pavilion commenced this case by filing a one-count complaint for a declaratory judgment in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. The complaint named Baltimore County as the sole defendant. Merritt Pavilion alleged that the County was unwilling to proceed under the contract without the Board of Public Works' approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The complaint made no mention of the Board of Public Works' regulations. Instead, Merritt Pavilion suggested that the obstacle to the sale was the covenant from the 1981 deed. Merritt Pavilion alleged that, because of \"political considerations unrelated to any direct financial interest in\n   the property[,]\" the Board had \"failed to act on a pending request for consent to the transfer, even though the request ha[d] been pending for many months and even though the consent covenant expressly provides that consent may not be unreasonably withheld.\" Merritt Pavilion asked the court to declare that the 1981 deed covenant was \"invalid and void as a matter of law because the State's financial interest in the property ha[d] been extinguished\" and that \"any further consent requirement would act as an unlawful restraint on the alienation of property.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Within one week, the County filed an answer in which it admitted every allegation in the complaint. Omitting any reference to the Board of Public Works' regulations, the County averred that the deed covenant was \"the sole reason\" why the County was \"unable to proceed in accordance with the\n   terms of the contract.\" The County asked the court to grant all relief requested by Merritt Pavilion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   A week after the County answered, Merritt Pavilion moved for summary judgment. On the same day, the County filed a response asking the court to grant summary judgment in Merritt Pavilion's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   When the Attorney General's Office learned of this unusual declaratory judgment action, the State moved to intervene, asserting that it was a necessary party to the proceedings. Merritt Pavilion and the County consented to the intervention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The State opposed Merritt Pavilion's summary judgment motion and made a cross-motion for summary judgment in its own favor. The State asked the court to declare that the covenant was valid, but that \"[e]ven in the absence of the challenged covenant, COMAR \u00a7 23.03.02.24 requires Baltimore County to seek and obtain the approval of the Board of Public Works before disposing of the former school[.]\" Merritt Pavilion responded by asking the court to declare that COMAR 23.03.02.24 was \"inapplicable to and unenforceable against the pending contract of sale\" of the property. The County adopted Merritt Pavilion's arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The circuit court held a hearing on the cross-motions for summary judgment on March 17, 2016. During the hearing, an Assistant Attorney General informed the court that, just days earlier, he had learned of the separate declaratory judgment action in which Ms. Cruz and others had challenged the conveyance to Merritt Pavilion on the basis of the 1981 covenant and COMAR 23.03.02.24. He suggested that the two cases should be consolidated because both involved the same covenant. The court instructed the State to set forth its position in writing, and it proceeded to hear arguments on the summary judgment motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   After the hearing, the State moved to consolidate the\n   <em>\n    Cruz\n   </em>\n   case with this case. Merritt Pavilion opposed the motion. The County adopted Merritt Pavilion's arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On March 25, 2016, the court issued an order denying the State's motion to consolidate, granting Merritt Pavilion's motion for summary judgment, and denying the State's cross-motion for summary judgment. The court saw the issue as whether the covenant in the 1981 deed gave the State \"veto power\" over the proposed sale of a former school property from the County to Merritt Pavilion. The court also saw a \"related issue\" of whether the Board of Public Works' regulations \"bestow an equivalent power upon the State.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In resolving those issues, the court wrote that \"the singular intent and purpose\" of the 1981 covenant and the Board of Public Works' regulations \"was to allow the State of Maryland to protect any financial interests it might have or might have\n   had in the sale of the real property which had been used for public schooling, and in which the State had a financial stake.\" Because the State had not had any financial interest in the property in question since the County assumed and paid off the bond debt in the 1980s, the court declared the covenant to be \"invalid and of no legal force and effect.\" Asserting that the regulations \"mirror\" the language in the covenant, the court declared them to be \"inapplicable to and unenforceable against the contract of sale between Merritt Pavilion LLC and Baltimore County.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Judgment was entered on March 31, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State filed a timely notice of appeal. Commenting that the State had been \"engaging in a pattern of delay[,]\" the court denied the State's\n   request to stay the judgment pending the outcome of the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n    <em>\n     Other Post-Judgment Developments\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   While this appeal was pending, another judge dismissed the separate case in which Ms. Cruz and other citizens set out to enjoin the sale of the property on the ground the County needed to obtain the Board of Public Works' approval. The\n   <em>\n    Cruz\n   </em>\n   parties noted an appeal, which is pending as\n   <em>\n    Karen Cruz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et al. v. Baltimore County, et al.\n   </em>\n   , No. 585, Sept. Term 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   For reasons that are not adequately explained by the record, the attorney for the\n   <em>\n    Cruz\n   </em>\n   parties received notification that his clients were parties to this appeal. As a precaution, their attorney filed a one-page brief, which simply adopted the contents of the State's brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Baltimore County has moved to strike the\n   <em>\n    Cruz\n   </em>\n   parties and to strike their appellate brief. None of the other litigants have opposed that motion. Although the\n   <em>\n    Cruz\n   </em>\n   brief would have no effect on the outcome, we agree that Ms. Cruz and her fellow citizens are not parties to this appeal. The motion to strike the\n   <em>\n    Cruz\n   </em>\n   parties as appellees and to strike their appellate brief is granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Surland v.

The hearing took place about one month after the court issued its judgment in this case. The County argues that the\n   <em>\n    Cruz\n   </em>\n   transcript does not belong in an appendix because it was not part of the record before the circuit court when it rendered its judgment. The State responds that this Court can take judicial notice of the transcript for the limited purpose of demonstrating that Merritt Pavilion has taken inconsistent positions on the question of whether the\n   <em>\n    Cruz\n   </em>\n   case involves the same issues as\n   this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   We agree with the State that an official transcript of a court proceeding is the type of document \"whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\" Md.

Two questions relate to the correctness of the court's declaratory judgment, and the other question concerns the propriety of issuing any declaration without first consolidating this case with the\n   <em>\n    Cruz\n   </em>\n   case. We have reordered and reformulated these questions as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   1. Did the court abuse its discretion in denying the State's motion to consolidate the action with a related declaratory judgment action?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   2. Did the circuit court err in concluding that the [Board of Public Works'] regulations for the disposition of former school property were inapplicable to and unenforceable against the disposition of the property?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   3. Did the circuit court err in concluding that the deed covenant was invalid and of no legal force and effect?\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   We conclude that the court was not required to consolidate this case with the\n   <em>\n    Cruz\n   </em>\n   case.

Throughout this case, Merritt Pavilion has suggested that the Board of Public Works acted unreasonably when it removed the North Point proposal from its agenda at the meeting in October 2015. Merritt Pavilion describes the Board's decision as \"politically motivated.\" At oral argument, the State responded that the Board members' motives are irrelevant because, the State says, the Board's discretion is virtually unlimited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Strictly speaking, however, this appeal does not concern the propriety of the Board's decision to withhold its consent (or, more precisely, its decision not to vote on the matter). As Merritt Pavilion wrote in its motion for summary judgment: \"The question presented for declaratory judgment is not whether the [Board of Public Works] must grant consent, but whether the [Board of Public Works'] consent need even be sought by the County and Merritt Pavilion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Similarly, the circuit court's declaration did not address the propriety of the Board's exercise of its approval power. Instead, the court declared that the approval power did not extend to this transfer in the first place and that the County had no obligation to seek the Board's approval. The court reached two conclusions: (1) that the covenant from the 1981 deed was \"invalid\"; and (2) that Board regulations were \"inapplicable to and unenforceable against\" the transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Although the State challenges both aspects of that ruling, the State begins by contending that the circuit court erred in its determination that the Board's regulations could not govern the proposed transfer. For the reasons explained below, we agree that the court erred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Regulatory Authority of the Board of Public Works\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Maryland Constitution requires the General Assembly to establish and to provide for the maintenance of \"a thorough and efficient System of Free Public Schools\" throughout the State.

Dep't of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene, Nursing Home Appeal Bd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690836\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/413/201/#p216\">\n    413 Md. 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 216-17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690836\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/413/201/#p216\">\n    991 A.2d 1257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) ), we interpret the word \"former\" in accordance with its ordinary meaning. Thus, the term \"former school property\" includes the North Point property and its facilities, which had formerly been used as a public school. Merritt Pavilion and Baltimore County have made no argument to the\n   contrary. Indeed, in a memorandum to the circuit court, Merritt Pavilion recognized that \"[t]hese regulations facially apply to a county's further disposition of former school properties that previously had been transferred to a county by a county board of education.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Moreover, as Merritt Pavilion points out, the County complied with section C of this regulation. In July 2015, the County Executive \"submit[ted] to the IAC a request for approval to dispose\" (COMAR 23.03.02.24(C) ) of this property. The IAC then \"review[ed] the request and ma[d]e a recommendation\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) to the Board of Public Works in September 2015. The IAC specifically recommended that the Board approve the proposal, with some conditions. In these circumstances, any requirement of COMAR 23.03.02.24(C) has already been fulfilled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The remaining issue is whether the Board of Public Works \"may approve, disapprove, or conditionally approve\" the County's request under COMAR 23.03.02.24(D). The State contended that the Board had the power to do so. The circuit court disagreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Our review of the grant of summary judgment in a declaratory judgment action normally involves \"only the grounds upon which the trial court relied in granting summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Springer v. Erie Ins. Exch.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4173806\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/439/142/#p155\">\n    439 Md. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   146 n.2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4173806\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/439/142/#p155\">\n    94 A.3d 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations and quotation marks omitted). The circuit court explained its reasoning as follows: the \"singular intent and purpose\" of COMAR 23.03.02.24 is to protect the State's financial interests in the sale of property; the State has no longer had a financial interest in this particular property since the 1980s;\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   and, therefore, those COMAR provisions\n   are \"inapplicable to and unenforceable against\" Baltimore County's disposition of this property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The State argues that the circuit court ignored principles of construction, which ordinarily require courts to give effect to the language of a regulation as written.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Sail Zambezi, Ltd. v. Maryland State Highway Admin.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4330444\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/217/138/#p150\">\n    217 Md.App. 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 150,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4330444\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/217/138/#p150\">\n    90 A.3d 592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). The State contends that the regulation plainly applies to a county's disposition of former school property, regardless of whether the State retains any direct financial interest relating to the property. Treating COMAR 24.03.02.24(D) as \"inapplicable,\" the State says, would either render its operative language meaningless or would impermissibly insert a new limitation not expressed in the language of the regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   We agree that the circuit court's conclusion, that the regulation is \"inapplicable,\" does not follow from the court's stated premises. The language triggering the application of this regulation (\"[a] county government proposing to dispose of former school property\") is broad enough to include the transaction here. Nothing in this regulation or its surrounding provisions expresses an intent that the regulation should apply only to former school properties as to which the State retains a direct financial interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Moreover, we are aware of no principle (and the parties have identified none) that would permit a court to declare a regulation \"inapplicable\" merely because the court determines that the regulatory purpose has been achieved. Ordinarily, the purposes would be better achieved by allowing the agency (and not a court) to make the determination in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The more fundamental problem with the court's stated rationale, however, is its narrow view of the purpose of the regulation. Because of how the parties presented this case, arguments about the regulation overlapped with arguments\n   about the covenant. The circuit court discussed the covenant and the regulation together, writing that \"the singular intent of both the consent covenant in the 1981 deed and the referenced COMAR provisions (23.03.02.23 and 23.03.02.24) was to allow the State of Maryland to protect any financial interests\" in the sale of real property. But while the covenant expressly \"acknowledg[es] the financial interest of the State of Maryland in the property,\" the regulation includes no statement of purpose, much less a \"singular\" purpose. As the text of the regulation does not mention the State's financial interest at all, it lends little support for an inference that a direct financial interest relating to the property is a condition for triggering the regulatory approval procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Protecting State investments does appear to be one function of this regulation, but the State of Maryland is not just an ordinary investor in matters related to school construction. \"Manifestly, the State's involvement in [the public school construction program] extends beyond financing on a piecemeal basis.\" 64 Md. Op. Att'y Gen. at 124 n.9. The State's interest in the disposition of surplus schools \"derives from a number of sources,\" including \"the State's financial investment[s]\" in school construction, as well as \"the comprehensive and systematic powers and duties of the State in administering the public school construction program-powers and duties that have been conferred by \u00a7\u00a7 5-301 and 5-302 on the Board of Public Works and its agent, the [IAC].\" 65 Md. Op. Att'y Gen. at 212. The Board of Public Works' oversight responsibility is not strictly limited to short-term financial concerns, but extends to the long-term operation of the ongoing program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   64 Md. Op. Att'y Gen. at 122 (concluding that \"if the [IAC] should find, in a given case that a proposed disposition would thwart the operation of the program, it may act to disapprove the transaction\"); Md. Code (1978, 2014 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 5-301(d)(2)(i) of the Education Article (authorizing the Board to make requirements for the \"development\n   and submission of long range plans\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Discussions from a Board of Public Works meeting on May 6, 1981, reveal the Board's rationale (at least historically) for\n   requiring the counties to seek Board approval for the conveyance of former school properties as to which the State no longer has a direct financial interest. At that meeting, the Board considered requests to approve transfers of four surplus schools to Baltimore County. The State was obligated to pay for the outstanding bond debt for each of those schools.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   During that meeting, the Comptroller objected to a proposed covenant under which the Board's approval power would end after 15 years or when \"the bond debt is completely retired, whichever is earlier.\" The Comptroller asked the Board to consider what might happen if, in the future, the population increased in an area where a school had once closed down. The Executive Director of the State School Construction Program responded that it would be a \"considerable expense\" for the State either to \"mothball\" a school until it might be needed again or, in the alternative, to finance the construction of entirely new schools in response to a future population increase. The Treasurer promptly proposed an amendment that would eliminate any restriction on the Board's approval power. The Governor described the effect of the proposed amendment as follows: \"if [the County] ever dispose[s] of the school, regardless of when, [the County would] have to come back for Board approval.\" The Board then voted to approve the covenants subject to the amendment. Other Board of Public Works records from this time period show that the Board imposed similar conditions when it approved other conveyances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Because the State has an ongoing responsibility to finance construction of schools and school-related improvements throughout the State, it is rational for the State to oversee\n   transactions disposing of previously-constructed facilities in each county. Little imagination is required to see how the disposition of this particular property, which is improved with multiple athletic fields, has an auditorium for public meetings, and is adjacent to an existing elementary school, would be of interest to the bodies responsible for financing school construction throughout the State. The requirement that the counties seek approval from the Board of Public Works to dispose of former school property, regardless of when the counties dispose of the property, safeguards long-term interests of the school construction program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   For those reasons, we conclude that COMAR 23.03.02.24 applies to Baltimore County's proposed disposition of this former school property. We reject the premise that the \"singular purpose\" of the regulation is to protect the State's financial interest in each individual property. We similarly reject the conclusion that the procedures of COMAR 23.03.02.24 only apply to properties as to which the State has a direct financial stake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Enforceability of Board Regulation as to the North Point Transaction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   In the circuit court, Merritt Pavilion argued that COMAR 23.03.02.24(C)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   \"exceed[ed] the authority of the statutes\" enabling that regulation and hence that the regulation was \"not enforceable as to the County or Merritt Pavilion in this case.\" Without expressly adopting that argument, the court echoed and implicitly endorsed it in concluding that the regulation was \"unenforceable.\" On appeal, Merritt Pavilion and the County argue that \"[n]o Maryland statute could be read to enable these regulations to be applied\" to the proposed disposition of the North Point property. We are unpersuaded that the statutes limit the Board of Public Works' regulatory authority in that manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Since the original enactment of the school construction program in 1971, the Board's power to make rules to administer the school construction program has always been \"broadly\n   stated.\" Wilner,\n   <em>\n    The Maryland Board of Public Works\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 104.

The statute directs that: \"In adopting any of these requirements, the State Board [of Education] and the Board of Public Works shall provide for the maximum exercise of initiative by school personnel in each county to ensure that the school buildings and improvements meet both the needs of the local communities and the rules and regulations necessary to ensure the proper operation\n   of this section and the prudent expenditure of State funds.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5-301(d)(4).

Merritt Pavilion and the County have identified no provision that squarely supports their theory that the Board's regulatory authority extends only to properties as to which the State retains a direct financial interest. Merritt Pavilion and the County nevertheless contend that the Board lacks authority to regulate a county's subsequent transfer of former school property because \"[t]he enumerated topics on which regulations may be adopted do not include anything specific to surplus schools, and certainly not specific to subsequent transfers of surplus schools after the initial transfer by a county board of education.\" To the contrary, the history of this statute reveals that the legislature did not intend to narrow the Board's regulatory power to those enumerated topics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   As originally enacted, the statute authorized the Board to prescribe requirements in nine, unnumbered areas, as well as\n   \"\n   <em>\n    any other\n   </em>\n   requirements involving school construction and capital improvements necessary or appropriate for the proper implementation of this section.\" 1971 Md. Laws ch. 624, \u00a7 1 (creating \u00a7 130A(d) of former Article 77 of the Maryland Code) (emphasis added). When the General Assembly reenacted this provision in 1978 as part of the newly-codified Education Article, it reorganized the list into ten items, the tenth of which was: \"school construction and capital improvements necessary or appropriate for the proper implementation of this section.\" 1978 Md. Laws ch. 22, \u00a7 2 (enacting Md. Code (1978), \u00a7 5-301(e)(2)(x) of the Education Article )). A Revisor's Note made it clear that this recodification did not effect a substantive change.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1978 Md. Laws ch. 22, \u00a7 2, Revisor's Note to \u00a7 5-301(e)(2) of the Education Article (stating that, aside from the intentional deletion of a few obsolete provisions, \"[t]he only other changes are in style\"). Legislation passed in 2004 moved this provision to subsection (d); added five more areas for which the Board \"may\" make requirements (\u00a7 5-301(d)(2)(xi) through (d)(2)(xv) ); and specified the eight areas for which the Board \"shall\" make requirements (\u00a7 5-301(d)(3)(i) through (d)(3)(viii) ).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2004 Md. Laws ch. 306, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3. Those provisions have remained unchanged since that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Overall, this statutory history undercuts any suggestion that the legislature intended to limit the Board of Public Works' regulatory authority to the specifically enumerated categories. The vague wording of subparagraph 5-301(d)(2)(x), which permits the Board to make requirements for \"[s]chool construction and capital improvements necessary or appropriate for the proper implementation of this section[,]\" is a product of legislative design. This provision anticipates that the Board might find it \"necessary or appropriate\" to make additional regulations that do not fit neatly into any enumerated category. It confers some discretion on the Board to decide which requirements are \"necessary or appropriate\" for the implementation of the program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   \"[C]ourts should generally defer to agencies' decisions in promulgating new regulations because they presumably make rules based upon their expertise in a particular field.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <em>\n    Fogle v.

Unquestionably, the subject matter of section 5-301 is more expansive than the mere payment of State construction funds. The operative provisions confirm the observation that the Board's \"[a]dministration of the program is comprehensive and systematic.\" 64 Md. Op. Att'y Gen. at 122 n.9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   In another (rather inventive) effort to uncover a legislative intent to limit the Board of Public Works' regulatory authority, Merritt Pavilion and the County point to what is now subsection (i) of section 5-301. In relevant part, it provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n   Consistent with \u00a7 4-115 of this article and regulations adopted by the Board of Public Works to implement \u00a7 4-126 of this article, the Board of Public Works may require by regulation that the portion of the proceeds received by a county from the sale, lease, or disposal of any public school building that represent State funds provided within 15 years prior to the date of the transaction shall be used solely as part of the State funding of the construction of future public school buildings in the county in which the sale, lease, or disposal occurred, if the public school building was constructed under a contract executed on or after February 1, 1971.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Md. Code (1978, 2014 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 5-301(i)(2) of the Education Article.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   This subsection plainly \"does not apply to the proceeds from the sale, lease, or disposition of public school buildings constructed under contracts executed before February 1, 1971.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5740061\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/193/322/#p362\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5-301(i)(1). Accordingly, Merritt Pavilion and the County rightly concede that this subsection \"is not directly applicable\" here because North Point Junior High School was built in the early 1950s. Furthermore, the State has not asserted any claim to proceeds from the proposed sale of the North Point property. Merritt Pavilion and the County argue that this provision \"nevertheless is instructive because it demonstrates, consistent with the entirety of Section 5-301, that the General Assembly's intent and interest in dispositions of public school buildings stems from the State's direct financial interest.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   This sweeping view of the implications of subsection 5-301(i) is unjustified. This provision was not part of the original 1971 legislation that empowered the Board of Public Works to enact regulations. The predecessor to subsubsection (i) was added a few years later to address the proceeds from \"the disposition of certain public school property[.]\" 1973 Md. Laws ch. 299, preamble. The enactment did not purport to limit the Board's preexisting regulatory powers. If anything, this provision assumes that the Board may oversee \"the sale, lease, or disposal\" of school buildings that have been transferred to a county government. It does not define the entire scope of that authority over \"the sale, lease, or disposal\" of school buildings transferred to a county. Instead, it merely circumscribes the Board's control of the\n   proceeds of those transactions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   In conclusion, section 5-301(d) contains a broad grant of rulemaking power in matters related to school construction and improvements. That power is not strictly limited to the enumerated areas in the statute. The statute as a whole does not express a legislative intent to limit the Board of Public Works' regulatory power only to properties in which the State retains a direct financial interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Alleged \"Abrogation\" of the County's Common Law Property Rights\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   As a final argument against the application of COMAR 24.03.02.24, Merritt Pavilion and the County contend that the\n   regulation is unenforceable because, they say, enforcing the regulation would violate the County's common-law right to free alienation of property. Relying on cases involving the enforceability of private covenants, they argue that the consent covenant from the 1981 deed is \"repugnant\" to the County's fee simple ownership and that the covenant has become an \"unreasonable\" restraint against alienation. Their challenge to the regulation assumes that the covenant is invalid and concludes that a regulation must be unenforceable if it imposes an equivalent restraint. They argue that the Board of Public Works' statutory authorization to make regulations does not \"permit retrospective regulatory abrogation of common law principles of free alienation to which the inhabitants of Maryland are entitled as a matter of state constitutional law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   The State attacks each link in that chain of reasoning. The State argues that the common law would not preclude the enforceability of the deed covenant; that the common law concerning alienation of property does not apply to \"an intergovernmental transfer between the State and one of its political subdivisions\"; and that an agency with the authority to make regulations that have statutory force may create exceptions to the common law to the same extent as any statute passed by the legislature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Although the briefs engage in a wide-ranging debate on these issues, it is unnecessary to discuss all of them. It is dispositive that the State's modification of a county's power to dispose of property is not subject to the same constitutional restraints\n   that apply to the State's restriction of existing private property rights.\n   Merritt Pavilion and the County cite Article 5(a)(1) of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, which declares \"[t]hat the\n   <em>\n    Inhabitants of Maryland\n   </em>\n   are entitled to the Common Law of England, ... and to the benefit of such of the English statutes as existed on [July 4, 1776]; and which, by experience, have been found applicable to their local and other circumstances, and have been introduced, used and practiced by the Courts of Law or Equity; ... subject, nevertheless, to the revision of, and amendment or repeal by, the Legislature of this State.\" (Emphasis added.) It is debatable whether Merritt Pavilion, a limited liability company with offices in Maryland, is or is not an \"[i]nhabitant[ ] of Maryland[.]\" But Merritt Pavilion does not own the property (at least not yet). Baltimore County owns it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Baltimore County is a charter county organized under Article XI-A of the Maryland Constitution.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Gunpowder Horse Stables, Inc. v.

The Maryland Constitution empowers the General Assembly to \"provide a grant of express powers\" to charter counties. Md. Const. Art. XI-A, \u00a7 2. Property rights of a charter county emanate from the Express Powers Act, which provides that \"[a] charter county ... may acquire and hold property, either absolutely or in trust for a public purpose\" and \"may dispose of property[.]\" Md. Code (2013), \u00a7 9-201(3) -(4) of the Local Government Article. A county's power to dispose of property, as with its other expressly granted powers, \"may be extended, modified, amended or repealed by the General Assembly.\" Md. Const. Art. XI-A, \u00a7 2 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dan Friedman,\n   <em>\n    The Maryland State Constitution\n   </em>\n   315 (2d ed. 2011) (explaining that the General Assembly may \"pass public general laws governing subjects that are within the express powers of the local governments\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   The General Assembly has modified each county's right to dispose of property in a number of ways that are relevant to the issues in this case. Property owned by the State or a unit of the State government may be transferred \"to any county or municipal corporation in the State subject to any conditions the Board [of Public Works] imposes.\" Md. Code (1985, 2015\n   Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 10-305(a)(2) of the State Finance and Procurement Article. When a county board of education transfers surplus school property to a county, the county may not dispose of the property by gift. Md. Code (1978, 2014 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 4-115 of the Education Article (providing that property determined to be surplus school property \"shall be transferred by the county board to the county commissioners or county council and may be used, sold, leased, or otherwise disposed of,\n   <em>\n    except by gift\n   </em>\n   , by the county commissioners or county council\" (emphasis added)). These statutory provisions govern an initial transfer of property to a county (like the one that occurred in 1981), but both statutes illustrate that the State may modify a county's power to dispose of property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   When the General Assembly authorized the Board of Public Works to adopt substantive regulations for the administration of the school construction program (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5-301(d)(1) ), the legislature expressly envisioned that the regulations might modify the powers of county governments. The statute provides: \"With respect to public school construction or public school capital improvements, including sites for school buildings, the authority, responsibilities,\n   <em>\n    powers\n   </em>\n   , and duties of\" the county governments \"are subject to the regulations adopted by the Board of Public Works\" under\n   section 5-301 of the Education Article.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4431476\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/108/612/#p618\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5-301(g)(1) (emphasis added). The Board's regulations and procedures prevail \"[i]f, as to public school construction or public school capital improvements, there is any conflict between the regulations and procedures of the Board of Public Works and the authority, responsibilities,\n   <em>\n    powers\n   </em>\n   , and duties of the individuals and agencies\" subject to the Board's regulations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4431476\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/108/612/#p618\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5-301(g)(2) (emphasis added). These \"powers\" subject to the Board's control include a county's power to dispose of property under the Express Powers Act. Section 5-301 thus authorizes the Board of Public Works to limit a county's power to dispose of property, which the Board did when it enacted COMAR 23.03.02.24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   As one aspect of their arguments about abrogation of the common law, Merritt Pavilion and the County accuse\n   the State of \"retroactively\" invoking its regulations. These references to retroactivity appear to invoke constitutional protections against statutes that impair substantive rights that have vested before the enactment of a statute.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Muskin v.

The regulation properly modifies a county's\n   <em>\n    power\n   </em>\n   to dispose of property. The authorities cited by Merritt Pavilion and the County are inapposite because they do not involve modifications to a county's power to dispose of property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Validity of the 1981 Deed Covenant\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   As discussed above, we have concluded that, even if the covenant did not exist, COMAR 23.03.02.24 would require the County to obtain approval from the Board of Public Works to dispose of this former school property. As a separate issue, the State contends that the court erred when it declared that the covenant was invalid; Merritt Pavilion and the County contend that the court was correct when it made that determination. For a few reasons, we decline to decide that issue and\n   instead vacate the portions of the declaration that concern the 1981 deed covenant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   The covenant and the regulation achieve similar effects, but they are not identical. For instance, the deed speaks only of \"consent\" from the Board of Public Works, but the regulation specifies that the Board may \"conditionally approve\" a request and \"may require that the disposition documents specifically incorporate the conditions.\" COMAR 23.03.02.24(D). The Board's regulations and procedures prevail in the event of any conflict with \"the authority, responsibilities, powers, [or] duties\" of the county government. Md. Code (1978, 2014 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 5-301(g)(2) of the Education Article. Thus, the regulation\n   reigns supreme over whatever responsibilities the County may have had under the deed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Because the terms of the regulation control and because the County would be subject to the regulation even if the covenant were invalid, it is unnecessary to analyze the validity of the covenant. Regardless of the status of the covenant, the Board of Public Works \"may approve, disapprove or conditionally approve\" the County's request under COMAR 23.03.02.24(D). It would serve no useful purpose to declare the parties' additional rights in the event of some controversy that may never arise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hickory Point P'ship v.

Baltimore County is subject to this regulation. To enforce this regulation, the State need not demonstrate that it has a direct financial interest as to the property or the transaction. The regulation requires Baltimore County to seek and obtain the approval of Board of Public Works before disposing of the former school property.

In other words, they do not contend that the Board of Public Works' regulations remove or replace the entire common-law doctrine regarding free alienation of property.
