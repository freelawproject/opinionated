We conclude that the court properly granted the respondent's motion for summary judgment\n   on counts one and two because the third petition was a successive petition as to those counts. Additionally, we conclude that the court also properly dismissed count three on the alternative ground of collateral estoppel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We therefore affirm the judgment of the habeas court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following factual and procedural background is relevant to our resolution of the petitioner's appeal. On July 20, 1999, the petitioner pleaded guilty under the\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   doctrine\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   to murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a), and the court,\n   <em>\n    Iannotti, J.\n   </em>\n   , sentenced him in accordance with a plea agreement to thirty years incarceration in the custody of the respondent. At the sentencing hearing, the defendant sought new counsel and to withdraw his plea.

In this petition, he alleges ineffective assistance of his trial counsel, Stephen Gionfriddo; his first habeas counsel, Michael D'Onofrio; and his second habeas counsel, Thomas Mullaney. We describe the petitioner's habeas cases in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2000, the petitioner filed his first petition for a writ of habeas corpus.\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Warden\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven, Docket No. CV-00-0439172-S,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20WL%20828494\">\n    2003 WL 828494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (January 24, 2003) (\n   <em>\n    Parker I\n   </em>\n   ). In his third amended two count petition in that proceeding, he alleged both ineffective assistance of trial counsel and actual innocence. The petitioner claimed that trial counsel: (1) did not adequately advise him of his option to plead guilty or to proceed to trial; (2) did not adequately advise him concerning the consequences of his plea; (3) failed to ensure that his plea was made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily; (4) did not adequately advise him of the elements of murder; (5) did not conduct a sufficient investigation into possible defenses; (6) failed to conduct a sufficient investigation into the elements of the prosecution's proof or of his case; and (7) failed to conduct a sufficient investigation by not speaking to certain witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After a trial, the first habeas court denied the petition for a writ of habeas corpus, concluding that trial counsel's representation did not amount to ineffective assistance; that the petitioner failed to prove any of the allegations in his petition; and that he did not prove prejudice. The court also found that the petitioner had failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he was actually innocent of murder, the crime to which he pleaded guilty and of which he was convicted. Following the first habeas court's denial of his petition for certification to appeal, this court dismissed his appeal, and our Supreme Court denied certification to appeal.

In his amended\n   petition in that proceeding, he alleged both ineffective assistance of trial counsel and ineffective assistance of first habeas counsel. He claimed that trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to (1) file a motion to suppress the petitioner's statements and other evidence obtained during a stop and search of his vehicle; and (2) advise the petitioner about proceeding with a motion to suppress, and, if the court denied that motion, then entering a nolo contendere plea, which would permit him to appeal the denial of that motion to suppress. As to first habeas counsel, the petitioner claimed that he was ineffective for failing to raise these issues in the first habeas petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After a hearing, the second habeas court found that the petitioner was unlikely to prevail on the motion to suppress the petitioner's statements and other evidence, trial counsel discussed this with him, and, thus, trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to pursue the motion. This court dismissed the petitioner's appeal from the second habeas court's judgment, and our Supreme Court denied certification to appeal.

The habeas court appointed counsel for him. On October 16, 2013, the petitioner amended his petition, claiming that his\n   trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to (1) investigate the facts and circumstances of his statements to law enforcement officers, and the facts and circumstances concerning the search of his vehicle; (2) research legal and factual grounds for a motion to suppress his statements to law enforcement officers and also to suppress any additional evidence discovered in the search of his vehicle; (3) adequately advise him about the grounds for moving to suppress such evidence; (4) adequately advise him of the option to file a motion to suppress; and (5) adequately advise him about whether to accept the plea deal. He also claimed ineffective assistance of first and second habeas counsel for failing to argue trial counsel's ineffectiveness under the\n   <em>\n    Strickland -Hill\n   </em>\n   standard\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   for ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 13, 2013, the respondent filed a motion for summary judgment, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 23-37,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   in which he alleged both that the third amended petition was a successive petition and that the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel barred the claims contained therein. Following a hearing on the motion, the habeas court,\n   <em>\n    Cobb, J.\n   </em>\n   , found that count one concerning trial counsel and count two concerning first habeas counsel constituted successive petitions and granted summary judgment against the petitioner on those counts. As to count three concerning second habeas counsel, however, the court denied the respondent's motion for summary judgment because no prior claims had been made against second habeas counsel,\n   and, therefore, the count was not barred as successive or by res judicata.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On June 4, 2014, the court,\n   <em>\n    Fuger, J.\n   </em>\n   , rendered judgment denying the petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The court concluded that it could not grant relief to the petitioner on count three because judgment had been rendered against him on his claims that trial counsel and first habeas counsel were ineffective as alleged in counts one and two of his third petition, and the judgment rendered on counts one and two was binding on the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The petitioner filed a motion to open the judgment rendered by the court,\n   <em>\n    Fuger, J\n   </em>\n   . On July 21, 2014, the court granted the\n   petitioner's motion to open the judgment and restored count three to the docket; however, the court also gave notice that a good cause determination would have to be made under General Statutes \u00a7 52-470 (b) (1)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   before count three could proceed to trial, and it ordered the parties to submit arguments on the good cause issue. On July 29, 2014, the court,\n   <em>\n    Fuger, J.\n   </em>\n   , denied a motion to vacate the order requiring good cause submissions, finding \u00a7 52-470 (b) (1) to be applicable to the petitioner's operative petition. The respondent filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to \u00a7 52-470 (b) (1) on August 19, 2014, arguing that good cause to proceed was not present because the factual basis for the claims asserted by the petitioner had already been raised before and determined by the prior habeas courts against him. The petitioner countered that there was good cause to proceed because the claims he asserted in his third petition had not been presented to a court. Specifically, he argued that first and second habeas\n   counsel relied on the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   standard,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   whereas the applicable law to be applied was the\n   <em>\n    Strickland -Hill\n   </em>\n   standard. After a hearing, the court found that the petitioner failed to make a showing of good cause to proceed to trial and, alternatively, that the claims set forth in the petition were successive or were barred by the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel. Thereafter, the third habeas court granted certification to appeal, and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Additional facts will be discussed where relevant to the issues raised by the petitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The petitioner argues that the habeas court erred when it rendered summary judgment on counts one and two because they were successive. Our standard of review of a summary judgment is well established. \"[S]ummary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.... Our review of the trial court's decision to grant [a] motion for summary judgment is plenary.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    O &amp; G Industries, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485369\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/950/#p301\">\n    322 Conn. 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 301-302,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485369\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/950/#p301\">\n    140 A.3d 950\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) ; see also Practice Book \u00a7 23-37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A habeas petition is successive if it is based on the same grounds as those raised in a prior petition.\n   <em>\n    Zollo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071491\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/133/266/#p276\">\n    133 Conn.App. 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 276,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20A.3d%20337\">\n    35 A.3d 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. granted on other grounds,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=304%20Conn.%20910\">\n    304 Conn. 910\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20A.3d%201120\">\n    39 A.3d 1120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) (appeal dismissed May 1, 2013). \"Practice Book \u00a7 23-29 (3)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   provides that a\n   petition may be dismissed by the court if the petition presents the same ground as a prior petition previously denied and fails to state new facts or to proffer new evidence not reasonably available at the time of the prior petition ....\" (Emphasis omitted;\n   footnote added; internal quotation marks omitted.)

Accordingly, when a petitioner fails to prove after a habeas trial that trial counsel provided him ineffective assistance, that petitioner cannot as a matter of law prove prejudice resulting solely from the first and second habeas counsel's alleged failure to raise claims against trial counsel on the same grounds.

Assuming, arguendo, that this is true, the petitioner still must prove that trial counsel's performance was deficient, which he twice has failed to do, to succeed on his claim. Again, the difference between the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   standard and the\n   <em>\n    Strickland -Hill\n   </em>\n   standard is the prejudice prong. To establish that first and second habeas counsel were ineffective, the petitioner would be required to prove, as he pleaded, that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to (1) investigate the facts and circumstances of his statements to law enforcement and the search of his vehicle; (2) research legal and factual grounds for a motion to suppress his statements to law enforcement or any evidence discovered in the search of his vehicle; (3) adequately advise him about grounds for moving to suppress such evidence; (4) adequately advise him of the option to file a motion to suppress; and (5) adequately advise him about whether to accept the plea deal. The court,\n   <em>\n    Nazzaro, J.\n   </em>\n   , found in the second habeas case that (1) the petitioner was not in custody when he made incriminating statements, (2) he consented to\n   the search of his vehicle, and (3) trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to file a motion to suppress the evidence obtained through the petitioner's statements and the search, or by not advising the petitioner to go forward with such a motion. Because the petitioner failed to prove any of these allegations, none of the habeas courts had to reach the issue of whether there was any prejudice to the petitioner under either standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We therefore conclude that the first and second habeas courts, inter alia, necessarily decided against the petitioner that trial counsel's performance was not deficient. The second habeas court's determination included the petitioner's statements to law enforcement officers, the search of his car, and the issues concerning the suppression of such evidence. Collateral estoppel precludes the petitioner from relitigating the same claims as part of his claim against second habeas counsel. Additionally, we also conclude that because the first habeas court necessarily decided the underlying issue of whether trial counsel adequately advised the petitioner of whether to plead guilty or to go to trial, collateral estoppel also precludes the petitioner from relitigating the same claims as part of his claim against second habeas counsel. With all of his claims against second habeas counsel in count three barred by collateral estoppel,\n   the third habeas court did not err in granting the respondent's motion to dismiss that count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The petitioner's claims against trial counsel and first habeas counsel are barred as successive, and the doctrine of collateral estoppel bars his claims against second habeas counsel. Accordingly, the third habeas court properly rendered summary judgment on counts one and two, and properly dismissed count three.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    The habeas court granted the petitioner's claim for certification to appeal.
