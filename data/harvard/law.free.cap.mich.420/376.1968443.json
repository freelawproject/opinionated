We are called upon to decide two issues. The first is whether the plaintiffs\u2019 duty disability pensions are subject to the offset provision found in \u00a7 129.1 of the Saginaw pension ordinance, so that their pension benefits can be reduced by the amount of workers\u2019 compensation benefits they receive. Both the Saginaw Circuit Court and the Court of Appeals held that the plaintiffs\u2019 pensions are not subject to such an offset. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The second issue presented for review is whether \u00a7 161 of the Michigan Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act, MCL 418.161; MSA 17.237(161), which allowed police or fire fighters to waive the provision of the WDCA in lieu of \"like benefits\u201d prescribed in a municipality\u2019s charter, is applicable to the facts of these cases. We hold that it is not, because the pension plan here was not prescribed in Saginaw\u2019s charter, but rather was provided by ordinance. <em>Vasser v Muskegon, </em>415 Mich 308; 329 NW2d 690 (1982) (opinion by Williams, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">All three plaintiffs in this case, James H. Ban-nan, George J. Kaufman, and Raymond J. Hale, were employed as fire fighters by the City of Sagi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>naw. In 1978, each' plaintiff filed a complaint against the city in the Saginaw Circuit Court, contesting the city\u2019s practice of deducting from his disability pension benefits the full amount of weekly workers\u2019 compensation benefits he received. The deductions were made pursuant to \u00a7 129.1 of the Saginaw City Ordinance. The consolidated actions involve similar facts, all of which were stipulated in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Mr. Bannan was employed by the city from 1942 until 1967. Since March 1, 1967, he has received weekly workers\u2019 compensation benefits of $69 or $3,588 annually, pursuant to a decision of the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Disability Compensation. Mr. Bannan became 55 years of age<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on March 1, 1969, and was retired by the city on May 23, 1969, under the duty disability retirement provision of the city\u2019s pension ordinance. Ord. No. D-l, ch 5, art 1, \u00a7 123.1. At this time, he became entitled to an annual pension of $3,479.06. However, since May 23, 1969, the city has deducted the full amount of weekly workers\u2019 compensation benefits paid to Mr. Bannan from the amount of pension benefits to which he is entitled as a disability retirant. Since the amount of his workers\u2019 compensation benefits exceeded his pension benefits, he has received no money from the Policemen and Firemen Retirement System of Saginaw. The amount of offsets in controversy totals $26,383.65.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Mr. Kaufman worked for the city from 1938 until 1973. He became 55 years of age on May 20, 1971. On November 21, 1974, the city voluntarily began paying Mr. Kaufman weekly workers\u2019 compensation benefits, paid retroactively to September 20, 1973, of $104 per week or $5,408 annually. The parties stipulated in the trial court that Mr. Kauf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>man is entitled to duty disability retirement status as of September 20, 1973. The annual pension to which he is entitled is $10,408.84. Mr. Kaufman\u2019s pension benefits have also been offset by the amount of workers\u2019 compensation benefits received, and the amount in controversy is $33,040.65.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Mr. Hale worked as a Saginaw fire fighter from 1949 until 1974. On March 9, 1974, the city voluntarily began paying him workers\u2019 compensation benefits in the amount of $106 per week, or $5,512 annually. He became 55 years of age on September 14, 1974, and was granted a duty disability pension on that date, in the amount of $8,035.30 annually. As with Messrs. Bannan and Kaufman, the city deducted the full amount of Mr. Hale\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation benefits from his pension benefits. The accumulated offset in controversy is $28,254.65.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">In a consolidated opinion, the circuit court found in favor of the plaintiffs. Applying established rules of statutory construction, it concluded that \u00a7 129.1 of the city\u2019s pension ordinance, which mandates the offset of workers\u2019 compensation benefits against pension, benefits, is not applicable to a duty disability retirant after he attains 55 years of age. The judgments entered in favor of each of the plaintiffs required the city to reimburse the plaintiffs for pension payments wrongfully withheld, awarded interest on the amount due, and enjoined the city from deducting workers\u2019 compensation benefits paid or payable from future pension bene_fits payable to the plaintiffs. The Court of Appeals affirmed in a per curiam opinion decided October 7, 1982. <em>Bannan v City of Saginaw, </em>120 Mich App 307; 328 NW2d 35 (1982). The city\u2019s application for rehearing was denied on November 18, 1982. We granted leave to appeal. 418 Mich 880 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Application of Offset Provision (\u00a7 129.1) of Saginaw Pension Ordinance to Over-55 Duty-Disabled Retirees</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">Saginaw\u2019s pension ordinance, which contains the city\u2019s Policemen and Firemen Retirement System, provides for an offset of workers\u2019 compensation benefits against pension benefits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-9\">\"Any workmen\u2019s compensation which may be paid or payable to a member retirant or beneficiary on account of his city employment shall be offset against any pensions payable to such member, retirant or beneficiary. In case the present value of the workmen\u2019s compensation is less than the pension reserves for the pension payable under this ordinance, the present value of such workmen\u2019s compensation shall be deducted from such pension reserves and such pensions as may be provided by the pension reserves so reduced shall be payable under the provisions of this article.\u201d Ord. No. D-1, ch 5, art 1, \u00a7 129.1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">The plaintiffs retired under \u00a7\u00a7 123-124, which provide for work-related disability pensions. Section 123 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-11\">\"A member who becomes physically or mentally totally incapacitated for duty, as a policeman or fireman in the employ of the city, by reason of a personal injury or disease, which the board of trustees finds to have occurred as the natural and proximate result of causes arising out of and in the course of his employment with the city, and the medical director, after a physical examination of such member, certifies to the board that such member is physically or mentally totally incapacitated to perform the duties of a policeman or fireman in the employ of the city, shall be retired by the board upon written application filed with the board by the said member or his department head. * * * [Appeal procedure omitted] * * * Upon his retirement he shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>be entitled to a pension provided in Section 124.\u201d Ord. No. D-l, ch 5, art 1, \u00a7 123.1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">Section 124 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-5\">\"124.1 A member, <em>who retires at or after his attainment of age 55 years on account of disability, </em>as provided in Section 123, shall receive a disability pension computed according to Section 118. Upon his retirement he shall have the right to elect, in lieu of his straight life disability pension, to receive his disability pension under an option provided for in Section 120.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-6\">\"124.2 <em>A member who retires prior to his attainment of age 55 years on account of disability, </em>as provided in Section 123, shall receive a disability pension computed according to Subsections 118.1 and 118.3. For the exclusive purpose only of computing his disability pension his credited service shall be increased by the number of years, and fraction of a year, in the period from the date of his disability retirement to the date he would attain age 55 years. Upon his attainment of age 55 years his disability pension shall be recomputed using a final average salary determined according to the salaries at the time he attains age 55 years for the ranks used in computing his final average salary at the time of his disability retirement. In no event shall such recomputed disability pension be less than the disability pension he received prior to his attaining age 55 years. Upon his retirement he shall have the right to elect, in lieu of a straight life disability pension, to receive his disability pension under an option provided for in Subsection 120. <em>To his attainment of age 55 years his disability pension shall be subject to Sections 128 and 129.\u201d </em>Ord. No. D-l, ch 5, art 1, \u00a7\u00a7 124.1, 124.2 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Each of th&amp; plaintiffs retired at or after age 55 pursuant to \u00a7 124.1. Section 124.1 contains no reference to the workers\u2019 compensation benefits offset provision of \u00a7 129.1. In contrast, \u00a7 124.2, which applies to members who retire <em>before </em>age 55, expressly provides that the \u00a7 129.1 offset provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>sion is applicable to duty disabled retirees until they reach 55 years of age.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The question, therefore, is whether the \u00a7 129.1 offset provision applies to duty disabled retirees who retire under \u00a7 124.1, as did these plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Finding an ambiguity in the pension ordinance, the Court of Appeals employed three familiar rules of statutory construction and applied them to the ordinance to interpret its meaning. <em>Bannan, supra, </em>pp 319-321. Firstly, applying the rule that specific provisions control over general ones in the same statute, the Court of Appeals found that \"the last sentence of \u00a7 124.2 took precedence over the more general provision of \u00a7 129.\u201d <em>Bannan, supra, </em>p 320. Secondly, the Court of Appeals noted that all language in a statute is presumed to have meaning and no part of a statute should be treated as surplusage. In response to the city\u2019s argument that the purpose of the last sentence of \u00a7 124.2 is merely to <em>emphasize </em>that under-55 duty disabled retirees are subject to the \u00a7 129 offset, the Court of Appeals stated that such an interpretation would render the last sentence of \u00a7 124.2 surplusage. <em>Bannan, supra, </em>p 320. The Court therefore concluded that the logical interpretation of \u00a7 124 is that the offset applies to duty disabled retirees <em>until </em>age 55, but does not apply thereafter. <em>Ban-nan, supra, </em>p 320. Thirdly, the Court of Appeals construed the ordinance as a whole, finding that \u00a7 129 is expressly cross-referenced in three different sections: \"(1) in \u00a7 122.1 relating to a retirant taking a nonduty disability retirement; (2) in \u00a7\u00a7 127. l(b)-127.1(e) pertaining to pensions payable to widows, children, and dependents; and (3) in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>\u00a7 124.2, as previously noted, pertaining to a duty-disabled retiree up to 55 years of age.\u201d <em>Bannan, supra, </em>p 320. The Court concluded that, since \u00a7 124.1 does <em>not </em>refer to \u00a7 129, the general offset language of \u00a7 129 \"only applies when expressly cross-referred.\u201d <em>Bannan, supra, </em>p 321. Therefore, the Court of Appeals held that the trial court correctly determined that the \u00a7 129 offset does not apply to the plaintiffs, duty disabled retirees who retired after attaining age 55 under \u00a7 124.1. <em>Ban-nan, supra, </em>p 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Appellant, City of Saginaw, contends that the same rules of statutory construction employed by the Court of Appeals compel the opposite conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">We are satisfied that the Court of Appeals interpretation of the pension ordinance is the correct one, and we agree with the reasoning and result of that portion of its opinion. Moreover, this interpretation is consistent with the policy behind the pension system involved in this case, which is funded in part by mandatory wage contributions. Ord. No. D-l, ch 5, art 1, \u00a7 131.2. Members of the system do not participate in the federal social security system. They may take a voluntary retirement at age 55. See footnote 2. We agree with the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that to deprive duty disabled retirees of their earned retirement income, after they have become 55 years of age, is contrary to the underlying purpose of the pension ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">Our holding that the \u00a7 129.1 offset does not apply to these plaintiffs is also consistent with the policy of liberally construing-pension laws in favor of the intended beneficiaries. <em>O\u2019Connell v Dearborn Pension Board, </em>334 Mich 208, 214-215; 54 NW2d 301 (1952). For these reasons, we hold that the pension benefits of duty disabled retirees who retire pursuant to \u00a7 124.1 of Saginaw\u2019s pension ordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>nance, Ord. No. D-1, ch 5, art 1, are not subject to the \u00a7 129.1 offset of workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Applicability op \u00a7 161 op Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">The second issue presented is whether \u00a7 161 of Michigan\u2019s Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act, MCL 418.161; MSA 17.237(161), is applicable to the facts of this case. In pertinent part, \u00a7 161 provided:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\">\"Policemen, firemen, or employees of the police or fire departments, or their dependents, in municipalities or villages of this state <em>having charter provisions prescribing like bene\u00f1ts, </em>may waive the provisions of this act and <em>accept in lieu thereof such like bene\u00f1ts as are prescribed in the charter </em>but shall not be entitled to like benefits from both. Nothing contained in this act shall be construed as limiting, changing, or repealing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>any of the provisions of a charter of a municipality or village of this state relating to benefits, compensation, pensions, or retirement independent of this act, provided for employees.\u201d MCL 418.161; MSA 17.237(161). (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">Saginaw\u2019s City Charter contains the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\">\"A complete retirement system shall be provided for policemen and firemen of the city by general ordinance.\u201d Ch XVI, \u00a7 1, amended effective January 1, 1965.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The Policemen and Firemen Retirement System is set forth in the city\u2019s ordinances, as discussed above. The issue, then, is whether the \"like benefits\u201d provision contained in \u00a7 161 of the WDCA is applicable where the retirement plan is provided by <em>ordinance, </em>adopted pursuant to a general provision in the charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">In its discussion of this issue, the Court of Appeals distinguished <em>Johnson v Muskegon, </em>61 Mich App 121; 232 NW2d 325 (1975), in which a different panel of the Court of Appeals held that benefits received under a disability retirement plan prescribed in Muskegon\u2019s City Charter were \"like benefits\u201d under \u00a7 161. The Court found that <em>Johnson </em>was distinguishable from this case, in part because the pension benefits in <em>Johnson </em>were set forth in the city charter. <em>Bannan, supra, </em>p 322. The Court further held that the disability benefits in this case are \"primarily retirement benefits,\u201d and therefore not \"like benefits\u201d under \u00a7 161. Visiting Judge R. B. Martin concurred in the per curiam opinion below, but found it unnecessary to decide whether the pension and workers\u2019 compensation benefits were \"like benefits\u201d because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>pension benefits are provided by ordinance and, therefore, \u00a7 161 is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">After the Court of Appeals released its decision in this case, we decided <em>Vasser v Muskegon </em>and <em>Plough v Muskegon, </em>415 Mich 308; 329 NW2d 690 (1982). In those companion cases, we were confronted with the precise issue presented here. <em>Vasser </em>and <em>Plough </em>involved facts similar to these. A fireman and policeman employed by the City of Muskegon were granted duty disability pensions. Muskegon\u2019s retirement plan had previously been prescribed in the city charter, but, in 1973, the charter was amended to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-5\">\"A complete retirement system shall be provided for policemen and firemen of the City of Muskegon, by general ordinance.\u201d <em>Vasser, supra, </em>p 312.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">In both <em>Vasser </em>and <em>Plough, </em>the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board affirmed the hearing referee\u2019s decision that the plaintiffs were required to elect between pension benefits and workers\u2019 compensation benefits pursuant to \u00a7 161 and <em>Johnson v Muskegon, supra. </em>The Court of Appeals affirmed the WCAB. <em>Vasser, supra, </em>p 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">In <em>Vasser, </em>this Court was equally divided on the issue of the applicability of \u00a7 161 to cases in which the benefits are prescribed in an ordinance adopted pursuant to a general provision in the charter. Justice Williams, in an opinion joined by Chief Justice Fitzgerald and Justice Ryan, held that \"the language clearly states that the like benefits must be prescribed in the charter, and, thus, there is no room for judicial interpretation.\u201d <em>Vasser, supra, </em>p 320. The opinion states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-8\">\"We are bound by the clear statutory language and thus conclude that like benefits must be prescribed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>the charter itself for MCL 418.161; MSA 17.237(161) to be applicable. <em>We hold that the pension hene\u00f1ts in these cases being received pursuant to an ordinance do not satisfy the statutory language, even though the ordinance was enacted pursuant to the charter.\u201d Vasser, supra, </em>p 321 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">In response to Muskegon\u2019s contention that \u00a7 161 is applicable because the city charter refers to the retirement plan, Justice Williams stated that such a reference fails to satisfy the clear language of the statute. <em>Vasser, supra, </em>p 321. Moreover, the distinction between a charter pension plan and a plan provided by ordinance \"is more than a matter of form,\u201d since a home-rule city\u2019s charter may only be amended with the electorate\u2019s approval, while the enactment of an ordinance is a much simpler procedure.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Vasser, supra, </em>p 321. Justice Williams\u2019 opinion concluded that, under the clear and unambiguous language of the statute, the plaintiffs, if entitled, could receive both the pension benefits and workers\u2019 compensation benefits. <em>Vasser, supra, </em>p 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">In an opinion authored by Justice Levin, however, three members of the Court were \"of the opinion that the details of 'like benefits\u2019 need not be set forth in the charter.\u201d <em>Vasser, supra, </em>p 326.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Instead, they construed the words \"having charter provisions prescribing like benefits\u201d as meaning the charter may <em>direct, authorize, </em>or <em>provide </em>for \"like benefits.\u201d Holding that the reference to a policemen and firemen retirement system in the Muskegon charter satisfied the relevant language of \u00a7 161, Justice Levin went on to conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>the benefits provided by the Muskegon ordinance were \"like benefits.\u201d <em>Vasser, supra, </em>pp 326-327. Thus, the Court of Appeals decision was affirmed by an equally divided Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">For the reasons given by Justice Williams in his opinion in <em>Vasser, </em>we are persuaded that \u00a7 161 is not applicable to the case before us. Where the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, the court\u2019s role is to apply it as written. <em>Dussia v Monroe County Employees Retirement System, </em>386 Mich 244, 248-249; 191 NW2d 307 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Our resolution of this issue makes it unnecessary for us to determine whether the pension benefits in this case are \"like benefits\u201d under \u00a7 161 of the WDCA, MCL 418.161; MSA 17.237(161).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">The decisions of the Court of Appeals and the circuit court are affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b452-7\">Williams, C.J., and Brickley, Cavanagh, and Boyle, JJ., concurred with Ryan, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b441-8\"> Ordinance No. D-l (Saginaw Administrative Code), ch 5; art 1 (hereinafter \"pension ordinance\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b442-8\"> Saginaw fire fighters may take a voluntary retirement at age 55.

We adhere to the view we expressed in <em>Vasser </em>that where, as in <em>Vasser </em>and here, the charter provided that a \"complete retirement system <em>shall </em>be provided for policemen and firemen of the city by general ordinance\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (emphasis supplied), benefits provided in an ordinance, adopted pursuant to such a charter direction to provide therefor, are prescribed by the charter although the details of the benefits are set forth in an ordinance and not in the charter itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">We would construe the words \"charter provisions prescribing like benefits\u201d (emphasis supplied), as meaning benefits authorized, provided for, or directed to be provided for in the charter. \"We believe this construction is consistent with and implements the apparent legislative purpose of barring double recovery.\u201d <em>Vasser, supra, </em>p 326 (Levin, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Within seven months after our 3-3 indecision in <em>Vasser, </em>the Legislature clarified its intention by amending the statute to eliminate the word \"charter\u201d; the operative language is now \"providing like benefits.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>Our 3-3 division in <em>Vasser </em>indicated an unresolved controversy concerning the construction of the statute. In such circumstances, a legislative change has been regarded as a \"clarification,\u201d and the meaning resulting from the clarification as the originally intended meaning. See <em>Detroit Edison Co v Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>320 Mich 506, 520-521; 31 NW2d 809 (1948), where this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">\"In 1 Sutherland Statutory Construction (3d ed 1943), p 418, \u00a7 1931, it is said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-7\">\" 'If the amendment was enacted soon after controversies arose as to the interpretation of the original act, it is logical to regard the amendment as a legislative interpretation of the original act \u2014 a formal change\u2014 rebutting the presumption of substantial change.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-8\">\"See, also, <em>Attorney General v Lewis, </em>151 Mich 81 [1908]; <em>Hambel v Lowry, </em>264 Mo 168 (174 SW 405) [1915]; <em>John Morrell &amp; Co v Unemployment Compensation Commission, </em>69 SD 618 (13. NW [2d] 498) [1944].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-9\">\"In view of the factual situation existing at the time of the amendment it is a logical conclusion that the primary purpose of the legislature was, as above indicated, to clarify the statute because of the differences of opinion existing between the department of revenue and the board of tax appeals. Plaintiff\u2019s claim as to the force and effect to be given the amendment is not tenable. The presumption on which such claim is based does not obtain.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">The parties have not discussed whether the 1983 amendment, which <em>substituted </em>the amendatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>language for the former language, has retroactive effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">The conclusion of the opinion of the Court that benefits provided in an ordinance are not within the intendment of the statute makes it unnecessary for the majority to address the question whether the benefits in the instant case are \"like benefits.\u201d Since the majority does not reach that question, we also express no opinion thereon.</p>\n<judges id=\"b455-5\">Kavanagh, J., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b453-7\"> Saginaw City Charter, Ch XVI, \u00a7 1.
