We hold:</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">1) All governmental agencies (state and local) are statutorily liable for injuries arising out of the failure to keep highways in reasonable repair (MCL 691.1402; MSA 3.996[102]), negligent operation of a government-owned motor vehicle by an officer, agent, or employee (MCL 691.1405; MSA 3.996[105]), and dangerous or defective conditions in public buildings under the agency\u2019s control (MCL 691.1406; MSA 3.996[106]).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">2) All governmental agencies (state and local) have tort liability for injuries arising out of the performance of a proprietary function. \"Proprietary function\u201d is defined as any activity conducted primarily for pecuniary profit, excluding activities normally supported by taxes or fees (see MCL 691.1413; MSA 3.996[113]).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">3) All governmental agencies (state and local) are immune from tort liability for injuries arising out of the exercise or discharge of a non-proprietary, governmental function. \"Governmental function\u201d is defined as any activity which is expressly or impliedly mandated or authorized by constitution, statute, or other law. An agency\u2019s <em>ultra vires </em>activities are therefore not entitled to immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">4) All governmental agencies (state and local) are vicariously liable for the negligent operation of government-owned motor vehicles by their officers, employees, and agents (MCL 691.1405; MSA 3.996[105]). Vicarious liability for all other torts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>may be imposed on a governmental agency only when its officer, employee, or agent, acting during the course of his employment and within the scope of his authority, commits a tort while engaged in an activity which is non-governmental or proprietary, or which falls within a statutory exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">5) Judges, legislators, and the highest executive officials of all levels of government are absolutely immune from all tort liability whenever they are acting within their respective judicial, legislative, and executive authority. Lower level officers, employees, and agents are immune from tort liability only when they are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-7\">a) acting during the course of their employment and are acting, or reasonably believe they are acting, within the scope of their authority;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-8\">b) acting in good faith; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-9\">c) performing discretionary-decisional, as opposed to ministerial-operational, acts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">\"Discretionary-decisional\u201d acts are those which involve significant decision-making that entails personal deliberation, decision, and judgment. \"Ministerial-operational\u201d acts involve the execution or implementation of a decision and entail only minor decision-making.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-11\">6) If the officer, agent, or employee is acting within the course of his employment and the scope of his authority, the governmental agency may pay for, engage, or furnish an attorney; represent the officer, agent, or .employee in the action; and compromise, settle, pay, or indemnify claims or judgments against the officer, agent, or employee. Such action, however, does not impose tort liability upon the governmental agency (MCL 691.1408; MSA 3.996[108]).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>I. <em>The Governmental Tort Liability Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">The causes of action in each of these cases arose after the governmental immunity statute was enacted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The title of the act, as amended,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> states that it is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-5\">\"AN ACT to make uniform the liability of municipal corporations, political subdivisions, and the state, its agencies and departments, when engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function, for injuries to property and persons; to define and limit this liability; to define and limit the liability of the state when engaged in a proprietary function; to authorize the purchase of liability insurance to protect against loss arising out of this liability; to provide for defending certain claims made against public officers and paying damages sought or awarded against them; to provide for the legal defense of public officers and employees; to provide for reimbursement of public officers and employees for certain legal expenses; and to repeal certain acts and parts of acts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">The governmental immunity act sets forth four categories of activity for which tort liability may be imposed. All governmental agencies, both state and local<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> are statutorily liable for bodily injury and property damage arising out of the failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>keep their highways in reasonable repair,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the negligent operation of a government-owned motor vehicle by the agency\u2019s officer, agent, or employee,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and dangerous or defective conditions in public buildings under the agency\u2019s control.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In addition, the state and its agencies, departments, and commissions are liable when engaged in a proprietary function.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>The heart of the act is \u00a7 7, which provides broad immunity from tort liability to governmental agencies whenever they are engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-4\">\"Except as in this act otherwise provided, all governmental agencies shall be immune from tort liability in all cases wherein the government agency is engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function. Except as otherwise provided herein, this act shall not be construed as modifying or restricting the immunity of the state from tort liability as it existed heretofore, which immunity is affirmed.\u201d MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Two problems are readily apparent in interpreting this provision. First, the second sentence statutorily affirms the law of sovereign (state) immunity from tort liability as it existed at the time the statute was enacted. Thus, this Court must examine the history of sovereign immunity to determine the exact parameters of the state\u2019s immunity. Second, \"governmental function\u201d is not defined in the act. This Court has struggled for more than a century to reach a consensus on this term\u2019s definition and application in a myriad of factual situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Finally, the act allows a governmental agency to provide legal assistance to and reimbursement of settlements and judgments levied against its officers, agents, and employees under certain circumstances.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number><footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, the act does not define under what circumstances such officers, agents, and employees may be held liable for their tortious acts. Nor does it specifically address the question of whether a governmental agency may be held vicariously liable for such torts under a theory of <em>respondeat superior. </em>We must again resort to an analysis of common law to determine the parameters of official liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">In resolving the questions presented by this act, our goal has been to create a cohesive, uniform, and workable set of rules which will readily define the injured party\u2019s rights and the governmental agency\u2019s liability. We recognize that our case law on these questions is confused, often irreconcilable, and of little guidance to the bench and bar. We have made great efforts to reexamine our prior collective and individual views on this subject in order to formulate an approach which is faithful to the statutory language and legislative intent. Wherever possible and necessary, we have reaffirmed our prior decisions. The consensus which our efforts produce today should not be viewed as this Court\u2019s individual or collective determinations of what would be most fair or just or the best public policy. The consensus does reflect, however, what we believe the Legislature intended the law to be in this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">II. <em>Sovereign (State) Immunity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">Although the concepts of \"sovereign immunity\u201d and \"governmental immunity\u201d are related, they have distinct origins and histories:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-8\">\" '[Sovereign\u2019 immunity and 'governmental\u2019 immunity are not synonymous. True, they have been over the years used interchangeably in decisions, but a delin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>eation may be helpful. <em>Sovereign </em>immunity is a specific term limited in its application to the State and to the departments, commissions; boards, institutions, and instrumentalities of the State. The reason is the State is the only sovereignty in our system of government, except as the States delegated part of their implicit sovereignty to the Federal government.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-4\">\"Over the years, by judicial construction, this 'sovereign\u2019 immunity has been transmogrified into 'governmental\u2019 immunity and made applicable to the 'inferior\u2019 divisions of government, <em>i.e., </em>townships, school districts, villages, cities, and counties, but with an important distinction. These subdivisions of government enjoyed the immunity only when engaged in 'governmental\u2019 as distinguished from 'proprietary\u2019 functions.\u201d <em>Myers v Genesee County Auditor, </em>375 Mich 1, 6, 8-9; 133 NW2d 190 (1965) (opinion by O\u2019Hara, J.) (emphasis in the original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Sovereign immunity is an ancient common-law concept that predates the statehood of Michigan by centuries. The sovereign immunity rule stated that the \"sovereign\u201d was immune from suit unless he consented to the action. Over the years, lawyers and judges have articulated two bases for this rule. The first rationale developed from the perception that the sovereign (the king) was somehow \"divine\u201d or above the law. As such, the king could commit no wrong and was, therefore, never properly sued. The second explanation was that the king was superior to the courts which he had created and vested with a portion of his power. As such, while the sovereign could do wrong, there was no entity with power to enter judgment against the sovereign. Only by the sovereign\u2019s consent (essentially, a self-inflicted judgment) could a party recover for an injury caused by the sovereign. This rule, with its dual rationale, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>the common-law rule for all sovereigns in the early nineteenth century.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">From statehood forward, Michigan jurisprudence recognized that the sovereign (the state) was immune from <em>all </em>suits, including suits for tortious injuries which it had caused. The rationale for sovereign immunity was never grounded in a belief that the state could do no wrong. Rather, sovereign immunity existed in Michigan because the state, as creator of the courts, was not subject to them or their jurisdiction. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Michigan State Bank v Hastings, </em>1 Doug 225, 236 (Mich, 1844):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-5\">\"The principle is well settled that, while a state may sue, it cannot be sued in its own courts, unless, indeed, it consents to submit itself to their jurisdiction. * * * [A]n act of the legislature, conferring jurisdiction upon the courts in the particular case, is the usual mode by which the state consents to submit its rights to the judgment of the judiciary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Thus, the original Michigan rule held that the state was immune from all suits except to the extent that it consented to be sued in its courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Sovereign immunity was not, however, an absolute bar to recovery against the state. As noted in <em>Hastings, </em>the Legislature could and did consent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>suits. In 1842, the difficulties caused by legislative disposition of every claim against the state led to the creation of the Board of State Auditors. The Legislature authorized the board to hear and decide claims against the state.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In effect, the Board of State Auditors exercised the \"sovereign\u201d legislative power to consent to suit or to assert sovereign immunity. However, when the board chose not to consent to \"suit,\u201d the issue was not appealable to the state courts. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>People ex rel Ayres v Board of State </em>Auditors, 42 Mich 422, 427-428; 4 NW 274 (1880):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-4\">\"[N]o claim against the State could, under the old Constitution, be allowed except by the Legislature. The State has never, before or since, allowed itself to be sued in its own courts * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-5\">\"* * * In providing for a different method of determining claims against the State, it was not deemed proper to include it within the judicial power * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">In the 1920\u2019s, most of this general claims function was transferred to the State Administrative Board. Among other matters, the board was statutorily authorized to inquire into, settle, and pay claims for injuries incurred by state employees during the course of their employment,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and to entertain and pay claims for damages arising out of the negligent construction, improvement, or maintenance of state trunk line highways.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In. addition, it had the discretionary power to hear and determine claims against the state arising from the \"negligence, malfeasance or misfeasance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>of any state officer, employe, commission, department, board, institution, or other governmental division * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">In 1939, the Legislature created the Court of Claims. 1939 PA 135, \u00a7 2. The Court of Claims was given exclusive jurisdiction \"[t]o hear and determine all claims and demands, liquidated and unliquidated, ex contractu and ex delicto, against the state and any of its departments, commissions, boards, institutions, arms or agencies.\u201d \u00a78(1). By creating a court with jurisdiction over the state, the Legislature destroyed the theoretical basis for sovereign immunity. There was now an entity with power to hear cases against the state, and individual consent to suit was no longer required. However, the Legislature retained sovereign immunity from tort liability in \u00a7 24:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-7\">\"This act shall in no manner be construed as enlarging the present liabilities of the state and any of its departments, commissions, boards, institutions, arms or agencies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">The distinction between immunity from suit and immunity from liability was made clear in <em>Manion </em>v <em>State Highway Comm\u2019r, </em>303 Mich 1, 19-21; 5 NW2d 527 (1942). There, plaintiff sued for injuries received while employed by the State Highway Commission. The state successfully moved to dismiss the suit on the grounds that the injuries were sustained during the maintenance of a highway, which was a governmental function. In determining exactly what immunity the Legislature had waived by enacting 1939 PA 135, the majority wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>\"The State, as sovereign, is immune from suit save as it consents to be sued, and any relinquishment of sovereign immunity must be strictly interpreted * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-4\"><em>\"There is a distinction between sovereign immunity from suit and sovereign immunity from liability. The latter exists when the sovereign is engaged in a governmental function. </em>The former may be waived without a waiver of the latter. Section 24 of the court of claims act * * * reads:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-5\">\" 'This act shall in no manner be construed as enlarging the present liabilities of the State and any of its departments, commissions, boards, institutions, arms or agencies.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-6\">\"I construe this to mean that the State\u2019s immunity from liability while engaged in a governmental function is preserved because the waiver of this defense would enlarge the 'present liabilities of the State.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-7\">\"The State is not liable in this instance because of its sovereign immunity from liability in the performance of a governmental function and not because of its sovereign immunity from suit.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3VL\">Subsequent decisions emphasized that the common-law doctrine of sovereign immunity from tort liability could not be waived or abrogated except by statute. <em>Mead v Michigan Public Service Comm, </em>303 Mich 168, 173; 5 NW2d 740 (1942); <em>McNair v State Highway Dep\u2019t, </em>305 Mich 181, 187; 9 NW2d 52 (1943). In addition, sovereign immunity from tort liability was recognized as a defense only when the state was engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function. See, <em>eg., Daszkiewicz v Detroit Bd of Ed, </em>301 Mich 212, 220; 3 NW2d 71 (1942); <em>Mead, supra, </em>p 171; <em>Thomas v Dep\u2019t of State Highways, </em>398 Mich 1, 11, fn 5; 247 NW2d 530 (1976); <em>Bofysil v Dep\u2019t of State Highways, </em>44 Mich App 118, 126; 205 NW2d 222 (1972), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number><em>lv den </em>389 Mich 768 (1973).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">In 1943, the Legislature abolished a significant portion of the state\u2019s sovereign immunity from tort liability by amending \u00a7 24 of 1939 PA 135. The state was now liable for injuries caused by the misfeasance or negligence of its officers and employees while acting within the scope of their employment. 1943 PA 237, \u00a7 24.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> However, 1943 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>PA 237 was repealed soon thereafter by 1945 PA 87, \u00a7 2, thus resurrecting the state\u2019s previous common-law sovereign immunity from tort liability. 1945 PA 87, \u00a7 1, however, created a limited statutory exception to this common-law immunity \u2014 the state was liable for damages arising out of the negligent operation of a state-owned motor vehicle by a state employee. The fact that the state was engaged in a governmental function at the time of the injury was not a defense.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Thus, the Legislature impliedly acknowledged that the state enjoyed immunity only when it was engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">The viability of the doctrine of sovereign immunity was not seriously assailed until <em>Williams v </em>Detroit, 364 Mich 231; 111 NW2d 1 (1961). There, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>plaintiffs decedent fell down an elevator shaft in a city building while moving furniture out of city offices. The majority held that the city was immune from liability because the injury was incurred while the city was performing a governmental function. In the future, however, this would not be so. Justice Edwards, joined by Justices Smith, T. M. Kavanagh, and Souris, wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-6\">\"From this date forward the judicial doctrine of governmental immunity from ordinary torts no longer exists in Michigan. In this case, we overrule preceding court-made law to the contrary.\u201d <em>Williams, supra, </em>p 250.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">However, Justice Black\u2019s concurring opinion held that immunity from liability would only be abolished for municipalities, not for the state and its subdivisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-8\">\"We are <em>not </em>considering today \u2014 as the opinions of both Brothers suggest \u2014 'the doctrine of governmental immunity.\u2019 That doctrine includes within its purview the State and 'its departments, commissions, boards, institutions, arms or agencies.\u2019 * * * We <em>are </em>considering the common-law rule that <em>municipal corporations </em>are immune from tort liability. 'Municipal corporations\u2019 are distinctively definable * * * and care should be taken that today\u2019s decision is confined thereto.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 278 (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">Thus, by a 4-4 vote, sovereign immunity was reaffirmed. Justice Black\u2019s position was thereafter adopted in <em>McDowell v State Highway Comm\u2019r, </em>365 Mich 268, 270-271; 112 NW2d 491 (1961).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>In reaction to this Court\u2019s abolition of common-law governmental immunity for municipalities in <em>Williams, </em>and in anticipation of a similar demise of immunity for counties, townships, and villages,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> the Legislature enacted the governmental immunity act in 1964. The first sentence of \u00a7 7 was intended to not only restore governmental immunity to non-sovereign governmental agencies, but to provide uniform treatment for state and local agencies.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Furthermore, the affirmance of corn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>mon-law sovereign immunity in the second sentence of \u00a7 7 was a clear directive that this Court henceforth could not further extend <em>Williams </em>and judicially abrogate the state\u2019s sovereign immunity. See <em>Thomas, supra, </em>398 Mich 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Therefore, at the time \u00a7 7 was enacted, the state was immune from tort liability when it was engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function, unless a statutory exception was applicable. This same immunity is reiterated by the first and second sentences of \u00a7 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">Subsequent decisions of this Court did not change the parameters of statutory sovereign immunity. In <em>Maki v East Tawas, </em>385 Mich 151; 188 NW2d 593 (1971), this Court affirmed the Court of Appeals determination that \u00a7 7 was unconstitutional because it violated the title-object clause of Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 24.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> During the pendency of the case before this Court, however, the Legislature amended the title of the governmental immunity act to remedy the constitutional problem. It did not modify \u00a7 7 in any significant respect.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Such action indicates that the Legislature did not intend to change the scope of statutory sovereign or governmental immunity from that intended in* the original 1964 version of \u00a7 7._</p>\n<p id=\"b669-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>The net effect of <em>Maki </em>was that statutory sovereign and governmental immunity did not exist until August 1, 1970, the effective date of the Legislature\u2019s amendment ,of the act\u2019s title. Causes of action arising before this date were governed by this Court\u2019s common-law decisions. <em>Pittman v City of Taylor, </em>398 Mich 41, 46; 247 NW2d 512 (1976) (opinion of Kavanagh, C.J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\"><em>Pittman </em>subsequently abolished common-law sovereign immunity as to that case and those cases pending as of November 23, 1976 (the date <em>Pittman </em>was decided) which had raised an express challenge to common-law \"governmental\u201d <em>(i.e., </em>sovereign) immunity. <em>Id., </em>p 50.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> ********************23 However, the lead opinion specifically noted that its holding abol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>ished only <em>common-law </em>immunity; the statutory immunity conferred by the governmental immunity act had to be given effect, unless it was unconstitutional to do so. <em>Id., </em>p 49, fn 8. Since <em>Pittman </em>was decided long after the Legislature enacted and amended the act, it is not relevant to determining the legislative intent behind the second sentence of \u00a7 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">In summary, at the time \u00a7 7 was enacted and became effective, the state enjoyed immunity from tort liability at common law whenever it was engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function, unless a statutory exception was applicable. This common-law sovereign immunity was codified by the second sentence of \u00a7 7. The immunity granted to the state by the first sentence of \u00a77 is essentially coextensive with this common-law immunity. We note that this interpretation furthers the Legislature\u2019s intent to create uniform standards of liability for state and non-sovereign governmental agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">III. Definition <em>of \"Governmental Function\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">Sovereign and governmental immunity from tort liability exist only when governmental agencies are \"engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function.\u201d \u00a7 7. Although \"governmental function\u201d is not defined in the act, it \"is a term of art which has been used by the courts of this state to describe those activities of government which due to their public nature should not give rise to liability at common law.\u201d <em>Thomas v Dep\u2019t of State Highways, </em>398 Mich 1, 9; 247 NW2d 530 (1976). There is a substantial body of case law defining this term. The initial question which must be resolved is whether the phrase \"governmental function\u201d is to be interpreted in light of present-day governmental activities, or whether the Legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>lature intended \u00a7 7 to have, as its fixed meaning, the common-law definition which existed at the time \u00a7 7 became effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">In <em>Thomas, supra, </em>pp 9-11, a majority of the Court concluded that we were bound by the common-law definition.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> However, this holding was overruled in <em>Parker v Highland Park, </em>404 Mich 183; 273 NW2d 413 (1978). In holding that the operation of a general hospital by a city is not a governmental function, Justice Fitzgerald, joined by Chief Justice Kavanagh and Justice Levin, wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-5\">\"[W]e [do not] believe that the Legislature intended that we must today hold the operation of a hospital to be a governmental function because we did so in 1902 and 1950. As was stated in the Kavanagh-Fitzgerald dissenting opinion in <em>Thomas v Dep\u2019t of State Highways, </em>398 Mich 1, 17, fn 4; 247 NW2d 530 (1976), to read the second sentence of MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107) as 'preserving for all time state governmental immunity heretofore recognized by case-law\u2019 would be to 'assume that the Legislature failed to recognize that the evolution of case law precedent is exclusively committed to the judicial branch of government.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-6\">\"Determining whether or not a certain activity is or is not a 'governmental function\u2019 is a matter of statutory interpretation. In the absence of a legislative definition of the term, statutory interpretation is a function committed to the judiciary. The term 'governmental function\u2019 is particularly subject to judicial interpretation because the phrase is of judicial origin.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 192._</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>Justice Moody reached a similar conclusion in his concurring opinion. <em>Id., </em>pp 197-199.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">We decline this opportunity to overrule this aspect of <em>Parker. </em>We note that the Legislature was certainly aware of our conflicting \"morass\u201d of case law concerning the definition of \"governmental function\u201d when it enacted \u00a7 7. The Legislature could have statutorily defined the term, as it did with \"proprietary function\u201d in \u00a7 13, but it has not done so. Furthermore, judicial development and refinement of the concept of governmental function allows us to keep abreast of the changing activities and needs of government and its people.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">A. <em>Prior De\u00f1nitions of \"Governmental Function\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Prior to 1976, the decisions of this Court generally fell into two categories. A governmental agency could not assert the defense of sovereign or governmental immunity from tort liability if it was engaged in a \"proprietary\u201d function<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> or did not act for the \"common good of all.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In 1976, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>\"essence to governing\u201d test was articulated by the <em>Thomas </em>dissent. Under this test, a function is not governmental unless the particular activity involved is essential to governing in that it has no common analogy to the private sector. <em>Thomas, supra, </em>p 21 (Kavanagh, C.J., and Fitzgerald, J., <em>dissenting).</em><footnotemark><em>28</em></footnotemark><em> </em>A similar \"of essence to governing\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>test was created by the late Justice Blair Moody, Jr. Rather than requiring that the activity have no common analogy, Justice Moody believed that the governmental agency must show that \"the purpose, planning and carrying out of the activity, due to its unique character or governmental mandate, can be effectively accomplished only by the government.\u201d <em>Parker, supra, </em>p 200.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Unfortunately, each of these tests has proved difficult to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\"><em>\"Proprietary Function\u201d Test. </em>Since government is instituted for the equal benefit, security, and protection of its people,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> a governmental agency cannot claim that it is engaged in a governmental function when the activity makes a profit for itself or for private individuals. Decisions of this Court have differed, however, as to how much, if any, incidental profit can be generated before an activity is deemed to be proprietary.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> By enacting \u00a7 13 of the governmental immunity act, the Legislature adopted the common-law \"proprietary function\u201d test but made it clear that activities which generate an incidental profit may still be considered governmental functions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-8\">\"The immunity of the state shall not apply to actions to recover for bodily injury or property damage arising out of the performance of a proprietary function as herein defined. Proprietary function shall mean any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>activity which is conducted primarily for the purpose of producing a pecuniary profit for the state, excluding, however, any activity normally supported by taxes or fees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">However, the enactment of \u00a7 13 presents two problems. First, it can be argued that if proprietary functions have always been considered nongovernmental in nature, there would have been no need to enact the first sentence of \u00a7 13. Stated another way, the statutory waiver of immunity from tort liability for proprietary functions would have been totally unnecessary because such functions have never enjoyed immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">We do not believe that \u00a7 13 is mere surplusage. As with the second sentence of \u00a7 7, the Legislature wished to codify the \"proprietary function\u201d test and to define clearly the parameters thereof to prevent this Court from further modifying the common-law test. Nevertheless, in order to avoid rendering the first sentence surplusage, we will no longer define \"governmental function\u201d with reference to \"proprietary function.\u201d The question whether a particular activity is governmental or proprietary in nature involves two separate inquiries. A governmental agency which performs a proprietary function is not immune from tort liability pursuant to \u00a7 13; however, the converse is not necessarily true. An activity may generate no profit <em>(i.e., </em>be nonproprietary), but may still be nongovernmental in nature, as hereinafter defined, and thus subject to tort liability pursuant to \u00a7 7.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">The second problem is that \u00a7 13 applies only to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>the state and its agencies, departments and commissions. The failure to include non-sovereign governmental agencies could be interpreted as bestowing governmental immunity upon their proprietary activities. We decline to read \u00a7 13 in such a manner because we do not believe the Legislature intended such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">The governmental immunity act was intended to provide uniform liability and immunity to both state and local governmental agencies. A strict <em>\"expressio unius est exclusio </em>alterius\u201d reading of \u00a7 13 would destroy this uniformity. As noted in <em>Pittman, supra, </em>p 48, there is no satisfactory reason to treat state and non-sovereign governmental agencies differently. Moreover, the \"proprietary function\u201d exception to common-law governmental immunity was well established at the time \u00a7 13 was enacted. If the Legislature had wished to abolish this rule as to non-sovereign governmental agencies, it would have done so in more explicit language.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Therefore, we reaffirm the common-law \"proprietary function\u201d exception to governmental immunity from tort liability, and we conclude that the statutory definition of \"proprietary function\u201d is applicable to all governmental agencies, State and local. In short, although \u00a7 13 of the governmental immunity act applies only to state governmental agencies, the same terms and principles embodied therein will be judicially applied to non-sovereign governmental agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\"><em>\"Common Good of All\u201d Test. </em>This test was aptly summarized by Justice Ryan in <em>Ross, supra, </em>p 7:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-9\">\"The expression \"common good of all\u201d has been used for more than a half century in cases discussing the doctrine of governmental immunity. Originally, it was intended to distinguish between governmental activity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>which has an exclusively public purpose as opposed to that which is 'of special corporate benefit or pecuniary profit.\u2019 See <em>Bolster v City of Lawrence, </em>225 Mass 387; 114 NE 722 (1917). The expression was first employed in our state\u2019s jurisprudence in cases concerning the immunity or liability of municipal corporations to distinguish between 'governmental\u2019 and 'proprietary\u2019 municipal functions. <em>Gunther v Cheboygan County Road Comm\u2019rs, </em>225 Mich 619, 621; 196 NW 386 (1923). See also <em>Martinson v Alpena, </em>328 Mich 595; 44 NW2d 148 (1950), and cases cited therein. More recently the expression has been used in governmental immunity cases interpreting MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107) to describe the standard by which an activity of a governmental agency is judged to be a governmental function and therefore immune from tort liability at the common law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">The proponents of the \"essence to governing\u201d test have criticized the \"common good of all\u201d test. They argue that governmental agencies often engage in activities which arguably contribute to the common good. Nevertheless, these same activities are often accomplished by non-governmental entities which do not enjoy immunity from tort liability. The mere fact that a governmental agency engages in such an activity does not convert the activity into a governmental function. <em>Ross, supra, </em>pp 29-30 (opinion of Kavanagh, J.); <em>Parker, supra, </em>pp 194-195 (opinion of Fitzgerald, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Aside from these criticisms, we also note that. the \"common good of all\u201d test is rather amorphous and difficult to apply. Almost all government activity is in some sense directed toward the public good. Nevertheless, it is rare when a particular activity benefits every member of the state equally. For example, a state mental hospital, such as that involved in <em>Perry, </em>is theoretically open to every member of the state who requires psychiatric treatment. In practice, however, only a small percentage of the state population actually uses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>the. facility. Similarly, a municipal hospital, such as that involved in <em>Parker, </em>is generally open only to local residents even though it is a public facility. Finally, although the drain constructed in <em>Ross </em>was planned, designed, constructed, and maintained pursuant to the state Drain Code\u2019s comprehensive system of water management control, it directly benefited only the Jackson County landowners whose land was drained. Because application of the \"common good of all\u201d test could result in either immunity or liability depending upon the viewpoint of the particular decision-maker, we decline to incorporate this test into the definition of \"governmental function.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\"><em>\"Essence to/of Governing\u201d Tests. </em>These tests represent attempts to describe and pinpoint those activities which are uniquely and generally associated with government. Relatively few activities can qualify for immunity under the \"essence of governing\u201d test since they must have no common analogy to the private sector. As the <em>Thomas </em>dissent noted, their test would generally grant immunity only to executive, legislative, or judicial decision-making and planning \u2014 the execution of these decisions would be susceptible to tort liability. <em>Thomas, supra, </em>pp 21-22. Moreover, governmental activities which appear unique at the time a particular case is decided may not be so in the future. Private enterprise has ventured into such \"unique\u201d activities as providing private security forces and establishing jail facilities. Some activities which a governmental agency is required by law to undertake and provide to the public, and which have consistently been afforded immunity from tort liability, have common private sector counterparts, <em>e.g., </em>public schools and state mental health facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">Justice Moody\u2019s \"essence of governing\u201d test pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>vides more flexibility because it focuses on whether the activity can be effectively accomplished only by government. Unfortunately, this approach is also flawed. For example, as noted in <em>Ross, supra, </em>pp 23-24 (opinion of Ryan, J.), many storm drains in the state are privately financed and built by individual landowners who require them. Private construction companies may be able to engineer, construct, and maintain drains more effectively than the local drainage district. Nevertheless, the fact remains that the drainage district is statutorily responsible for providing an efficient and systematic drainage system to safeguard the public health and welfare. Private enterprise may also decline to engage in or abandon an activity which benefits the public good <em>(e.g., </em>a hospital or health care facility) because it is not sufficiently profitable, not because it cannot effectively accomplish the activity. If a governmental agency thereafter assumes the responsibility in order to provide or continue to make available necessary public services, it risks tort liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">Finally, both tests fail to specify precisely what activity must be evaluated. As noted in <em>Ross, supra, </em>pp 22-23 (opinion of Ryan, J.), if the actual physical construction of a drain, sewer, or other public project is the activity which must be evaluated, immunity will never be afforded to the governmental agency which undertakes the construction itself, since the private sector often undertakes similar projects. This would be true even where the project is mandated by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">B. <em>New De\u00f1nition of \"Governmental Function\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The fundamental problem with the \"common good of all\u201d and \"essence to/of governing\u201d definitions of \"governmental function\u201d is that they require the judiciary to make value judgments as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>which activities government should be allowed to engage in without being held responsible for the unfortunate consequences thereof. This type of subjective inquiry necessarily results in legitimate difference of opinion. In contrast, the immunity from tort liability provided by \u00a7 7 is expressed in the broadest possible language \u2014 it extends immunity to <em>all </em>governmental agencies for <em>all </em>tort liability <em>whenever </em>they are engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function. This broad grant of immunity, when coupled with the four narrowly drawn statutory exceptions, suggests that the Legislature intended that the term \"governmental function\u201d be interpreted in a broad manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The Legislature\u2019s refusal to abolish completely sovereign and governmental immunity, despite this Court\u2019s recent attempts to do so, evidences a clear legislative judgment that public and private tortfeasors should be treated differently. This disparate treatment is not totally unjustifiable. The California Law Commission, after an extensive and careful study of the problems presented by sovereign and governmental immunity, concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-7\">\"The problems involved in drawing standards for governmental liability and governmental immunity are of immense difficulty. Government cannot merely be liable as private persons are for public entities are fundamentally different from private persons. Private persons do not make laws. Private persons do not issue and revoke licenses to engage in various professions and occupations. Private persons do not quarantine sick persons and do not commit mentally disturbed persons to involuntary confinement. Private persons do not prosecute and incarcerate violators of the law or administer prison systems. Only public entities are required to build and maintain thousands of miles of streets, sidewalks and highways. Unlike many private persons, a public entity often cannot reduce its risk of potential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>liability by refusing to engage in a particular activity, for government must continue to govern and is required to furnish services that cannot be adequately provided by any other agency. Moreover, in our system of government, decision-making has been allocated among three branches of government \u2014 legislative, executive and judicial \u2014 and in many cases decisions made by the legislative and executive branches should not be subject to review in tort suits for damages, for this would take the ultimate decision-making authority away from those who are responsible politically for making the decisions.\u201d 4 California Law Revision Comm Reports, Recommendations &amp; Studies, p 810 (1963).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">Our task therefore must be to devise an objective definition of \"governmental function\u201d which will further this legislative judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 1 sets forth a simple, fundamental concept of government.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-6\">\"All political power is inherent in the people. Government is instituted for their equal benefit, security and protection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">In our organized society, people, through the state constitution they have ratified and the laws enacted by representatives they have elected, require or authorize their government to perform certain activities in their behalf. People allow government to handle these matters for a variety of reasons. Often, an individual or group of people cannot accomplish an activity or project because of, <em>e.g., </em>the amount of financing required, the tremendous risks involved, or the size or scope of the project or activity. Regardless of the reason, however, the fact that the people have delegated these responsibilities to government indicates their belief that a particular activity or function is one which the government must or can undertake to meet their individual and collective needs. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>other words, the people, by mandating or authorizing the government to engage in certain activities, have determined that these activities are governmental in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Conversely, activities which are not mandated or authorized by the people cannot be deemed governmental. When a governmental agency engages in such activities, it is acting for itself, rather than on behalf of the people. In these situations, the agency should be treated the same as a private tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">We therefore conclude that a governmental function is an activity which is expressly or impliedly mandated or authorized by constitution, statute, or other law. When a governmental agency engages in mandated or authorized activities, it is immune from tort liability, unless the activity is proprietary in nature (as defined in \u00a7 13) or falls within one of the other statutory exceptions to the governmental immunity act. Whenever a governmental agency engages in an activity which is not expressly or impliedly mandated or authorized by constitution, statute, or other law <em>(i.e., </em>an <em>ultra vires </em>activity), it is not engaging in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function. The agency is therefore liable for any injuries or damages incurred as a result of its tortious conduct.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">We realize that the definition we have formu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>lated today is broad and encompasses most of the activities undertaken by governmental agencies. We have adopted this approach because we believe that this is the result envisioned by the enactors of the governmental immunity act. We note, however, that our definition may be statutorily modified to reflect more accurately the desires and needs of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">IV. <em>Vicarious Liability of Governmental Agencies for the Torts of Their Officers, Employees, and Agents</em></p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The tort liability of a governmental agency can be premised on two distinct theories.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The plaintiff may allege that the agency itself acted, or failed to act, in a tortious manner.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> In such situations, the agency will be held directly liable for its torts if the activity in which it was engaged constituted a non-governmental or proprietary function, or fell within the statutory \"highway,\u201d \"motor vehicle,\u201d or \"public building\u201d exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The plaintiff may also allege that the governmental agency is vicariously liable for the torts of its officers, employees, and agents. This vicarious liability is premised on the employer-employee or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>principal-agent relationship which exists between the agency and the individual tortfeasor. Plaintiffs often seek to impose liability even though the governmental agency played no part in the tort, did nothing whatsoever to aid or encourage it, or may have done everything possible to stop it. See Prosser, Torts (4th ed), \u00a7 69, p 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Unfortunately, plaintiffs often do not clearly differentiate between direct and vicarious liability theories in their pleadings. The problem lies in part with the governmental immunity act. The act focuses primarily upon the actions of the agency itself. The \"motor vehicle\u201d exception in \u00a7 5 is the only instance where a governmental agency is explicitly held vicariously liable for the negligent actions of its officers, employees, and agents. Section 8 authorizes an agency to furnish an attorney to appear on behalf of or pay claims and judgments rendered against an officer or employee who negligently causes injuries while in the course of employment and while acting within the scope of his or her authority.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> An agency is also permitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>under \u00a7 9 to purchase liability insurance in order to indemnify and protect itself and/or its officers, employees, and agents.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> However, if the agency decides to take any of the aforementioned action, such action does not impose any liability on the agency. \u00a7\u00a7 8(3), 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">Despite the. act\u2019s general silence as to if or when vicarious tort liability may be imposed upon a governmental agency, this Court impliedly acknowledged the continued existence of common-law <em>respondeat superior </em>theories of recovery in <em>Lockaby v Wayne County, </em>406 Mich 65; 276 NW2d 1 (1979), <em>Galli v Kirkeby, </em>398 Mich 527; 248 NW2d 149 (1976), and <em>McCann v Michigan, </em>398 Mich 65; 247 NW2d 521 (1976). Nevertheless, courts must be careful not to destroy an agency\u2019s immunity by indiscriminately imposing vicarious liability whenever individual officers, employees, and agents are held personally liable for their torts.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Allegations of vicarious tort liability generally arise where an employment relationship exists between the governmental agency and the individ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>ual tortfeasor. <em>Respondeat superior </em>liability generally can be imposed only where the individual tortfeasor acted during the course of his or her employment and within the scope of his or her authority.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> If either of these conditions is not met, a governmental agency cannot be held vicariously liable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-6\">\"The question of the liability of a municipality under the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior </em>is subject, ordinarily, to the same rules as govern the liability of any other corporation or individual. Thus, it must appear that an agent or servant was acting within the scope of his authority at the time the injury complained of occurred. If he was not, the municipal corporation is not liable. Also, the act of the agent or servant must have been done in the course of the employment. * * * [A municipal corporation is not] liable for * * * unauthorized and unlawful acts of its officers and employees which are outside the scope of their authority, although purported to be done on the behalf of the corporation; it must further appear that such persons were expressly authorized by the municipal government to do the acts complained of, or that they were done in pursuance of a general authority to act for the municipality, on the subject to which they related. A municipal corporation may, however, be liable for an unlawful and unauthorized act of one of its officers or agents if the act was done in the course of his official duty or employment, and within the general scope of his authority.\u201d 57 Am Jur 2d, Municipal, School, and State Tort Liability, \u00a7 88, pp 99-100.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">Even when the tort is committed during the employee\u2019s course of employment and is within the scope of the employee\u2019s authority, the governmen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>tal agency is not automatically liable. Where the individual tortfeasor is acting on behalf of an employer, the focus should be on the activity which the individual was engaged in at the time the tort was committed. A governmental agency can be held vicariously liable only when its officer, employee, or agent, acting during the course of employment and within the scope of authority, commits a tort while engaged in an activity which is nongovernmental or proprietary, or which falls within a statutory exception. The agency is vicariously liable in these situations because it is in effect furthering its own interests or performing activities for which liability has been statutorily imposed. However, if the activity in which the tortfeasor was engaged at the time the tort was committed constituted the exercise or discharge of a governmental function <em>(i.e., </em>the activity was expressly or impliedly mandated or authorized by constitution, statute, or other law), the agency is immune pursuant to \u00a7 7 of the governmental immunity act. See <em>Hirych v State Fair Comm, </em>376 Mich 384, 391-393; 136 NW2d 910 (1965), and <em>Sherbutte v Marine City, </em>374 Mich 48, 50; 130 NW2d 920 (1964) (city cannot be held vicariously liable for torts of its police officers committed during the course of an arrest because the officers were engaged in police activity, which is a governmental function entitled to immunity).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">This type of analysis will require plaintiffs to plead their causes of action more precisely. Such precision is necessary to ensure that governmental agencies retain the full extent of immunity from tort liability which the Legislature intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">V. <em>Individual Immunity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Like sovereign and governmental immunity, the scope of immunity from tort liability granted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>officers, employees, and agents of a governmental agency is not presently clear. Prior to 1979, officers, employees, and agents were immune when engaged in discretionary, as opposed to ministerial, acts which were within the scope of their authority. In <em>Wall v Trumbull, </em>16 Mich 228, 235-238 (1867), Justice Cooley explained that the members of a township board could not be held liable for authorizing an allegedly illegal tax:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-6\">\"In determining whether the members of the township board voting for the allowance are liable, the first question which arises is, whether the nature of their duties is judicial, or ministerial only; for the rule of liability is altogether different in the two cases. A ministerial officer has a line of conduct marked out for him, and has nothing to do but to follow it; and he must be held liable for any failure to do so which results in the injury of another. A judicial officer, on the other hand, has certain powers confided to him to be exercised according to his judgment or discretion; and the law would be oppressive which should compel him in every case to decide correctly at his peril. It is accordingly a rule of very great antiquity that no action will lie against a judicial officer for any act done by him in the exercise of his judicial functions, provided the act, though done mistakenly, were within the scope of his jurisdiction[.] [Citations omitted.] This principle of protection is not confined to courts of record, but it applies as well to inferior jurisdictions * * *. Nor does the rule depend upon whether the tribunal is a court or not; it is the nature of the duties to be performed that determines its application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-7\">\"[0]fficers, judicial as well as ministerial,-have been held liable when acting without jurisdiction. * * * The rule of official exemption depends in these cases upon jurisdiction; but wherever that appears and is not exceeded, the protection is complete.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-8\">\"The board then had jurisdiction to determine whether the claim was within the law or not, and their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>record, showing the presentation of the claim, would affirmatively show jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-4\">\"If we were at liberty to pass upon these claims ourselves, upon the evidence appearing in this record, I should be inclined to think the board decided correctly as to some of the claims, and erred as to others. But nothing could be more apparent than the injustice of reviewing their decision in a suit against them in trespass. For whether each particular claim was within the law or not, would depend upon the proof as to whether the money was advanced upon the credit of the township; and the showing on this point might be very different before the board, and in the circuit court. To hold the members of the board responsible in such a case, we must not only hold them bound to decide correctly at their peril, upon the evidence presented to them, but we must also hold that at their peril they must come to the same conclusion as to the legality of the claim which the circuit judge will afterwards arrive at on another hearing, when the testimony may be either more or less than they acted upon, and when even the same witnesses may have told a different story. The mere statement of such a proposition seems to me sufficient to refute it.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">The doctrine of individual immunity even survived the abolition of common-law governmental immunity. Justice Edwards, in his opinion in <em>Williams, supra, </em>364 Mich 261-262, wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-6\">\"[T]here are and will continue to be many situations in relation to which real or fancied grievances exist where governmental freedom from liability will persist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>on wholly different grounds. Legislative bodies, for example, have the right to make many types of decisions which may do harm to some. Subsequent history may clearly demonstrate that some of those decisions were wrong. Discretion implies the right to be wrong. So long as those decisions are within the discretion vested in the legislative body, there is clearly neither breach of duty nor a right to damages. The instant case, a tort action, does not in any manner alter the fact that actions or decisions of a legislative, executive, or judicial character which are performed within the scope of authority of the governmental body or officer concerned continue to enjoy freedom from liability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-6\">\"The people place great powers of decision making in the hands of their government. In the exercise of discretionary power, governmental duty runs to the benefit of the whole public, rather than to individuals. It is of great importance that this crucial function of democratic decision making be unhampered by litigation.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">The governmental immunity act does not address whether or when individual officers, employees, and agents are immune from tort liability. It merely authorizes governmental agencies to defend, indemnify, and insure officers and employees who have committed negligent torts during the course of their employment and while acting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>within the scope of their authority. \u00a7\u00a7 8, 9. Thus, the existence and scope of individual immunity continues to be a creature of judicial decision-making.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">Unfortunately, two recent decisions of this Court have obfuscated the precise parameters of individual immunity. In <em>Bush v Oscoda Area Schools, </em>405 Mich 716; 275 NW2d 268 (1979), plaintiffs sued a school district, its superintendent, a principal, and a teacher concerning injuries incurred by a student during a science classroom explosion. Three members of the Court summarily concluded that the complaint stated a claim against the individual defendants. <em>Id., </em>p 733 (opinion of Levin, J.). Justice Moody, joined by Chief Justice Coleman, wrote that the superintendent, principal, and teacher were immune from liability for their ordinary negligence because they \"were performing primarily discretionary activities that are of essence to government\u201d and which were public in nature. <em>Id., </em>p 734. Justice Williams believed that only the <em>ultra vires </em>activities of public employees are not protected by governmental immunity because the exercise or discharge of a governmental function is not involved. <em>Id. </em>Justice Ryan stated that the immunity defense was applicable if the school district and employees were engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function. <em>Id., </em>pp 734-735. The end result was that the individual officials and employees were immune from tort liability unless they had been engaged in <em>ultra vires </em>activities. None of the opinions mentioned the traditional \"discretionary/ministerial\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\"><em>Lockaby v Wayne County, </em>406 Mich 65; 276 NW2d 1 (1979), added to the confusion. There, an action was brought <em>inter alios </em>against the Wayne County Sheriff and the administrator of the county jail for the intentional assaults and mistreatment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>of an inmate by unidentified jail personnel. Justice Levin, joined by Justices Kavanagh and Fitzgerald, concluded that although the sheriff could not be held responsible for the acts of his deputies by statute, he was responsible for his own acts of negligence and the tortious acts of employees who were not deputies pursuant to the common-law doctrine of <em>respondeat superior. </em>Similarly, the jail administrator was responsible for his own negligence. Although Justice Levin recognized that government officials have limited immunity at common law, the decision as to whether immunity actually existed was deferred until after trial. <em>Id., </em>pp 77-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Justice Moody wrote that the county officers and employees, while acting within the scope of their employment <em>(i.e., </em>operating and maintaining a jail), were primarily performing essential public duties and therefore were immune from tort liability for their negligent actions and selection of personnel. In addition, plaintiff had failed to allege that the sheriff or administrator had committed or condoned any intentional acts. <em>Id., </em>p 84. The remaining three justices essentially agreed with this reasoning. <em>Id., </em>pp 79, 82. However, Justice Williams noted that intentional torts may be protected by governmental immunity as long as they do not constitute <em>ultra vires </em>activities and are within the scope of the exercise and discharge of a governmental function. <em>Id., </em>pp 82-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">The tendency of this Court to define individual immunity with respect to \"governmental function\u201d has been criticized as blurring two separate inquiries.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> As noted in <em>Williams, </em>individual immunity may exist where sovereign or governmental immunity does not. For example, a governmental agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>which runs a statutorily mandated or authorized activity that is proprietary in nature would not be entitled to immunity under \u00a7 13. However, those officials and employees who are required to make decisions as to how the proprietary activity must be carried out should be entitled to immunity as long as they are acting within the scope of their authority and during the course of their employment. Individual immunity exists to ensure that a decision-maker is free to devise the best overall solution to a particular problem, undeterred by the fear that those few people who are injured by the decision will bring suit. We therefore will no longer define the parameters of individual immunity with reference to whether the tortfeasor was engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">The <em>\"ultra vires\u201d </em>element of the individual immunity test also has its drawbacks. By definition, <em>ultra vires </em>activities are those which are unauthorized and outside the scope of employment. Officials and employees who engage in such activities have never been immune from tort liability, even under the traditional \"discretionary/ministerial\u201d test. However, under the present formulation of the <em>\"ultra vires\u201d </em>test, immunity is extended to every public official, employee, and agent whenever they engage in authorized acts, including those which are merely ministerial. Such broad individual immunity is not justified by either prior case law or present-day realities. The mere fact that individuals are employed by a governmental agency does not relieve them of the responsibility to perform their duties properly and conscientiously.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Michigan\u2019s traditional \"discretionary/ministerial\u201d approach to individual immunity is somewhat different than that of other jurisdictions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>Michigan case law affords absolute immunity to all public officials, employees, and agents for both intentional and negligent torts whenever they are engaged in discretionary acts within the scope of their authority. In contrast, other jurisdictions have extended different levels of immunity depending upon the function of the officer. Absolute immunity from tort liability is granted to judges, legislators, and the highest executive officials of all levels of government, even for malicious acts, as long as they are acting within their respective judicial, legislative, and executive authority. Lower level officers, employees, and agents are extended only qualified immunity. This immunity exists when the individual is engaged in discretionary acts which are performed in good faith. An employee therefore risks liability for negligently performed ministerial acts, regardless of good faith. Prosser, supra, \u00a7 132, pp 987-990, and cases cited therein; Littlejohn &amp; DeMars, Governmental <em>Immunity After Parker and Perry: The King Can Do Some Wrong, </em>1982 Det C L Rev 1, 25-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">This disparate treatment of individuals based upon their official function has been justified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-5\">\"It is assumed through the broad grant of immunity to certain public employees that these officials and, therefore, their governmental agencies, will not be intimidated nor timid in the discharge of their public duties. Although absolute immunity may be necessary for unfettered governmental decision-making, courts have been reluctant, understandably, to extend its protection beyond select public employees who are delegated policy-making powers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-6\">\"* * * The policy which only provides a limited immunity to lower level executive officials, unlike the justifications for absolute immunity, reflects a recogni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>tion that official immunity should not shield malicious or intentionally unlawful behavior when the actor is not engaged in broad, essential governmental decision-making. Holding these public servants liable does not hamper or intimidate them in the faithful discharge of their duties since they are responding to established administrative guidelines, regulations and informal policy. It is assumed, therefore, that an unreasonable burden does not fall on an administrative system when courts hold lower level executive employees liable for their acts performed in bad faith.\u201d Littlejohn &amp; DeMars, <em>supra, </em>pp 27-28.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">We are persuaded that a similar scheme of individual immunity should be adopted in Michigan. We therefore hold that judges, legislators, and the highest executive officials of all levels of government are absolutely immune from all tort liability whenever they are acting within their judicial, legislative, or executive authority. Lower level officials, employees, and agents are immune from tort liability only when they are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-5\">1) acting during the course of their employment and acting, or reasonably believe they are acting, within the scope of their authority;<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-6\">2) acting in good faith; and_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>3) performing discretionary, as opposed to ministerial acts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Under this test, no individual immunity exists for <em>ultra vires </em>activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The final problem is defining \"discretionary\u201d and \"ministerial\u201d acts. Because of the longstanding difficulty of accurately differentiating between discretionary and ministerial acts, some writers have suggested that the distinction be abandoned.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> We decline this opportunity to do so. The \"discretionary/ministerial\u201d test has a long common-law history and grants immunity to individuals only to the extent necessary to guarantee unfettered decision-making.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">\"Discretionary\u201d acts have been defined as those which require personal deliberation, decision, and judgment. Prosser, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 132, p 988. This definition encompasses more than quasi-judicial or policy-making authority, which typically is granted only to members of administrative tribunals, prosecutors, and higher level executives.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> However, it does not encompass every trivial decision, such as \"the driving of a nail,\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> which may be involved in performing an activity. For clarity, we would add the word \"decisional\u201d so the operative term would be \"discretionary-decisional\u201d acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">\"Ministerial\u201d acts have been defined as those which constitute merely an obedience to orders or the performance of a duty in which the individual has little or no choice. <em>Id. </em>We believe that this definition is not sufficiently broad. An individual who decides whether to engage in a particular activity and how best to carry it out engages in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>discretionary activity. However, the actual execution of this decision by the same individual is a ministerial act, which must be performed in a nontortious manner. In a nutshell, the distinction between \"discretionary\u201d and \"ministerial\u201d acts is that the former involves significant decision-making, while the latter involves the execution of a decision and might entail some minor decision-making. Here too, for clarity, we would add the word \"operational\u201d so the operative term would be \"ministerial-operational\u201d acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">Many individuals are given some measure of discretionary authority in order to perform their duties effectively. Therefore, to determine the existence and scope of the individual\u2019s immunity from tort liability in a particular situation, the specific acts complained of, rather than the general nature of the activity, must be examined. The ultimate goal is to afford the officer, employee, or agent enough freedom to decide the best method of carrying out his or her duties, while ensuring that the goal is realized in a conscientious manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Under the rules set forth today, it is obvious that the immunity extended to individuals is far less than that afforded governmental agencies. We believe that this was the result intended by the Legislature. The threat of personal liability for engaging in <em>ultra vires </em>activities or tortiously executing one\u2019s duties may be the most effective way of deterring improper conduct. We note, however, that a governmental agency is statutorily authorized to defend or indemnify its officers, employees, and agents in its discretion under certain circumstances. This statutory authorization could be the basis for a contractual agreement of representation and indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>VI. <em>Application of Law to Cases</em></p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">\n<em>Ross v Consumers Power Co</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Appellant, the John Saines Project I Drainage District, contracted the construction of a drain to Dunigan Brothers, Inc. Since a portion of the drain was to be constructed on property owned by appellee, Consumers Power Company, Consumers granted an easement to Jackson County. On August 24, 1971, Michael Ross, a Dunigan employee, was injured when a vehicle in or near which he was working came in contact with overhead electric power lines maintained by Consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">Ross sued Consumers and the action was eventually settled. Consumers filed an amended third-party complaint against the district and drain commissioner, alleging two counts in contract and one count in tort. The Court of Appeals summarized the allegations contained in the tort claim as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-9\">\"In its essentials, Consumers\u2019 tort claim against the District alleges negligence arising out of a failure to notify Consumers that work was being undertaken that could interfere with the power lines, a failure to make arrangements with Consumers to safeguard workers from contact with the lines, a failure to instruct and warn its contractors concerning the lines, a failure to hire a properly licensed and competent contractor, and a failure to adequately supervise and inspect the project in such a manner as to prevent the accident from occurring.\u201d 93 Mich App 687, 697; 287 NW2d 319 (1979).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-10\">The trial court granted the district and commissioner\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to all three counts. Consumers appealed only the judgment for the district. The Court of Appeals reversed as to the two contract counts because \u00a7 7 of the governmental immunity act does not grant immunity from contract liability. Applying Justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>Moody\u2019s \"essence of governing\u201d test, the Court concluded that the district was also not immune from tort liability because the construction of a drain is not of the essence of governing. The district appealed only the decision concerning the tort claim. This Court affirmed by an equally divided Court, 415 Mich 1; 327 NW2d 293 (1982), but subsequently granted rehearing. 417 Mich 1113 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">This appeal involves only the direct liability of a non-sovereign governmental agency for its negligence in contracting out, supervising, and inspecting the construction of a drain. The crucial inquiry is whether these activities, from which the injuries arose, constitute the exercise or discharge of a non-proprietary, governmental function. There is no allegation that any of these activities were conducted by the district primarily for pecuniary profit. We therefore must determine whether the contracting out, supervision, and inspection of the construction were activities which the district was expressly or impliedly mandated or authorized by constitution, statute, or other , law to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7\u00a7 51 and 52 require the Legislature to provide for the protection and promotion of public health and the state\u2019s natural resources. The Drain Code of 1956, MCL 280.1 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 11.1001 <em>et seq., </em>is a comprehensive act governing the establishment of drainage districts and construction of drains. A drainage district has the power to contract under \u00a7 5, and the drain commissioner is specifically authorized to let out construction contracts under prescribed circumstances. See, <em>e.g., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 151,154, 221-223, 471. Furthermore, the commissioner, or a competent designatee, is required to inspect \u201eand approve all construction work. \u00a7 241. Any right to supervise the actual construction of a drain is impliedly author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>ized by the district\u2019s general power over the establishment, construction, and maintenance of drains. The trial court correctly found that the district is immune from tort liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">\n<em>Willis v Nienow</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">\n<em>Willis v Dep\u2019t of Social Services</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">The Court of Appeals summarized the facts of these cases as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-9\">\"These cases arose out of the same incident and were consolidated on appeal. Plaintiff is the administratrix of the Estate of Jeffrey Willis. On August 16, 1978, 16-year-old Jeffrey was a resident of Harbor House, a juvenile care facility for delinquent and neglected youths operated by defendant Department of Social Services. At Harbor House, defendant Dennis Nienow was the director, defendant Erma Knox was a counselor, and defendant Cindy Hunt was a student-intern. Jeffrey and other Harbor House residents were taken for a swimming outing on Lake Michigan under the supervision of Knox and Hunt. Jeffrey drowned in the course of the outing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-10\">\"Plaintiff brought actions against defendants State of Michigan and Department of Social Services in the court of claims and against defendants Nienow, Knox, and Hunt in circuit court. Plaintiff\u2019s complaints alleged that Jeffrey and Knox could not swim or were of marginal swimming ability, that neither Knox nor Hunt had lifesaving training, that there were no lifeguards on duty at the time in question, that Jeffrey and other Harbor House residents were allowed to swim in areas not designated as swimming areas, and that Jeffrey and the other residents were allowed to swim under dangerous weather conditions. In each case the trial court granted summary judgment for defendants based on governmental immunity * * *.\u201d 113 Mich App 30, 32-33; 317 NW2d 273 (1982).<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>The Court of Appeals, applying Justice Moody\u2019s reasoning in <em>Perry, </em>concluded that the operation of a juvenile care facility constitutes a governmental function and that recreational activities are directly related to an effective program of caring for the children. Using the traditional \"discretionary/ministerial\u201d test for individual immunity, the Court concluded that defendant Nienow\u2019s hiring decisions involved discretionary acts which were entitled to immunity, but the manner in which the swimming outing was conducted involved ministerial acts. Finally, the Court held that plaintiff had failed to state a cause of action for intentional tort. Thus, judgment for the state and DSS was affirmed, but reversed as to the individual defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">Plaintiff essentially alleges that Nienow, Knox, and Hunt were negligent or reckless in allowing decedent to participate in the swimming outing and in failing to adequately care for and supervise him. In deciding whether these defendants are entitled to immunity, we must determine whether they were 1) acting during the course of their employment and within the scope of their authority; 2) acting in good faith; and 3) performing discretionary-decisional acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">There is no suggestion that the supervision of children during recreational activities was not during the course of defendants\u2019 employment or within the scope of their authority. There is no allegation of bad faith. Assuming that each defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>dant had the authority to, and in fact did, decide who would participate in the outing, as well as when and where it would be conducted, we hold that these were discretionary-decisional acts entitled to immunity. However, the execution of these decisions, which included the care and supervision of the participating children, were ministerial-operational acts that entailed only minor decision-making.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">As to defendant Nienow, plaintiff alleged that he was negligent in hiring Knox and Hunt. There is no suggestion that the hiring of personnel was outside the course of Nienow\u2019s employment or beyond the scope of his authority. Nor is bad faith alleged. We agree with the Court of Appeals that the decision to hire Knox and Hunt was a discretionary-decisional act entitled to immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The complaint against the state and the DSS does not clearly differentiate between direct and vicarious liability theories. It can be read as alleging that defendants themselves did not adequately care for and supervise decedent, or that they are vicariously liable for their employees\u2019 negligent care and supervision. Assuming that a vicarious liability theory was pleaded, we have already assumed that the employees were acting during the course of their employment and within the scope of their authority. The question therefore is whether allowing decedent to participate in a swimming outing, and the care and supervision of decedent during the outing, constitute the exercise or discharge of a non-proprietary, governmental function.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">There is no allegation that the swimming outing was conducted primarily for pecuniary profit. Furthermore, recreational activities for delinquent and neglected children residing in state facilities are impliedly authorized by statute. The Social <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>Welfare Act, MCL 400.1 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 16.401 <em>et seq., </em>requires the DSS, through the office of children and youth services, to operate halfway houses, regional detention facilities, etc., with the goal of providing \"an effective program of out-of-home care.\u201d \u00a7 115(a). Recreational activities can be an important part of such a program. Implicit in the authority to conduct such activities is the authority to decide who will participate in them.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">Finally, the DSS is expressly required by statute to care for and supervise children residing in state facilities. Sections 3 and 4(1) of the Youth Rehabilitation Services Act, MCL 803.301 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 25.399(51) <em>et seq., </em>require the DSS to supervise and operate state facilities and programs for the proper care of delinquent and neglected children. Even if this statute did not exist, the care of resident children implies a responsibility to supervise them in order to prevent, as far as is practicable, any unnecessary injury. We therefore conclude that the state and the DSS are entitled to sovereign immunity from tort liability since the injuries arose while they and their employees were engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">We also conclude that plaintiff failed to state a claim of intentional tort against any of the defendants for the reasons stated by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">\n<em>Siener v Dep\u2019t of Mental Health</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">Plaintiff Russell Siener, Jr., was an in-patient at the Hawthorn Center, a state mental health facility for emotionally disturbed children. On July 8, 1976, plaintiff and several other patients were taken by the center\u2019s personnel on a field trip to Greenfield Village in Dearborn, Michigan. Plaintiff maintained that a supervisor had permitted five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>boys, including himself, to leave the group without supervision. Subsequently, one of the boys seriously injured plaintiff by striking him in the face with a cast iron pot lid.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Plaintiff brought a negligence action against the state, the Department of Mental Health, and the Hawthorn Center alleging that they had failed to properly supervise and control the patients. The Court of Claims denied defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment because plaintiff had pled facts in avoidance of governmental immunity. The Court of Appeals reversed. 117 Mich App 179; 323 NW2d 642 (1982). The Court found that under <em>Perry, </em>the operation of a state mental health facility for children is a governmental function. Furthermore, the field trip was directly related to the effective care of emotionally disturbed children. The Court rejected plaintiff\u2019s argument that MCL 330.1722; MSA 14.800(722) is a statutory exception to the governmental immunity act.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">The complaint could be read as alleging that defendants are directly liable because of their failure to provide adequate supervision and control over plaintiff and the other patients, or that defendants are vicariously liable for their employees\u2019 negligent supervision. (Plaintiff apparently has not commenced an action against the individual employees.) Plaintiff does not argue that the field trip should not have been conducted, or that he should not have been allowed to participate. Assuming that a vicarious liability theory was pleaded, there is no suggestion that the employees who supervised the patients during the field trip were not acting during the course of their employment or within the scope of their authority. Furthermore, there is no allegation that the trip was conducted primarily for pecuniary profit. We must therefore determine whether the control and supervision of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>emotionally disturbed patients by defendants and their employees during a field trip is expressly or impliedly mandated or authorized by constitution, statute, or other law.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">Educational and recreational field trips for emotionally disturbed, in-patient children are impliedly authorized by constitution and statute. Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 8 states that programs and services for the care, treatment, education, or rehabilitation of the mentally or otherwise seriously handicapped shall always be fostered and supported. Section 116 of the Mental Health Code, MCL 330.1001 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 14.800(1) <em>et seq., </em>authorizes the Department of Mental Health to provide directly, or through contractual arrangement, any type of patient service related to the treatment, care, education, training, and rehabilitation of the mentally ill or retarded. In addition, a child who resides in a mental health facility is entitled to an education. \u00a7 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Finally, the Department of Mental Health and the Hawthorn Center are expressly and impliedly required by statute to adequately control and supervise in-patients of mental health facilities. All residents are entitled to a safe, sanitary, and humane living environment. \u00a7 708. The governing body of a mental health facility is responsible for the operation of the facility, the selection of the medical staff, and the quality of care rendered. \u00a7 143. Implicit in the notion of caring for emotionally disturbed patients is the responsibility to control and supervise them to prevent, as far as is practicable, any unnecessary injury. We therefore conclude that defendants are entitled to sovereign immunity from tort liability since the injury arose while they and their employees were engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>Plaintiff maintains the defendants are nevertheless liable because \u00a7 722 of the Mental Health Code<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> is an exception to \u00a77 of the governmental immunity act. Section 722 provides in part that if a recipient of mental health services is physically or otherwise abused, the recipient has a right to pursue injunctive and other appropriate civil relief. We disagree with plaintiffs argument for the reasons stated in <em>Rocco v Dep\u2019t of Mental Health, </em>114 Mich App 792, 798-799; 319 NW2d 674 (1982):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-6\">\"MCL 330.1700 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 14.800(700) <em>et seq., </em>enumerates certain rights possessed by recipients of mental health services. The statute\u2019s purpose is to ensure that patients are treated in a humane manner and that their privacy is maintained. The statute focuses on the duty of the health care facility towards its patients. None of the sections discusses the rights and responsibilities between patients. The statute\u2019s primary purpose is to protect the patient from certain abuses by the mental health facility or its staff. When this purpose is read into MCL 330.1722; MSA 14.800(722), it is clear that this provision was meant to prevent the staff of a mental health care facility from abusing the patients in its care. It was not the intention of the Legislature to abolish governmental, immunity in those cases where one patient attacks another.\u201d_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>\n<em>Rocco v Dep\u2019t of Mental Health</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">The Court of Appeals summarized the facts of this case as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-5\">\"On January 7, 1980, plaintiffs\u2019 decedent, Daniel Rocco, was a resident patient of the Ypsilanti Regional Psychiatric Hospital (hospital). That night, while he was sleeping in his hospital bed, Rocco was murdered by another patient. The murderer was Andrew Higginbotham, a patient who had a history of violence and assaultive behavior.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-6\">\"Plaintiffs filed a complaint in the Court of Claims against two state agencies (the Department of Social Services and the Department of Mental Health) which supervise the administration of the hospital, and the hospital. The state agencies and hospital are hereinafter referred to as defendants. The complaint consisted of two counts. Count I alleged negligence in that defendants failed to take steps to protect the decedent from attack by violent patients in the hospital. Specifically, plaintiffs alleged that defendants breached their duty of care and committed malpractice in that they were aware of Higginbotham\u2019s violent and criminal tendencies, yet placed him unrestrained and unsupervised in the same ward with the decedent. Count II alleged breach of implied contract, averring that plaintiffs agreed to and did in fact pay for the care and treatment of the decedent but that defendants breached their contractual duty by failing to protect the decedent from harm and abuse by other patients at the hospital.\u201d <em>Rocco, supra, </em>pp 794-795.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Defendants were granted summary judgment on both counts. The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment as to Count I, concluding that the operation of a state mental hospital is a governmental function and that \u00a7 722 of the Mental Health Code is not an exception to governmental immunity. As to Count II, the majority held that the breach of an implied contract claim was not merely a restatement of the tort claim. Since the governmen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>tal immunity act does not bar contract claims, judgment for defendants was reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">The tort claim alleges that defendants are directly and vicariously liable. As to the vicarious liability theory, there is no suggestion that defendants\u2019 employees were not acting during the course of their employment or within the scope of their authority. Although plaintiffs paid for the care rendered to decedent by the hospital, there is no allegation that the hospital provided s\u00fach care primarily for pecuniary profit. In fact, \u00a7 808 of the Mental Health Code specifically limits the total financial liability of a recipient of mental health services to the cost of the services rendered. The crucial inquiry therefore is whether the placement of patients within a mental health facility, and the care, control, and supervision of in-patients, are activities which are expressly or impliedly mandated or authorized by constitution, statute, or other law.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The evaluation of patients upon admission and periodically thereafter is expressly mandated by \u00a7 710 of the Mental Health Code. A patient may be secluded or his freedom of movement restricted only insofar as such action is necessary to prevent the patient from physically harming himself or others, or causing substantial property damage. \u00a7\u00a7 742(2), 744. The governing body of a mental health facility is required to establish the maximum length of time seclusion may last, how often the patient must be examined, and any other appropriate regulations. \u00a7 742(6). Finally, we have previously concluded in <em>Willis </em>and <em>Siener, supra, </em>pp 638-644, that the Department of Mental Health, the DSS, and a mental health facility have an express and implied responsibility to care for, control, and supervise residents of state facilities. We therefore hold that defendants are entitled to sovereign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>immunity from tort liability because the injuries arose while they and their employees were engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function. As in <em>Siener, </em>we reject plaintiffs\u2019 argument that \u00a7 722 is an exception to the governmental immunity act.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">Defendants recognize that the governmental immunity act grants immunity only from tort liability, but maintain that plaintiffs\u2019 contract claim should be dismissed because it merely restates the allegations contained in their tort count. We disagree. Defendants brought their motion for summary judgment under GCR 1963, 117.2(1). Such motions test the legal basis of the complaint, not whether it can be factually supported. Accepting as true a plaintiff\u2019s allegations, and any conclusions that may reasonably be drawn therefrom, the motion must be denied unless the claim is so clearly unenforceable as a matter of law that no factual development could justify a right to recover. Although most of the allegations contained in Counts I and II are identical, the latter count also alleges that plaintiffs contracted and agreed with defendants for decedent\u2019s care and treatment; plaintiffs paid valuable consideration for decedent\u2019s care; and defendants breached their contractual duties to plaintiffs and decedent. These allegations are sufficient to withstand defendants\u2019 challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">We recognize that plaintiffs have and will attempt to avoid \u00a7 7 of the governmental immunity act by basing their causes of action on theories other than tort. Trial and appellate courts are routinely faced with the task of determining whether the essential elements of a particular cause of action have been properly pleaded and proved. If a plaintiff successfully pleads and establishes a non-tort cause of action, \u00a7 7 will not bar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>recovery simply because the underlying facts could have also established a tort cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">\n<em>Regulski v Murphy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Plaintiff, a seventeen-year-old attending high school in defendant Wayne-Westland School District, was enrolled in a building trades class, which was offered as part of the school\u2019s vocational education program. Participating students were required to build a house, which was then sold by the district to a private buyer. On October 10, 1975, plaintiff was injured when he attempted to hammer a nail into a piece of wood. Apparently, he hit the nail at an angle, causing it to fly up and strike him in the eye.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Plaintiff sued the school district, the director of the vocational building trades program, and the instructor of the class. In his amended complaint, plaintiff alleged that the district was engaged in a proprietary function and that all of the defendants were negligent in failing to properly instruct, warn, and supervise plaintiff. In addition, defendants had failed to provide safety glasses, adequate first-aid supplies at the site, and transportation for emergencies. After discovery was completed, defendants moved for and were granted summary judgment. The Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that the operation of a building trades class is a governmental function which entitled the district to governmental immunity. Since the individual defendants were engaged in a governmental function, they too were immune. 119 Mich App 418; 326 NW2d 528 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">The cause of action against the school district alleges both direct and vicarious liability. As to the vicarious liability theory, there is no suggestion that the individual defendants were not acting during the course of their employment or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>within the scope of their authority. We therefore must determine whether the instruction and supervision of students enrolled in a building trades class, as well as the provision of safety devices and measures, constitute the exercise or discharge of a non-proprietary, governmental function.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">Plaintiff alleged that the district built and sold the house \"for the purpose of producing <em>a </em>pecuniary profit.\u201d The district disagreed and offered evidence showing that the class was not designed to be a profit-making venture and that the district in fact lost money on the sale of the house. We need not decide whether a governmental agency must actually realize a pecuniary profit from the challenged activity before \u00a7 13 of the governmental immunity act will allow a tort recovery, or whether there was no genuine issue or material fact on this point. During arguments on the motion for summary judgment, plaintiff\u2019s counsel admitted that the class was not conducted <em>primarily </em>for pecuniary profit. Instead, he argued below and here that the seeking of remuneration and the possibility of any incidental profit is sufficient evidence of a proprietary function. Although at one time any incidental profit generated by an activity was sufficient to defeat an agency\u2019s claim of immunity, the Legislature in \u00a7 13 has modified this rule to require that the activity be conducted <em>primarily </em>for pecuniary profit. On the basis of these facts, we conclude that the operation of the building trades class was not a proprietary function.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The board of a school district is required under \u00a7 1282 of the School Code of 1976, MCL 380.1 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 15.4001 <em>et seq., </em>to establish and carry on the departments it deems necessary or desirable, determine the courses of study to be pursued, and cause its pupils to be taught in the depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>ments it deems expedient. The board is expressly authorized by \u00a7 1287 to establish, equip, and maintain vocational education programs and facilities. Section 1288 specifically requires each pupil participating in certain vocational and industrial arts classes to wear eye protective devices.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Furthermore, the board must make reasonable regulations concerning anything necessary for the proper establishment, maintenance, management, and carrying on of public schools, including regulations concerning the safety of children while in attendance at school, or en route to and from school. \u00a7 1300. Thus, the district was expressly authorized to offer the building trades course and was expressly and impliedly required through its employees to instruct, warn, and supervise the students, as well as to provide safety equipment and measures, in order to prevent any unnecessary harm to the students. Since the injuries arose while the district and its employees were engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function, the district is entitled to governmental immunity from tort liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">As to the liability of the individual defendants, we have already assumed that they were acting during the course of their employment and within the scope of their authority. There is no allegation that they were acting in bad faith. The question therefore is whether they were engaged in discretionary-decisional acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Plaintiff has not alleged that the individual defendants were negligent in offering the class, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>allowing him to participate, or deciding where and when to conduct the class. Such acts are discretionary-decisional in nature. Instead, plaintiff alleged that defendants were negligent in instructing, warning, and supervising him. Although some decision-making is involved in these activities, it is relatively minor. Instruction and supervision are essentially ministerial-operational activities for which there is no immunity from tort liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">As to the allegation of inadequate safety measures, we have previously noted that a school board is statutorily required to provide for the safety of its students and, in particular, to provide eye protective devices to those participating in certain potentially dangerous activities. It is unclear whether plaintiff alleged that the individual defendants were negligent in establishing the type and extent of safety measures, or merely failed to provide that which was required by statute and school policy. If any of the defendants were responsible for establishing the school\u2019s policy as to the type of eye protective devices that would be provided to the students, the type of first-aid supplies to have at the building site, and what emergency transportation measures would be provided, that defendant is immune from tort liability because these are discretionary-decisional acts. However, the individuals can be held liable for failing to comply with \u00a7 1288 and the school\u2019s safety policy since the actual provision of eye protective devices, first-aid supplies, and emergency transportation involves only ministerial-operational acts. Summary judgment for the individual defendants is therefore reversed and the case remanded for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">\n<em>Trezzi v City of Detroit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">On April 23, 1978, plaintiff\u2019s parents were attacked by an unknown assailant who had forcibly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>entered their Detroit home. When plaintiff walked by the house, he noticed that a refrigerator door was ajar and that there were no lights on in the house. Plaintiff called Detroit\u2019s 911 emergency assistance system six times for help. Unknown 911 operators assigned a low-priority rating to the calls and passed them on to a police dispatcher. The dispatcher sent a police vehicle approximately one and one-half hours after plaintiff\u2019s first call.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Plaintiff brought an action against the City of Detroit, the dispatcher, and the 911 operators alleging that his parents sustained fatal injuries as a result of the delayed response. When the city moved for summary judgment, plaintiff amended his complaint to allege both negligent and intentional tort. The city was granted summary judgment, the dispatcher eventually settled with plaintiff, and the suit against the unknown operators was dismissed. The city refused to defend or indemnify the dispatcher for the judgment, which apparently remains unsatisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">A majority of the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment for the city. 120 Mich App 506; 328 NW2d 70 (1982). The entire panel agreed that under the \"essence to governing\u201d test, the operation of a 911 emergency system would not constitute a governmental function, although it would under the \"common good of all\u201d test. Applying Justice Moody\u2019s \"essence of governing\u201d test, the majority concluded that the 911 system was an indispensable part of the operation of a police department with no common analogy in the private sector. The panel agreed that plaintiff\u2019s intentional tort claim actually alleged no more than gross negligence. Plaintiff does not challenge this latter holding in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">As explained in the Court of Appeals dissenting opinion, the Detroit 911 system handles emergency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>calls for police, fire, and medical assistance. It is staffed by civilian employees of the city, who rank the seriousness of the calls and contact police, fire, and medical dispatchers. The system is designed to make emergency assistance more effective by freeing up police and fire personnel and enabling citizens to request help by dialing three easily remembered digits. The system essentially acts as a clearinghouse for emergency calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">This appeal involves only the vicarious liability of a non-sovereign governmental agency for its employees\u2019 negligence. There is no suggestion that the employees were not acting during the course of their employment or within the scope of their authority. There is no allegation that the 911 system was operated primarily for pecuniary profit. We therefore must determine whether the categorizing of emergency calls by a 911 operator and the dispatch of police vehicles in accordance therewith are activities which are expressly or impliedly mandated or authorized by constitution, statute, or other law.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Const 1963, art 7, \u00a7 22 gives the electors of each city the power to frame and adopt a city charter. In addition, the city has the power to adopt resolutions and ordinances relating to its municipal concerns, property, and government. Since Detroit is a home-rule city, its charter must provide for the public peace, health, and safety of persons and property. MCL 117.3(j); MSA 5.2073(j). Pursuant to these constitutional and statutory provisions, Detroit Charter, art 7, ch 11, \u00a7 7-1101 establishes a police department -which is required to preserve the public peace, prevent crime, arrest offenders, protect the rights of persons, preserve order, and enforce laws and ordinances. Section 7-1103 authorizes the board of police commissioners to establish policies, rules, and regulations. In order to accom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>plish its duties, the police department necessarily needs some sort of system for accepting, processing, and acting upon calls for police assistance. Thus, the 911 emergency assistance system and the police dispatch system, including their internal procedures for determining the seriousness of calls and dispatching vehicles, are impliedly authorized by constitution, statute, and city charter. Since the injuries arose while the city\u2019s employees were engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function, the city is entitled to governmental immunity from tort liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">\n<em>Disappearing Lakes Ass\u2019n v Dep\u2019t of Natural Resources</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">Plaintiffs are property owners of land adjoining Square Lake and Little Square Lake in Oakland County. From 1966 to 1976, the Michigan Department of Conservation and its successor, the Department of Natural Resources, issued permits and extensions to a private land developer for the dredging of canals south of Lake Orion and immediately north of plaintiffs\u2019 property. In 1977, the water level of the Square Lakes began to drop precipitously. The recreational and aesthetic purposes of the lakes were eventually destroyed. Studies indicate that the water loss was caused by interference with the subsurface water flow, which occurred when the canals were dredged.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">Plaintiffs filed suit in 1979 against the state and the DNR in the Court of Claims seeking damages for nuisance and negligence. A similar action was commenced in circuit court against Orion Township, Oakland County, and several municipal boards and individuals. The suits were eventually consolidated. In 1981, the circuit court granted the state and the DNR\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground of governmental immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>regardless of which test was applied, the issuance of dredging permits by the DNR constituted a governmental function. After examining numerous cases, the Court concluded that a governmental agency cannot be held liable in nuisance unless it actually controlled the project which created the nuisance. Issuance of dredging permits alone was not sufficient evidence of control. Plaintiffs\u2019 claims that the state had taken their property without due process of law, that the DNR had acted outside the scope of its authority, and that plaintiffs were entitled to equitable relief were rejected because these claims had not been raised before the trial court. 121 Mich App 61; 328 NW2d 570 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">Count II of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint essentially alleges that the state and the DNR are directly and vicariously liable for negligently issuing permits without adhering to statutory guidelines or conducting proper studies, failing to warn of the possible adverse effects of dredging, and failing to revoke the permits.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> As to the vicarious liability theory, there is no suggestion that defendants\u2019 employees were not acting during the course of their employment or within the scope of their authority. Nor is there any allegation that the issuance of dredging permits was conducted primarily for pecuniary profit. Therefore, we must determine whether the issuance of dredging permits and extensions, and activities related thereto, are activities which are expressly or impliedly mandated or authorized by constitution, statute, or other law.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 52 requires the Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>to provide for the protection of the state\u2019s waters from pollution, impairment, and destruction. In 1965, the Legislature first enacted the Inland Lakes and Streams Act. See 1965 PA 291, as amended by 1968 PA 7, MCL 281.731 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 11.451 <em>et seq. </em>This act was repealed and replaced in 1972 by a substantially similar act. See 1972 PA 346, MCL 281.951 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 11.475(1) <em>et seq. </em>The primary purpose of both acts was the regulation and protection of the state\u2019s inland lakes and streams.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Under the act, any person who wishes to dredge canals is required to obtain a permit from the DNR. \u00a7\u00a7 3, 5. A permit must be issued if the project will not adversely affect the public trust or riparian rights. In making this determination, the DNR must consider the possible effects of the proposed project upon inland lakes, streams, and waters, as well as the impact on their recreational, aesthetic, and other uses. No permit can be issued if the project will unlawfully impair or destroy any waters or other natural resources. \u00a7 7. Once issued, the permit is effective for its stated term, unless revoked for cause, and may be renewed. The permit may specify the term and conditions under which the work is to be carried out. \u00a7 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">Thus, the DNR is statutorily required to issue dredging permits once certain conditions are met and to revoke them if there is sufficient cause. In determining whether a permit should be issued, renewed, or revoked, the DNR is impliedly authorized to conduct studies and inspect the proposed and current dredging sites, although such actions are not required. The DNR is expressly authorized to impose conditions on the dredging in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>avoid adverse environmental consequences. Such conditions serve as a warning to the permittee to conduct its dredging in a careful manner. We therefore conclude that the state and the DNR are entitled to sovereign immunity from tort liability since the injuries arose while they and their employees were engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">The Court of Appeals conclusion that plaintiffs had insufficiently pleaded a nuisance cause of action is not clearly erroneous. Plaintiffs essentially asserted only a negligence claim. The damage to the lakes may have been sufficiently severe to constitute an unconstitutional taking of private property without just compensation or warrant injunctive relief; however, plaintiffs did not raise these arguments before the trial court and have not pursued them on appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">\n<em>Zavala v Zinser</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The Court of Appeals summarized the facts of this case as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-7\">\"This controversy arose out of the shooting of plaintiff Jose Zavala outside a Detroit bar in the early morning hours of November 2, 1975. As Mr. Zavala left the bar that morning, he encountered a large group of people in front of the building; some of the people, including Mr. Zavala\u2019s brother, were fighting. After shouting at his brother to stop fighting, Mr. Zavala was shot and seriously injured by one of the participants in the fight. At the time of the incident, defendants Zinser and Harris, City of Detroit police officers, were sitting nearby in their marked police vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-8\">\"Plaintiffs sued several of the participants in the fight. They were later granted permission to amend their complaint to add defendants Zinser, Harris, and the City of Detroit. They alleged that defendants Zinser and Harris had been negligent in failing to stop the fight, in failing to stop Mr. Zavala\u2019s assailant from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>shooting him, and in generally failing to uphold or enforce the law. They alleged a 'special relationship\u2019 between Mr. Zavala and defendant police officers giving rise to a duty of due care toward him. Plaintiffs further alleged the vicarious liability of defendant City of Detroit for the negligent conduct of its employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-6\">\"Defendants Zinser, Harris, and the City of Detroit moved for summary judgment under GCR 1963, 117.2(1). The court ruled that plaintiffs\u2019 claims against defendant city were barred by governmental immunity, and that any duties owed by defendant police officers in this case had been owed to the public generally and not to Mr. Zavala individually. The motion for summary judgment was, therefore, granted.\u201d 123 Mich App 352, 354-355; 333 NW2d 278 (1983).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">A majority of the Court of Appeals agreed that if a police officer breaches his duty to preserve the peace, the officer is liable only to the public. Since plaintiffs failed to allege sufficiently that the officers owed some other duty to them in particular, judgment for the officers was affirmed. Judgment for the city was also affirmed on the grounds that the operation of a police department is a governmental function and a claim of intentional tort had not been alleged\u2019 However, the case was remanded for further fact-finding concerning the denial of plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend their complaint to allege a cause of action under 42 USC 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">The dissent maintained that judgment for the officers was improper because they had \"a ministerial duty to perform some minimum acts to preserve the peace\u201d pursuant to statute, the city charter, and police department policy. Furthermore, plaintiffs\u2019 allegation of a \"special relationship\u201d was sufficient to give rise to a duty of due care and a question of fact as to whether the officers had acted reasonably.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">As to the liability of the individual officers, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>need not decide the \"public/individual\u201d duty issue or whether the \"special relationship\u201d allegations were legally sufficient, since we conclude that the officers are entitled to individual immunity from tort liability. Plaintiffs admitted in \u00b6 39 of their second amended complaint, and the trial court found during the motion for summary judgment, that the officers were acting during the course of their employment and within the scope of their authority. The only allegations of bad-faith conduct appeared in Count VIII of plaintiffs\u2019 proposed third amended complaint.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> However, the trial court did not allow plaintiffs to add this count. Thus, the only question remaining is whether the officers\u2019 actions, or lack thereof, in dealing with the fight were discretionary-decisional in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">The parties agree that the officers did not sit idly by while the fight occurred. The officers decided not to deal with the disturbance alone and immediately called for backup assistance, which arrived six to ten minutes later. Plaintiffs do not allege that the officers delayed too long in requesting assistance, gave the wrong address, etc. Instead, plaintiffs maintain that the officers did not take the type of action which plaintiffs believe would have been appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Police officers, especially when faced with a potentially dangerous situation, must be given a wide degree of discretion in determining what type of action will best ensure the safety of the individuals involved and the general public, the cessation of unlawful conduct, and the apprehension of wrongdoers. The determination of what type of action to take, <em>e.g., </em>make an immediate arrest, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>pursue a suspect, issue a warning, await backup assistance, etc., is a discretionary-decisional act entitled to immunity. Once that decision has been made, however, the execution thereof must be performed in a proper manner, <em>e.g., </em>the arrest must be made without excessive force, the pursuit of the suspect must not be done negligently, the request for assistance must include reasonably accurate information, etc. Since plaintiffs merely alleged negligent performance of a discretionarydecisional act, summary judgment for the individual officers was properly granted.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 claim against the city alleges vicarious liability for the officers\u2019 negligence.

In <em>McDowell, </em>the majority of the Court concluded that 1945 PA 87 granted statutory tort immunity to the state.' This conclusion, we believe, was erroneous. The Legislature in 1945 PA 87 did not statutorily grant to the state governmental tort immunity. Rather, it repealed the statutory waiver of immunity found in 1943 PA 237 and returned the state to the common-law immunity it had enjoyed prior to the 1943 amendment. This conclusion was correctly explained by Justice Edwards dissenting in <em>McDowell:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b669-17\">\" 'By this statute [1945 PA 87], the legislature repealed PA 1939, No 135, \u00a7 24, as amended by PA 1943, No 237, the amendment being a legislative grant of the right of maintaining tort actions against the State. By enactment of this statute, the legislature moved to abolish the judicial doctrine of governmental immunity. By repealing this statute, the legislature returned to its prior posture which was no statutory provision on the subject whatsoever.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pittman, supra, </em>398 Mich 46-47, fn 1.</p>\n<p id=\"Ag4\"><em>Cf. </em>fn 18, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b669-23\">The majority believed that the reasons given in <em>Williams </em>for abolishing common-law governmental immunity for municipalities were equally applicable to sovereign immunity. In addition, there was no good reason to treat state and non-sovereign governmental units differently. <em>Id., </em>p 48. <em>Pittman, </em>however, has limited applicability. Only those cases pending or filed as of November 23, 1976, involving causes of action arising before August 1, 1970 (the date \u00a7 7 became effective), could take advantage of the demise of common-law sovereign immunity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b671-7\"> The majority reasoned that words and phrases which have acquired a common-law meaning are interpreted in the same manner when used in statutes dealing with the same subject matter. The Legislature, in using the term \"governmental function\u201d to describe the limits of governmental immunity, intended that activities which were considered governmental functions when the statute was enacted should also enjoy statutory immunity. This conclusion was bolstered by the second sentence of \u00a7 7, which affirmed the case law precedent concerning sovereign immunity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b672-7\"> Subsequent decisions of this Court did not overrule <em>Parker </em>on this point. In <em>Perry v Kalamazoo State Hospital, </em>404 Mich 205; 273 NW2d 421 (1978), which was decided the same day as <em>Parker, </em>Justice Ryan, joined by Justices Williams and Coleman, again expressed their view that the phrase \"governmental function\u201d must be defined by common-law precedent. <em>Id., </em>pp 210-212. Justice Moody briefly mentioned his contrary view in his concurrence, <em>id., </em>p 215, but the remaining three members of the Court did not. However, since these same four justices had espoused the \"anti-freeze\u201d position in <em>Parker, </em>it is clear that they intended the same result in <em>Perry.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">In <em>Ross </em>v <em>Consumers Power Co, </em>415 Mich 1; 327 NW2d 293 (1982), Justices Ryan, Williams, and Coleman again expressed their views. <em>Id., </em>pp 14-15. Justice Kavanagh\u2019s opinion, joined by Chief Justice Fitzgerald and Justice Levin, did not mention the issue, but there is no indication that they had abandoned their prior views.

Officer and Employee Immunity</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">The immunity of a public officer or employee<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>from personal tort liability for actions within the scope of his official authority and in the performance of his official duties is an immunity separate and distinct from sovereign and governmental immunities.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Neither \u00a7 7 nor any other provision of the governmental tort liability act provides protection for public officers or employees.

Qualified immunity can only attach when a public officer or employee is acting in good faith.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">(3) Was the officer or employee exercising quasi-judicial or policy-making discretionary authority?</p>\n<p id=\"b743-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>The qualified immunity afforded to public officers and employees generally varies with the scope of their discretion as to the specific act in question:<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-4\">\" <em>'[AJctions </em>or <em>decisions </em>of a <em>legislative, executive, </em>or <em>judicial </em>character which are performed within the scope of authority of the governmental body or officer concerned * * * enjoy freedom from liability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-5\">\"The people place great powers of decision making in the hands of their government. In the exercise of discretionary power, governmental duty runs to the benefit of the whole public, rather than to individuals. It is of great importance that this crucial function of democratic decision making be unhampered by litigation.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in the original.) <em>Sherbutte v Marine City, </em>374 Mich 48, 54; 130 NW2d 920 (1964), quoting <em>Williams v Detroit, </em>364 Mich 231; 111 NW2d 1 (1961).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Public officers or employees are, however, liable for the negligent performance of ministerial acts. <em>Id., </em>p 54, fn 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">The scope of immunity granted a public officer or employee in any given situation turns on the specific character of the act complained of, not on the general nature of his job.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Accordingly, it is not determinative that the officer or employee has some general discretionary authority if the act complained of is properly characterized as ministerial.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">It is often difficult to distinguish between discretionary and ministerial activities: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>any official act, no matter how directly ministerial, that did not admit of some discretion in the manner of its performance, even if it involved only the driving of a nail.\u2019 \u201d Prosser, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 132, p 990, quoting <em>Ham v Los Angeles County, </em>46 Cal App 148, 162; 189 P 462 (1920).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>\"It seems almost impossible to draw any clear and definite line, since the distinction, if it exists, can be at most one of degree. \u2019[I]t would be difficult to conceive of</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>The discretionary decisions intended to be protected by official immunity are those that involve policy formulation<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> and those that are quasi-judicial in nature. In <em>Sherbutte v Marine City, supra, </em>pp 54-55, this Court said that official immunity protects \"democratic decision making,\u201d namely, <em>\"actions </em>or <em>decisions </em>of a <em>legislative, executive, </em>or <em>judicial </em>character.\u201d (Emphasis in the original.) The Court in <em>Sherbutte </em>held that a police officer or employee was not immune from an action alleging excessive use of force during the course of an arrest: \"We think it unnecessary to expatiate on the point. The action of a police officer in making an arrest cannot be considered within the broad scope of the discretion allowed a free government in its legislative, executive, or judicial branch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">In sum, if judges and legislators are acting within the scope of their official function, they are absolutely immune. Other public officers or employees only possess official immunity if they are acting within the scope of their official function, they are acting in good faith, and, focusing upon the specific activity complained of by the plaintiff, they are exercising quasi-judicial or policy-making discretionary authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">IV. The Opinion of the Court</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">The opinion of the Court states that the phrase \"governmental function\u201d should be construed in a \"broad manner\u201d because \u00a7 7 \"extends immunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number><em>all </em>governmental agencies for <em>all </em>tort liability <em>whenever </em>they are engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 618. (Emphasis in original.) The language of \u00a7 7, however, might just as readily be read as providing a more limited immunity, absolving <em>all </em>governmental agencies from <em>all </em>tort liability <em>only when </em>they are engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">All can agree that the Legislature has \"evidence^] a clear legislative judgment that public and private tortfeasors should be treated differently.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 618. That does not suggest, however, that the Legislature intended to immunize \"most of the activities undertaken by governmental agencies.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 621. All can agree that \"the people, by mandating or authorizing the government to engage in certain activities, have determined that these activities are governmental in nature.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 620. It does not follow, however, that by mandating or authorizing the government to engage in certain activities, the people have determined that the government should be immune for each and every act connected with the performance of that activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">The opinion of the Court, for example, concludes that a right to supervise the construction of a drain is impliedly authorized by the Drain Code of 1956, MCL 280.1 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 11.1001 <em>et seq., </em>which grants a drainage district power over the establishment, construction, and maintenance of a drain. <em>Ante, </em>pp. 637-638. Under this view, a drainage district or board would be immune if an employee operating a helicopter to supervise drain construction flies too low and strikes a person or damages property. There is nothing in the language or history of the governmental tort liability act, nor is there anything in the language or history of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>Drain Code, to suggest that the Legislature intended that operating aircraft be an immune \"governmental function.\u201d Virtually all government activity is expressly or impliedly mandated or authorized by the constitution, a statute, or other law. By perusing the statute books rather than focusing on the specific activity complained of by the plainiff, the Court casts the net of governmental immunity too far, enabling a governmental entity to expand the scope of its own immunity by promulgating an ordinance or other law relating to its activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">The inherent difficulty in defining \"governmental function\u201d by scanning the statute books is illustrated in the Court\u2019s treatment of the <em>Willis </em>case. The opinion of the Court argues that the statutory duty , imposed on the Department of Social Services to care for children residing in state facilities \"implies a responsibility to supervise them in order to prevent, as far as is practicable, any unnecessary injury.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 641. Yet the Court then relies on that same statutory duty as a reason for immunizing the department when one of its employees breaches that statutory duty to prevent injury. Under the Court\u2019s analysis, then, the same statute that creates the responsibility to supervise children to prevent injury also immunizes the department when one of its employees breaches that very responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">V. Application in the Instant Cases</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">The detailed application of the factors in the individual cases is set forth in the Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">Four of these <em>cases </em>\u2014 Willis <em>II, Siener, Rocco, </em>and <em>Disappearing Lakes </em>\u2014 are actions against the state and its departments. The Legislature has affirmed sovereign immunity in these cases, and therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>the defendants are absolved from liability by the sovereign immunity provided by the second sentence of \u00a7 7. In <em>Rocco, </em>the plaintiff also alleges a contract claim, and that claim should be remanded for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">Four <em>cases </em>\u2014 Ross, <em>Regulski, Trezzi, </em>and Zavala\u2014 are actions against non-sovereign political units. On the basis of an application of the factors discussed above and set forth in detail in the Appendix, the governmental entities in <em>Ross </em>and <em>Regulski </em>were not engaged in the exercise or discharge of a \"governmental function,\u201d and therefore are not immune pursuant to the first sentence of \u00a77; in <em>Trezzi </em>and <em>Zavala </em>the governmental entities are immune under the first sentence of \u00a7 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">In <em>Regulski, </em>neither teaching or supervision nor providing safety goggles and emergency supplies and facilities for students in a building trades class are \"governmental functions.\u201d In <em>Regulski </em>and <em>Ross, </em>non-sovereign political units are not immune with respect to the conduct and operation of construction work. In <em>Trezzi </em>and <em>Zavala, </em>the city is immune from liability for the manner of police responses to requests for assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Three <em>cases </em>\u2014 Willis <em>I, Regulski, </em>and <em>Zavala </em>\u2014 are or include actions against public officers or employees. On the basis of an application of the common-law factors discussed above, the individual defendants in these cases are not immune. Thus, official immunity does not attach to teaching and supervising students <em>(Regulski), </em>supervising residents of a juvenile care facility on a recreational outing <em>(Willis I), </em>or the decision of police officers regarding how to respond to a request for assistance <em>(Zavala). </em>No opinion is expressed whether the police officers, or indeed any of the defendants, are subject to liability under tort principles; this opinion is addressed only to the sepa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>rate question of sovereign, governmental, and officer or employee immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">Appendix</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Detailed Application of the Factors in the Instant Cases</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">\n<em>Ross</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">In connection with the construction of a drain on property owned by Consumers Power Company, the John Saines Project I Drainage District provided Consumers with an easement. The district contracted the construction of the drain to Dunigan Brothers, Inc. Michael Ross, a Dunigan employee, was injured when a construction vehicle near which he was working came in contact with electric power lines maintained over the property by Consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">Ross commenced an action against Consumers, and the action was eventually settled. Consumers had filed a third-party action against the district. The Court of Appeals summarized the allegations of Consumers\u2019 amended complaint as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-9\">\"In its essentials, Consumers\u2019 tort claim against the District alleges negligence arising out of a failure to notify Consumers that work was being undertaken that could interfere with the power lines, a failure to make arrangements with Consumers to safeguard workers from contact with the lines, a failure to instruct and warn its contractors concerning the lines, a failure to hire a properly licensed and competent contractor, and a failure to adequately supervise and inspect the project in such a manner as to prevent the accident from occurring.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">The heart of Consumers\u2019 complaint is that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>district allowed its contractors to work too close to Consumers\u2019 power lines without notifying Consumers of the danger, without explicitly warning the workers about the lines, and without adequately supervising and inspecting the work to prevent contact with the power lines. The question is whether this specific activity complained of constitutes, in light of the factors discussed above, a \"governmental function.\u201d It does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">First, the specific activity complained of does not involve policy formulation, nor is it quasi-judicial in nature. Consumers\u2019 claim is for the conduct of construction work too close to electric power lines without proper warnings to the workers and without proper notice to the owner of the power lines.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> That the defendant here happens to be a governmental entity does not, in and of itself, inject any degree of policy formulation into the activity. Supervision and inspection of construction work has generally been held to be operational in nature. This factor weighs against immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Second, the specific activity complained of \u2014 failures to warn, supervise, and inspect in respect to a specific site where a governmental construction project was in progress \u2014 did not represent a failure to prevent harm from a source not subject to governmental control. This factor weighs against immunity in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Third, the specific activity complained of has a common analogy in the private sector; it is not an activity primarily performed and accomplished by the government. Conceding that drain-construction occurs primarily pursuant to the Drain Code, there is nevertheless a common analogy in the private sector. The analogy obtains whenever construction workers are permitted to work close to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>electric power lines without notice to the owner of the power lines, without specific warnings and instructions to the workers, and without adequate supervision and inspection of the construction work. The private analogy is even more common when it is recognized that the same tort issues arise whenever a contractor is hired to do construction work near any kind of hazard; the analogy is not limited to the hazard of electric power lines. Because the specific activity complained of has an analogy in many private construction projects, this factor weighs against immunity in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">In conclusion, the district is not immune under \u00a77 for allegedly permitting the Dunigan employees to work too close to Consumers\u2019 power lines without notifying Consumers, without warning the workers about the danger, and without supervising and inspecting the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Consumers\u2019 complaint also alleges that the district was negligent in hiring a contractor that was not properly licensed and competent. Evaluating this specific activity independently in light of the factors set forth above,<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> the district is not immune under \u00a7 7 for its hiring of Dunigan Brothers as the contractor for this drain.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>\n<em>Willis I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">Plaintiff is the administratrix of the estate of Jeffrey Willis, who was a resident of Harbor House, a juvenile care facility for delinquent and neglected youths operated by the Department of Social Services. Willis and other Harbor House residents were taken for a swimming outing on Lake Michigan under the supervision of a counselor, Erma Knox, and a student-intern, Cyndi Hunt. Willis entered the water and drowned.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Plaintiff brought this action in the circuit court against Knox, Hunt, and the director of Harbor House, Dennis Nienow, claiming against all three negligent conduct and supervision of recreational outings. The Court of Appeals summarized the allegations of the complaint as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">\"Plaintiff\u2019s complaints alleged that Jeffrey and Knox could not swim or were of marginal swimming ability, that neither Knox nor Hunt had lifesaving training, that there were no lifeguards on duty at the time in question, that Jeffrey and other Harbor House residents were allowed to swim in areas not designated as swimming areas, and that Jeffrey and the other residents were allowed to swim under dangerous weather conditions.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">The question is whether these public officers or employees are immune from liability for the specific activity that forms the basis of plaintiff\u2019s complaint. They are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">First, all three defendants acted within the scope of their official function. It appears that recreational outings were standard activities at a facility such as Harbor House. The official functions of Knox, Hunt, and Nienow include the conduct and supervision of such recreational out<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>ings. Thus, the decisions made by these defendants with respect to this swimming outing were made within the scope of their official function.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Second, the defendants were not exercising quasi-judicial or policy-making discretionary authority, but rather were performing a ministerial act. Although permitting Jeffrey Willis to swim in the lake under the circumstances as they existed at the time was a decision requiring the defendants to use their judgment, it did not require the exercise of quasi-judicial or policy-making discretionary authority to which official immunity attaches.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">The conclusion that these public officers or employees were not exercising the type of discretionary authority protected by official immunity renders it unnecessary to consider whether they acted in good faith. Although Knox, Hunt, and Nienow were acting within the scope of their official function, they are not immune because the specific activity complained of \u2014 permitting Willis to swim under dangerous circumstances \u2014 was not done in the exercise of discretionary quasi-judicial or policy-making authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">\n<em>Willis II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">This action arises out of the same drowning incident involved in <em>Willis I. </em>In addition to the circuit court action against the individual defendants, Knox, Hunt, and Nienow, plaintiff brought an action in the Court of Claims against the State of Michigan and the Department of Social Services. The theories of liability here parallel those that were pled against the individual defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>The state has statutory sovereign immunity from tort liability pursuant to the second sentence of \u00a7 7. The scope of the statutory sovereign immunity is absolute except to the extent that it has been waived by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">The Legislature has not waived the state\u2019s immunity for torts committed in connection with the operation of a state-operated juvenile care facility. The defendants are immune.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">\n<em>Siener</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Russell Siener, Jr., was an in-patient at the Hawthorn Center, a state-operated mental health facility for emotionally disturbed children. Siener was taken by personnel of the center, in the company of other patients, on a field trip to Greenfield Village. While there, the supervisor permitted five boys, including Siener, to leave the group without supervision. During this unsupervised diversion one of the boys injured. Siener by striking him in the face with a cast iron pot lid. Siener brought an action in the Court of Claims against the State of Michigan, the Department of Mental Health, and the Hawthorn Center, alleging that the defendants failed to properly supervise and control the group of patients to which Siener had been assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">The state and its agencies have absolute sovereign immunity from tort liability pursuant to the second sentence of \u00a7 7 unless that immunity has been waived by the Legislature. Siener argues that the Legislature waived the state\u2019s immunity with respect to mental health centers in the Mental Health Code.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Specifically, Siener claims that the following provision constitutes such a waiver:</p>\n<p id=\"b754-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>\"(1) A recipient of mental health services shall not be physically, sexually, or otherwise abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">\"(4) Any recipient of mental health services physically, sexually, or otherwise abused shall have a right to pursue injunctive and other appropriate civil relief.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">The language of this section can, to be sure, be read to provide a right to civil relief for any mental health patient who is abused, whether that abuse is inflicted by a Mental Health Department employee or by another patient. In determining the legislative intent underlying this section, however, we must view the statutory provision in light of the general purpose sought to be accomplished or the evil sought to be remedied by the statute as a whole. <em>White v Ann Arbor, </em>406 Mich 554, 562; 281 NW2d 283 (1979). The underlying purpose of the Mental Health Code is to set certain standards and requirements for the treatment of recipients of mental health services by the staff and employees of mental health facilities. The statute nowhere suggests a legislative intent to impose liability on the government for injuries inflicted by other patients.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The Legislature has not waived the state\u2019s sovereign immunity where a complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>alleges injuries inflicted by another patient in a mental health facility.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> The defendants in this case are immune.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">\n<em>Rocco</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Daniel Rocco was a resident of the state-operated Ypsilanti Regional Psychiatric Hospital when he was murdered by another patient. Plaintiffs filed a two-count complaint in the Court of Claims against the Department of Social Services and the Department of Mental Health. Count I alleged that defendants negligently placed decedent\u2019s assailant, who was a patient known to have a history of violent and assaultive behavior, in an unrestrained and unsupervised unit with the decedent, who no longer required in-patient care and was awaiting transfer to a halfway house. Count II of the complaint alleged that plaintiffs paid for the care and treatment of the decedent,, and that the defendants breached their implied contractual duty to protect the decedent from harm and abuse by other patients at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">For the reasons stated in the companion case of <em>Siener, </em>the Mental Health Code does not provide a cause of action where the injury complained of was inflicted by another mental health patient, nor does the Mental Health Code constitute a legislative waiver of the state\u2019s sovereign immunity provided by the second sentence of \u00a7 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">The language of \u00a7 7, however, speaks only to immunity from tort liability; it does not grant immunity from contract claims. The state is sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>ject to action on contract claims.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Nothing in \u00a7 7 suggests an intent to establish a statutory sovereign immunity for causes of action relating to contracts. The cause should be remanded for consideration of the merits of Count II alleging breach of an implied contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Defendants argue that the contract count of the complaint merely restates the allegations of the tort count, and that to permit the contract claim to be heard would be to circumvent the tort immunity provided by \u00a7 7. Although all the allegations contained in Count I of the complaint are repeated in the contract count, Count II contains the critical allegations that plaintiffs agreed to and did pay defendants for the housing, care, and treatment of Daniel Rocco. In Count II the plaintiffs have moved beyond the statement of a cause of action in tort and have alleged a separate and legally distinct cause of action for breach of an implied contract.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">\n<em>Regulski</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">James T. Regulski was a 17-year old high school senior. He was enrolled in a building trades class. The class was offered as a regular part of the high school curriculum of the defendant school district. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>The students in this class erect a house during the course of the semester, which is then sold by the school district to a private buyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">While working on the house, Regulski was injured when he attempted to drive a nail into a piece of wood. When Regulski struck the nail, it bounced free of the wood and struck him in the left eye. Regulski brought an action against the school district, the teacher of the building trades class, Leo Hansen, and the director of the vocational building trades program for the school district, William Murphy, alleging that the defendants were negligent in failing to dismiss the class when the teacher left the job site and in allowing Regulski to continue working without supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Although it has been said that at common law, a school district \"as an agency of the State [is] clothed with the State\u2019s immunity from liability,\u201d <em>Sayers v School Dist No 1, Fractional, </em>366 Mich 217, 219; 114 NW2d 191 (1962), school districts have generally been held to have the governmental immunity of non-sovereign political units <em>(e.g., </em>cities, counties), rather than the absolute sovereign immunity of the state.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> In all events, the common-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>law immunity of school districts was abrogated by this Court in <em>Pittman v City of Taylor, </em>398 Mich <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>41, 49-50; 247 NW2d 512 (1976).<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> The current immunity of school districts is derived not from the common law but rather from \u00a7 7; school districts have the governmental immunity provided to \"governmental agencies\u201d by the first sentence of \u00a7 7, rather than the absolute sovereign immunity provided to the \"state\u201d by the second sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">The first sentence of \u00a7 7 provides governmental immunity to \"governmental agencies.\u201d The act defines \"governmental agency\u201d as \"the state, political subdivisions, and municipal corporations as herein defined.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Thus the \"state\u201d and a \"political subdivision\u201d are separate and distinct entities for purposes of the act. \"Political subdivision,\u201d in turn, is defined as including a \"school district.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Accordingly, a \"school district\u201d is a \"political subdivision\u201d and is therefore not synonymous with, but is rather distinct from, the \"state.\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Az-\">Since a school district is within the first rather than the second sentence of \u00a7 7, the question is whether the specific activities complained of constitute, in light of the factors discussed above, \"governmental, functions.\u201d Regulski\u2019s complaint alleges that the defendants allowed him to work on the construction project: 1) when no supervisor was present; 2) without adequate instruction concerning the dangers involved and the proper meth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>ods for doing the work; 3) without safety goggles or glasses; and 4) without adequate emergency supplies and facilities available in case a mishap should occur. None of these activities are \"governmental functions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">First, these activities neither involve policy formulation nor are quasi-judicial in nature. As previously noted, supervision of construction work is an operational activity. Policy formulation similarly is not involved in instructing students about the work, permitting students to work without protection for their eyes, or failing to provide sufficient emergency supplies. The decisions to offer this vocational program and to allow Regulski to participate in the program having been made, traditional tort standards are readily applied to evaluate these allegations of negligence in the implementation of the policy. This factor weighs against immunity as to all four of these allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Second, while the school district did not directly inflict the injury Regulski suffered by permitting him to work in the building trades class without supervision, instruction, protection for his eyes, and sufficient emergency supplies and facilities, and Regulski, through his own hammering, was the direct source of his own injury, the specific activity complained of \u2014 the failure of teachers adequately to teach or supervise Regulski \u2014 represented a failure to prevent harm from a source subject to governmental control. This factor weighs against immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Third, teaching has a common analogy in the private sector. There are many private schools with vocational courses offered as a part of their curriculum. While educating children and youths is an activity that today is primarily performed by the government, a significant number of students <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>are educated in a large number of private schools sufficient to constitute a common analogy in the private sector. This factor weighs against immunity with respect to the allegations of negligent instruction and negligent supervision of the teaching process.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">The private analogy regarding the provision of safety goggles and emergency preparedness extends beyond private schools to include all instances of construction and carpentry work. Whenever people work with wood, identical tort issues arise regarding safety goggles and emergency preparedness. Because construction work involving wood is generally performed by persons or concerns other than government, this factor weighs against immunity with respect to these two allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">In this case, all the factors weigh against immunity. The school district is not immune for these activities under \u00a7 7.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">The individual defendants also do not have official immunity against the allegations in this complaint. Both Hansen, as teacher of the class, and Murphy, as director of the vocational building trades program, were acting within the scope of their official functions with respect to the supervi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>sion, instruction, conduct, and emergency preparations of the course, and Regulski has not alleged that either Hansen or Murphy acted with a corrupt or malicious purpose or in bad faith. The officers were not, however, exercising quasi-judicial or policy-making discretionary authority with respect to the activities alleged in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Whether or not decisions regarding what vocational courses to offer, what prerequisites to establish, and which students are eligible to participate involve the exercise of policy-making authority, the supervision and conduct of a class does not involve the exercise of such discretion. This is particularly true with respect to the allegation that Regulski was permitted to work with inadequate supervision. In <em>Larson v Braham Independent School Dist No 314, </em>289 NW2d 112 (Minn, 1980), the Minnesota Supreme Court held that neither the teacher of a gym class nor the school principal was immune from liability to a student for injuries allegedly suffered as a result of negligent spotting of a gymnastic exercise. The supervision of classroom activities does not involve the exercise of discretionary authority to which official immunity attaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">\n<em>Trezzi</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">After walking past his parents\u2019 house and seeing through their window that the refrigerator door was ajar, Trezzi sought emergency assistance by calling 911 six times. The 911 operator attached a low-priority rating to those calls and passed them on to the police dispatcher, Philip Torbit, who then failed to dispatch any police vehicles for approximately one and one-half hours after receiving the first call for emergency assistance. During this period, Trezzi\u2019s parents were attacked by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>unknown assailant who had forcibly entered their premises; they died as a result of their injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">Applying the factors set forth above, the City of Detroit was engaged in the exercise or discharge of a \"governmental function,\u201d and therefore the city is immune pursuant to the first sentence of \u00a7 7. The crux of Trezzi\u2019s complaint is that a 911 operator improperly assigned a low-priority classification to his call and that the dispatcher delayed unnecessarily \u2014 even permitting some police officers to take a lunch break \u2014 before sending, a unit to respond to his call.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The specific activities complained of \u2014 the classification of incoming calls and the dispatch of police vehicles \u2014 involve a sufficient degree of policy formulation for the first factor to weigh in favor of immunity. This case does not involve the operational implementation of a 911 system. The determination of the priority to be given to an incoming call for assistance, in light of available manpower and other demands for assistance at the time, constitutes a policy decision regarding the most effective utilization of police resources. Even a decision to send certain units to lunch before responding to a call given a low priority requires the exercise of policy-making judgment regarding the utilization of police officers who, at some point, must eat. Assuming, as Trezzi contends, 911 operators are guided by a preexisting priority designation system, the city did not, by adopting guidelines, change the nature of the decision or diminish its <em>statutory immunity </em>from liability therefor.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>Such policy determinations weigh in favor of immunity on these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Second, because the basis of the complaint is that the government failed to prevent harm from a source not subject to governmental control, this factor weighs in favor of immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Third, the classification of calls for police assistance does not have a common analogy in the private sector. Although there are private security forces, they generally do not engage in general emergency assistance analogous to a public 911 system. And although private ambulance services may maintain a priority designation system similar to that employed by a 911 system, such ambulance services are not sufficiently analogous because they do not provide police protection. The coordination of requests for police emergency assistance afforded by a 911 system is performed and accomplished uniquely by the government. This factor weighs in favor of immunity in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">The classification of 911 calls and the dispatching of police vehicles to respond to such calls are \"governmental functions,\u201d and therefore the City of Detroit is immune when engaged in these activities under the first sentence of \u00a7 7.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">\n<em>Disappearing Lakes</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">At the request of a private land developer, the Michigan Department of Conservation (the prede<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>cessor of the Department of Natural Resources) issued a permit for the dredging of canals or channels in an area extending from Lake Orion southwestward. After the dredging, the water levels of Square Lake and Little Square Lake, both located just south of Lake Orion, dropped precipitously. Studies indicate that water loss in the Square Lakes was caused by interference with the subsurface water flow when the canals were dredged. The use of the Square Lakes for recreational and aesthetic purposes was destroyed, and plaintiffs, who own land adjoining the Square Lakes, brought an action claiming damage to health and property.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">The state and its agencies possess absolute sovereign immunity pursuant to the second sentence of \u00a7 7 unless that immunity has been waived by the Legislature. The Legislature has not waived immunity for decisions granting or denying dredging permits.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">\n<em>Zavala</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Jose Zavala was shot in front of the El Taurino Lounge. A fight had erupted outside the bar and, after a short period of time, Zavala was shot by one of the participants in the fight. After initially bringing an action against several of those involved in the fight, Zavala amended his complaint to add as defendants Sergeant Andrea Zinser, Officer Freida Harris, and the City of Detroit. Zavala alleged that at the time of the. incident, Zinser and Harris were sitting just a few feet away in a marked police car, that they saw the fight and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>indicated to individuals requesting them to act that they would take effective police action, but that they failed to make their presence known to those who were fighting and failed to break up the disturbance, choosing instead to call and wait for back-up assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">The question presented with respect to the complaint against the City of Detroit is whether an officer\u2019s decision to call and wait for back-up assistance rather than to intervene in a disturbance constitutes, in light of the factors discussed above, a \"governmental function.\u201d I would hold that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">First, a decision regarding how to handle an observed breach of the peace does not involve policy formulation and is not quasi-judicial in nature. This factor, then, weighs against immunity in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">The second factor supports a finding of immunity. Zavala is complaining that the police officers failed to prevent the shooting that caused him injury. This case presents perhaps the archetypical example of a complaint relating to what the government did not do for the claimant. Professor Cooperrider observed in respect to the prevention of crime, that a decision that government should assume \"a greater degree [of] the burdens of personal misfortune arising from its failure to shield individual citizens from harmful occurrences, such as <em>crime </em>and flood * * * belongs to the political rather than to the judicial process.\u201d Cooperrider, <em>supra, </em>p 286. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">Third, a decision to await back-up assistance rather than act immediately to break up a disturbance does not have a common analogy in the private sector. Although there are some private security forces, their responsibilities do not often require them to stop a fight among a number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>individuals. In all events, the task of breaking up a fight and arresting those engaged in disorderly conduct \u2014 and thus the decision concerning the number of officers required to perform that task safely \u2014 is uniquely performed and accomplished by government. This factor therefore weighs in favor of immunity in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">On balance, the decision to request and await back-up assistance rather than act immediately to break up the fight was a \"governmental function\u201d for which the City, of Detroit is immune under the first sentence of \u00a7 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">With respect to the individual defendants, Sergeant Zinser and Officer Harris were acting within the scope of their official function. Their responsibility as police officers was to enforce the law, and a decision to quell the disturbance by seeking back-up assistance from their fellow officers was well within the scope of that function.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">The next consideration is whether Zinser and Harris were acting in good faith. The failure to intervene in a fight occurring a few feet away does not evidence recklessness or a corrupt or malicious purpose where the officers did act by requesting back-up assistance. The record as it now stands contains no allegations of bad faith on the part of officers Zinser and Harris.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">The officers in this case, however, were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>exercising quasi-judicial or policy-making discretionary authority. This Court has held that although effecting an arrest requires the exercise of judgment, a police officer is not immune in an action alleging excessive force during an arrest. <em>Sherbutte v Marine City, supra. </em>Similarly, decisions by Zinser and Harris regarding whether to make an arrest or the number of officers necessary to accomplish an arrest required the exercise of their professional judgment, but did not require policy-making or quasi-judicial \u00abdecision-making to which official immunity attaches. Zinser and Harris do not have official immunity. The opinion of the Court does not reach the duty question, and therefore no opinion is expressed thereon.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b768-6\">Kavanagh, J., took no part in the decision of these cases.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b724-7\"> In all these cases except <em>Disappearing Lakes, </em>the plaintiffs suffered a physical injury; other factors and considerations might be determinative where the alleged tortious conduct does not cause physical injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b724-8\">\" '[Sovereign\u2019 immunity and 'governmental\u2019 immunity are not synonymous.

See, <em>e.g., Marathon Twp School Dist No 4 v Gage, </em>39 Mich 484, 486 (1878); <em>Seeley v Bd of Ed, </em>39 Mich 486 (1876); <em>Belles v Burr, </em>76 Mich 1; 43 NW 24 (1889).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">The first case to consider the scope of a school district\u2019s tort liability was <em>Ferris v Detroit Bd of Ed, </em>fn 8 <em>supra. </em>In that case, the plaintiff was injured when he slipped on ice and snow that had fallen off a school roof. In finding that the school board was liable in tort, the Court treated it as a municipal corporation, not as an agent of the state:</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">\"It is conceded by counsel for plaintiff that <em>municipal corporations </em>are not generally held liable, under the common law, for negligent injuries to individuals arising from defective plans of construction of public works or failure to keep the same in repair; but it is contended that, where the injury is the result of the direct act or trespass of the <em>municipality, </em>it is liable, no matter whether acting in a public or private capacity. We are satisfied that counsel for plaintiff are right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>in this contention. * * * It has been many times held in this court that a <em>city </em>has no more right to invade, or cause the invasion of, private property, than an individual.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 318. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">In <em>Whitehead v Detroit Bd of Ed, </em>139 Mich 490; 102 NW 1028 (1905), the plaintiffs action to recover for personal injuries suffered while he was employed by the defendant school district was dismissed by the trial court because \"in the State of Michigan <em>municipal corporations </em>are not liable for the negligence of their servants when in the exercise of duties in connection with the governmental capacity of the corporation, unless made so by statute.\u201d Id., p 492. (Emphasis added.) The trial judge based his decision on <em>Nicholson v Detroit, </em>129 Mich 246; 88 NW 695 (1902), where a <em>city </em>successfully demurred to an action arising out of negligent conduct by the city\u2019s board of health. This Court in <em>Whitehead </em>affirmed the trial judge\u2019s result and his conclusion that <em>Whitehead </em>\"could not be distinguished in principle from the case of <em>Nicholson * * Whitehead v Detroit Bd of Ed, supra, </em>p 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">In <em>Daniels v Grand Rapids Bd of Ed, </em>191 Mich 339; 158 NW 23 (1916), this Court rejected the conclusion in <em>Whitehead </em>that a school district should be treated as a municipal corporation for purposes of immunity from tort liability. A school district, the Court held, is not a municipal corporation but rather a \"quasi corporation\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">\"Although invested with certain corporate characteristics to more efficiently serve the purpose for which they are created, school districts are not municipalities, nor public corporations in the full sense, but because of their very restricted powers are distinguished and recognized as <em>quasi </em>corporations.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 347. (Emphasis in the original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">The Court in <em>Daniels </em>noted, however, that the question whether a school district should be labeled a quasi corporation or a municipal corporation was not important in that case, because the same immunity from tort liability attached to each.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-11\">School districts thus had the governmental immunity of municipalities and other non-sovereign political units rather than the absolute sovereign immunity of the state. It appears that the concept that a school district is a state agency, found in <em>Sayers v School Dist No 1, Fractional, supra, </em>can be traced to <em>Attorney General ex rel Kies v Lowrey, </em>131 Mich 639; 92 NW 289 (1902). That case, however, was a quo warranto proceeding challenging the right of certain persons to hold the office of trustee of a newly created school district. The Court\u2019s statement that \"[t]he school district is a State agency [and] is of legislative creation\u201d provided a rationale for its conclusion that the Legislature may fix, and change, school district boundaries. <em>Id., </em>pp 644-647. <em>Lowrey </em>thus was not a tort action and had no bearing on whether school districts have governmental immunity and, if so, the immunity of non-sovereign political units or the sovereign immunity of the state. See <em>Ferris, supra, Whitehead, supra, </em>and <em>Daniels, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"56\">\n<p id=\"b759-5\"> See fn 21.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"57\">\n<p id=\"b759-6\"> See fn 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"58\">\n<p id=\"b759-7\"> See fn 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"59\">\n<p id=\"b759-8\"> The act defines the term \"state\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">\" 'State\u2019 means the state of Michigan and its agencies, departments, and commissions, and shall include every public university and college of the state, whether established as a constitutional corporation or otherwise.\u201d See fn 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">The inclusion of \"every public university and college of the state\u201d within the statutory definition of \"state\u201d also suggests that school districts operating public elementary and secondary schools are not within the statutory definition of \"state.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"60\">\n<p id=\"b761-7\"> Regulski argues that because the school district sells houses constructed by the building trades class at market value, it is engaged in a proprietary function for which immunity is waived by \u00a7 13 of the act (MCL 691.\u00cd413; MSA 3.996[113]). This waiver of immunity, however, applies <em>only </em>to the state:</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">\"The immunity of <em>the state </em>shall not apply to actions to recover for bodily injury or property damage arising out of the performance of a proprietary function as herein defined.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">Nevertheless, since a school district is not a state agency (see fns 15 and 55 and accompanying text), and other units of government are immune only when engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function, \u00a7 13 is not determinative. A proprietary function is not a governmental function. In all events, since teaching and supervision is not a governmental function, Regulski\u2019s cause does not depend on characterizing the activity as a proprietary function.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"61\">\n<p id=\"b763-6\"> Trezzi also alleges that the defendants failed \"to properly carry out its inspection, counseling and safety measures in regard to '911\u2019 calls,\u201d and that the 911 system constitutes \"a complete fraud upon the public.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"62\">\n<p id=\"b763-7\"> Tort cases concerning failures to follow preexisting guidelines are not analogous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"63\">\n<p id=\"b764-9\"> This is not a case in which a 911 operator erred in taking down an address from the caller, or in which the address is recorded correctly but the dispatcher nevertheless sends a police vehicle to the wrong location.

(Emphasis supplied.) Since the opinion of the Court does not address the duty question, I express no opinion on the question whether a police officer has a tort law duty to protect a person observed being assaulted and, for failure to discharge that duty, is subject to tort liability.
