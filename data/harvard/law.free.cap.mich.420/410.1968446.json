During the next few years plaintiff intermittently worked for defendant, mainly during haying and potato seasons.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the spring of 1969, plaintiff worked a couple of Saturday afternoons cultivating fields for defendant. In June of the same year plaintiff worked 2 to 3 days per week, 5 to 7 hours per day for defendant while working part time for another employer. Throughout that summer plaintiff worked 4 to 5 hours per week for defendant while also holding other jobs. In late August or early September, plaintiff began working full time for a Mr. Johnson. While still working for Johnson, plaintiff worked one day for defendant during potato season. On that day, September 30, 1969, plaintiff, then age 18, was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">The injury occurred when the plaintiff was caught in a self-loading wagon. As a result of the accident, plaintiff is a quadriplegic confined to a wheelchair. Plaintiff was eligible for lifetime medical benefits which have been supplied and are not at issue in this appeal. MCL 418.115(e); MSA 17.237(115)(e)._</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Defendant\u2019s two sons also worked for him. The elder, Bruce, owned his own farm in 1969, but still worked 10 to 20 hours per week for defendant and was paid a salary. The other son, Nelson, lived on defendant\u2019s farm and worked there full time for a salary. When Nelson was away for five months in the National Guard, a neighbor worked 3 to 4 hours per day for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Two haying seasons occurred each year on defendant\u2019s farm. During the first, defendant hired 4 to 5 full time employees for a 2 to 3 week period. Later in the year defendant would hire the same number of full time employees for approximately one week. During potato season defendant hired 8 to 10 people who worked approximately 20 hours per week for 2 to 2-1/2 weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">In 1977, the hearing referee awarded disability benefits on the basis of his understanding that <em>Gallegos v Glaser Crandell Co, </em>388 Mich 654; 202 NW2d 786 (1972), held that the agricultural exclusion in \u00a7 115 was unconstitutional. The WCAB affirmed the referee in 1981, but substituted the board\u2019s own narrative findings. Each member interpreted <em>Gallegos </em>differently, but all concurred in affirming the award of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">The Court of Appeals denied defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal. Judge Cynak voted to grant the application. This Court subsequently remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for consideration as on leave granted. GCR 1963, 853.2(4); 413 Mich 872 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">The Court of Appeals, in an unpublished opinion per curiam, decided April 1, 1983 (Docket Nos. 63830, 63831), affirmed the decision of the WCAB. The Court interpreted <em>Gallegos </em>to mean that \"all distinctions between private and agricultural employers violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d The Court struck the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>words, \"other than agricultural employers\u201d from MCL 418.115(a), (b); MSA 17.237(115)(a), (b). It found that plaintiff was injured during a period in which the defendant regularly employed three or more employees at one time.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, it determined that at the time of the injury defendant was an employer subject to the act under \u00a7 115(a) as modified. The defendant and the Attorney General, appearing on behalf of the Second Injury Fund, applied for leave to appeal to this Court. We granted leave to appeal, 418 Mich 881 (1983), and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The statute at issue in this case, MCL 418.115; MSA 17.237(115), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-7\">\"Sec. 115. This act shall apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-8\">\"(a) All private employers, other than agricultural employers, who regularly employ 3 or more employees at 1 time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-9\">\"(b) All private employers, other than agricultural employers, who regularly employ less than 3 employees if at least 1 of them has been regularly employed by that same employer for 35 or more hours per week for 13 weeks or longer during the preceding 52 weeks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-10\">\"(c) All public employers, irrespective of the number of persons employed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-11\">\"(d) All agricultural employers of 3 or more regular employees paid hourly wages or salaries, and not paid on a piecework basis, who are employed 35 or more hours per week by that same employer for 13 or more consecutive weeks during the preceding 52 weeks. Coverage shall apply only to such regularly employed employees. The average weekly wage for such an employee shall be deemed to be the weeks worked in agricultural employment divided into the total wages which the employee has earned from all agricultural occupations during the 12 calendar months immediately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>preceding the injury, and no other definition pertaining to average weekly wage shall be applicable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">\"(e) All agricultural employers of 1 or more employees who are employed 35 or more hours per week by that same employer for 5 or more consecutive weeks shall provide for such employees in accordance with rules established by the director, medical and hospital coverage as set forth in section 315 for all personal injuries arising out of and in the course of employment suffered by such employees not otherwise covered by this act. The provision of such medical and hospital coverage shall not affect any rights of recovery that an employee would otherwise have against an agricultural employer and such right of recovery shall be subject to any defense the agricultural employer might otherwise have. Section 141 shall not apply to cases, other than medical and hospital coverages provided herein, arising under this subdivision nor shall it apply to actions, brought against an agricultural employer who is not voluntarily or otherwise subject to this act. No person shall be considered an employee of an agricultural employer if the person is a spouse, child or other member of the employer\u2019s family, as defined in subdivision (b) of section 353 residing in the home or on the premises of the agricultural employer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">\"All other agricultural employers not included in subdivisions (d) and (e) shall be exempt from the provisions of this act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">In Gallegos, the plaintiffs also challenged the constitutionality of \u00a7 115(d). There the plaintiffs were migrant workers employed to harvest cucumbers. They were compensated on a piecework basis and were injured during their employment. The WCAB denied each plaintiff\u2019s claim for benefits on the authority of the piecework exclusion and correctly ruled that it did not have the authority to decide the constitutional question.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">The Court of Appeals granted plaintiffs\u2019 application for leave to appeal and subsequently affirmed the decision of the WCAB. <em>Gallegos v Glaser Cran</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number><em>dell Co, </em>34 Mich App 489; 192 NW2d 52 (1971). The Court stated the issue before it as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-4\">\"The precise question then is whether the creation of classes within the act, thereby allowing for coverage to permanent salaried or wage-earning [farm] laborers while denying coverage to temporary piecework laborers (such as migrant workers) is such unreasonable and arbitrary discrimination as to deny the latter equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the [state and federal constitutions].\u201d 34 Mich App 491-492.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">After deciding that the plaintiffs\u2019 rights to travel were not violated, the Court further held that \"it cannot be said that the legislative decision to amend the act so as to include certain farm laborers while continuing to exclude others was arbitrary or totally without reason.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 497. Finally, the <em>Gallegos </em>Court of Appeals stated: \"In upholding the constitutionality of [\u00a7 115(d)(3)] <em>i.e., the exclusion of piecework farm laborers, </em>we in no way imply approval of the [legislative treatment of migrant workers].\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">This Court granted leave to appeal in <em>Gallegos </em>and \"the arguments of appellants and appellee [each] posit[ed] the issue as piecework.\u201d (Williams, J., <em>concurring in part and dissenting in part, </em>388 Mich 676.) Specifically, in <em>Gallegos </em>the \"[pjlaintiffs argue[d] that the exclusion from workmen\u2019s compensation benefits of those agricultural workers who are paid on a piecework basis * * * denies those workers the equal protection of the laws.\u201d (T. G. Kavanagh, J., <em>concurring in result, id., </em>p 670.)</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">The majority in <em>Gallegos </em>held that \"the provisions of \u00a7 115(d) * <em>* </em>* violate[d] the plaintiffs\u2019 rights to equal protection\u201d under the state and federal constitutions. <em>Id., </em>p 659. Notwithstanding the narrow issue before the Court, the bulk of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>majority opinion discussed the different treatment given agricultural employers and nonagricultural employers under \u00a7 115 generally. The majority stated that its \"difficulty [was] with the classification of agricultural employers\u201d because \"[agricultural employers * * * are accorded a special treatment and classification of their employees not accorded any other private or public employer.\u201d It thus held: \"[s]uch treatment is impermissible, clearly discriminatory, and has no rational basis.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 668. Plaintiff in the case at bar argues that \"[t]his language demonstrates beyond dispute that the <em>Gallegos </em>Court moved to strike down <em>all </em>distinctions based on the classification of agricultural employers.\u201d Plaintiff concludes that <em>Gallegos </em>means that agricultural employers \"must provide coverage to the same extent and under the same circumstances as non-agricultural employers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Clearly, it was not necessary for the majority in <em>Gallegos </em>to decide whether it is permissible for the Legislature to distinguish between the two types of employers in order to decide whether employees paid by the piece and those paid by wages may be treated differently. Nonetheless, the majority did so hold. We now find that because <em>Gallegos </em>was decided on issues not necessary to the resolution of the case and without a lower court record or briefing on the broader issue of distinctions between employers, it is now necessary to undertake a further analysis of that issue. Our inquiry, then, is whether the Legislature may exempt from the WDCA certain agricultural employers without violating plaintiff\u2019s right to equal protection of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The standard of review for social and economic legislation generally is applicable to evaluate provisions of the workers\u2019 compensation act in question here. <em>Johnson v Harnischfeger Corp, </em>414 Mich <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>102, 113; 323 NW2d 912 (1982). This legislation is primarily social and economic, involving property rights, not fundamental rights, and is so subjected to review under the traditional equal protection test. The burden is on the person challenging the classification to show that it is without reasonable justification. The statute will be set aside only if there is not any set of facts which can reasonably be conceived to justify it. <em>McAvoy v HB Sherman Co, </em>401 Mich 419, 453; 258 NW2d 414 (1977). Where the legislative judgment is drawn in question by an equal protection challenge, a court\u2019s inquiry must be restricted to the issue whether any state of facts either known or which could reasonably be assumed affords support for it. Thus, we must uphold the validity of \u00a7 115 unless plaintiff bears his burden of showing that the classification therein is arbitrary and does not bear a rational relation to the object of the legislation. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>p 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Michigan\u2019s first workers\u2019 compensation statute was 1912 (1st Ex Sess) PA 10. Under the act, farm laborers, domestic servants and casual workers were treated differently than all other employees. 1912 (1st Ex Sess) PA 10, \u00a7 2. In 1943, farm laborers were expressly excluded from coverage under the workmen\u2019s compensation act. 1943 PA 245, \u00a7 2a.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In 1965, the Legislature revised much of the workmen\u2019s compensation act, including the section which has since evolved into \u00a7 115. 1965 PA 44, \u00a7 2a. The 1965 version of the agricultural exclusion is essentially similar to \u00a7 115 with respect to the provisions at issue in this litigation. The legislative intent as to 1965 PA 44, \u00a7 2a, is accordingly relevant to a determination of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>purposes and object of the current partial agricultural exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">Prior to the 1965 revision, a concurrent resolution was adopted by the House of Representatives and Senate authorizing a joint special interim committee to investigate and study the entire structure of the workmen\u2019s compensation system in Michigan. The committee report stated the following with respect to agricultural employees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-5\">\"The Committee received substantial testimony, both pro and con, with respect to covering additional labor by the Act. At the present time both agricultural and domestic servant labor can be covered on a voluntary basis. Reports indicate that the total year-round farm labor force in the State of Michigan, including family help and hired labor, is approximately 149,500 persons. This figure, however, includes farmers themselves, farm wives, sons, daughters, and other relatives. It appears that the aggregate number of full time hired farm workers is between three and five thousand persons. The Committee heard testimony alleging that the <em>costs would be prohibitive </em>to bring all agricultural, workers within the Compensation Act. However, there is a strong argument for bringing <em>permanent agricultural employees </em>and domestic servants under the purview of the compensation law. It is the recommendation of the Committee that consideration be given to additional coverage for these groups.\u201d 1965 Journal of the House, pp 77-78. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Thus, it appears that the Legislature exempted certain smaller agricultural employers from WDCA coverage because it believed that coverage would create an undue-economic burden on them. The Legislature further intended to bring larger agricultural employers and their permanent full time employees under coverage. All other private employers are covered if they regularly employ three or more employees at one time or if they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>have regularly employed one person for 35 or more hours a week for 13 weeks or longer during the preceding 52 weeks. \u00a7 115(a), (b). We are required to uphold the validity of \u00a7 115 if the employer classifications are rationally related to the purpose of preventing undue hardship to agricultural employers by exempting them from the WDCA in certain circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">We hold that the classifications drawn by the statute are rationally related to the permissible goal of recognizing the economic uniqueness of Michigan\u2019s agricultural employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">The Legislature could have reasonably concluded that agricultural employers needed to be protected from the additional overhead of workers\u2019 compensation insurance premiums.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Legislature could have further decided that an excessive administrative burden on small agricultural employers would result if WDCA coverage were required. The casual and often familial nature of agricultural employment might make it administratively onerous for small agricultural employers to determine which employee should be covered. For example, small farmers often trade labor between themselves, friends, neighbors, and family. Requiring the small farmer to keep records on and insure each casual or temporary employee could effect a serious drain on time and resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">The wisdom of this policy of partial agricultural exclusion is not before us, nor is the question whether a similar exclusion should have also been given to other small businesses. It is settled that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>legislation will not fall merely because the Legislature does not address all evils at one time. <em>O\u2019Donnell v State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins Co, </em>404 Mich 524, 542; 273 NW2d 829 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The lawmakers could also consider the fact that farmers, unlike those in other sectors of the economy, ordinarily have no power to raise their prices to absorb the additional overhead costs occasioned by premium costs of workers\u2019 compensation insurance. <em>Ross v Ross, </em>308 NW2d 50, 53 (Iowa, 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Since the plaintiff has failed to show that a separate classification for agricultural employers in \u00a7 115 bears no rational relationship to a legitimate legislative goal, we hold that the challenged classification is constitutionally sound and does not violate plaintiff\u2019s right to equal protection of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">Any portions of. <em>Gallegos </em>inconsistent with this opinion are hereby overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">Turning to the statute as applied to the instant case, we find that the facts are undisputed. The defendant did not have three or more regular employees who had worked 35 or more hours per week for 13 consecutive weeks prior to the accident. \u00a7 115(d). The last sentence of \u00a7 115 provides in part: \"All other agricultural employers not included in [\u00a7 115(d), (e)] shall be exempt from the provisions of [the WDCA].\u201d Hence, except as the parties have agreed with respect to medical benefits under \u00a7 115(e), the defendant was exempt from coverage under the WDCA at the time of the injury, thereby rendering the plaintiff ineligible for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">No costs as a public question is involved.</p>\n<judges id=\"b485-12\">Williams, C.J., and Ryan, Cavanagh, and Boyle, JJ., concurred with Brickley, J.</judges>\n<p id=\"b486-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>Clerk\u2019s Note: The following opinion was filed December 28, 1984, but was revised after the signing of the majority opinion._</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b476-8\"> Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 2; US Const, Am XIV.

The basis of decision in <em>Gallegos </em>did not depend on a factual basis in a \"lower court record\u201d; the Court in <em>Gallegos </em>found rather that there was <em>not </em>a factual basis for the \"piecework\u201d analysis which the opinion of the Court today states made it unnecessary for the Court in <em>Gallegos </em>to reach the \"broader issue,\u201d and</p>\n<p id=\"b486-11\">iii. The appellants in the instant case did not raise the question whether the decision in <em>Gallegos </em>should be overruled before the WCAB or the Court of Appeals or in their application for leave to appeal to this Court; and the Statement of Questions Involved does not set forth or necessarily suggest that <em>Gallegos </em>should be overruled. (See fn 13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b486-12\">The opinion of the Court adverts to the analysis and opinion of Justice Kavanagh in <em>Gallegos, </em>but omits from the quotation from his opinion the words \"and those agricultural workers who do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>work 35 or more hours per week for the same employer for 13 or more consecutive weeks,\u201d i.e., seasonal agricultural workers. Eastway, although not a migrant worker, was a seasonal worker.. Eastway would be covered by the workers\u2019 compensation act under the analysis of Justice Kavanagh\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"><em>Gallegos </em>may indeed have been incorrectly decided. It should not be overruled, however, unless and until the question is duly presented and there is the resulting notice to persons who might be affected by an overruling decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The Court states that \"[a]ny portions of <em>Gallegos </em>inconsistent with this opinion are hereby overruled.\u201d The inference is that <em>Gallegos </em>is not overruled in its entirety; although not stated, <em>Gallegos </em>may still govern where the farm worker is \"paid by the piece\u201d and is not a seasonal agricultural worker, i.e., he is employed 35 or more hours per week by the same employer for 13 or more consecutive weeks during the preceding 52 weeks. The Court does not, however, state a doctrinal basis for such a rule, and, as the Court recognizes, a majority of the Court in <em>Gallegos </em>declared that it could not adopt an analysis that would provide a basis for such a rule. Thus, if <em>Gallegos </em>survives to that extent, it does so by fiat without a doctrinal basis in which a majority of this Court has joined. (See fn 13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The effect of today\u2019s overruling decision is not limited to persons employed by \"small family farmers.\u201d Overruling <em>Gallegos </em>might enable an agricultural employer with a large workforce to ~ avoid the application of the workers\u2019 compensation act.

The fallout from an overruling of <em>Gallegos </em>is unclear.

Kavanagh who submitted an opinion which posited the validity of differential treatment of industrial and agricultural employment, but would have held that subsection (d) was violative of the Equal Protection Clause as applied to the subclassification of seasonal agricultural workers who otherwise would have been covered and who worked less than 35 hours per week for 13 consecutive weeks or who were not compensated on an hourly or salary basis.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Justice Paul Adams submitted an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>opinion, which became the opinion of the Court when it was signed by a majority of the justices, which rejected that analysis and held that the differential treatment of industrial and agricultural employment was violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the federal and state constitutions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>While some might conclude that Justice Kavanagh\u2019s analysis was both preferable and supportable, the majority of this Court did not err in <em>Gallegos </em>in concluding that the subclassification analysis of Justice Kavanagh was not factually supported and that, therefore, the Court was required to decide whether the differential classification of industrial/agricultural employment was constitutional. The decision of this Court in <em>Gallegos </em>that the differential classification of industrial/ agricultural employment was unconstitutional<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> was accordingly not obiter dictum, but rather was necessary to decision and is binding on this Court under the doctrine of stare decisis unless and until overruled.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> While defendants no doubt would wel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>come an overruling of <em>Gallegos, </em>the question whether it should be was not raised before the WCAB or the Court of Appeals or in the application for leave to appeal.

Under either analysis, subsection (d) is invalid; Eastway, although not a migrant worker, was a seasonal worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">We agree with the Court of Appeals that <em>Gallegos </em>implicitly held that the \"other than agricultural employers\u201d clause of subsection (a) was unconstitutional. Under the analysis of both the opinion of the Court and of Justice Kavanagh, the differentiation between employers of three or more regular employees, under subsection (a), and agricultural employers of three or more regular employees, under subsection (d), was invalid. The exclusion of seasonal agricultural workers of employers of three or more regular employees under subsection (d) being invalid, it necessarily follows that subsection (a), otherwise applicable to employers of three or more regular employees, governs and that the effort to exclude agricultural employers from the operational effect of subsection (a) is also invalid. The \"other than agricultural employers\u201d clause of subsection (a) was implicitly held invalid in <em>Gallegos.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">In sum, under <em>Gallegos, </em>the act applies to agricultural employers who regularly employ three or more employees without regard to subsection (d) or the agricultural limitation in subsection (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">It is unclear whether Eisenga had three or more regular employees.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> One member of the appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>board found that he did.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Another or both of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>other members may have concurred in that finding, but their opinions do not clearly so state.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We would remand to the WCAB for clarification of whether it decided that Eisenga had three or more regular employees and further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">We have considered the defendant\u2019s family farm argument. While the Legislature may have had the family farmer in mind in drafting subsection (e), providing that the term agricultural employee does not include certain resident members of the family, subsection (d) would exclude seasonal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>workers whether they are employed by a family farm or a large farm or enterprise.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">The question whether the exclusion of resident members of an agricultural family set forth in subsection (e) is applicable to subsections (a) or (b) as well as subsection (e)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> need not be decided if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Eisenga had, as at least one member of the WCAB found, three regular employees other than family members; Eastway was not a member of Eisenga\u2019s family.

He would come and work a bit in the morning and then a bit in the evening. The estimation of the hours worked by Bruce was between ten and twenty hours per week. Bruce was paid $150 every 2 weeks for 52 weeks each year including the year 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"AXP\">\"2. The other son, Nelson, date of birth July 8, 1950 and living at 143 Woodland Drive in Cadillac, Michigan, did live at the home of the Eisengas in 1969, is listed as a dependent of Mr. and Mrs. Eisenga on their 1969 income tax record and left the Eisengas\u2019 residence in late August of 1970. He was on a <em>[sic] </em>$80 per week salary for full-time work at the Eisengas from the time of his graduation from high school in June of 1968. Nelson was in the National Guard and away from the Eisengas\u2019 farm for five months, including January through June of 1969. While Nelson was gone, Mr. Willis Blackledge, a neighbor of the Eisengas, did some of the milking at the Eisengas and worked approximately three to four hours per day at most.</p>\n<p id=\"Auq\">\"There were two seasons of the year when there would be a group of people working at the Eisengas\u2019 farm, and they are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"AeW\">\"1. The haying season lasting two to three weeks when they would have four to five people working and probably each working a full 40 hr. week.</p>\n<p id=\"ACmS\">\"2. The potato season which lasted two or two and one-half weeks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>when they would have eight to ten people working with the majority of them being students working after school. Each working from 18 to 20 hrs. per week.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ATf\">\u201cAddendum to the Proposed Stipulation of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"Ahn\">\"I.</p>\n<p id=\"ASM\">\"The calendar seasons are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"AnD\">\"1. The first haying season would last approximately two weeks starting at the end of June and going through the middle of July.</p>\n<p id=\"Am7\">\"2. The second haying season would occur in late August and would last for approximately one week.</p>\n<p id=\"A5Y\">\"3. The potato season starts at the end of September and lasts until approximately the middle of October, a period of two to two and one-half weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"AVf\">\"II.</p>\n<p id=\"ABp\">\"The son, Nelson, while working full-time [approximately 40 hours per week] at the Eisengas during the period previously spelled out in the Proposed Stipulation of Facts, would work days of up to ten (10) hours in his work for his parents.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b498-13\"> Each of the three member WCAB panel filed a separate opinion. Only Robert L. Richardson specifically addressed the question whether there were three or more regular employees. He found that there were:</p>\n<p id=\"b498-14\">\"Without considering defendant\u2019s son Nelson, we find that for purposes of compensation coverage, defendant is a private employer under section 115(a) who regularly employed three or more employees at one time, as per the stipulation of facts pertaining to not only his away-from-home son Bruce, but the extra employees during the haying and potato seasons each year. Defendant is thus liable for payment of benefits to plaintiff as set forth in the referee\u2019s order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-15\">While there were still other issues, the bulk of Mr. Richardson\u2019s opinion was devoted to a consideration of the scope of the holding in <em>Gallegos. </em>Member William C. Marshall, Jr., filed a separate opinion stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b498-16\">\"I concur with my associate\u2019s opinion and result in this case except that I cannot endorse his position that <em>Gallegos v Glaser Crandell Co, </em>388 Mich 654 (1972), is concerned only with the constitutionality of MCLA 418.115(d). I believe that <em>Gallegos </em>is much more broadly premised and sweeping in its impact than this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-17\">The opinion continues with a discussion of <em>Gallegos </em>but does not specifically advert to whether Eisenga had three or more regular employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-18\">Member Robert-W. Kehres\u2019 opinion was denominated \"concurring in result with Member Richardson.\u201d He agreed with Mr. Marshall regarding the scope of <em>Gallegos </em>but did not specifically advert to whether there were three or more regular employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-19\">The Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b498-20\">\"In our view, the <em>Gallegos </em>Court, at least implicitly, declared that all distinctions between private and agricultural employees violate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Here, plaintiff sustained injuries during the potato season, a period in which defendant Eisenga, regularly employed three or more employees at one time. Under \u00a7 115(a), the act is applicable to a non-agricultural employer. Based on our determination that the separate treatment afforded agricultural employers unconstitutionally deprives their employees of equal protection, we hold that defendant Eisenga is an employer subject to the provisions of the act pursuant to \u00a7 115(a). We strike the terms 'other than agricultural employers\u2019 from MCL 418.115(a), (b); MSA 17.237(115)(a), (b).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Eisenga and his insurer contend that until this cause reached the Court of Appeals on remand from this Court for consideration as on leave granted, 413 Mich 872 (1982), the parties considered the equal protection question \"in terms of whether Mr. Eisenga\u2019s sons could be counted in determining the number of employees on the farm or whether the seasonal workers could be counted as regular employees so as to bring the Eisengas within the provisions of MCLA 418.115(a) and (b),\u201d and that the Court of Appeals was.not justified in finding that Eastway was injured \"during the potato season, a period in which defendant Eisenga regularly employed three or more employees at one time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">We do not find any decision of this Court on the question of what constitutes regular employment. See generally 81 Am Jur 2d, Workmen\u2019s Compensation, \u00a7 103; <em>Rodwell v Pro Football, Inc, </em>45 Mich App 408; 206 NW2d 773 (1973); 1C Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation, \u00a7 52.20. In the Court of Appeals and in their brief in support of their application for leave to appeal, Eisenga. and his insurer suggested that the WCAB could construe the term \"regularly employ\u201d to take into account the seasonal nature of agricultural employment which distinguishes it \"from the work of an employer who regularly hires outside help whenever he has any work to do.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b499-9\"> See fn 15.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b500-5\"> The argument that the agricultural employment exclusion should be read to exclude family farms ignores the broad definition of the term \"agricultural employer\u201d under \u00a7 155 of the act. MCL 418.155; MSA 17.237(155). If the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Gallegos </em>were to be limited so that three regular employees must work more than 35 hours per week for 13 weeks, then the act would not apply to an agricultural employer who has a regular work force of 20 or \u00cd00 or more employees who generally work no more than 30 hours per week even if those employees work 40 or more weeks per year and work substantial overtime for no more than, say, 10 weeks per year as long as no more than two employees work more than 35 hours per week for 13 weeks. The language of such an exclusion would, thus, not be confined to family farmers. In all events, the basis of decision in <em>Gallegos </em>precludes reading into subsection (d) a subclassification for family farmers. It is clear that <em>Gallegos </em>at least held that the agricultural exemption set forth in subsections (a) and (d) was in its entirety unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">We also note that the defendants in the instant case have not provided a definition of a family farmer although it is clear that they regard Eisenga to be a family farmer. The number of persons employed by Eisenga is set forth in the stipulations (see fn 14). We would not, however, be justified in reading into the act a definition of a family farmer which essentially characterizes Eisenga, but not other farmers whose operations vary somewhat in terms of the number of employees and hours worked.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b500-7\"> Subdivision (e) (see fn 1 for text) also differs from subdivision (b) in that the employee need only have worked 35 or more hours per week for 5 or more consecutive weeks rather than 13 weeks or longer, and the obligation of the agricultural employer is not to provide disability benefits but rather to \"provide for such employees\u201d medical and hospital coverage. Subdivision (e) states that the provision of such medical and hospital coverage shall not affect any right of recovery the employee would otherwise have against the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">While it is indeed arguable that <em>Gallegos </em>declared that the agricultural exemption set forth in subsections (b) and (e) was unconstitutional, we need not decide that question at this time. <em>Gallegos </em>adverted to subsection (e) stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">\"Nor are the exclusions from the act allowed agricultural employers under \u2022\u00a7 115(d) remedied by the treatment accorded agricultural employees under \u00a7 115(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">\"Finally, the argument that \u00a7 115(e) is especially tailored to meet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>the problems of the small farmer and his occasional employees fails to account for the need for similar treatment as to the small businessman \u2014 grocer, clothier, butcher \u2014 or as to the small contractor\u2014 plumber, carpenter, roofer \u2014 or as to numerous other categories of small employers and their employees who are not accorded this treatment.\u201d <em>Gallegos v Glaser Crandell Co, supra, </em>pp 667-668.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\"><em>Gallegos </em>does not appear to have directly involved the constitutionality of subdivision (e) or of the exclusion in counterpart subsection (b). The only employee in the instant case with the requisite 35 hours and 13 weeks was Eisenga\u2019s son residing in his house.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b501-8\"> Section 118 of the act provides that no household domestic servant who is a wife, child or other member of the employer\u2019s family residing in the home shall be considered an employee. MCL 418.118; MSA 17.237(118). Section 161(2) of the act provides that a spouse of an employer may be excluded from coverage by indorsement of a policy or contract of workers\u2019 compensation insurance.
