This issue relates to the police seizure of a stolen trailer from the open access parking lot of an abandoned restaurant. As to whether the defendant in this case has standing to challenge the search and seizure of that trailer, due to the inadequacy of the record we think it appropriate to remand this case to the trial court for a new suppression hearing. In addition, since the determination of the standing issue may make it unnecessary to resolve a second issue of whether the evidence resulting from the seizure should have been excluded, we will not reach this latter issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Defendant claimed \"automatic standing,\u201d citing <em>People v Godwin, </em>94 Mich App 286; 288 NW2d 354 (1979), and arguing that because Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 11 varies slightly from US Const, Am IV, it requires a more liberal interpretation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Godwin </em>relied on <em>Jones v United States, </em>362 US 257; 80 S Ct 725; 4 L Ed 2d 697 (1960). Plaintiff contended that the test of \"reasonable expectation of privacy\u201d set forth in <em>United States v Salvucci, </em>448 US 83; 100 S Ct 2547; 65 L Ed 2d 619 (1980), which overruled the \"automatic standing\u201d test of <em>Jones, </em>applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">For this Court, this issue under art 1, \u00a7 11 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Michigan Constitution is for all intents and purposes an issue of first impression since <em>Jones </em>and <em>Salvucci. </em>For the United States Supreme Court, this issue under Am IV was settled in <em>Salvucci. </em>Under <em>Salvucci, </em>pp 92, 95, the test for standing is a \"reasonable expectation of privacy.\u201d Furthermore, <em>Salvucci, </em>p 85, expressly overruled the <em>Jones </em>test of \"automatic standing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">This Court\u2019s first inquiry must be whether there are any policy considerations which commend the \"automatic standing\u201d test over the \"reasonable expectation of privacy\u201d test, and whether anything in the differences in language between art 1, \u00a7 11 and Am IV requires us to choose one test over the other. Upon consideration, we conclude that there are no policy considerations which incline us to adopt the \"automatic standing\u201d test and that there is nothing in the differences in language between art 1, \u00a7 11 and Am IV that requires or suggests the adoption of the \"automatic standing\u201d test.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We adopt a \"reasonable expectation of privacy\u201d test consonant with our search and seizure precedents. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and overrule <em>Godwin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Defendant Smith was charged with receiving and concealing stolen property of a value over $100, to wit: a 45-foot van-type trailer. MCL 750.535; MSA 28.803. Following the preliminary examination, defendant, <em>inter </em>alia, filed a motion to suppress the trailer as evidence against him. Thereafter, an evidentiary hearing was conducted at which only one witness testified. That witness, Norman Anderson, was an investigator from the Wayne County Prosecutor\u2019s Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">In October of 1979, Mr. Anderson was provided with information concerning the theft of certain automobile transmissions. He learned that the stolen transmissions had been sold to a company in Dallas, Texas. In November of 1979, Mr. Anderson went to Dallas to investigate this report. He interviewed several employees of the recipient company. He was told that two tractor-trailer rigs had delivered the transmissions. One of the tractors was a Peterbilt and the other was a Ken-worth. The trailers were silver and appeared to be new. In addition, Mr. Anderson received four checks that had been given to the drivers of the vehicles in payment for the transmissions. One of the checks had been made payable to a Mr. Carr, and the other three were made payable to defendant Smith. The checks were indorsed by the parties and were marked with their operator license numbers. All of the checks had been cashed. These facts weye the basis of a different case against Messrs. Carr and Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">Several days after Mr. Anderson returned to Detroit, an attempt was made to locate Mr. Carr <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>and defendant Smith. On the morning of November 14, 1979, while in the company of FBI agent Tom Love and State Police officer Lyle Schroeder, Mr. Anderson went to Mr. Carr\u2019s residence on Gainesboro, four and one-half blocks from Avon and Grand River in Detroit. They knocked on Mr. Carr\u2019s door, but no one answered. The officers drove away, and at the intersection of Avon and Grand River they saw two tractor-trailer rigs parked in an abandoned restaurant lot. There was a fence around the lot, with two large openings in it for access. Upon closer inspection of the vehicles, the officers observed that one of the tractors was a Kenworth and the other was a Peterbilt. Inside the window of the Peterbilt, one of the officers saw a nameplate bearing defendant Smith\u2019s name. The trailers looked relatively new. The Kenworth tractor was still attached to one of the trailers, and the Peterbilt was parked immediately in front of the second trailer. The first trailer bore vehicle identification numbers (VIN) indicating that it was a Fruehauf. The other trailer was unmarked except for two mud flaps on which were printed the name Fruehauf.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The officers ran a check on the license plates of the vehicles. They learned that the license plates on both trailers were registered to defendant Smith. In addition, although the plates had different numbers on them, they had both been assigned to the same Fruehauf trailer. The officers located the VIN on the first trailer and discovered that it was the trailer to which both license plates had been assigned. They were unable to find the VIN on the second trailer. They found the spot where the VIN plate is normally located, but the plate had been removed. The rivet marks were still apparent. The trailer also looked as though it had recently been painted.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Mr. Anderson left the scene and returned to the police station. The State Police officer remained at the scene. In an effort to find out where the <em>hidden </em>VIN on the second trailer might be, Mr. Anderson attempted to contact someone in the commercial theft department. Mr. Anderson was unsuccessful in his attempt and thus decided to call Fruehauf. An employee of the company told him where the hidden VIN was located on Fruehauf trailers. Mr. Anderson returned to the parking lot. He had been gone for approximately 1 to 1-1/2 hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">When Mr. Anderson arrived at the lot, he crawled under the second trailer to look for the hidden VIN, but he was unable to find it. Apparently, different manufacturers put the hidden VIN in different locations. The officers then compared the physical appearance of the first trailer, which they knew to be a Fruehauf, with that of the second trailer. The two trailers were substantially dissimilar. The officers concluded that the second trailer was not in fact a Fruehauf. The officers then called a tow truck to have the trailer removed. About 1 to 1-1/2 hours later, the tow truck arrived. The trailer was towed to Cover Service in Romulus. One of the officers called the National Auto Theft Bureau to have the trailer identified. Personnel from the bureau arrived the next day, located the hidden VIN, and confirmed that the trailer was stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">Mr. Anderson testified that approximately 3 to 3-1/2 hours elapsed from the time he first saw the trailer until the time the trailer was towed away. Mr. Anderson further stated that after they first discovered the trailer, they discussed the possibility of obtaining a search warrant, but decided against it. No search warrant of any kind was ever obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">Upon the basis of the above information, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, ruling that the officers should have obtained a warrant before they seized the trailer. On appeal, the prosecutor contended that defendant lacked \"standing\u201d to challenge the propriety of the seizure.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals rejected this argument, holding that defendant had \"automatic standing\u201d to challenge the seizure under art 1, \u00a711 of the Michigan Constitution, and that the police were obliged to obtain a warrant before they seized the trailer. <em>People v Smith, </em>118 Mich App 366; 325 NW2d 429 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">II. Defendant\u2019s Contention as to Standing</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">To begin with, the issue here is not whether the government had the right to seize the trailer. The issue is whether the defendant had \"standing\u201d to object to the introduction of evidence of the results of that seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">\"Standing has been called one of 'the most amorphous [concepts] in the entire domain of public law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Flast v Cohen, </em>392 US 83, 99; 88 S Ct 1942; 20 L Ed 2d 947 (1968). \"Standing\u201d relates to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>civil<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as well as criminal matters.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The basis for \"standing\u201d to challenge a search or seizure may be possession,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> physical location,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or right to privacy,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> among others.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Defendant contends there is another and differ-. ent basis for standing from any of the above, <em>i.e., </em>\"automatic standing,\u201d \"where the defendant is charged with an offense that includes as an [essential element of the] offense charged the possession of seized evidence at the time of the contested search and seizure.\u201d Defendant relies on the Michigan Court of Appeals case of <em>People v Godwin, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> Godwin </em>relied on <em>Jones v United States.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">It is true that both <em>Godwin </em>and <em>Jones </em>support defendant\u2019s contention. However, the \"automatic standing\u201d rule of <em>Jones </em>was limited in <em>Rakas v Illinois, </em>439 US 128, 142-143; 99 S Ct 421; 58 L Ed 2d 387 (1978), and overruled in <em>United States v Salvucci, supra, </em>p 85. Defendant, however, does not discuss the federal law and relies on Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 11 and <em>Godwin </em>rather than on US Const, Am IV.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">If defendant convinces us that the rationale in <em>Godwin </em>and <em>Jones </em>is superior to that in <em>Rakas </em>and <em>Salvucci </em>and that Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 11 should be construed to grant defendants greater \"standing\u201d rights than they possess under US Const, Am IV, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>we should consider adopting the \"automatic standing\u201d rule. However, we are not so convinced on either score.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">Defendant\u2019s arguments for his rationale fail to persuade us for at least the following three reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">1. The self-incrimination rationale on which <em>God-win </em>and <em>Jones </em>rely is inapplicable because, in fact, trial procedures protect defendant against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">2. The \"automatic standing\u201d rule attempts to invoke an art 1, \u00a7 11-Am IV right <em>vicariously, </em>but the art 1, \u00a7 11-Am IV right, like other rights, is <em>personal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">3. While we have on occasion interpreted art 1, \u00a7 11 more liberally than the United States Supreme Court has interpreted Am IV, we do not find anything in the differences in language between the state and federal constitutions or in our precedents that requires us to adopt defendant\u2019s position.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">III. Self-Incrimination Rationale for Standing Is Inapplicable</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">The first reason for rejecting defendant\u2019s rationale for suppression is that it relies on the right against self-incrimination, but there is actually no self-incrimination involved. Defendant urges the \"automatic standing\u201d rule to protect against placing the defendant in a so-called \"dilemma.\u201d The \"dilemma\u201d was posited by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Jones v United States, supra, </em>p 262, to support the adoption of the \"automatic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>standing\u201d rule under the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It was premised upon the fact that various federal circuit courts of appeal at that time had required the defendant to have \u201cstanding,\u201d either to \u201chave owned or possessed the seized property or to have had a substantial possessory interest in the premises searched.\u201d <em>Jones, supra, </em>p 261. Since at that time there was no rule barring the admission against the defendant at trial of evidence introduced at a suppression hearing, the defendant frequently found himself faced with the \u201cdilemma\u201d of choosing between establishing \u201cstanding\u201d by alleging that he possessed the item, thereby risking the possibility that such evidence would be used against him at trial, or not establishing \u201cstanding\u201d and not being permitted to seek suppression of illegally obtained evidence. The <em>Jones </em>Court found this situation intolerable in cases where possession of the seized evidence was an essential element of the charged offense. In these cases, possession would both confer \u201cstanding\u201d and convict. Therefore, the <em>Jones </em>Court sought to remedy this situation by giving the defendant \"automatic standing\u201d to seek the suppression of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">In the instant case, defendant does not allege that he has been pinioned by this \u201cdilemma.\u201d In fact, in the wake of <em>Simmons v United States, </em>390 US 377, 390-394; 88 S Ct 967; 19 L Ed 2d 1247 (1968), no . defendant can find himself faced with this \"dilemma.\u201d The <em>Simmons </em>Court held that pursuant to the federal constitution a defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>suppression hearing testimony cannot be used as evidence of guilt against the defendant at trial.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We have recognized the principle set forth in <em>Simmons, </em>and we reaffirm our commitment to that principle. See <em>People v DeClerk, </em>400 Mich 10, 18-19; 252 NW2d 782 (1977). As a consequence, the fundamental tenet upon which the \"dilemma\u201d was posited has been eliminated, and along with it the \"dilemma\u201d itself. See <em>United States v Salvucci, supra, </em>pp 89-90. See also <em>Brown v United States, </em>411 US 223, 228; 93 S Ct 1565; 36 L Ed 2d 208 (1973). Therefore, we cannot accept the \"dilemma\u201d as supporting the adoption of the \"automatic standing\u201d rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The Court of Appeals in this case chose to follow the rationale of Justices Marshall and Brennan in their dissent in <em>Salvucci. </em>118 Mich 374. In his opinion, Justice Marsh\u00e1ll argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-7\">\"I cannot agree that <em>Simmons </em>provides complete protection against the 'self-incrimination dilemma\u2019 * * *. Respondents contend that the testimony given at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>the suppression hearing might be held admissible for impeachment purposes and, while acknowledging that that question is not before us in this case, the majority broadly hints that this is so. * * * The use of the testimony for impeachment purposes would subject a defendant to precisely the same dilemma, unless he was prepared to relinquish his constitutional right to testify in his own defense, and would thereby create a strong deterrent to asserting Fourth Amendment claims. * * * <em>Simmons, </em>therefore, does not eliminate the possibility that a defendant will be deterred from presenting a Fourth Amendment claim because of 'the risk that the words which he utters may later be used to incriminate hijn.\u2019 \u201d 448 US 96, 97.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">With due respect to the Court of Appeals and Justices Marshall and Brennan, we cannot agree that the possibility of defendant\u2019s testimony in favor of suppression being used to impeach him in the main trial justifies the \"automatic standing\u201d rule. It is one thing to protect a defendant from the dilemma of having to testify that there was possession to obtain standing at the cost of having that testimony used to incriminate him at trial. It is an entirely different proposition to give defendant protection against exposure of his lying at trial by denying the use of his suppression motion testimony.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>People v Graham, </em>386 Mich 452; 192 NW2d 255 (1971); <em>Harris v New York, </em>401 US 222; 91 S Ct 643; 28 L Ed 2d 1 (1971). However, we agree with the majority in <em>Salvucci </em>that the issue whether the <em>Simmons </em>privilege should extend to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>exclude such impeachment is best treated in a proper case. <em>Salvucci, supra, </em>p 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">In sum, we do not find merit in any of the above arguments advanced that defendant should have \"automatic standing\u201d to argue suppression of evidence because of an allegedly illegal search or seizure, because with the <em>Simmons </em>change in procedure the defendant\u2019s right against self-incrimination is not jeopardized.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">IV. Constitutional Rights Are Personal Only</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">The second reason for rejecting defendant\u2019s rationale for suppression is that the \"automatic standing\u201d rule attempts to invoke the rule for suppression of illegal search or seizure evidence vicariously, although the art 1, \u00a7 11-Am IV right is personal. At the outset, we note that constitutional protections are generally personal. They cannot be asserted vicariously, but rather only \"at the instance of one whose own protection was infringed by the search and seizure.\u201d <em>Simmons v United States, supra, </em>p 389. This Court enunciated this principle as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">\"The right to suppression is personal to the one whose right to privacy was violated.\u201d <em>People v Warner, </em>401 Mich 186, 203; 258 NW2d 385 (1977) (opinion of Williams, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">Stated differently, only an individual who \"belongs to the class for whose sake the constitutional protection is given\u201d can seek to invoke its protection. <em>New York ex rel Hatch v Reardon, </em>204 US 152, 160; 27 S Ct 188; 51 L Ed 415 (1907). See <em>People v Warner, supra, </em>pp 203, 209; <em>People v Norwood, </em>312 Mich 266, 272; 20 NW2d 185 (1945), and cases cited therein; <em>People v Oaks, </em>251 Mich <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>253, 255; 231 NW 557 (1930); <em>People v Joshua, </em>32 Mich App 581, 585; 189 NW2d 105 (1971), <em>lv den </em>386 Mich 758 (1971), <em>cert den </em>409 US 853; 93 S Ct 183; 34 L Ed 2d 96 (1972); <em>United States v Salvucci, supra, </em>p 86; <em>Rakas v Illinois, supra, </em>pp 133-134; <em>Brown v United States, supra, </em>p 230; <em>Aiderman v United States, </em>394 US 165, 171-172, 174; 89 S Ct 961; 22 L Ed 2d 176 (1969); <em>Simmons v United States, supra, </em>p 389; <em>Jones v United States, supra, </em>p 261. In urging us to embrace the \"automatic standing\u201d rule, defendant is necessarily advocating a departure from the above well-settled principles because the \"automatic standing\u201d rule would provide a defendant with \"standing\u201d regardless of whether he was asserting his own rights or those of another. See <em>Rakas v Illinois, supra, </em>p 135, fn 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">V. Should the Michigan Constitution Be Interpreted More Liberally Than the Federal?</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">The third reason for rejecting defendant\u2019s rationale for suppression is that he fails to advance any meritorious reason why art 1, \u00a7 11 should be interpreted any differently than Am IV. Defendant argues that this Court has traditionally imposed higher standards under art 1, \u00a7 11 than the United States Supreme Court has imposed under the Fourth Amendment. The two provisions follow:</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">\"The person, houses, papers and possessions of every person shall be secure from unreasonable searches and seizures. No warrant to search any place or to seize any person or things shall issue without describing them, nor without probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation. The provisions of this section shall not be construed to bar from evidence in any criminal proceeding any narcotic drug, firearm, bomb, explosive or any other dangerous weapon, seized by a peace officer outside the curtilage of any dwelling house in this state.\u201d Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>\"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d US Const, Am IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The defendant seems to argue that the more liberal standing under the Michigan Constitution has been attributed to the difference in wording between art 1, \u00a7 11 and the Fourth Amendment. See <em>People v Secrest, </em>413 Mich 521, 525; 321 NW2d 368 (1982). He points out that where the Fourth Amendment uses the word \"effects,\u201d the Michigan provision substitutes the word \"possessions.\u201d He concludes that this distinction provides a basis for affording greater rights under art 1, \u00a7 11 than those enjoyed under the Fourth Amendment and that, hence, we should adopt the \"automatic standing\u201d rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">We acknowledge that in the past we have on occasion offered defendants greater protection under art 1, \u00a7 11 than the Supreme Court of the United States has offered under the Fourth Amendment, and in a proper case we will do so again. We are unable to accept, however, defendant\u2019s suggestion that this has consistently been the case. In <em>People v Secrest, supra, </em>p 525, we stated that the differences in wording between art 1, \u00a7 11 and the Fourth Amendment could provide a basis for imposing higher standards under art 1, \u00a7 11 than under the Fourth Amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">\"There are differences in wording between the two. As a result, we have imposed a higher standard under the state provision than the federal where the item seized is not one within the proviso of the third sentence of art 1, \u00a7 11. <em>People v Moore, </em>391 Mich 426, 435; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>216 NW2d 770 (1974). <em>People v Beavers, </em>393 Mich 554, 567-568; 227 NW2d 511 (1975) \u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Nonetheless, we have never stated that the difference in wording between art 1, \u00a7 11, exclusive of the proviso of the third sentence, and the Fourth Amendment mandates a higher standard in every case. In fact, this Court, in <em>People v Nash, </em>418 Mich 196; 341 NW2d 439 (1983), specifically stated that \"we have not * * * created any per se higher standard\u201d and that we will only accord defendants greater rights \"where there is compelling reason.\u201d In the present case, we are not persuaded that such a compelling reason exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">In fact, we are not even convinced that the difference in wording is indeed a difference in meaning as it affects this case. The terms \"possessions\u201d and \"effects\u201d are virtually identical in meaning and are often used interchangeably. <em>Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary </em>(2d ed), p 262, supports this conclusion in that it defines \"effects\u201d as \"[g]oods; <em>possessions\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Thus, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that the difference in wording between art 1, \u00a7 11 and the Fourth Amendment requires adopting the \"automatic standing\u201d rule which would offer defendants greater protection under the state constitution than under the federal constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">VI. \"Reasonable Expectation op Privacy\u201d Test</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">Since neither constitution nor public policy requires or commends the \"automatic standing\u201d test, the next obvious question is what test should this Court adopt for search and seizure \"standing.\u201d In the past we have employed various tests to determine whether a defendant has \"standing.\u201d We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>now find that the development of jurisprudence has made these tests obsolete. We therefore adopt a new test, the \"reasonable expectation of privacy\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">A. <em>Prior Michigan Standing Cases</em></p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Historically, the earlier Michigan standing cases used a possessory test. <em>People v Norwood, supra, </em>p 272 (rights in the premises); <em>People v Oaks, supra, </em>p 255 (\"merely a tenant of a stall in [another\u2019s] garage\u201d \u2014 \"not defendant\u2019s home\u201d insufficient); <em>People v Bartoletta, </em>248 Mich 499, 501; 227 NW 763 (1929) (\"[w]hether the officers were in and at the saloon in violation of the constitutional right of its proprietor to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures is no concern of defendant\u201d driving a car full of beer to a saloon); <em>People </em>v <em>Azukauckas, </em>241 Mich 182, 184; 216 NW 408 (1927) (\"[t]he protection accorded homes may well be left to the householder to assert and we can see no reason for letting the 'guests\u2019 raise the question of immunity\u201d); <em>People v Anscomb, </em>234 Mich 203, 206; 208 NW 45 (1926) (\"difficult to see how this defendant could complain of an act unlawfully committed in the search of another\u2019s home\u201d). All these cases arose during the era of Prohibition and demonstrate two things. First, \"standing\u201d is related to ownership. Second, \"standing\u201d is a personal right that cannot be exercised vicariously.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">These cases parallel the contemporary federal case law to a considerable extent. See <em>Jones v United States, supra, </em>pp 265-267. However, it is a parallel development rather than .a. following of precedent, because the Michigan cases were decided at a time when the states were free to fashion their own rules as to the exclusion of evidence. <em>Mapp v Ohio, </em>367 US 643; 81 S Ct 1684; 6 L Ed 2d 1081 (1961); <em>Wolf v Colorado, </em>338 US 25; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>69 S Ct 1359; 93 L Ed 1782 (1949). See also 78 ALR2d 246, 250-251.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">The next significant and only other search and seizure standing case is <em>People v Gonzales, </em>356 Mich 247; 97 NW2d 16 (1959). In <em>Gonzales </em>an automobile was stopped by two police officers after they observed that a headlamp was not burning. The driver was taken back to the scout car by one of the officers for purposes of issuing a citation. Meanwhile, the second officer ordered the passengers, one of them the defendant, out of the car \"so he 'could check it.\u2019 \u201d <em>People v Gonzales, supra, </em>p 251. He then saw the butt of a pistol sticking out from under the front seat and picked it up. The defendant admitted ownership of the gun, and a search of his person uncovered a .38 caliber cartridge. On the merits, the Court held that under these facts the police had no right to search the car in which defendant was riding.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">With reference to defendant\u2019s \"standing\u201d to attack the constitutionality of the search and seizure, and without citation of authority, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">\"Further, we believe that on the facts in this case defendant had the right to raise the constitutional objection. There is no showing of any waiver of the objection by anyone. And though defendant apparently had only the status of a passenger, when the first requirement of the search (and a material one to its outcome) was that defendant remove himself from the seat in the automobile where he had a right to be, we regard the search as directly affecting him.\u201d <em>People v Gonzales, supra, </em>p 257.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">It is clear from its language that this Court was particularly impressed with defendant\u2019s right to be in the car. See <em>People v Sims, </em>23 Mich App 194, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>198-200; 178 NW2d 667 (1970), <em>aff'd </em>385 Mich 621; 189 NW2d 41 (1971).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\"><em>Gonzales </em>preceded the federal <em>Jones </em>case by a year, but its holding was similar to that of <em>Jones </em>in rejecting the refusal to grant standing to \"guests\u201d and \"invitees.\u201d <em>Jones, supra, </em>p 265. Thus, <em>Gonzales, </em>without expatiating on the subject, moved away from the narrow \"ownership\u201d test for standing of the previous cases. <em>Jones, </em>however, did speak more fully to what <em>Gonzales </em>had in fact indicated. <em>Jones </em>spoke as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-7\">\"We are persuaded * * * that it is unnecessary and ill-advised to import into the law surrounding the constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures subtle distinctions, developed and refined by the common law in evolving the body of private property law which, more than almost any other branch of law, has been shaped by distinctions whose validity is largely historical. Even in the area from which they derive, due consideration has led to the discarding of these distinctions in the homeland of the common law. See Occupiers\u2019 Liability Act, 1957, 5 and 6 Eliz 2, c 31, carrying out Law Reform Committee, Third Report, Cmd 9305. Distinctions such as those between 'lessee,\u2019 'licensee,\u2019 'invitee\u2019 and 'guest,\u2019 often only of gossamer strength, ought not to be determinative in fashioning procedures ultimately referable to constitutional safeguards.\u201d <em>Jones v United States, supra, </em>pp 266-267. See <em>Rakas v Illinois, supra, </em>p 143; <em>People v Sims, supra, </em>pp 198-200.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">B. <em>Choosing a New Standing Test </em>Turning to formulating a new standard, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>appropriate to recognize viable old principles. We begin with the fundamental tenet that constitutional protections are personal. Only an individual who \"belongs to the class for whose sake the constitutional protection is given\u201d can seek to invoke its protection. <em>New York ex rel Hatch v Reardon, supra, </em>p 160. See <em>People v Warner, supra, </em>pp 203-210 (opinion of Williams, J.); <em>People v Norwood, supra, </em>p 272, and cases cited therein; <em>People v Oaks, supra, </em>p 255; <em>People v Joshua, supra, </em>p 585. See also <em>United States v Salvucci, supra, </em>p 86; <em>Rakas v Illinois, supra, </em>pp 133-134; <em>Brown v United States, supra, </em>p 230; <em>Alderman v United States, supra, </em>p 174; <em>Simmons v United States, supra, </em>p 389; <em>Jones v United States, supra, </em>p 261. In the context of art 1, \u00a7 11, this means that the rights guaranteed by that provision can only be asserted \"at the instance of one whose own protection was infringed by the search and seizure.\u201d See <em>Simmons v United States, supra, </em>p 389. To establish standing to seek art 1, \u00a7 11-Am IV suppression, a defendant must show that he has a protectable interest under art 1, \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">This brings us to the critical question. What is the interest protectable under art 1, \u00a7 11?</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">The question is appropriately phrased in this manner, because it is clear that standing and the protectable search and seizure interest have been virtually synonymous. When the protectable interest was ownership of a home, standing was based on that ownership interest. When, with <em>Gonzales </em>and <em>Jones, </em>the protectable interest expanded from ownership, then the standing test was likewise expanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">Of course, in <em>Rakas, supra, </em>p 139, the opinion goes so far as to indicate that the concept of standing should be abandoned altogether and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>we should use only the protectable interest test. <em>Rakas </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-4\">\"we think the better analysis forthrightly focuses on the extent of a particular defendant\u2019s rights under the Fourth Amendment, rather than on any theoretically separate, but invariably intertwined concept of standing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Later, the <em>Rakas </em>opinion, p 140, talks of \"dispensing with the rubric of standing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">We need not here consider the utility of officially dispensing with the term \"standing,\u201d because this time-honored tool will in all probability remain in the vocabulary and lexicon of lawyers for a long time. It is not an empty label. It is a working concept.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">So what is the present magnitude and quality of defendant\u2019s right to protection under art 1, \u00a7 11? The long and short of it is that this Court has firmly enunciated and entrenched the definition of the right against unreasonable search and seizure in the test of \"reasonable expectation of privacy.\u201d As recently as December of 1983, in <em>People v Nash, supra, </em>pp 204-215, we agreed that Fourth Amendment interests were only \"implicated when the governmental activity infringed on a justifiable, or reasonable, expectation of privacy\u201d and that art 1, \u00a7 11 did not mandate a different standard. As long ago as April 1975, in <em>People v Beavers, supra, </em>pp 562-566, this Court clearly employed the \"reasonable expectation of privacy\u201d test in defining the scope of art 1, \u00a7 11 for purposes of ascertaining whether participant monitoring was within its ambit. In fact we relied on <em>Katz v United States, </em>389 US 347; 88 S Ct 507; 19 L Ed 2d 576 (1967), in reaching our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">As a consequence, both logic and experience <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>uphold the propriety of making the test for standing the \"reasonable expectation of privacy\u201d test. We now so establish it.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">VII. Parameters of the \"Reasonable Expectation of Privacy\u201d Test</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">In adopting the \"reasonable expectation of privacy\u201d test to determine standing, it is obvious that the parameters of this test are not delimited by a fine line. It offers no exact template that can be mechanically imposed upon a set of facts to determine whether or not standing is warranted. It does, however, provide the normal common-law value of general direction and practical flexibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">Justice Powell in his concurring opinion in <em>Rakas, supra, </em>pp 152-155, wrote a useful primer on the \"reasonable expectation of privacy\u201d test. We concur with the following remarks, and hold them applicable to art 1, \u00a7 11:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-9\"><em>\"The ultimate question, therefore, is whether one\u2019s claim to privacy from government intrusion is reasonable in light of all the surrounding circumstances. </em>As the dissenting opinion states, this standard 'will not provide law enforcement officials with a bright line between the protected and the unprotected.\u2019 See <em>post, </em>at 168. Whatever the application of this standard may lack in ready administration, it is * * * faithful to the purposes of the Fourth Amendment * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-10\">\"In considering the reasonableness of asserted privacy expectations, the Court has recognized that no single factor invariably will be determinative. Thus, the Court has examined whether a person invoking the protection of the Fourth Amendment took normal precautions to maintain his privacy \u2014 that is, precautions customarily taken by those seeking privacy. See, <em>e.g., United States v Chadwick, </em>433 US 1, 11; 97 S Ct 2476; 53 L Ed 2d 538 (1977). ('By placing personal effects inside a double-locked footlocker, respondents mani<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>fested an expectation that the contents would remain free from public examination\u2019); <em>Katz v United States, supra, </em>at 352 ('One who occupies [a telephone booth], shuts the door behind him, and pays the toll that permits him to place a call is surely entitled to assume that the words he utters into the mouthpiece will not be broadcast to the world\u2019). Similarly, the Court has looked to the way a person has used a location, to determine whether the Fourth Amendment should protect his expectations of privacy. In <em>Jones v United States, supra, </em>for example, the Court found that the defendant had a Fourth Amendment privacy interest in an apartment in which he had slept and in which he kept his clothing. The Court on occasion also has looked to history to discern whether certain types of government intrusion were perceived to be objectionable by the Framers of the Fourth Am\u00e9ndment. See <em>United States v Chadwick, supra, </em>at 7-9. And, as the Court states today, property rights reflect society\u2019s explicit recognition of a person\u2019s authority to act as he wishes in certain areas, and therefore should be considered in determining whether an individual\u2019s expectations of privacy are reasonable. See <em>Alderman v United States, </em>394 US 165; 89 S Ct 961; 22 L Ed 2d 176 (1969).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">In <em>People v Nash, supra, </em>where we equated the protectable interest of the Fourth Amendment with the protectable interest of art 1, \u00a7 11, this Court expressed its agreement with the principles set forth in Justice Powell\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Rakas. </em>We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-5\">\"An expectation of privacy is legitimate if the individual has an actual, subjective expectation of privacy and that actual expectation is one that society recognizes as reasonable. <em>United States v Knotts, </em>460 US 276; 103 S Ct 1081; 75 L Ed 2d 55 (1983). Whether an expectation of privacy exists in both the subjective and the objective sense is determined by scrutinizing the totality of circumstances surrounding the alleged intrusion. <em>United States v Hawkins, </em>681 F2d 1343 (CA 11, 1982). See <em>Rawlings [v Kentucky, </em>448 US 98; 100 S Ct 2556; 65 L <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Ed 2d 633 (1980)]; <em>Rakas, supra </em>(opinion of Powell, J., <em>concurring).\u201d People v Nash, supra, </em>p 205.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">In accordance with the foregoing, we wish to emphasize that the expectation of privacy must be one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable. In <em>Rakas, supra, </em>p 141, fn 9, the United States Supreme Court disparaged the idea \"that a person present in a stolen automobile at the time of a search may object to the lawfulness of the search of the automobile.\u201d In a slightly different vein, <em>Jones, supra, </em>p 267, referred to \"those who, by virtue of their wrongful presence, cannot invoke the privacy of the premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">In sum, we hold that before a defendant may attack the propriety of a search or seizure, that search or seizure must have infringed upon an interest of the defendant which art 1, \u00a7 11 was designed to protect. In making this determination, the court must decide whether the defendant had an expectation of privacy in the object of the search and seizure and whether that expectation is one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable. The court should consider the totality of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">VIII. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Application of the foregoing principles to the case before us is very difficult because of the inadequacy of the record. The issue of standing was first raised in the Court of Appeals. Neither the prosecutor nor defense counsel argued the standing issue in the trial court and only one witness testified at the suppression hearing. As a consequence, the trial judge made no factual findings on the issue of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">In light of these circumstances, we deem it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>appropriate to remand this case to the trial court for a new hearing on the issue of defendant\u2019s standing to challenge the seizure of the trailer in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b91-5\">Ryan, Brickley, and Boyle, JJ., concurred with Williams, C.J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b91-6\">Kavanagh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AE\">Defendant was charged in Detroit Recorder\u2019s Court with receiving stolen property, MCL 750.535; MSA 28.803, which consisted of a 45-foot aluminum trailer. Asserting an unconstitutional search and seizure, counsel for defendant moved to suppress evidence of the trailer. The trial court granted the motion, and the prosecution appealed, urging reversal on the grounds that defendant lacked standing to contest the search. The Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">We would affirm, and hold that any defendant against whom the state intends to offer evidence obtained in violation of Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 11, has standing to challenge its introduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">Police officers, while investigating the sale of stolen vehicle transmissions shipped in tractor-trailer rigs, happened upon such rigs parked in the lot of a restaurant in Detroit. One of the trailers was seized, without a warrant, and towed to a police compound in Romulus where, the next day, it was examined for a hidden vehicle identification number.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">In response to defendant\u2019s motion in the trial court to suppress the evidence obtained by the search and seizure without a warrant, the prosecutor contended that various exceptions to the warrant requirement justified the police conduct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>On appeal from the trial court\u2019s order suppressing the evidence, the prosecution challenged, for the first time, defendant\u2019s standing to contest the search and seizure. Recognizing that the automatic standing rule of <em>Jones v United </em>States, 362 US 257; 80 S Ct 725; 4 L Ed 2d 697 (1960), for cases like the present one, had been overruled by <em>United States v Salvucci, </em>448 US 83; 100 S Ct 2547; 65 L Ed 2d 619 (1980), the Court of Appeals nonetheless concluded that it \"is still applicable in Michigan as it provides greater protection to the citizens of this state from unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d <em>People v Smith, </em>118 Mich App 366, 374; 325 NW2d 429 (1982). The Court finally concluded that the seizure was unlawful and that the evidence was correctly suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">In this Court, the prosecution pursues its challenge to defendant\u2019s standing. We are urged to follow the United States Supreme Court in <em>Salvucci </em>and reject the rule of <em>Jones </em>that automatically confers standing on a defendant charged with a crime which includes possession as an essential element. In place of that rule a defendant must establish that he was a victim of an invasion of privacy because Fourth Amendment rights are personal and may not be asserted vicariously. A defendant has standing to challenge a search and seizure, the prosecution contends, only if he can demonstrate an invasion of a reasonable expectation of privacy in the property seized or the place searched.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">The United States Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the Fourth Amendment, upon which the prosecution bases its argument, confers standing only upon those whose subjective expectation of privacy has been invaded, see <em>Rakas v Illinois, </em>439 US 128; 99 S Ct 421; 58 L Ed 2d 387 (1978), and <em>Rawlings v Kentucky, </em>448 US 98; 100 S Ct 2556; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>65 L Ed 2d 633 (1980). But this would understate the breadth of Michigan\u2019s constitutional safeguard. What the Court in <em>Katz v United States, </em>389 US 347, 350; 88 S Ct 507; 19 L Ed 2d 576 (1967), said about the Fourth Amendment applies with equal force to our own art 1, \u00a7 11: \"the Fourth Amendment cannot be translated into a general constitutional 'right to privacy.\u2019 That Amendment protects individual privacy against certain kinds of governmental intrusion, but <em>its protections go further, and often have nothing to do with privacy at all. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Art 1, \u00a7 11 of the Michigan Constitution protects the <em>\"person, houses, papers and possessions of every </em>person.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Not only is privacy in a place protected, but so are persons, houses, papers, and possessions protected from unreasonable searches and seizures.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">We do not believe that only those defendants whose own privacy has been invaded by government officials may challenge the introduction of evidence unlawfully seized. Art 1, \u00a7 11 states that \"[t]he person, houses, papers and possessions of <em>every </em>person shall be secure from unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This section operates as a general injunction against the government, prohibiting its agents from conducting unreasonable searches and seizures. If a search and seizure contravenes this section, the resulting evidence has been acquired unlawfully, regardless of whether it is offered in evidence against one whose own subjective expectation of privacy has not been invaded by the search and seizure. Such tainted evidence may not be admitted in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The rule which excludes evidence obtained in contravention of art 1, \u00a7 11 likewise does not depend for its efficacy upon the particular defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>against whom such evidence is proffered. The evidence is excluded to enforce a constitutional safeguard. The government may not prosecute an individual with evidence it has obtained unlawfully because the government is not above the law. The integrity of the judiciary forbids the courts from participating in, and thereby condoning, unlawful conduct by officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">All of these reasons underlying the exclusionary rule apply whenever the state seeks to admit evidence obtained in violation of art 1, \u00a7 11. That safeguard always prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. Any criminal defendant, therefore, has standing to challenge the introduction of evidence allegedly obtained through an unlawful search and seizure. And if it was so obtained, it is inadmissible regardless of whether it was obtained in violation of the challenging defendant\u2019s rights. This view renders it unnecessary to address the prosecutor\u2019s challenge to the automatic standing rule of <em>Jones, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The prosecution argues that, even if defendant has standing, the seizure of the trailer and subsequent search for its identifying number were lawful acts and that the evidence should not have been suppressed. The argument asserts that because the trial court found that there was probable cause to believe the trailer was evidence of a crime and because it stood in an open parking lot no warrant was needed to seize it.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">We recognize that the Court of Appeals stated that the trial court had so found, 118 Mich App 376, but our own reading of the trial court\u2019s opinion reveals that the court did not find that the investigating officers had probable cause to believe the trailer was evidence of a crime. The trial court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>\"At the time of the seizure of the trailer, the officers had, at best, some suspicions that the vehicle was involved in a theft-related offense.\u201d <em>People v Smith, </em>unpublished opinion of the Recorder\u2019s Court of Detroit, decided April 3, 1980 (Docket No. 79-08198).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">We are not persuaded to disturb this finding. At the very least, in order for a seizure of private property without a warrant to be considered reasonable under art 1, \u00a7 11, there must be probable cause to believe it is evidence of a crime. See <em>People v Trudeau, </em>385 Mich 276; 187 NW2d 890 (1971), <em>cert den </em>405 US 965; 92 S Ct 1169; 31 L Ed 2d 240 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">We are in accord with the trial court\u2019s observation that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-8\">\"The plain view exception does not authorize police officers to seize everything in sight, only those items which the officer has probable cause to believe are evidence of crime. * * * The plain view exception is inapplicable to the facts at hand since the officers had conceded that the purpose of the impounding was to determine the true identity of the vehicle, not because the vehicle was thought to contain contraband or to be a stolen vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">We would affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b95-10\">. Levin, J., concurred with Kavanagh, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b95-11\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Adn\">The defendant, Lee Brady Smith, is charged with receiving or concealing a stolen motor vehicle.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The question is whether he should be accorded automatic standing to contest the seizure.

A search warrant had not been obtained. Nor was there probable cause to believe that the vehicle was stolen when it was seized.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Smith moved to suppress evidence of the trailer on the ground that it was illegally seized. The Recorder\u2019s Court granted the motion. The Court of Appeals rejected the argument that Smith lacked standing to challenge the seizure and held that he had automatic standing to challenge the seizure under Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 11, and that the police should have obtained a warrant before they seized the trailer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">The United States Supreme Court developed the standing requirement as a limitation on the exclusionary rule.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> SAbsent a standing limitation, a de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>fendant could object to the admission of evidence whether or not he had a possessory or proprietary interest in the evidence seized or the premises searched. Imposition of a standing requirement has been justified on the basis that the right to protection from unreasonable search and seizure is a personal right that may not be asserted vicariously.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Standing was at first accorded only those defendants who had a property right in the premises searched or the evidence seized. That rule came to be known as the \u201ctrespass doctrine\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and depended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>on the strength of the defendant\u2019s possessory interest in the property seized or searched. The trespass doctrine thus depended on common-law property concepts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">The trespass doctrine posed a dilemma for defendants charged with crimes in which an essential element was possession of the property seized. A motion to suppress required proof that the defendant had an interest in the property seized; however, testimony that showed his interest in the property could be used by the prosecution at his subsequent trial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant was called upon to surrender his right against self-incrimination to assert his right to be free from unreasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>searches and seizures or his latter right to retain his former right.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The United States Supreme Court resolved the dilemma in <em>Jones v United States, </em>362 US 257; 80 S Ct 725; 4 L Ed 2d 697; 78 ALR2d 233 (1960). The Court held that when a defendant is charged with a crime an essential element of which is possession of the item seized, he has automatic standing to object to a search or seizure.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Court reasoned that to reach a contrary conclusion would , permit the government to benefit from the contradictory positions of asserting that the defendant had an interest sufficient to be charged with possession, but insufficient to have standing to object to the search or seizure.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This became known as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>\"automatic standing\u201d rule.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Court added that when a defendant proved that he was legitimately on the premises of the place searched he had standing to object to use of evidence seized during the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The Court subsequently abandoned the rules announced in <em>Jones </em>and substituted a requirement that the accused be able to assert a reasonable expectation of privacy in the premises searched. The concept of a reasonable expectation of privacy, developed in <em>Katz v United States, </em>389 US 347; 88 S Ct 507; 19 L Ed 2d 576 (1967), extended the reach of the Fourth Amendment to provide greater protection of individual constitutional rights than had been accorded under prior decisions. The concept of a \"reasonable expectation of privacy\u201d was first articulated in Justice Harlan\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Katz </em>in which he suggested that the protection of the Fourth Amendment extended to all searches of areas in which one has such an expectation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Justice Harlan, speaking for the Court, subsequently relied on \"reasonable expectation of privacy\u201d in <em>Mancusi v DeForte, </em>392 US 364; 88 S Ct 2120; 20 L Ed 2d 1154 (1968). The Court held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>the defendant had standing to object to the search of an office that he shared with others and the seizure of papers from that office. Both <em>Jones </em>and <em>Katz </em>were cited with approval in the Court\u2019s opinion thereby indicating that the reasonable expectation of privacy formulation was thought to be consistent with the <em>Jones </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The \"legitimately on the premises\u201d test came under attack in <em>Rakas v Illinois, </em>439 US 128; 99 S Ct 421; 58 L Ed 2d 387 (1978). The Court concluded that substantive Fourth Amendment doctrine subsumed the <em>Jones </em>standing requirements and rejected the \"legitimately on the premises\u201d test as a measure of those rights. Absent a showing that one has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the premises searched, the defendant lacks standing to object to the search.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Justice White argued, in his dissent, that the Court\u2019s new test was inconsistent with the purpose of the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Automatic standing was abandoned in <em>United States v Salvucci, </em>448 US 83; 100 S Ct 2547; 65 L Ed 2d 619 (1980). The Court declared that <em>Simmons v United </em>States, 390 US 377; 88 S Ct 967; 19 L Ed 2d 1247 (1968), had resolved the dilemma addressed in <em>Jones. </em>In Simmons, the Court had held that testimony given by a defendant during a suppression hearing could not be used by the government to prove the essential elements of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>crime with which the defendant was charged. In <em>Salvucci, </em>the Court said that the rule announced in <em>Simmons </em>eliminated the major justification for the automatic standing rule. The <em>Salvucci </em>Court held that \"defendants charged with crimes of possession may only claim the benefits of the exclusionary rule if their own Fourth Amendment rights have in fact been violated.\u201d 448 US 85. The test then became, whether \"the defendant * * * had an expectation of privacy in the area searched.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 93. A defendant who had a possessory interest in the item seized or a defendant who was charged with a crime involving the element of possession was no longer automatically accorded standing to object to the search and seizure.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Although earlier in the term in which <em>Salvucci </em>was decided the Court had ruled that illegally obtained evidence may be used for impeachment purposes,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> it failed to note that evidence offered at a suppression hearing <em>might </em>be used to impeach the defendant should he take the stand during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>trial. While the trial court will instruct the jury that testimony offered to impeach a defendant may not be used in considering his guilt, the jury will find it difficult to distinguish between evidence offered by the prosecution to prove its case and testimony offered to impeach the defendant once he takes the stand.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Simmons </em>thus failed to eliminate the dilemma sought to be resolved by the automatic standing rule.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">When evidence obtained in a search is offered against more than one person, there may be different decisions on their motions to suppress, under the <em>Salvucci </em>rule. While all the defendants might be \"legitimately on the premises,\u201d charged with a possessory offense, and have an interest in the evidence seized, one may be found to have a \"reasonable expectation of privacy\u201d and others may be found to have no such expectation. This has been called the \" 'lightning rod\u2019 theory of standing.\u201d <em>United States v Baskes, </em>433 F Supp 799, 804, fn 6 (ND Ill, 1977), <em>aff'd </em>687 F2d 165 (CA 7, 1981).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The theory is so termed because one defendant obtains the benefit of the constitutional protection and the others do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The \"reasonable expectation of privacy\u201d test is no more consistently applied by the courts than the \"trespass doctrine\u201d was applied. A significant deficiency inherent in the \"reasonable expectation of privacy\u201d test, evidenced in <em>Rakas, </em>is that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>courts tend to look to their own intuitions to determine whether one should be accorded an expectation of privacy in a particular area. It has been observed that <em>\"Katz </em>* * * offers neither a comprehensive test of fourth amendment coverage nor any positive principles by which questions of coverage can be resolved. * * * In the end, the basis of the <em>Katz </em>decision seems to be that the fourth amendment protects those interests that may justifiably claim fourth amendment protection.\u201d Amsterdam, <em>Perspectives on the Fourth Amendment, </em>58 Minn L Rev 349, 385 (1974).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">A survey of decisions applying the reasonable expectation of privacy test shows inconsistent application.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The concept that the constitutional proscription of unreasonable search and seizure protects property rights as well as privacy rights is consistent with <em>Katz. Katz </em>extended Fourth Amendment rights to include privacy rights. It did not abrogate previous doctrine that the Fourth Amendment protected property rights.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This reading of prior decisions and of the constitutional protections has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>served as the basis of a number of state supreme court decisions that have retained the automatic standing rule. A state may recognize greater restrictions on search and seizure under its constitution than have been recognized under the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The New Jersey Supreme Court construed the term \"effects\u201d in the New Jersey Constitution<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> to confer standing on the defendant when he was the owner of, or had a possessory interest in, personal property seized by law enforcement officers. <em>State v Alston, </em>88 NJ 211, 227; 440 A2d 1311 (1981). The court said \"that the constitutional protection against unreasonable searches and seizures extends to people\u2019s 'effects\u2019 as well as to their 'persons\u2019 and 'houses\u2019 * *</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The Supreme Court of Washington reaffirmed the \"automatic standing\u201d rule under the Washington Constitution. <em>State v Simpson, </em>95 Wash 2d 170; 622 P2d 1199 (1980). The rationale was twofold: a construction of the Washington Constitution,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and a concern that the right against self-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>incrimination was inadequately protected by the rule announced in <em>Simmons.</em><footnotemark><em>26</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">In <em>State v </em>Settle, 122 NH 214; 447 A2d 1284 (1982), the Supreme Court of New Hampshire retained the automatic standing rule for possessory crimes pursuant to the New Hampshire constitutional provision regulating searches and seizures, which, like Michigan\u2019s constitutional provision,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> protects \"possessions\u201d from unreasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>searches and seizures. The court concluded that the word \"possessions\u201d provides a greater degree of protection of individual rights than is provided by the Fourth Amendment which protects only \"effects.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania also retained the \"automatic standing\u201d doctrine pursuant to the Pennsylvania Constitution. <em>Commonwealth v Sell, </em>504 Pa 46; 470 A2d 457 (1983). The court concluded that the charge of a possessory offense is sufficient to establish standing and declined to adopt the \"amorphous 'legitimate expectation of privacy\u2019 standard.\u201d <em>Id., </em>pp 66-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The rule announced in <em>Simmons </em>inadequately protects a person\u2019s right against self-incrimination guaranteed by Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17. This Court should recognize that a person charged with a possessory offense has \"automatic standing\u201d under Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 11, and that Smith has the right to object to an illegal seizure and subsequent search of the trailer, possession of which is an element of the offense with which he is charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">The Court of Appeals held that the only warrant exception that might be applicable is the \"plain view\u201d doctrine. It held that the plain view doctrine was inapplicable because the seizure failed to meet the requirements set forth in <em>Coolidge v New Hampshire, </em>403 US 443; 91 S Ct 2022; 29 L Ed 2d 564 (1971). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">There are three requirements that must be met to validate a seizure under the plain view doctrine. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>They are: the law enforcement officers must be validly on the premises, the discovery of the item must be inadvertent,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and it must be immediately apparent that the item is incriminating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The third requirement was not met here. This requirement is not satisfied unless the property appears to be incriminating without prying or a search of any kind. <em>Commonwealth v Bowers, </em>217 Pa Super 317; 274 A2d 546 (1970),<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and <em>State v Murray, </em>84 Wash 2d 527; 527 P2d 1303 (1974), <em>cert den </em>421 US 1004 (1975).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The seizure of the trailer occurred before the police located the VIN and checked it against the stolen vehicle lists. The police had subjected the vehicle to thorough searches to locate the hidden VIN plate and had been unable to locate it. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>the seizure, a special unit was notified and conducted the search to locate the VIN plate. The need for such efforts shows that it was not immediately apparent that the trailer was stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">The \"automatic standing\u201d doctrine first announced in <em>Jones </em>is embodied in Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 11, for crimes in which possession is an essential element. Because Smith was charged with a possessory offense, he has standing to object to the admission of evidence of seizure of the trailer. The warrantless seizure of the trailer failed to satisfy the requirements of the \"plain view\u201d doctrine set forth in <em>Coolidge v New Hampshire, supra, </em>and the evidence should be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">The standing doctrine developed by the United States Supreme Court as a limitation on the exclusionary rule has a questionable doctrinal basis.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Ordinarily any person who is significantly affected adversely by governmental action may assert that the governmental action is violative of a constitutional limitation.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Requiring a person who is the object of governmental action to show more than that he is so adversely affected by the asserted constitutional violation, appears to be inconsistent with traditional standing doctrine.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> To impose greater restrictions on the assertion of constitutional limitations designed to protect personal liberty is questionable. We should reconsider the legitimacy of the standing doctrine. See <em>Alderman v United States; </em>394 US 165, 200-211; 89 S Ct 961; 22 L Ed 2d 176 (1969) (Fortas, J., <em>concurring in part and dissenting in part); People v Martin, </em>45 Cal 2d 755; 290 P2d 855 (1955). The constitution proscribes unreasonable searches and seizures and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>does not state or incorporate a standing requirement based on expectation of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">In the instant case, because Smith is charged with a possessory offense, decision does not require that we do more than recognize that the concept of \"automatic standing\u201d is embodied in Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">We would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b112-6\">Cavanagh, J., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b68-9\"> The defendant does not argue that he has \"standing\u201d to challenge the seizure under Am IV of the United States Constitution. US Const, Am IV; US Const, Am XIV. Since today we adopt a standard nearly identical to the federal standard, see <em>United States v Salvucci, </em>448 US 83; 100 S Ct 2547; 65 L Ed 2d 619 (1980); <em>Rakas v Illinois, </em>439 US 128; 99 S Ct 421; 58 L Ed 2d 387 (1978), defendant\u2019s \"standing\u201d rights under the federal constitution will be the same as those under the Michigan Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b69-7\"> Of course, it is not necessary that the' wording of the Michigan Constitution be different from that of the United States Constitution in order for this Court to interpret our constitution more liberally than the United States Supreme Court interprets the language of the federal constitution. It is true that this Court cannot interpret a similar provision in the Michigan Constitution less liberally than the United States Supreme Court interprets the United States Constitution, but the opposite is not true. <em>Cf. People v Beavers, </em>393 Mich 554, 562; 227 NW2d 511 (1975), with <em>United States v White, </em>401 US 745; 91 S Ct 1122; 28 L Ed 2d 453 (1971) (participant monitoring). See also <em>People v Turner, </em>390 Mich 7; 210 NW2d 336 (1973) (entrapment); <em>People v White, </em>390 Mich 245; 212 NW2d 222 (1973) (double jeopardy). To the extent that <em>People v Secrest, </em>413 Mich 521; 321 NW2d 368 (1982) (discussed below) implies that this Court can impose a higher standard under the state than the federal search and seizure provision <em>only </em>because of differences in language, it is obviously wrong. Furthermore, <em>Secrest </em>does not show how the differences in language justify a higher standard under the Michigan Constitution. The point here, however, is that there is no difference in art 1, \u00a7 11 that <em>compels </em>a different interpretation and there is no persuasive policy reason to commend a different interpretation in this Court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b73-9\"> We note at this juncture that defendant contends that this Court should not have reviewed the \"standing\u201d issue because the prosecution did not raise the issue in the trial court. Normally, this Court will not consider issues not raised both in the trial court and the Court of Appeals. See <em>People v Crawl, </em>401 Mich 1, 30-32, and fn 20; 257 NW2d 86 (1977) (opinion of Levin, J.). In fact, in <em>People v Tyler, </em>399 Mich 564, 571; 250 NW2d 467 (1977), <em>aff'd </em>436 US 499, 512, fn 7; 98 S Ct 1942; 56 L Ed 2d 486 (1978), we declined to review the exact issue present herein because the prosecutor failed to raise it in the Court of Appeals. See also <em>People v Warner, </em>401 Mich 186; 258 NW2d 385 (1977). In the instant case, the prosecutor did raise the issue in the Court of Appeals. Because we agree with the Court of Appeals that the resolution of this issue is necessary to a proper determination of the case, 118 Mich App 370, and because this issue has caused much confusion and courts have failed to apply the true rule of law, <em>People v Crittle, </em>390 Mich 367, 371; 212 NW2d 196 (1973), we consider it at this time. See <em>People v Crawl, supra, </em>pp 30-32, and fn 20 (opinion of Levin, J.).

In these circumstances, we find it intolerable that one constitutional right should have to be surrendered in order to assert another. We therefore hold that when a defendant testifies in support of a motion to suppress evidence on Fourth Amendment grounds, his testimony may not thereafter be admitted against him at trial on the issue of guilt unless he makes no objection.\u2019 <em>[Simmons], </em>at 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">\"This Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Simmons </em>thus not only extends protection against this risk of self-incrimination in all of the cases covered by [the \"automatic standing\u201d rule], but also grants a form of 'use immunity\u2019 to those defendants charged with nonpossessory crimes. In this respect, the protection of <em>Simmons </em>is therefore broader than that of [the \"automatic standing\u201d rule]. Thus, as. we stated in <em>Brown v United States, </em>411 US 223, 228; 93 S Ct 1565; 36 L Ed 2d 208 (1973), '[t]he self-incrimination dilemma * * * can no longer occur under the prevailing interpretation of the Constitution [in <em>Simmons].\u2019 \u201d</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b78-7\"> Defendant also suggests that <em>Simmons </em>is not broad enough because it does not protect against the possibility that the prosecutor\u2019s access to suppression hearing testimony could provide him with information advantageous to trial preparation. This argument, however, is applicable to nonpossessory as well as possessory offenses, and hence in order to protect against such a possibility, \"automatic standing\u201d would have to be accorded to all defendants.

Generally, one has standing to sue when he has \"alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions.\u201d <em>Baker v Carr, </em>369 US 186, 204; 82 S Ct 691; 7 L Ed 2d 663 (1962).

A number of commentators have called for revision of the standing doctrine to require no more than a showing that a person has been charged with an offense and the evidence sought to be suppressed may be used at his trial.
