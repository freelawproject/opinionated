We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>therefore affirm the Court of Appeals decision and remand to the Court of Claims for a determination of plaintiffs\u2019 monetary award.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">On September 30, 1980, plaintiffs filed this action in the Court of Claims against the State of Michigan and several of its officers and departments. The complaint alleges that since January 4, 1979,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the plaintiffs have been required to pay their fire fighters overtime wages for all hours worked in excess of 216 hours in a work period of 28 consecutive days, pursuant to MCL 408.384a(2); MSA 17.255(4a)(2). The complaint further alleges that plaintiffs are entitled to a money judgment of reimbursement from the state, pursuant to MCL 408.384a(7); MSA 17.255(4a)(7), for the costs incurred as a result of complying with MCL 408.384a(2); MSA 17.255(4a)(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendants\u2019 answer denied, <em>inter </em>alia, that reimbursement was required by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">On October 28, 1980, plaintiffs moved for sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>mary judgment. On February 18, 1981, defendants moved for summary judgment and for accelerated judgment. The matter was heard before the Court of Claims on March 11, 1981. In an opinion filed on January 12, 1982,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Court of Claims discussed plaintiffs\u2019 claim based on MCL 408.384a(7); MSA 17.255(4a)(7), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-5\">\"The legislature shall annually appropriate from the general fund to each political subdivision affected by subsection (2) an amount equal to the difference in direct labor costs before and after the effective date of subsection (2) which arises from any change in existing law resulting from the enactment of subsection (2) and incurred by each such political subdivision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The Court of Claims noted that subsection 7 is not self-executing, but requires legislative action. It reasoned that, in order to reimburse plaintiffs under subsection 7, an order would have to issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>requiring the State Treasurer to pay out unappropriated funds, or compelling the Governor to submit an appropriations bill. The Court of Claims concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-5\">\"Plaintiffs do not seek a writ of mandamus but a money judgment for reimbursement of costs pursuant to Subsection 7 of 1978 PA 604. <em>Such a remedy, if granted, would have the same effect as a writ of mandamus in enforcing this subsection. </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 suggested remedy is merely a different route to an action for mandamus which this Court lacks jurisdiction to grant.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">The court, therefore, granted the state\u2019s motion for accelerated judgment on this issue. The Court of Claims order, entered March 17, 1982, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-7\">\"1. The Court hereby determines and declares that prior to the enactment of 1978 PA 604, MCLA \u00a7 408.384a; MSA \u00a7 17.255(4a), as amended, there was no existing law requiring Plaintiffs to pay overtime compensation to their employees engaged in fire protection activities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-8\">\"2. The Court hereby determines and declares that as of January 4, 1979, pursuant to 1978 PA 604, Plaintiffs became required to provide overtime compensation to their employees engaged in fire protection activities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-9\">\"3.

Plaintiffs\u2019 prayer for the entry of a money Judgment, reimbursing them for the costs incurred as a result of their compliance with Act 604, is hereby denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-6\">\"5. Defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment as to Count II [Headlee Amendment] of Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint is hereby granted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Plaintiffs appealed the Court of Claims ruling that it had no jurisdiction to enter a money judgment for plaintiffs. The state did not cross-appeal the declaratory ruling that the state is required to reimburse plaintiffs.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded to the Court of Claims \"for a determination of the monetary award that plaintiffs should receive.\u201d <em>City of Adrian v Michigan, </em>124 Mich App 72, 76; 333 NW2d 582 (1983). The Court of Appeals reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-8\">\"The Court [of Claims] ruled that it did not have the authority to order the State Treasurer to pay unappropriated funds from the state treasury or to require the Governor to submit an appropriations bill to the Legislature under Michigan Const 1963, art 5, \u00a7 18. However, the Court of Claims could have issued a monetary award and MCL 600.6458; MSA 27A.6458 could have been utilized. Since the Legislature failed to appropriate funds for satisfying the state\u2019s obligation under MCL 408.384a(7); MSA 17.255(4a)(7), a monetary award can be satisfied out of the funds appropriated for the purpose of satisfying judgments of the Court of Claims, see 1981 PA 30, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 71, or any other remedy a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>judgment creditor may pursue. The Court of Claims erred by denying plaintiffs a monetary award.\u201d <em>City of Adrian, supra, </em>pp 75-76.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">We granted defendants\u2019 application for leave to appeal. 418 Mich 954 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">At the time plaintiffs filed their complaint, the Legislature had not appropriated any funds for the purpose of reimbursing plaintiffs or other municipalities with similar claims. Beginning in 1982, however, and for each of the fiscal years 1982-83, 1983-84, and 1984-85, the Legislature has appropriated funds for this purpose.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, these appropriations have resulted in only partial reimbursement to the plaintiff cities, which claim they are still owed approximately $650,000.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">The state argues that MCL 408.384a(7); MSA 17.255(4a)(7) (hereinafter \u00a7 7) is not an appropriation, but merely an authorization, or intention to appropriate. It contends that \u00a7 7 creates only a political obligation, not a legal duty, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>judicial enforcement of \u00a7 7 would be an unconstitutional interference with the appropriations process. Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 17. Therefore, the state contends, the Court of Claims correctly held that it could not enter a money judgment for plaintiffs in this case. Alternatively, the state argues that, assuming a money judgment can be entered, it can be enforced only pursuant to MCL 600.6458; MSA 27A.6458, the statutory enforcement procedure for Court of Claims judgments,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and not through \"any other remedy a judgment creditor may pursue,\u201d as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>the Court of Appeals held. <em>City of Adrian, supra, </em>p 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Conversely, plaintiffs contend that \u00a7 7 sets forth a continuing legal obligation of the state to reimburse them for overtime payments made to their fire fighters since January 4, 1979. In response to defendants\u2019 argument that \u00a7 7 does not create a legal duty, plaintiffs argue that defendants are bound by the Court of Claims ruling on this point, as the state did not appeal it to the Court of Appeals. Plaintiffs dispute defendants\u2019 contention that granting a money judgment in this case will unconstitutionally interfere with the appropriations process. Plaintiffs stress that they are not requesting an order directing the Legislature to appropriate any money, but are merely requesting that the Court of Claims enter a judgment in the amount which the state is required to reimburse them. This money judgment, plaintiffs contend, would then be enforced in the same manner as any other Court of Claims judgment, following the procedure set forth in MCL 600.6458; MSA 27A.6458.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Since this procedure in no way compels <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>the Legislature to appropriate money to pay Court of Claims judgments, nor does it compel the payment of unappropriated monies, it cannot be said to interfere with the Legislature\u2019s constitutional prerogative to control the appropriations process.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The Court of Claims made the following ruling in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-6\">\"The Court hereby determines and declares that pursuant to \u00a7 4a(7) of 1978 PA 604; MCLA 408.384a(7); MSA 17.255(4a)(7), the State of Michigan is required to reimburse the Plaintiffs for all additional costs imposed upon Plaintiffs by the enactment of 1978 PA 604 for overtime payments to employees engaged in fire protection activities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">No appeal was taken from this declaratory ruling. However, the state now argues that \u00a7 7 does not impose a legal obligation on the state because it merely indicates an intent or desire to appropriate funds in the future for the stated purpose.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We hold that this argument is waived because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>state failed to appeal that portion of the Court of Claims judgment quoted above. <em>Glass v Drieborg, </em>296 Mich 30, 33; 295 NW 547 (1941); <em>Long v Pettinato, </em>394 Mich 343, 349; 230 NW2d 550 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The state also argues that the entry of a money judgment for plaintiffs will unconstitutionally in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>terfere with the appropriations process and will therefore result in a violation of the separation of powers doctrine. Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 2; art 9, \u00a7 17; art 5, \u00a7 18; art 4, \u00a7 31. This argument is without merit because it misperceives the nature of the relief plaintiffs seek. Plaintiffs are not asking this Court to order or compel the Legislature to appropriate any monies, but are merely requesting a money judgment which can then be enforced pursuant to the Court of Claims Act, specifically MCL 600.6458; MSA 27A.6458. The plaintiffs correctly contend that the enforcement mechanism set forth in MCL 600.6458; MSA 27A.6458 for the payment of Court of Claims judgments in no way compels an appropriation, nor the payment of unappropriated funds. We therefore reject the state\u2019s contention that the entry of a money judgment for plaintiffs would be an improper interference with the appropriations process.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-3\">Although the Court of Claims held that plaintiffs were entitled to reimbursement from the state pursuant to \u00a7 7, it refused to grant plaintiffs a money judgment because it reasoned that such a judgment would be the equivalent of a writ of mandamus, which it has no jurisdiction to grant. Since no funds had been appropriated to reimburse plaintiffs at the time the Court of Claims decided this case, that court concluded that the entry of a money judgment to reimburse plaintiffs would have the effect of compelling such appropriations. This conclusion, however, is erroneous because, as we have indicated, the enforcement of a money judgment pursuant to the Court of Claims Act compels neither an appropriation nor the payment of unappropriated funds. Therefore, it was within the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims to award plaintiffs a money judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">The state has raised another issue for our con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>sideration. The Court of Appeals, in remanding this case to the Court of Claims, held that \"a monetary award can be satisfied out of the funds appropriated for the purpose of satisfying judgments of the Court of Claims [citations omitted], <em>or by any other remedy a judgment creditor may </em>pursue.\u201d <em>City of Adrian, supra, </em>p 76 (emphasis added). The state contends that the above-emphasized portion of the Court of Appeals opinion is erroneous and that, assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>a money judgment may enter, it would be enforceable only according to the provisions of the Court of Claims Act, specifically MCL 600.6458; MSA 27A.6458. Plaintiffs respond that the state has waived this argument by failing to raise it in its application for leave to appeal. GCR 1963, 853.2(l)(a).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">We find it unnecessary to decide this issue now. Plaintiffs are seeking the award of a money judgment, not an order enforcing such a judgment. Moreover, plaintiffs do not suggest that they propose to enforce this judgment in any manner other than that set forth in MCL 600.6458; MSA 27A.6458.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">We affirm the Court of Appeals decision to remand this case to the Court of Claims for a determination of plaintiffs\u2019 monetary award.</p>\n<judges id=\"b628-7\">Williams, C.J., and Kavanagh, Levin, Brickley, Cavanagh, and Boyle, JJ., concurred with Ryan, J._</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b617-8\"> Plaintiffs are the following cities:</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">City of Adrian, City of Alpena, City of Battle Creek, City of Berkley, City of East Grand Rapids, City of Grand Haven, City of Inkster, City of Ishpeming, City of Jackson, City of Kalamazoo, City of Livonia, City of Madison Heights, City of Mt.

If no funds are available from this appropriation, the details of the judgment are reported to the Legislature at its next session, \u201cand said judgment * * * shall be paid as soon as moneys are available for such purpose.\u201d MCL 600.6458(2); MSA 27A.6458(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b625-8\"> In support of its argument that \u00a7 7 is a mere authorization, or intention to appropriate, the state relies on our decision in <em>Oakland Bd of Ed v Superintendent of Public Instruction, </em>392 Mich 613; 221 NW2d 345 (1974). In <em>Oakland, </em>a school district sought a writ of mandamus to compel the payment of sums of money allegedly appropriated in the 1970 amendments to the school aid act. The purported appropriation provision contained in the 1970 amendment was revised in 1971, as part of the appropriation process for the 1971-72 fiscal year. The Governor vetoed the 1971 amendment, however, and disapproved the $400,000 appropriation contained therein. The plaintiff school board then sought an order compelling the Superintendent of Public Instruction to distribute its share of the funds it contended had been appropriated by the 1970 amendment. We declined to construe this amendment as an actual appropriation, but rather construed it as an authorization, or intention to appropriate. Our reasoning follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">\"Although the Michigan Legislature may at times place authorization provisions and appropriation provisions in the same bill, we believe that any provision that does not take initial effect during the ensuing fiscal year is intended to function only as an authorization\u2014 an intention to appropriate. The dynamics of the budget change from year to year on the basis of the revenues derived and the expenditures required by the people of Michigan. Responsible fiscal policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>consequently also requires a yearly reassessment of revenues, spending goals and priorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">\"The Michigan Constitution of 1963 brought to this state new measures designed to require an annual review of the budget and to provide for annual fiscal accountability in both the legislative and executive branches. See, Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 31 and art 5, \u00a7 18 and the 'Convention Comment\u2019 accompanying each section. To construe 1970 PA 100, \u00a7 16a(5) as urged by appellee would violate the spirit if not the letter of these constitutional provisions. The Legislature would be, in effect, appropriating in advance of its ability to accurately forecast available revenues and would thereby be unable to match revenue with appropriations as required by Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 31. In addition, such prospective appropriations would force the Governor to approve or veto the expenditure far in advance of his ability to assess the fiscal needs of the state. See generally, Const 1963, art 5, \u00a7\u00a7 18 and 19. We do not believe that the Legislature intended either of these results.</p>\n<p id=\"AIi\">\"In sum, we believe that the most reasonable construction that can be made of the legislative intent behind the enactment of 1970 PA 100, \u00a7 16a(5) is to find that this section expressed only a desire to appropriate in the future. This construction avoids any conflict with the constitutional requirements binding upon both the Legislature and the Governor, and, in our opinion, furthers the comity between these two branches that is necessary for the responsible functioning of the state government.\u201d <em>Oakland, supra, </em>pp 620-621.</p>\n<p id=\"AWE\">We therefore denied plaintiff\u2019s request for mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"AQmN\">Unlike the school board in the <em>Oakland </em>case, plaintiffs in this case do not argue that \u00a7 7 effects an appropriation. Nor do they seek an order compelling the Legislature to appropriate any funds. We fail to see how the constitutional budgeting and appropriation provisions, upon which our <em>Oakland </em>decision was based, are implicated in the <em>case </em>before us. The Court of Claims has ruled that the Legislature, pursuant to \u00a7 7, is required to reimburse plaintiffs for the costs they have incurred as a result of complying with \u00a7 1. The state has not appealed this ruling. Even if it had, such a construction of \u00a7 7 does not require the Legislature to appropriate \"in advance of its ability to accurately forecast available revenues,\u201d <em>Oakland, supra, </em>p 621, because the entry of a money judgment in this case will not compel any appropriations whatsoever. Because the rationale of the <em>Oakland </em>decision is not applicable to the facts before us, we do not view that decision as determinative.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b628-8\"> GCR 1963, 853.2(l)(a) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">\"Unless otherwise ordered by the Court, appeals shall be limited to the issues raised in the application for leave to appeal.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
