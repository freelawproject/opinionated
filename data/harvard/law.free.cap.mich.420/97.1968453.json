It is asserted by the commission that the circulation of the edited letter conveyed the false and misleading impression that certain grievances had been dismissed by the commission without any finding of impropriety on the part of the respondent. In recommending public censure of the respondent, the commission has concluded that respondent\u2019s conduct was \"dishonest\u201d and constitutes conduct clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice and misconduct in office, citing Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 30, and GCR 1963, 932.4(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">On May 15, 1981, an attorney filed with the commission a request for investigation of the respondent. The request for investigation alleged partiality by the respondent with regard to the processing of certain misdemeanor charges against a Macomb County Commissioner. In addition it was alleged that in response to the filing of a motion to disqualify the respondent in one of the aforementioned cases the respondent had attacked the integrity or competence of various persons, including the individual who had filed the request for investigation, by typing statements on unrelated court files designed to achieve that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>On November 9, 1981, a separate request for investigation dealing with a matter related to the previous request was filed by a different complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">On February 4, 1982, the respondent met with a subcommittee of the commission to discuss these allegations. On this occasion the respondent acknowledged that his actions with regard to the charges against the Macomb County Commissioner and with regard to the making of the previously mentioned entries in unrelated court files were inappropriate. The respondent indicated that there would be no repetition of such conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">On February 8, 1982, the commission sent respondent a letter the full text of which is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">\n<em>\"PERSONAL &amp; CONFIDENTIAL</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">\"The Honorable Don Binkowski Judge, 37th District Court 8300 Common Road Warren, Michigan 48093</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">\"Re: <em>Grievances #81-1932 and #81-2071</em></p>\n<p id=\"AcU\">\"Dear Judge Binkowski:</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">\"Please be advised that the Judicial Tenure Commission has completed its review of the grievances concerning which your response was previously invited, and with respect to which you appeared before a subcommittee of the Commission on February 4, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">\"It is the considered view of the Commission that your conduct in connection with the <em>Myslakowski </em>cases was inappropriate in certain respects, as was pointed out by the Commission subcommittee. At that time, it was indicated, and the Commission again would reiterate, that a disinterested observer might reasonably interpret such conduct on your part as reflecting partiality or favoritism towards Mr. Myslakowski.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>\"The Commission must also express its disapproval of your practice in making extraneous entries on court files at the 37th District Court. These notations on public records serve no legitimate purpose, unnecessarily demean the object of the notations, denigrate respect for your own office and person, and raise serious doubts in the mind of the public concerning the judiciary\u2019s ability to dispense justice in a fair and impartial manner. However, the Commission\u2019s perception of the gravity of this conduct is tempered by your recognition that such actions were improper, and your representation that there will be no repetition of this practice on your part.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-3\">\"There being no need for further action, the Commission has, accordingly, dismissed the above grievances.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">\"Very truly yours,</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">\n<em>\u201c/s/Michael J. Kelly</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">\"Michael J.

As modified by the respondent the letter now read:</p>\n<p id=\"b163-14\">\n<em>\"PERSONAL &amp; CONFIDENTIAL</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Aqz\">\"The Honorable Don Binkowski</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Judge, 37th District Court 8300 Common Road Warren, MI 48093</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">\"Marrocco Kennedy [both names handwritten]</p>\n<p id=\"A6o\">\"Re: <em>Grievances #81-1932 and #81-2071</em></p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">\"Dear Judge Binkowski:</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">\"There being no need for further action, the Commission has, accordingly, dismissed the above grievances.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">\"Very truly yours,</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">\n<em>'Vs/ Michael J.

Montgomery. Both Judge Faunce and Judge Montgomery testified that they perceived the altered letter supplied to them by the respondent to be the complete document. Within a few days after dissemination of the altered letter successful efforts were made either by respondent or someone on his behalf to retrieve the copies.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-15\">The respondent admitted that he had provided the altered letter to his two colleagues. When asked by the master why he had altered the letter he replied:</p>\n<p id=\"b165-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>\"Your Honor, for me to reveal the admonishment by the Commission, in view of a very bitter 1980 campaign, would be to commit political hara-kiri. I thought that the letter was confidential to me, and I was free to do with it whatever I wanted to do in whatever I wanted to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-3\">The respondent denied that he had intended to deceive anyone by altering the letter in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Nathan J. Kaufman, a former judge of the Michigan Court of Appeals, was appointed to act as master in this matter. After hearing evidence, he issued his report in this matter in which he stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\">\"Your Master concludes that the act of respondent in changing the Judicial Tenure Commission letter, Exhibit C, was not honest. Furthermore, I find that his explanation was a very foolish one \u2014 that he did his dishonest acts in the interest of politics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">\"Your Master also concludes that the other charges were not established. Further, no one testified as to the respondent\u2019s conduct on the bench, his legal abilities, or his moral behavior. And, while the acts were dishonest, I believe that the matter should have been disposed of after preliminary investigation with private censure in accordance with GCR 1963, 932.7(c); <em>In re </em>Somers, 384 Mich 320; 182 NW2d 341 (1971).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">A majority of the commission, after receiving the report of the master, has recommended that the respondent be publicly censured. In reaching this conclusion, the majority observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-9\">\"On its face, we find Respondent\u2019s conduct to involve a material alteration of the Commission\u2019s communication of February 8, 1982.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-10\">\"We further find that Respondent\u2019s action in dissemi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>nating a significantly modified version of the notice of disposition conveyed a false and misleading impression concerning the manner in which the grievances had been disposed of by the Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-5\">\"We base this conclusion, in part, on the testimony of the Hon. George E. Montgomery and the Hon. Sherman P. Faunce, who were the chosen recipients of Respondent\u2019s truncated letter. Both of Respondent\u2019s fellow judges at the 37th District Court testified that they had viewed the letter as a copy of a formal communication from the Commission advising Respondent the grievances were dismissed. They perceived the letter as being complete and no question arose in their minds of it being less than the entire original communication. We also note the fact neither Judge Montgomery nor Judge Faunce testified that the alleged existence of copy lines or marks on Respondent\u2019s version of the letter gave indication the letter did not purport to be complete. We, therefore, find unpersuasive Respondent\u2019s assertion that marks arising from his copying of the letter gave ready notice that the modified communication was only a portion of a more detailed letter. The testimony of the Hon. Thomas E. Kennedy on these points is also corroborative of Judge Montgomery\u2019s and Judge Faunce\u2019s testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Finally, the commission concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-7\">\"We hold that Respondent\u2019s conduct was 'dishonest,\u2019 being contrary to GCR 1963, 953(3), as found by the Master, and, further, would necessarily effect public confidence in the judiciary and hinder the administration of justice. It, therefore, constitutes conduct clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice and misconduct in office within Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 30, and GCR 1963, 932.4(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-8\">\"Respondent\u2019s conduct, as set forth in the Amended Complaint, evidences his studied indifference, if not outright disregard, of the special ethical obligations incumbent on members of the judiciary. Further, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>Respondent has, while admitting the salient facts, vocally asserted that his actions were proper in every respect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-4\">\"In our view, this course of conduct reflects Judge Binkowski\u2019s inability or unwillingness to abide by the expressed expectations of the Supreme Court that judges of this State must adhere to the '* * * highest standards of personal and professional conduct.\u2019 <em>In the Matter of Bennett, </em>403 Mich 178, 193; 267 NW2d 914 (1978). The Respondent has thereby made himself a fit subject for disciplinary action by the Supreme Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-5\">\"Wherefore, we respectfully recommend to the Michigan Supreme Court that Respondent be publicly censured in accordance with Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 30 and GCR 1963, 932.25.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">As a preliminary matter we address the contention of the respondent that the commission\u2019s letter of February 8, 1982, which he admittedly altered, was a letter of \"admonishment\u201d and that the commission lacked the authority to issue such a letter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The argument is that if the commission lacked the authority to issue a letter of \"admonishment\u201d there can be no sanction imposed for altering it and disseminating the altered version.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">This argument is disingenuous in. the extreme, and the very fact that it is being advanced gives us pause. Regardless of whether the commission could impose this level of \"punishment,\u201d the fact remains that the respondent took it upon himself to alter the commission\u2019s communication in a manner calculatingly designed to give the impression that the altered version constituted the complete communication. The instant proceedings have not been invoked to test the legality of admonishing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>the respondent. We reject <em>in toto </em>respondent\u2019s attempt to avoid the consequences of his actions by virtue of a challenge to the power of the commission to issue the letter in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Respondent also argues that he has been denied due process in that he was never aiforded an opportunity to cross-examine those who had filed the requests for investigation which ultimately resulted in the letter of reprimand. Once again we reiterate that the question in controversy in these proceedings is not the legitimacy of the contentions of those who filed the requests for investigation. Respondent\u2019s argument in this regard is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">As recently as in <em>In the Matter of Evan Callanan, Sr, </em>419 Mich 376, 386; 355 NW2d 69 (1984), we had the occasion to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-7\">\"A judge, at any level of the court system presides at the focal point of the administration of justice. For that reason, a judge must be held to the highest standard of any public official.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">We are persuaded that the respondent\u2019s conduct in this matter was designed to convey to his colleagues the erroneous impression that the outcome of the commission\u2019s inquiry into the grievances which had been filed was a straightforward and unencumbered dismissal of those grievances. The respondent\u2019s colleagues testified that such was the conclusion which they drew from what was communicated to them. We are unconvinced by respondent\u2019s assertion that in altering the commission\u2019s letter he had no intent to deceive his colleagues. We accept the conclusion of the majority of the commission that the respondent\u2019s actions were indeed dishonest.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">We conclude that the respondent\u2019s actions con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>stitute conduct that is clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice and misconduct in office. Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 30; GCR 1963, 932.4(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-3\">The commission\u2019s recommendation is for public censure of the respondent. We conclude that the proceedings in this matter have already accomplished such a purpose, and we are content to let them and the opinion of this Court stand as the public censure of the respondent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b169-4\">Williams, C.J., and Kavanagh, Levin, Ryan, Brickley, Cavanagh, and Boyle, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b161-6\"> Five members of the Judicial Tenure Commission recommended public censure of the respondent.
