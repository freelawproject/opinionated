In view of the difficulty in evaluating goodwill, it is hereby agreed that the price of said goodwill shall be measured by the billable time spent by Employer and/or his employees in servicing such client during the 12-month period immediately preceding the date of termination or expiration extended at the billing rates in effect as of such date, but in no event, less than Two Thousand ($2,000.00) Dollars for each such client. It is mutually agreed that this amount will be paid by the Employee to the Employer over a five (5) year period of time with 20% down and the balance in sixty equal payments, including interest at 8-1/2% per annum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">The agreement in <em>Nolta-Quail-Sauer </em>provides in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">\"5. In the event of termination of Employee\u2019s employment for any reason, if Employee shall, within a period of five (5) years following the termination of his employment with the Company, directly or indirectly provide insurance services for any customer of the Company, Employee shall be deemed\" to have elected to purchase the insurance business with respect to such customer from the Company, and upon demand, shall pay to the Company in cash an amount equal to three (3) times the first year\u2019s insurance sales commission payable with respect to any insurance policy purchased by such customer in connection with insurance services rendered by Employee. This provision shall not be deemed a waiver of any rights of the Company against Employee for breach of any provision of this Agreement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b461-5\"> On appeal to this Court, defendants argue that the contractual provision violates the statute, drawing a parallel between this case and <em>Bernstein, Bernstein, Wile &amp; Gordon v Ross, </em>22 Mich App 117; 177 NW2d 193 (1970). Defendant suggests that the practical effect of the agreement is to prohibit him from providing services for any of Follmer\u2019s clients, because of the amounts of money that he must pay under the contract. Defendant argues that, although he is free to provide services for other clients and other accounts, the agreement is still a partial restraint of trade and as such violates the statute. Defendant submits that it will be difficult for him to survive on his own without the benefit of his established client contacts.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Defendant further argues that assuming that the plaintiff has a property interest, the agreement could have been drafted more narrowly to protect only trade secrets, including customer lists. A more rational payment schedule could have been provided. Thus, the agreement extracts more than is necessary to protect plaintiffs interests. Defendant argues that the $2,000 minimum payment imposed an undue hardship upon him because it effectively prohibits him from practicing on his own, and that the agreement injures the public and the clients who have decided to employ his services.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Defendant submits that summary judgment should not have been granted because the agreement\u2019s reasonableness was a question of fact and that the agreement extracts a penalty and not fair liquidated damages because it disregards the principle of just compensation in requiring defendant to pay the same amount of money without regard to whether there was solicitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Plaintiff answers that defendant is not prohibited from competing and that nothing in the agreement prevents or limits him from doing so in whatever manner he chooses. The covenant in question is merely a contractual agreement of purchase and sale. Accounting practices are frequently bought and sold. Defendant\u2019s obligation did not arise because plaintiff required him to purchase anything, but because defendant freely elected to represent plaintiffs former clients. The terms of the agreement, providing for a 20% down payment and payment in five yearly installments at 8-1/2% interest are reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">The agreement, plaintiff argues, does not violate the statute, because defendant has not agreed \"not to engage in any avocation,\u201d etc. Agreements have been upheld which far more substantially discourage competition in <em>Couch v Administrative Committee of Difco Laboratories, Inc, </em>44 Mich App 44; 205 NW2d 24 (1972), <em>Woodward v Cadillac Overall Supply Co, </em>396 Mich 379; 240 NW2d 710 (1976), <em>Tweddle v Tweddle Litho Co, </em>80 Mich App 418; 264 NW2d 9 (1978), and <em>Bannert v American Can Co, </em>525 F2d 104 (CA 6, 1975), <em>cert den </em>426 US 942 (1976), <em>reh den </em>429 US 874 (1976). This is a far more compelling case for the application of those principles, because defendant forfeits nothing, and cannot be restrained from representing anyone. <em>Bernstein </em>and <em>Stoia v Miskinis, </em>298 Mich 105; 298 NW 469 (1941), relied on by defendant, involved covenants not to compete, and as such are distinguishable. \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">Plaintiff argues that the agreement is not unreasonable at common law because defendant has not \"contracted himself out of a trade\u201d and the agreement does not \"destroy competition and thereby create [a monopoly].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">Finally, plaintiff argues that the agreement does not set forth a penalty or liquidated damages, but rather an agreed valuation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b462-10\"> On appeal to this Court, plaintiff argues that the \"purchase of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>business\u201d provision is not a penalty imposed against Roche for competing with his former employer, but rather is fair and agreed compensation for the loss to plaintiff of its property \u2014 particularly customers and confidential information identifying those customers. Plaintiff argues that the agreement does not prevent Roche from competing with plaintiff in the insurance business. If it deters Roche from competing, it does so no more than the provisions approved in the previously mentioned cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-3\">Plaintiff stresses the investment that insurance companies make in building their businesses and developing customer goodwill, states that it guards its lists of customers and information concerning the customers\u2019 insurance needs, expiration dates of policies, and premiums charged, and shared that information with Roche under a promise of confidentiality. Plaintiff emphasizes that Roche was encouraged to develop client contacts, was reimbursed for the reasonable costs of client development, and that he was supported in this endeavor by advertising at the company\u2019s expense. Plaintiff notes that Roche acknowledged in his deposition that information concerning \"expirations\u201d provides an agent with a definite advantage. Plaintiff argues that the formula agreed upon for valuing the goodwill sold was reasonable and \"not inconsistent with industry practice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Plaintiff argues that the purchase price set forth in the employment agreement was neither a penalty nor a forfeiture, but an agreed upon valuation for the value of the property. Such an agreed upon valuation is permissible where it is difficult to ascertain or estimate the actual damages for breach of contract. The value agreed upon is not so excessive as to amount to a constructive bar on competition (which would call for a reformation to a reasonable amount).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Defendants\u2019 answer that the plaintiff is attempting to prohibit Roche from competing \"by imposing a monetary penalty for providing insurance services to customers who happen to be former customers of the Employers.\u201d Defendants argue that paragraph 3 of the employment agreement (no longer relied upon by plaintiff) is a bald restraint of trade and that paragraph 5 is merely the penalty provision for the enforcement of paragraph 3. Defendants contend that Michigan courts are reluctant to enforce covenants not to compete. Defendants argue that the plaintiff no longer claims that Roche wrongfully appropriated confidential information or trade secrets (apparently because it relies only on Count V of its complaint and has dropped the other counts). In any case, defendants say there was no evidence to suggest that Roche wrongfully used trade secrets or confidential information to plaintiff\u2019s detriment. Defendants argue that if plaintiff had the good-faith intention of allowing Roche to purchase insurance business, it would not have included paragraph 3 (the prohibition on selling insurance to plaintiff\u2019s customers) in the employment contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Defendants argue that Roche never solicited any of plaintiff\u2019s customers after termination of his employment. All the customers came to him. Defendants argue that the payment is unreasonable because it means that any time Roche sells insurance to a former customer, he must pay plaintiff three times his first year\u2019s commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Defendants submit that the deposition testimony of Roche, relied on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>by plaintiff, referred to the sale of an entire insurance agency, and not to \"casual sales of individual insurance customers\u201d and thus does not support a finding of reasonableness with respect to that formula. The cases involving agreed valuations did not consider the Michigan statute prohibiting anticompetitive agreements, and that statute clearly prohibits this agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b464-10\"> \"It has been uniformly held that general knowledge, skill, or facility acquired through training or experience while working for an employer appertain exclusively to the employee.
