A. Muer Corporation. Miller became engaged to a woman who worked as a waitress at the same restaurant. When Miller told the restaurant manager of his marriage plans, the manager informed him of the company\u2019s policy<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that prohibited a husband and wife from working in the same restaurant. Miller was told that after his marriage he would be required to choose between quitting his employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>ment, being discharged, or being transferred to another restaurant operated by Muer. Miller quit his employment in apparent response to the restaurant\u2019s policy. Subsequently, he commenced this action alleging employment discrimination on the basis of marital status and seeking damages and declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-3\">The circuit judge granted Muer\u2019s motion for summary judgment stating that \"discrimination based on marital status means discrimination based on 'the existence or non-existence of a spouse.\u2019 \u201d The Court of Appeals reversed stating that \"[t]he Legislature\u2019s intent would be furthered by construing the term 'marital status\u2019 to include a prohibition against discriminatory employment practices based on the identity of one\u2019s spouse.\u201d <em>Miller v C A Muer Corp, </em>124 Mich App 780, 784; 336 NW2d 215 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Plaintiff Rosemary Lowry was employed as a security officer by defendant Sinai Hospital of Detroit. She married William Lowry who also was a security officer employed by Sinai Hospital. Shortly after their marriage, the Lowrys were told that hospital policy<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> required that one of them leave the employment or transfer to another de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>partment. Approximately four months after the marriage, Rosemary Lowry transferred to a different department where she received lower hourly compensation without the possibility of merit increases or promotion. She quit her employment approximately eight months after the transfer. Subsequently, she commenced this action alleging that the hospital\u2019s policy discriminated on the basis of marital status and seeking compensatory and exemplary damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The circuit judge, relying on his earlier opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>in <em>Miller,</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>granted the hospital\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The Court of Appeals affirmed in a divided opinion; the cause was submitted to the entire Court, and a majority voted to follow the opinion issued in <em>Miller </em>and reverse the decision of the circuit judge. <em>Lowry v Sinai Hospital of Detroit, </em>129 Mich App 726; 343 NW2d 1 (1983) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">In both <em>Miller </em>and <em>Lowry </em>we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand to the circuit court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">The validity of antinepotism and no-spouse policies has been consistently sustained when challenged under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 USC 2000e-2.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Michigan civil rights act, however, in contrast with the federal act, prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of a person\u2019s marital status.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">The Legislature did not define the term \"marital status\u201d in the civil rights act. It has been said that the term means \"whether one is married or not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>married,\u201d <em>Maryland Comm on Human Relations v Greenbelt Homes, Inc, </em>300 Md 75, 83; 475 A2d 1192 (1984), or \"the social condition enjoyed by an individual by reason of his or her having participated or failed to participate in a marriage,\u201d <em>Manhattan Pizza Hut, Inc v New York State Human Rights Appeal Board, 51 </em>NY2d 506, 511; 434 NYS2d 961; 415 NE2d 950 (1980). The usual answer to a query about one\u2019s marital status is \"married,\u201d \"single,\u201d \"divorced,\u201d \"widowed,\u201d or \"separated.\u201d <em>Id., </em>pp 511-512. The relevant inquiry is <em>if </em>one is married rather than <em>to whom </em>one is married. <em>Klanseck v Prudential Ins Co of America, </em>509 F Supp 13, 18 (ED Mich, 1980) (supplemental memorandum opinion issued February 26, 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">In the context of challenges to antinepotism or no-spouse policies, a number of courts have construed \"marital status\u201d to mean whether or not one is married.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Other courts, including the Court of Appeals in the instant cases, have adopted more expansive definitions to further their perceptions of legislative purpose and intent.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We are persuaded, however, that the Legislature did not intend that the term \"marital status\u201d include the identity, occupation, and place of employment of one\u2019s spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Civil rights acts seek to prevent discrimination against a person because of stereotyped impressions about the characteristics of a class to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>the person belongs.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Michigan civil rights act is aimed at \"the prejudices and biases\u201d borne against persons because of their membership in a certain class, <em>Boscaglia v Michigan Bell Telephone Co, </em>420 Mich 308, 316; 362 NW2d 642 (1984); <em>Freeman v Kelvinator, Inc, </em>469 F Supp 999, 1000 (ED Mich, 1979), and seeks to eliminate the effects of offensive or demeaning stereotypes, prejudices, and biases.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">By including marital status as a protected class, the Legislature manifested its intent to prohibit discrimination based on <em>whether </em>a person is married. To include the identity, occupation, and place of employment of one\u2019s spouse within the definition of \"marital status\u201d might enlarge the protected class to include all married persons who desire to work with their spouse.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Such a construction would invalidate most antinepotism policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Some of the reasons advanced in justification of antinepotism policies include potential emotional interference with job performance, collusion in grievance disputes, favoritism, morale problems resulting from the appearance of favoritism, and conflicts of interest that arise if an employee is required to supervise the employee\u2019s spouse.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> 11 Whether these reasons are valid in all circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>stances or not, they do not appear to reflect offensive or demeaning stereotypes, prejudices, or biases. Absent a more specific manifestation of legislative intent, we conclude that the prohibition of employment discrimination on the basis of \"marital status\u201d was not meant to protect a right to be employed in the same department as one\u2019s spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The instant antinepotism policies do not, in terms, discriminate on the basis of whether a person is married. In <em>Miller, </em>the policy applies to \"any relatives (natural or through marriage).\u201d In <em>Lowry, </em>the policy applies to parents, children, siblings, spouses, grandparents, and legal guardians. Neither of these policies facially treats employees differently on the basis of whether they are married, nor is there any facial indication of an adverse effect upon married, single, divorced, separated, or widowed employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">Miller and Lowry claim that the instant antinepotism policies interfere with their fundamental right to marry and that such interference violates their rights of privacy, freedom of choice, due process, and equal protection under the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> They urge that we adopt a standard of \"strict scrutiny\u201d when reviewing the validity of antinepotism policies.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>In confronting similar arguments, federal courts have applied a \"rational basis\u201d test and have upheld antinepotism policies against constitutional challenges.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court has indeed said that the freedom to marry is a \"vital personal right.\u201d <em>Loving v Virginia, </em>388 US 1, 12; 87 S Ct 1817; 18 L Ed 2d 1010 (1967). The antinepotism policies in the instant cases, however, do not prohibit marriage or deny co-workers the right to marry. Not every regulation that \"relates in any way to the incidents of * * * marriage must be subjected to rigorous scrutiny;\u201d such scrutiny is applicable when regulations \"interfere directly and substantially with the right to marry.\u201d <em>Zablocki v Redhail, </em>434 US 374, 386-387; 98 S Ct 673; 54 L Ed 2d 618 (1978). Antinepotism policies may require co-workers who desire to marry to confront serious and difficult choices. Such policies do not, however, infringe on the right to marry \"directly and substantially.\u201d See <em>Parsons v County of Del Norte, </em>728 F2d 1234, 1237 (CA 9, 1984), <em>cert den \u2014 </em>US \u2014; 105 S Ct 158; 83 L Ed 2d 95 (1984); <em>Cutts v Fowler, </em>223 US App DC 414, 417; 692 F2d 138 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">We turn to the argument that the instant antinepotism policies are discriminatory <em>as applied </em>to Miller and Lowry. A facially neutral employment practice can operate as a mask or pretext for impermissible discrimination. Thus our decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>that the instant policies are <em>facially </em>neutral concerning the criterion of whether one is married does not preclude a finding that Miller and Lowry were nevertheless discriminated against because of their marital status or for some other impermissible reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Because summary judgments were entered in the instant cases, there are no factual records concerning the application of the antinepotism policies. Therefore, these cases are remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">HI</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">To summarize, the circuit court correctly construed the term \"marital status.\u201d In each case, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b428-8\">Williams, C.J., and Kavanagh, Ryan, Bkickley, Cavanagh, and Boyle, JJ., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b420-7\">The antinepotism policies at issue in the instant cases, which facially are applicable to several familial relationships, must be distinguished from \"no-spouse rules\u201d which apply to married couples only.
