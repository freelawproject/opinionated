Boscaglia worked for Michigan Bell Telephone Company from September 24, 1953, until August 11, 1977. By October 1, 1972, she had been promoted to the position of supply foreman. In May, 1976, Boscaglia refused to accept a lateral transfer to Detroit, and in June, 1976, she was demoted. Boscaglia alleges that her demotion was the result of sex discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Various employment problems allegedly arose after her demotion. On August 7, 1977, a male supervisor accused Boscaglia of coming to work late. Boscaglia broke down completely, leaving in tears and ultimately receiving psychiatric treatment. She has not returned to work for Michigan Bell.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">On April 26, 1978, Boscaglia filed an action against Michigan Bell and three supervisors alleg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>ing violations of both the FEPA and the civil rights act. During the pendency of this action, on April 30, 1979, Boscaglia filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits; on April 29, 1981, she was awarded benefits of $127 per week for mental and emotional disability for a period beginning August 11, 1977, and continuing until further order of the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Disability Compensation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Frederick Pacheco, Jr., was hired as a security guard by General Motors Corporation on November 3, 1953. The complaint, which names General Motors and two supervisors as defendants, alleges various acts of discrimination, during 1974 and 1975, against Pacheco because of his Spanish-American heritage, including a suspension and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>demotion in late 1974, a discharge on April 29, 1975 (which was reversed on June 2, 1975), and various acts of derision and harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-3\">The parties have stipulated that from November 29, 1974 through April 11, 1975, and again from July 8, 1975 through October 13, 1975, Pacheco was on approved medical disability leave for which he was paid sickness and accident benefits by a third-party insurance carrier under the General Motors Group Insurance Plan.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6*Pacheco alleges that he was disabled as a result of hypertension and anxiety caused by the discrimination against him. Pacheco did not file a workers\u2019 compensation claim in connection with the alleged acts of discrimination.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The exclusive remedy provision of the workers\u2019 compensation act provides that \"the right to the recovery of benefits as provided in this act shall be the employee\u2019s exclusive remedy against the employer.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> *****7</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The FEPA, enacted in 1955, declared that the opportunity to obtain employment without discrimination because of race, color, religion, national origin, or ancestry is a civil right,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and stated a definition of an \"unfair employment practice.\u201d<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number><footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 9 In <em>Pompey v General Motors Corp, </em>385 Mich 537, 560; 189 NW2d 243 (1971), this Court declared that an employee \"can maintain a civil damage action for redress of his statutorily created right to be free from [racial] discrimination in private employment, and that this remedy may be pursued in addition to the remedial machinery provided by [the FEPA].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-3\">The civil rights act, enacted in 1976, prohibits an employer from discriminating against a person on the basis of religion, race, color, national origin, age, sex, height, weight, or marital status.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The act extended \"this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pompey </em>by expressly providing for direct access to circuit court for an aggrieved party.\u201d <em>Holmes v Haughton Elevator Co, </em>404 Mich 36, 44; 272 NW2d 550 (1978) (Moody, J., <em>concurring). </em>This \"direct access\u201d provision states that a person alleging a violation of the act may bring a civil action for appropriate injunctive relief \"or damages, or both,\u201d and that the term \"damages\u201d means \"damages for injury or loss caused by each violation of this act, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The evils at which the civil rights acts are aimed are different from those at which the workers\u2019 compensation act is directed. The workers\u2019 compensation act guards against the victims of industrial injuries being \"turned away empty handed\u201d and \"unrecompensed\u201d as a result of common-law tort doctrines such as contributory negligence and the fellow-servant rule. <em>Crilly v Ballou, </em>353 Mich <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>303, 307-308; 91 NW2d 493 (1958). The civil rights acts are addressed to \"the prejudices and biases\u201d one race, sex, or religion bears against another. <em>Freeman v Kelvinator, Inc, </em>469 F Supp 999, 1000 (ED Mich, 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">In <em>Mathis v Interstate Motor Freight System, </em>408 Mich 164, 179; 289 NW2d 708 (1980), the Court noted that \"[t]he Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act (WDCA) and the no-fault insurance act are complete and self-contained legislative schemes addressing discrete problems. Neither act refers expressly to the other.\u201d In <em>Perez v State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins Co, </em>418 Mich 634, 650; 344 NW2d 773 (1984), the plurality opinion added that \"neither [statutory] scheme should be permitted to frustrate the purposes and objectives of the other [statutory] scheme.\u201d Just as the Court in <em>Mathis, supra, </em>p 183, held that an employee is not barred by the exclusive remedy provision from obtaining no-fault benefits for injuries sustained while occupying a motor vehicle owned by his employer, so too an employee is not barred by the exclusive remedy provision from invoking the civil rights acts to recover for injuries resulting from discrimination by his employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">The question whether physical, mental, and emotional injuries are compensable under the FEPA or the civil rights act has not been briefed or argued, and . hence we intimate no opinion in that regard. We think it self-evident, however, assuming the Legislature in enacting the civil rights acts intended to provide compensation for physical, mental, or emotional injury resulting from discrimination, that it did not intend that that objective would be defeated by the bar of the exclusive remedy provision of the workers\u2019 compensation act.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Whatever may have been the intention of the Legislature in enacting the exclusive remedy provision of the workers\u2019 compensation act, if it intended in enacting civil rights legislation that workers discharged in violation of such legislation could recover for resulting physical, mental, or emotional injury that intention would necessarily supersede or modify the scope of other legislation that otherwise would defeat the intent to permit such recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-3\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">Defendants in <em>Pacheco </em>argue that even if the exclusive remedy provision does not bar the express \"direct access\u201d cause of action statutorily created by the civil rights act, it should nevertheless apply to a civil action for violation of the FEPA recognized in <em>Pompey.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">We read <em>Pompey </em>as holding that the Legislature intended a cumulative judicial remedy for an employer\u2019s violation of the FEPA. \"[T]he question whether a statute creates a private right of action is ultimately 'one of [legislative] intent, not one of whether this Court thinks that it can improve upon the statutory scheme that [the Legislature] enacted into law * * *.\u201d\u2019 <em>Universities Research </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number><em>Ass\u2019n, Inc v Coutu, </em>450 US 754, 770; 101 S Ct 1451; 67 L Ed 2d 662 (1981) (quoting <em>Touche Ross &amp; Co v Redington, </em>442 US 560, 578; 99 S Ct 2479; 61 L Ed 2d 82 [1979]). Thus the only difference in the legislative intent respecting a civil action for violations of the FEPA and the civil rights act is the specificity with which it was expressed. The source of the right to be free from employment discrimination under the FEPA is statutory, just as it is under the civil rights act.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">We reject the distinction drawn in <em>Stimson v Bell Telephone Co, </em>77 Mich App 361; 258 NW2d 227 (1977),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> between disabling and nondisabling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>injuries. The bar of the exclusive remedy provision of the workers\u2019 compensation act does not depend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>on whether the worker suffered a compensable disabling injury. An injury may fall within the bar of the exclusive remedy provision, precluding a damage action, although the injury is not disabling and hence not compensable at all. See 2A Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, \u00a7\u00a7 65.40-65.52, pp 12-25 to 12-41.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The <em>Stimson </em>distinction would yield anomalous results. Where employment discrimination causes injuries that are not so severe as to culminate in disability, the injured employee would be permitted to sue his employer in tort and recover full damages; however, where the injuries suffered are so severe as to culminate in disability, the injured employee would be restricted to the recovery of workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Defendants in <em>Pacheco </em>contend that the applicability of the exclusive remedy provision to any particular employment discrimination action is a question that, as a jurisdictional matter, can only be answered by the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Disability Compensation. The Michigan Constitution, however, provides that \"[t]he circuit court shall have original jurisdiction in all matters not prohibited by law * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Our holding that the exclusive remedy provision does not bar an employment discrimination action seeking recovery for physical, mental, or emotional injuries requires the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>conclusion that the workers\u2019 compensation act does not prohibit the circuit court from exercising original jurisdiction in employment discrimination actions.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">\"[P]rior to the passing of [the FEPA] in 1955, there was in Michigan no recognized legal remedy for acts of discrimi\u00f1ation * * * in private employment.\u201d <em>Pompey v General Motors Corp, supra, </em>p 552. The common law did not provide a remedy either to an employee who claimed to be a victim of employment discrimination or to an employee\u2019s spouse who claimed to have suffered injury to the marital relationship as a result , of the discrimination against the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">In 1955, the FEPA declared the right to be free from discrimination in private employment to be a civil right entitled to protection of the law and provided, for the first time, a remedy to an employee who claimed to be a victim of discrimina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>tion. The statute did not, however, provide a remedy to the employee\u2019s spouse for loss of consortium or injury to the marital relationship. Nor did <em>Pompey, supra, </em>which held that the Legislature also intended to create a cumulative judicial remedy for the employee, suggest that the Legislature intended to create a derivative cause of action for the employee\u2019s spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Section 7(b) of the FEPA provided that \"[a]ny individual <em>claiming to be aggrieved </em>by an alleged unlawful employment practice may * * * make, sign and file with the board * * * a verified complaint in writing * * *\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Section 7(h) then provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-6\">\"If, upon the preponderance of the evidence on the record considered as a whole, the [fair employment practices] commission shall determine that the respondent has engaged in or is engaging in any unfair employment practice, the commission shall state its findings of fact and shall issue and cause to be served on such respondent an order requiring such respondent to cease and desist from such unfair employment practice and to take such further aifirmative or other action as will effectuate the purposes of this act, including but not limited to, hiring, reinstatement or upgrading of employees with or without back pay, or admission or restoration to union membership, including a requirement for reports of the manner of compliance.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">We agree with the conclusions of New York courts that an employee\u2019s spouse is not a person \"aggrieved\u201d within the meaning of the civil rights act. <em>Hart v Sullivan, </em>84 AD2d 865, 866; 445 NYS2d 40 (1981), <em>aff'd </em>55 NY2d 1011; 449 NYS2d 481; 434 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>NE2d 717 (1982).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We also note that the language of \u00a7 7(h) of the FEPA is similar to that of Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and that it has been held that Title VII does not provide a derivative cause of action to an employee\u2019s spouse. <em>Torres v Claytor, 25 </em>FEP Cases 998 (SD Cal, 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-3\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">Cynthia Pacheco argues that she possessed a preexisting common-law loss of consortium action that was triggered when the Legislature granted statutory protection to the right to be free from employment discrimination. Our attention has been directed to <em>Washington v Jones, </em>386 Mich 466; 192 NW2d 234 (1971). In that case, plaintiff brought an action for loss of consortium against the owner and driver of the automobile in which her husband was riding as a guest when he was injured. The action alleged gross negligence because the Civil Liability Act then in force provided that a guest could only maintain an action against the owner or operator of the vehicle in which he was riding if the owner or operator committed \u201d gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct.\u201d<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number><footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The Court assumed that there was an action for loss of consortium although it dismissed the case for insufficiency in the evidence. <em>Id., </em>pp 472-473. At common law, however, a guest injured in an automobile accident could recover against a host for ordinary negligence. <em>Roy v Kirn, </em>208 Mich 571; 175 NW 475 (1919); <em>Eskovitz v Berger, </em>276 Mich 536; 268 NW 883 (1936). <em>Washington v Jones </em>holds simply that by limiting the preexisting common-law right of a guest to recover in tort to cases of gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct, the Legislature did not alter a spouse\u2019s common-law action for loss of consortium resulting from the automobile accident.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The question once again is one of legislative intent. Absent a legislative intent to provide such a derivative cause of action, the spouse of a person subjected to discrimination does not have a right of recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">In <em>Boscaglia, </em>the cause is remanded to the trial court for consideration of Boscaglia\u2019s motion to reinstate her claims for emotional injuries and future wages,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and further proceedings consistent with this opinion._</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>In <em>Pacheco, </em>the decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b387-5\">Williams, C.J., and Kavanagh, Ryan, Brickley, Cavanagh, and Boyle, JJ., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b373-9\"> MCL 418.131; MSA 17.237(131).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b373-10\"> MCL 423.301 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 17.458(1) <em>et seq., </em>repealed by 1976 PA 453 and replaced by the Michigan civil rights act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b373-11\"> MCL 37.2101 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 3.548(101) <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b374-6\"><em> </em>On September 25, 1979, defendants filed a motion for partial summary judgment and accelerated judgment with respect to Boscaglia\u2019s claims in her second amended complaint for emotional injury <em>(e.g., </em>nervousness, depression, mental anxiety) and loss of future wages due to the resultant inability to continue active employment. On December 4, 1980, the circuit judge granted defendants\u2019 motion \"because such claims are barred by the exclusive-remedy provision of the Workers\u2019 Disability Compensation Act.\u201d When Boscaglia again sought to recover for emotional injury and resultant loss of future wages in her third amended complaint, the circuit judge granted another motion for partial accelerated judgment because \"[plaintiffs damage claims for emotional injury and the incidental future wage loss * * * are not within the subject-matter jurisdiction of the circuit court. * * * [T]he exclusive remedy is under the [workers\u2019 compensation] act before the Bureau * *</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">On September 21, 1981, the Court of Appeals issued its decision in <em>Pacheco v Clifton, </em>109 Mich App 563, 574; 311 NW2d 801 (1981), stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">\"[T]hose damages which allegedly resulted from the alleged unlawful discrimination by defendants, particularly those resulting from humiliation, embarrassment, loss of consortium,' and lost wages, are compensable in circuit court and should not be barred by the exclusivity clause of [the workers\u2019.compensation act].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">Contending that this holding was relevant to her case, Boscaglia filed a motion to reinstate her claims for emotional injury and future wages.

He sought to recover for physical and mental injuries allegedly resulting from the discrimination against him. Pacheco alleges that as a result of the discrimination against him, he has suffered moderately severe renin; essential hypertension; malignant hypertension; paroxysmal supraventicular tachycardia; extreme manifest anxiety; situational anxiety reaction; emotional distress; abnormal activity of the sympathetic nervous system; traumatic or situational neurosis; loss of former job pleasure; loss of consortium; and great pain and suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">In the same complaint, his wife Cynthia sought to recover for various physical and mental injuries and loss of consortium that she allegedly suffered as a result of the discrimination against her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing: 1) that the exclusive remedy provision of the workers\u2019 compensation act denied the circuit court jurisdiction over Pacheco\u2019s claim for personal injuries (defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment did not challenge the jurisdiction of the circuit court to consider Pacheco\u2019s separate claim for wages lost as a result of the allegedly discriminatory suspension and demotion), and 2) that Cynthia Pacheco lacked standing to sue under the PEPA. The circuit judge denied defendants\u2019 motion, but certified the two issues as controlling questions of law for interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">On September 21, 1981, the Court of Appeals affirmed the ruling of the trial court that the exclusive remedy provision of the workers\u2019 compensation act did not bar the Pachecos\u2019 suit:</p>\n<p id=\"Ar6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>\"To the extent Mr. Pacheco suffered periods of physical disability, the WDCA is his exclusive remedy. * * * It would appear, however, that this question is moot since the stipulation of facts indicate that during his periods of medical disability Mr. Pacheco was paid benefits by a third-party insurance carrier under the General Motors group insurance plan. Further, we ar.e of the opinion that those damages which allegedly resulted from the alleged unlawful discrimination by defendants, particularly those resulting from humiliation, embarrassment, loss of consortium, and lost wages, are compensable in circuit court- and should not be barred by the exclusivity clause of WDCA. This is true not only of those injuries occurring <em>prior </em>to plaintiff\u2019s disability but also as to those occurring <em>after </em>his disability.\u201d <em>Pacheco v Clifton, supra, </em>pp 574-575 (emphasis in the original).</p>\n<p id=\"ATH\">The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s ruling with respect to Mrs. Pacheco\u2019s claim, holding that \"the Legislature did not intend that the spouse of a victim of discrimination has standing to sue under the statute in question [the FEPA] for damages resulting to her from that discrimination.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 577.

Although the Court did not explicitly address the question of exclusivity when an injury is suffered which does not culminate in disability, the <em>Stimson </em>opinion suggests that exclusivity would not apply. See <em>Freeman </em>v <em>Kelvinator, Inc, supra, </em>p 1002.</p>\n<p id=\"AEx\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>The Court of Appeals seems to have based its conclusion on a misreading of the argument in 2 A Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, \u00a7\u00a7 68.30-68.34, pp 13-39 to 13-81. In his discussion of nonphysical intentional torts committed against an employee <em>(e.g., </em>employment discrimination, false imprisonment, intentional infliction of emotional distress), Professor Larson notes that when no physical injury has been suffered, and thus \"[w]hen no compensation remedy is available, these tort actions fall squarely within the broad class of cases * * * which do not come within the fundamental coverage pattern of the Act at all * * <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 68.30, p 13-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Yet he adds:</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">\"[T]he matter is complicated by the fact that occasionally a tort of this type will become intertwined with a compensable injury in some way. The question then becomes a closer one. It is not whether the tort action will lie when no workmen\u2019s compensation claim is possible, but whether a tort action will lie when a compensation claim is also possible, and indeed may have been filed and granted.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">With respect to this more \"complicated\u201d situation of a nonphysical intentional tort resulting in a physical injury, Professor Larson concludes:</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">\"If the essence of the tort, in law, is non-physical, and if the injuries are of the usual non-physical sort, with physical injury being at most added to the list of injuries as a make-weight, the suit should not be barred. But if the essence of the action is recovery for physical injury or death, the action should be barred even if it can be cast in the form of a normally non-physical tort.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 68.34(a), pp 13-62 to 13-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">Thus the Court in <em>Stimson </em>transformed Professor Larson\u2019s distinction between injuries that are physical (exclusive remedy provision applies) and those that are not physical (exclusive remedy provision does not apply) into a distinction between injuries \u2014 physical or not physical \u2014 that are disabling (exclusive remedy provision applies) and those that are not disabling (exclusive remedy provision presumably does not apply).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">Since Professor Larson\u2019s argument focused on nonphysical intentional torts generally, in most of which the source of the right involved is the common law rather than statute, his discussion is not applicable to employment discrimination cases in which the source of the right to be free from employment discrimination is statutory.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">We express no view regarding the merits of Professor Larson\u2019s thesis as applied to other nonphysical intentional torts.
