(\u201cAppellants\u201d). In August 2006, Appellants<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> removed the personal injury action to federal district court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. After removal to the district court, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding Robert Lafita, a resident of Florida, as a plaintiff, and Ely\u2019s Tire, Inc., a Florida corporation, as a defendant. Finding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because there was no longer complete diversity among the parties, the district court remanded the case to state court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(e).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellants now appeal the district court\u2019s order remanding the case to state court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-12\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d), an order remanding an action to state court pursuant to \u00a7 1447(c) is not reviewable on appeal. <em>See Thermtron Prods., Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, </em>423 U.S. 336, 342-43, 96 S.Ct. 584, 589, 46 L.Ed.2d 542 (1976) (holding that \u00a7 1447(d) precludes review only of those remand orders issued pursuant to \u00a7 1447(c)). In <em>Poore v. American-Amicable Life Insurance Co., </em>218 F.3d 1287 (11th Cir.2000), this Court held that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d)\u2019s bar to appellate review of a district court\u2019s remand to state court pursuant to \u00a7 1447(c) did not apply where subject matter jurisdiction existed <em>at the time of removal </em>and the district court based its remand on a plaintiffs <em>post-removal </em>amendment to the complaint.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-13\">Appellants argue that under our prior interpretation of \u00a7 1447(c) in <em>Poore, </em>a district court\u2019s order remanding a case to state court (pursuant to either \u00a7 1447(c) or \u00a7 1447(e)) based on a post-removal amendment to the complaint is reviewable if the case was properly removed in the first instance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, the Supreme Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>recent decision in <em>Powerex Corp. v. Reliant Energy Services Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2411, 168 L.Ed.2d 112 (2007), requires us to revisit our prior interpretation of \u00a7 1447(c). In <em>Powerex, </em>the Supreme Court held that when a district court remands a properly removed case because it nonetheless determines post-removal that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the remand is covered by \u00a7 1447(c) and thus is shielded from appellate review by \u00a7 1447(d). Therefore, <em>Poore </em>is overruled to the extent we held that a remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 1447(c) is reviewable if it is based on a post-removal amendment to the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Powerex, </em>a remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under \u00a7 1447(e), which arises post-removal, and a remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under \u00a7 1447(c), which may arise at the time of removal or post-removal, are indistinguishable for purposes of determining whether \u00a7 1447(d)\u2019s bar to appellate review applies. If at any time before final judgment the district court issues an order remanding a case to state court because it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, that order is not reviewable. Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b662-8\">. Sears Roebuck and Co. and Ford Motor Co. filed the notice of removal with the consent of Uniroyal Tire Co.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b662-9\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(e) states that \u201d[i]f after removal the plaintiff seeks to join additional defendants whose joinder would destroy subject matter jurisdiction, the court may deny joinder, or permit joinder and remand the action to the State court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b662-10\">. On March 16, 2007, the district court <em>sua sponte </em>entered an order dismissing the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Plaintiffs filed a motion for clarification, arguing that the case should be remanded to state court rather than dismissed. On April 17, 2007, the district court granted the motion and issued a final order remanding the case to state court. We do not believe, and Appellants have not argued, that the district court\u2019s two orders issued for the single purpose of finding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction constitute separate orders, the former of which is reviewable and the latter of which is not under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Waco v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>293 U.S. 140, 55 S.Ct. 6, 79 L.Ed. 244 (1934).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b662-15\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d) states that \"[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise, except that an order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed pursuant to section 1443 of this title shall be reviewable by appeal or otherwise.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b662-16\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c) provides in part: If at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the case shall be remanded.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
