His petition for habeas corpus, which was treated by the district court as a motion to vacate sentence under Title 28 U.S.C.A. 2255, was denied, and he appeals. His privilege against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment was not violated. The privilege falls in the face of the immunity statute, which is constitutional. Reina v. United States, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>364 U.S. 507, 81 S.Ct. 260, 5 L.Ed.2d 249 (1960); Piemonte v. United States, 367 U.S. 556, 81 S.Ct. 1720, 6 L.Ed.2d 1028 (1961); cf. Murphy v. Waterfront Comm., 378 U.S. 52, 84 S.Ct. 1594, 12 L.Ed.2d 678 (1964). The recent case of Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 84 S.Ct. 1489, 12 L.Ed.2d 653, relied upon by appellant, is inapposite. It was concerned with a state prosecution and did not involve a promise of immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
