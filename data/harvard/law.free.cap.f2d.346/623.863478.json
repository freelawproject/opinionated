David Crystal, Inc., opposes on prior registrations of \u201cFoggers\u201d and \u201cBritish Foggers\u201d for ladies\u2019 and misses\u2019 dresses, coats, dress and jacket ensembles, suits, blouses, slacks, coveralls and jumpers. In dismissing the opposition the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-28\">Applicant\u2019s mark \u201cFog Cutters\u201d and opposer\u2019s marks \u201cFoggers\u201d and \u201cBritish Foggers\u201d manifestly differ substantially in both appearance and sound, and they convey distinctly different commercial impressions. In view thereof, it is our opinion that there is no reasonable likelihood of purchaser confusion, mistake or deception.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-30\">No testimony was taken regarding channels of trade, quality or prices of the competing goods, the parties merely submitting on the record and briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-31\">We agree with the board\u2019s assumption that the goods are of such nature as to be made by a single manufacturer and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>probably sold through the same trade channels. We also agree that application of the competing marks to the respective goods would not result in any likelihood of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\"> Here, as in all such cases, the competing marks have <em>something </em>in common, else there would be no contest. In this instance, opposer dissects his allegedly arbitrary mark \u201cFoggers\u201d into \u201cfog\u201d and \u201cer\u201d in an attempt to establish confusion. We do not think purchasers would be prone to follow that course when the marks are viewed as a whole, as they must be. The fact that applicant\u2019s mark is applied to <em>mens\u2019 </em>apparel, and opposer\u2019s mark to <em>ladies\u2019 </em>garments, goods presumably bought with some degree of care, provides additional reason in support of the board\u2019s holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">RICH and SMITH, JJ., dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
