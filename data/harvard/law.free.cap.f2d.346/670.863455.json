Its last payments of the withholding and social security taxes withheld from its employees were for the first two quarters of 1959. On January 11, 1963, a penalty assessment pursuant to section 6672 was made against the appellant in the amount of $15,335.31, representing the employees\u2019 portion of the social security taxes and the employees\u2019 income taxes withheld for the third and fourth quarters of 1959 and the first and second quarters of 1960. The appellant paid $114.55, an amount sufficient to cover the penalty for the third quarter of 1959 applicable to one employee and then filed a claim for a refund of the amount paid. The claim was disallowed and appellant filed suit against the Director. The United States intervened and filed its complaint in intervention against the appellant for the amount of the penalty assessment less the $114.55 and less the sum of $621.35 obtained by administrative levy. After trial, the district court entered its findings of fact and conclusions of law and rendered judgment against the appellant in the principal amount of $13,385.27, plus interest. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">The appellant was president, chairman of the board and general manager of the corporation from its inception in 1958 until its demise in 1960. He signed the corporation\u2019s quarterly tax returns for each of the four quarters for which the taxes were not paid. He testified that until January 22, 1960, he was not aware that those returns were forwarded without payment of the taxes shown to be due.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">There was ample evidence to support the district court\u2019s finding that the appellant was the responsible officer of Casco whose duty it was to collect, account for and pay over its withholding and social security taxes. Among other such evidence, Casco\u2019s bookkeeper testified that when the appellant was in the office he had \u201cthe final say as to what checks would be prepared, for who and in what amount.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">Corporate funds were deposited into the personal bank account of the appellant as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgJ\">\u201c1959</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APu\">\u201cFebruary $ 1,264.59</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVH\">November 65,206.73</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6M\">December 90,680.11</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_g\">\u201c1960</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6u\">\u201cJanuary 34,296.41</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6B\">February 16,537.55</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIN\">March 21,794.97</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Abz\">April 20,935.98</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADi\">May 10,289.65</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZKq\">June 15,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3X\">October 15,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-9\">TOTAL $291,005.99\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">The appellant used those funds to pay corporate creditors other than the government. From all of the evidence we cannot say that the district court was clearly erroneous in finding that \u201cthe plaintiff [appellant] was at all times aware of the financial condition of the corporation and knew at all times that the withholding and social security taxes withheld from the employees for the quarters involved herein had not been paid to the Government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-11\">The appellant insists, however, that his failure to pay the taxes was not willful because it was premised upon reasonable cause. Construing this statute in Frazier v. United States, 5 Cir. 1962, 304 F.2d 528, 531, we held that \u201cwithout reasonable cause\u201d is part of the civil test in determining whether the failure to pay was willful. See also Dillard v. Patterson, 5 Cir. 1963, 326 F.2d 302, 304, 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-12\">Approximately seventy per cent of Casco\u2019s total sales were to Bunge Corporation of New York. The first National Bank in Dallas advised Bunge that it was the assignee of Bunge\u2019s accounts payable to Casco. Casco denied that the Bank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>held any such assignment. On January 6, 1960, Bunge deposited in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas $74,912.20 which it claimed to be the total sum owed to Casco. Casco\u2019s accountant and its attorney advised the appellant that the government had a prior lien on this fund. Significantly, however, neither of them advised the appellant not to pay the taxes as they became due. The government revenue agent was advised of this fund and of the government\u2019s apparent priority. The government ultimately elected not to file a claim and the fund was distributed to Casco\u2019s creditors other than the government. See Casco Chemical v. Superintendence Co., 5 Cir. 1964, 335 F.2d 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">The government was not required to look to the Bunge fund for the payment of its taxes. It at no time assured the appellant that it would do so. We agree with the district court that the appellant\u2019s assumption that the government would get its taxes out of the Bunge fund did not furnish reasonable cause for the appellant\u2019s failure to pay the taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Finally, appellant seeks to go beyond \u201cthe sole question\u201d quoted from its brief at the outset of this opinion, and makes what appears to us to be a halfhearted attack upon the constitutionality of section 6672, that it is a non-uniform, direct tax in violation of art. 1, \u00a7 2, cl. 3, \u00a7 8, cl. 1, and \u00a7 9, cl. 4 of the Constitution. We do not find where any such contention was made in the district court. Assuming that it can be made on appeal for the first time, it does not appear to have enough substance to require discussion and decision. As was said in Dillard v. Patterson, 5 Cir. 1963, 326 F.2d 302, 304: \u201cUnless the Government has recourse for collection of the tax from the employer or the responsible agent of the employer, the tax is lost.\u201d The statute seems clearly a valid measure imposing upon the responsible agent civil liability for failure to collect or pay over the taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Finding no reversible error in the record, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b721-11\">. The reference is to section 6672 of Title 26 U.S.Code, in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-12\">\u201c\u00a7 6672. <em>Failure to collect and pay over tax, or attempt to evade or defeat tax</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-13\">\u201cAny person required to collect, truthfully account for, and pay over any tax imposed by this title who willfully fails to collect such tax, or truthfully account for and pay over such tax, or willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any such tax or the payment thereof,, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be liable to a penalty equal to the total amount of the tax evaded, or-not collected, or not accounted for and paid over.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b722-13\">.
