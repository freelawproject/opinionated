He contends that in many respects the United States has failed to establish guilt of the crime charged; that the facts proved, together with rational inferences therefrom, are wholly consistent with innocence of all crime; and of innocence of having <em>engaged in the business </em>of accepting wagers; and of <em>accepting </em>wagers (as a principal) as distinguished from merely receiving them (as a runner).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In his brief appellant characterizes the Government\u2019s case as \u201calmost a preposterously thin case.\u201d We are forced to agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">Proof is limited to two contacts with appellant by Agent Harris of the Internal Revenue Department, at the El Jay Ray bar in Phoenix, Arizona.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">1. On May 24, 1963, as Harris testified, he went to the bar in an effort to meet appellant whom he was \u201cinvestigating\u201d in some unspecified respect. He arrived at 12:10 P.M., had lunch, talked with the bartender and struck up a conversation with two other patrons, Carroll and Hale. They discussed horse racing until about 3:30, when appellant arrived at the bar. Harris was introduced to appellant by Carroll. Carroll and appellant conversed briefly, then left the bar for about five minutes. On their return Carroll seated himself at the bar next to Harris. Appellant stood at the bar on the other side of Carroll. Carroll then produced a $100 bill, laid it on the bar and announced: \u201cI\u2019ll go 50-50 on Daysie Dawn.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant looked at his watch, took the money and put it in his pocket. Harris then announced: \u201cI\u2019ll go 20-20 on Daysie Dawn.\u201d He took a $20 bill and two $10 bills from his pocket, laid them on the bar in front of Carroll. Appellant reached over, took the money, pocketed it and left the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-15\">2. On May 25, the following day, Harris returned to the bar to find appellant, Hale and several others there. Everyone was discussing horse racing. Harris had a racing form with him. He gave it to appellant, who studied it. It was passed around to others, who studied it. Appellant asked if he could have it, and Harris agreed. Harris placed a bet this time with Hale.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-16\">This was the extent of Harris\u2019 testimony. This was the extent of the Government\u2019s case. To find guilt the Government must cumulate a series of inferences: (1) that the bet was not a social bar-room bet; (2) that appellant was a professional. gambler; (3) that in his profession he was a principal. Each of the necessary inferences was, however, subject to a contrary inference which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>was, in our judgment on this meager record, equally rational. In our judgment this does not measure up to the Government\u2019s burden of proof. It was error to deny appellant\u2019s motion for acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-11\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4401(c) requires that \u201c[e]ach person who is engaged in the business of accepting wagers\u201d shall pay tax on all wagers made with him. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4412(a) requires all persons subject to such tax to register with the official in charge of the Internal Revenue District. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7203 and 7262, make it a crime to fail to pay tax or register when required.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b188-18\">. \u00a7 4411 imposes a tax on \u201ceach person who is liable for tax under section 4401 or who is engaged in receiving wagers for or on behalf of any person so liable.\u201d Appellant was charged in the information with engaging in the business of accepting wagers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b188-19\">.
