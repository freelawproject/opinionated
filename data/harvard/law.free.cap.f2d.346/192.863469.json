Thornton, conducted a hearing on the Secretary\u2019s Petition to Compel Respondents to Testify, and rendered an opinion which is published at 235 F. Supp. 913.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">The district court ordered respondents to appear before the Department\u2019s representative and \u201cthere fully testify and answer all questions propounded as required by the subpoenas ad testificandum duly issued and previously served upon them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">When respondents continued in their refusal to testify, an application was filed for adjudication of contempt, and an order was entered adjudging the respondents guilty of contempt of court and remanding them to the custody of the United States Marshal for a maximum of sixty days, \u201cunless they shall sooner purge themselves of this contempt.\u201d Execution of the contempt order was stayed pending determination of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">It is argued in this court that the district court erred in holding that appellants effectively have been granted immunity from both federal and state prosecution.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-11\">On this point the district court said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AU_\">\u201cAny support for the position of respondents in relation to the self-incrimination claim that may have heretofore existed has been, in our opinion, abrogated by two recent decisions of the United States Supreme Court. They are Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 84 S.Ct. 1489, 12 L.Ed.2d 653, and Murphy v. Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor, 378 U.S. 52, 84 S.Ct. 1594, 12 L.Ed.2d 678. We deem these to be not only directly applicable here but controlling.\u201d 235 F. Supp. at 915.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-13\">In Murphy v. Waterfront Commission, 378 U.S. 52, 77-78, 84 S.Ct. 1594, 1609, 12 L.Ed.2d 678, the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-14\">\u201cWe hold that the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination protects a state witness against incrimination under federal as well as state law and a federal witness against incrimination under state as well as federal law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-15\">As said by this court in United States v. Earl Coplon, 6 Cir., 339 F.2d 192, 193:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-16\">\u201cWe find appellant\u2019s contention as to self-incrimination to be completely without merit. He clearly will be immune from both federal and state prosecution. His immunity is co<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>extensive with his constitutional privilege not to incriminate himself. Murphy v. Waterfront Commission, 378 U.S. 52, 79, 84 S.Ct. 1594, 12 L.Ed.2d 678; Brown v. United States, 359 U.S. 41, 79 S.Ct. 539, 3 L.Ed.2d 609; United States v. Harris, 334 F.2d 460 (C.A.2); United States v. Testa, 326 F.2d 730 (C.A.3), cert. denied, 376 U.S. 931, 84 S.Ct. 701, 11 L.Ed.2d 652; Marcus v. United States, 310 F.2d 143 (C.A.3), cert. denied, 372 U.S. 944, 83 S.Ct. 933, 9 L.Ed.2d 969.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">In Coplon this court construed the grant of immunity contained in the Federal Communications Act. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 409(1). In the present case the grant of immunity is set forth in the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 49,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which is made applicable to the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Procedure Act of 1959 by 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 521.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Respondents-appellants contend that the grant of immunity made in the Federal Trade Commission Act is not as broad as that contained in the Federal Communications Act, and point out that neither of these acts contains the words \u201cin any court\u201d which appears in the Narcotics Control Act of 1956, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">We hold that the grant of immunity set forth in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 49, like 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 409(1), when implemented by an order of the district court as has been done in the present case, is coextensive with the constitutional privilege of appellants not <em>to </em>incriminate themselves, and protects appellants from both state and federal prosecution with respect to the matters concerning which they have been ordered by the district court to testify. Ahlers v. United States, 336 F.2d 191 (C.A.2), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 963, 85 S.Ct. 654, 13 L.Ed.2d 558.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b244-7\">. \u201cNo person shall be excused from attending and testifying or from producing documentary evidence before the commission or in obedience to the subpoena of the commission on the ground or for the reason that the testimony or evidence, documentary or otherwise, required of him may tend to criminate him or subject him to a penalty or forfeiture. But no natural person shall be prosecuted or subjected to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter, or thing concerning which he may testify, or produce evidence, documentary or otherwise, before the commission in obedience to a subpoena issued by it: <em>Provided, </em>That no natural person so testifying shall be exempt from prosecution and punishment for perjury committed in so testifying.
