The court set aside the Secretary\u2019s finding that appellee was not disabled within the meaning of 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 416(i) and 423(c) (2) on the ground that it was not supported by substantial evidence and concluded that there was substantial evidence in the record of a medically determinable impairment which rendered her unable to engage in substantial gainful activity. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-21\">There was ample positive proof of disability in the testimony of appellee\u2019s personal physician, Dr. Allin, that she was suffering from a severe case of angina pectoris which was precipitated by mild physical exertion. This testimony was bolstered by the uncontradicted statements of laymen that appellee was experiencing pain and shortness of breath. On the other hand, the reports of the physicians on which the Secretary relied were of a purely negative nature and their findings were inconclusive. These doctors did not dispute the correctness of Dr. Allin\u2019s diagnosis, but merely stated that their limited examination of appellee did not reveal the existence of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>disabling condition. In these circumstances, we cannot say the Secretary\u2019s conclusions were supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
