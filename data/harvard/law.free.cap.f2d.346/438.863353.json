(1946 ed.) \u00a7 801(e).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed this decision in all respects and dismissed Tanaka\u2019s appeal on November 23, 1960. On December 20, 1960 Tanaka brought a declaratory judgment action to review the order of deportation in the Southern District of New York and on July 23, 1962, the district court transferred the action to this court under the judicial review provisions of \u00a7 106 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a, which became law on October 26, 1961. Act of September 26, 1961, 75 Stat. 651, 8 U.S.C. (Supp. V, 1959-1963) \u00a7 1105a.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-17\">Under \u00a7 106, a petition for review of a final order of deportation, if it is not frivolous,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> shall first be considered by the court of appeals, and if that court determines, on the basis of the administrative record, that there exists a genuine issue of material fact, the proceedings are to be transferred to the district court. However, if the record leaves no factual issues to be resolved, the court of appeals is required to pass upon the issues presented in the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-18\">On the record made before the Special Inquiry Officer, we find that no question of material fact is left unresolved and there is no need for proceedings before the district court. Reaching the merits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>of Tanaka\u2019s petition, we find that the circumstances surrounding his voting in 1950 do not constitute duress, and that therefore the Board of Immigration Appeals correctly determined that Tanaka lost his American citizenship by voting in a foreign election.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">The facts, almost all testified to by Tanaka, are not in dispute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Tanaka was born in New York City on March 29, 1923, of parents born in Japan. Thus at birth he was a citizen of the United States as well as of Japan. His mother took him to Japan when he was three years old and he resided there continuously for over 30 years. Tanaka attended Maiji University in Tokoyo for two years. He married a Japanese national in 1954 and his wife and their child are in Japan. He served in the Japanese Army from December 1, 1943 to October 30, 1944, when he was discharged because of illness. The Special Inquiry Officer concluded that this military service did not expatriate him as it was involuntary. See Nishikawa v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 129, 78 S.Ct. 612, 2 L.Ed.2d 659 (1958). Likewise, his employment in a Japanese political subdivision from November 1946 to April 1955 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was held not to have expatriated Tanaka as the Service had not established that this was voluntary or that the position was one for which only Japanese nationals were eligible. After April 1955, he was employed as a newspaper correspondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Tanaka never made any claim in Japan that he was an American citizen until he applied to the United States Consul at Fokuoko, Japan, for a United States passport in 1954. His application was rejected because of his army service and his voting.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">Tanaka entered the United States in February 1957 on a Japanese passport for a three-months\u2019 stay as a non-immigrant newspaper representative. Extensions of his stay were granted until May 1959. Thereafter Tanaka\u2019s departure pursuant to deportation orders was delayed until Congress, in April 1960, rejected a private bill to naturalize him. The deportation proceedings were reopened, on Tanaka\u2019s motion, and his claims that he was a United States citizen and that he had not expatriated himself were considered by the Special Inquiry Officer for the first time.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">Tanaka testified that he first voted in 1946 or 1947 at a national election when elections were first held in Japan after World War II, and at every election thereafter, until 1956, including an election on June 4, 1950.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Tanaka, answering through an interpreter his counsel\u2019s question why he voted in the Japanese elections, said \u201cI participated in the elections because I was afraid of what my neighbors thought if I didn\u2019t.\u201d He said he knew he was \u201cunder a close watch by the police\u201d and that everyone in the community knew he had been born in the United States and that his father was living in the United States; he had to protect himself from suspicion and from possible danger. He also said he never told his neighbors he was an American citizen. In explaining what he meant by being under a \u201cclose watch,\u201d he said, \u201cThey might have thought that I may have some special privilege of some kind or something.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">He testified that he lived in Saiki, a community of about 30,000, and he felt his neighbors were always watching him. Prior to voting the first time he received in the mail a numbered paper from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>city authority where he lived which enabled him to vote. There was no testimony or claim that there was any compulsion to vote or that anyone checked up on those who did not vote, except that elementary school children were sent around to urge the non-voters to vote as the communities in Japan were competing for the highest rate of voting. He had never been threatened with violence by any of his neighbors and had never heard of anyone who had been assaulted solely because he didn\u2019t vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"> It is not open to question that the voluntary act of voting in a foreign election in 1950 results in expatriation under \u00a7 401(e) of the Nationality Act of 1940, the constitutionality of this provision having been expressly affirmed in Perez v. Brownell, 356 U.S. 44, 78 S.Ct. 568, 2 L.Ed.2d 603 (1958). However, no conduct results in expatriation unless it is voluntary. Nishikawa v. Dulles, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\"> Tanaka has shown that he was a United States citizen by reason of his birth. The burden then shifts to the government to prove the act of expatriation \u201cby clear, convincing and unequivocal evidence.\u201d Nishikawa v. Dulles, supra, 356 U.S. at 133, 78 S.Ct. at 615. Tanaka\u2019s admissions that he voted in the 1950 election have discharged the government\u2019s burden. Tanaka is then obligated to come forward and adequately inject the issue of voluntariness. This is the test laid down by the Supreme Court in Nishikawa where it was held that the petitioner had \u201cadequately injected the issue of voluntariness\u201d by showing conscription into the Japanese army in March 1941, under penal sanctions for failure to obey.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">In our view, taking Tanaka\u2019s testimony in the light most favorable to him, we find that he has not adequately injected the issue of involuntariness to require the government to come forward and introduce evidence on that issue. Tanaka was under no compulsion or sanction to vote in the 1950 election. Compare Nishikawa v. Dulles, supra. Fear of what one\u2019s neighbors might think does not supply the kind of involuntariness that the law recognizes or that Congress could possibly have haa in mind. While he testified that there was considerable public sentiment in favor of voting by those who were eligible, he admitted that no official action was ever taken regarding those who did not vote, he never heard of anyone being assaulted in Japan after World War II solely because of failure to vote, and he was on good terms with his neighbors. In short, there was no evidence whatever that he had any reason to fear bodily harm or any form of oppression.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">Other courts in considering whether a petitioner has come forward with enough evidence to put the government to its proof on the issue of involuntariness have required that, in addition to a showing of petitioner\u2019s subjective fear, he also must show some additional circumstances to justify his fear. In Nishikawa v. Dulles, supra, the conscription laws of Japan provided that justification for Nishikawa\u2019s fears. In Doreau v. Marshall, 170 F.2d 721 (3 Cir. 1948), the petitioner, in France during World War II and expecting a child, applied for French citizenship hoping to avoid the very real threat of internment as an American national; this act was found to be involuntary. Matter of G, 8 I. &amp; N. Dec. 317 (1959), relied on by Tanaka, is a case where a dual national of Greece and the United States possessed a mistaken belief that he would be branded a communist and subjected to violence if he did not vote in a Greek election. He was able to show a prevailing mob atmosphere which was adequate to put the government to its proof. In cases involving voting in Japanese elections during the immediate post-war period, petitioners who were successful in maintaining their burden of going forward made a showing of specific pressures or threats. See, e. g., Takehara v. Dulles, 205 F.2d 560 (9 Cir. 1953); Serizawa v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Dulles, 134 F.Supp. 713 (N.D.Calif.1955) and cases cited at 715.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">The petitioner must show something more than his own vague and groundless fears of what his neighbors would have thought had he not voted, especially where there was no basis whatever for believing that they might have applied any coercive measures as a result of his not voting. The act of voting in a foreign election \u2014 in this case a national election \u2014 is such an unequivocal act of expatriation \u2014 and generally so considered \u2014 that it cannot be explained away as being involuntary because of a feeling that one\u2019s neighbors would have disapproved if it had not been done. If this were to be enough to nullify acts of expatriation it would be almost impossible ever to prove that such an act was voluntary. We ought not to emasculate the clear mandate of Congress by the construction which the petitioner urges.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">We find no genuine issue of material fact such as to require transfer to the district court for resolution, and we affirm the order of deportation.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b489-11\">. The Service also found that in any event Tanaka had lost his American citizenship under the presumption of voluntariness of \u00a7 349(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1481(b), <em>(1), </em>by voting in two Japanese elections in April 1953, because of the provisions of \u00a7 349(a) (5), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1481 (a) (5), and (2), by remaining in the employ of a Japanese government political subdivision after December 24, 1952, because of the provisions of \u00a7 349(a) (4), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1481(a) (4). As we are of the opinion that Tanaka lost his American citizenship under \u00a7 401(d) of the Nationality Act of 1940, 8 U.S.C. (1946 ed.) \u00a7 801(d), by voting in the 1950 Japanese election, we do not consider the Questions under the 1952 Act or any facts relating thereto.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b489-20\">. This provision was continued in force in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952.

The government concedes, and we agree, that this petition is not frivolous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b490-7\">. For the purpose of this proceeding, the government accepts Tanaka\u2019s testimony as \u201ca truthful and sincere account of the reasons underlying his decision to vote in the Japanese political election of June 4, 1950.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b490-8\">.

For reasons which are not clear, the Special Inquiry Officer held that Tanaka voted for the first time in the June 1950 election, apparently because Tanaka had so stated in an application for a United States passport which he executed in July 1954.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b492-8\">. Passage of the Watkins Act, 68 Stat. 495, 496, July 20, 1954, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1438 note, which temporarily provided simplified naturalization procedures for certain persons who had lost their citizenship by voting in Japanese elections between September 2, 1945 and April 27, 1952, provides no support for Tanaka\u2019s claim of duress. Contra, Kamada v. Dulles, 145 F.Supp. 457, 461 (N.D.Calif. 1956); Serizawa v. Dulles, supra. The Act specifically recognized that those who voted in the election had lost their citizenship. The legislative history of the Act indicates that it was passed out of sympathy for those dual American-Japanese nationals who had responded to the call by General MacArthur and others to participate in Japanese political life, many of whom were unaware of the consequences to their American citizenship. Specifically disavowed was the assumption that many of these people had acted under compulsion. See 2 U.S.Code Cong. and Admin.News, pp. 2579, 2583 (1954).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b492-6\">KAUFMAN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A-je\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Minoru Tanaka is being deprived of the precious right of American citizenship because he voted, bowing to community pressure and in fear of possible economic reprisals and other dangers, in a post-war Japanese election conducted under the aegis of our nation\u2019s occupation forces. I must dissent from the result, which I consider harsh under the circumstances, for when the proper burden of proof rules are applied to the record evidence, there can be no doubt that the Government has failed to show the voluntariness of the alleged expatriating act \u201cclearly, convincingly and unequivocally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">\u201cIt is settled,\u201d the Supreme Court has said, \u201cthat no condfict results in expatriation unless the conduct is engaged in voluntarily.\u201d Nishikawa v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 129, 133, 78 S.Ct. 612, 615, 2 L.Ed.2d 659 (1958). My learned brothers, apparently accepting this well-established proposition, insist that Tanaka\u2019s testimony before the special inquiry officer did not adequately <em>inject </em>the issue of involuntariness and, therefore, it was not incumbent upon the Government to show that he voted voluntarily. They accept the Government\u2019s position that once the act of expatriation was established (by the uncontroverted evidence that he voted), Tanaka was obliged to come forward and make an adequate positive showing of duress in order properly to put the issue of voluntariness into the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-12\">With all respect, I believe application of these standards proceeds from a misreading of Nishikawa, supra. The Supreme Court, recognizing the drastic consequences of denationalization, accepted the view that \u201cvoluntariness is an element of the expatriating act, and as such must be proved by the Government.\u201d 356 U.S. at 134, 78 S.Ct. at 616. Nishikawa, the Court said, \u201cadequately injected the issue of voluntariness\u201d by showing that \u201che was conscripted in a totalitarian country to whose conscription law, with its penal sanctions, he was subject.\u201d 356 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>U.S. at 136, 78 S.Ct. at 617. I do not read this language to mean that only allegations and proof of legal or physical compulsion suffice to put the Government to the burden of proving voluntariness.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">That the majority in Nishikawa required little more from the petitioner than <em>pleading </em>the defense of involuntariness, coupled with minimal factual \u2022allegations, is strongly suggested by Mr. Justice Frankfurter\u2019s advocacy of a more restricted holding in his separate concurrence. He would have held, it appears, that where an individual engages in conduct \u201cby command of a penal statute of another country to whose laws he is subject, * * * the Government should, * * * have the burden of proving by clear, convincing and unequivocal evidence that the citizen voluntarily performed an act causing expatriation,\u201d 356 U.S. at 141, 78 S.Ct. at 620, but would have avoided the question \u201c[wjhether, in other classes of cases in which the defense of duress is asserted, the Government should have the burden of proving its absence.\u201d 356 U.S. at 142, 78 S.Ct. at 620. Indeed, in his dissent, Mr. Justice Harlan criticized the majority opinion, which he interpreted as altering, \u201cin <em>all </em>denationalization cases,\u201d the rule that consciously performed acts are presumed voluntary, \u201cby placing the burden of proving voluntariness on the Government.\u201d 356 U.S. at 144, 78 S.Ct. at 621 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">I also note that the Board of Immigration Appeals, in this very case, viewed the burden of proof problem somewhat differently from the position now taken by the Government and my brothers. Relying on Nishikawa, the Board\u2019s acting chairman wrote that \u201csince the respondent raised the issue of voluntariness, the Government must prove, by clear, convincing and unequivocal evidence, that this respondent\u2019s act of voting on June 4, 1950, was voluntarily performed.\u201d This was, in my view, a proper reading of Nishikawa, in which the Court rejected the rule that placed the burden of going forward to establish involuntariness on the citizen, Nishikawa v. Dulles, 235 F.2d 135 (9 Cir. 1956); Alata v. Dulles, 95 U.S.App.D.C.182, 221 F.2d 52 (1955), and adopted instead the principle that conscription into the army of a foreign government of one holding <em>dual citizenship </em>is sufficient to establish prima facie that his entry and service were involuntary. Lehmann v. Acheson, 206 F.2d 592 (3 Cir. 1953).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">Turning to the evidence, as adduced before the Immigration Service\u2019s special inquiry officer, I have little doubt that Tanaka adequately \u201cinjected\u201d and certainly \u201craised\u201d the issue of voluntariness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>sufficient to put the Government to its burden. Indeed, bearing in mind that \u201cevidentiary ambiguities are not to be resolved against the citizen,\u201d Nishikawa v. Dulles, 356 U.S. at 136, 78 S.Ct. at 617, it is apparent that the Government has fallen far short of meeting the burden of establishing the voluntary character of Tanaka\u2019s actions. My brothers find no more than \u201cvague and groundless fears of what his neighbors would have thought had he not voted,\u201d thus echoing the special inquiry officer\u2019s statement that Tanaka\u2019s \u201csole explanation is that as a native and citizen of the United States he was sensitive to the possibility of <em>disapproval </em>of his neighbors.\u201d This is, I submit, an over-simplified characterization of testimony which, I believe, established Tanaka\u2019s pervasive fear that he, as well as his family, might suffer, physically and economically, if Japanese neighbors who knew that he was an American citizen, with a father still living in the United States, also discovered that he was not voting in Japanese elections.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">The background of fear begins after Tanaka\u2019s release from the army when he was twice interrogated at his home by the Japanese military police about communications with his father. The fact that the military police came was, to Tanaka, a \u201csignificant threat,\u201d and to avoid the suspicions of his neighbors, who discussed the purpose of the visit, he lied and said the police were simply seeking to ascertain the degree of his recovery from the illness which caused his discharge from the army.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Tanaka also explained, at the hearing, that any failure to vote would be noted by his watchful neighbors because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-6\">\u201cthe names on this voting register were checked and if you failed to vote they usually sent the elementary school children to urge them to vote because at that time all the communities in Japan were competing for the highest rate of voting. * * If I don\u2019t vote, the people in charge would send someone to my place so the whole neighborhood would know. * * * We lived in a small neighborhood, and anything like this, even the voice, would be heard, so they would know.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-17\">Initially,\" petitioner testified that he voted \u201cbecause I was afraid of what my neighbors thought if I didn\u2019t.\u201d This vague explanation was, however, given greater substance during the course of the hearing. For example, after noting that he knew of one incident in which a Japanese man was \u201cbeaten up\u201d for speaking favorably about the United States,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-18\">Everyone in the community knew that I was an American citizen and my father was living in this country, so that I had to protect myself from the suspicions <em>and from the possible danger. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AxU\">Moreover, if Tanaka did not vote, he could not \u201ctell what might happen as a consequence,\u201d but was afraid of those who would resort to' physical reprisals of my family.\u201d And the testimony, and \u201cthe possible harm to the members which as my brothers concede should be taken in the light most favorable to Tanaka, also indicates that he feared the loss of his job with the prefectural government, whose officials could easily learn of his failure to vote on the occasions when he was given an absentee ballot. See Stipa v. Dulles, 233 F.2d 551 (3 Cir. 1956) (economic duress sufficient defense); Takehara v. Dulles, 205 F.2d 560 (9 Cir. 1953) (fear of loss of ration card); Takano v. Dulles, 116 F. Supp. 307 (D.Hawaii 1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>Furthermore, the Board of Immigration Appeals took an unnecessarily narrow view when it expressed inability to perceive \u201chow voting or not voting in a Japanese election would indicate sympathy or antagonism toward the United States.\u201d This statement misconceives the relevant question, which is simply what Tanaka believed his neighbors would think <em>and do </em>if he failed to vote. In any event, Tanaka\u2019s position is understandable : If a person living in Japan were thought \u2014 relatively soon after the end of a bloody war with the United States \u2014 to have close ties with the United States, his failure to vote in a Japanese election in 1950 might be viewed as a lack of interest in Japanese affairs or even disloyalty to Japan and paramount allegiance to the United States. Let us suppose, by way of illustration, that a person living in the United States had dual American and German citizenship, with many relatives living in Germany. Surely, we would not be taxing credulity if we recognized some justification for his belief that he might be disdained by his neighbors and that some headstrong nationalist might do him physical harm if he did not vote in American elections relatively soon after our war with Germany ended. His disinterest in American elections expressed by his failure to vote, if it could be ascertained, might very well be interpreted as greater devotion to Germany and lack of fealty to the American democracy, particularly by those neighbors whose kin were killed or maimed in the war.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The record evidence in this case, moreover, should be read in the context of conditions in post-war Japan, as revealed in numerous court adjudications dealing with voting by dual Japanese-American nationals. We learn from these cases that, in the years immediately following surrender, an intensive campaign was conducted to stimulate participation in the democratic election process by all inhabitants of Japan. Furthermore, General MacArthur\u2019s headquarters, through press, radio and other communications media, constantly urged qualified persons to vote in order to promote democracy and local leaders, in turn, impressed upon everyone the need to participate in the elections. Radio broadcasts sounded the theme that the world was watching the Japanese elections and branded those who refrained from voting \u201cenemies of the people.\u201d Indeed, the campaign stressing the function of voting was so powerful that many deemed it mandatory to vote, fearing reduction of rations and ostracism for failure to do so. Kamada v. Dulles, 145 F.Supp. 457, 461 (N.D.Cal.1956). And the effect of this veritable wave of pressure, aimed at securing a large turnout at the polls, was particularly potent on a people whose minds and habits had, for almost three centuries, been trained to obey the will of a governing few. Akio Kuwahara v. Acheson, 96 F.Supp. 38 (S.D.Cal.1951). See also Hichino Uyeno v. Acheson, 96 F.Supp. 510 (W.D.Wash.1951); Kasumi Nakashima v. Acheson, 98 F.Supp. 11 (S.D.Cal.1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">It has even been suggested by one court that Congress recognized the involuntary nature of the Japanese elections following the war and the contribution by persons such as Tanaka in helping implement United States policy by voting in those elections when it enacted the Watkins Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1438 note, providing for restoration of the citizenship of American-born Nisei who voted in occupied Japan. See Serizawa v. Dulles, 134 F.Supp. 713, 714 (N.D. Cal.1955). I do not pass judgment on the validity of that suggestion, see footnote 7 of majority opinion, but it does seem appropriate to quote from the legislative history, reflecting conditions in Japan during the occupation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-8\">\u201c[M]any persons genuinely concerned with the fate of that wartorn country sacrificed their United States citizenship to participate in the epic struggle waged at the polls. * * * The basic issue in the postwar elections was the pro-American policy of the Prime Minister in opposition to the Communists. * * Some who voted did so in the belief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>that they were helping win the battle against the Communists in that crucial and strategic struggle which in Japan, at least, seems to have been resolved in favor of democracy and pro-Americanism.\u201d 1954 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Adm.News, pp. 2579, 2580.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">In light of the evidence here, when viewed against the background of the prevailing climate outlined above, I am persuaded that the Government has failed to carry its burden and prove, by clear, convincing and unequivocal evidence, that Tanaka voluntarily voted in the June 4, 1950, election. Absent here is the requisite \u201csolidity of proof which leaves no troubling doubt in deciding a question of such gravity as is implied in an attempt to reduce a person to the status of alien from that of citizen.\" Baumgartner v. United States, 322 U.S. 665, 670, 64 S.Ct. 1240, 1243, 88 L.Ed. 1525 (1944). The Government has failed to prove that Tanaka\u2019s act of voting was the conscious exercise of a free choice, made spontaneously and apart from the force of outside pressures. See Matter of G, 8 I. &amp; N.Dec. 317, 319-20 (1959). That subjective motivations inducing the overt act are relevant cannot be doubted; for example, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, in Nishikawa v. Dulles, 356 U.S. at 140, 141, 78 S.Ct. at 619, recognized the difficulty the Government might encounter in attempting to establish the citizen\u2019s state of mind \u201cas it bears on his will, purpose and choice of action \u2014 in short, \u2018voluntariness,\u2019 \u201d and alluded to the \u201csubtle, psychologic factors that bear on duress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">It is important to recognize, moreover, that the quantum of influence which removes actions from the sphere of free choice varies according to the character of the act. Thus, it would seem to me that a greater degree of proof of compulsion or coercion would be necessary to sustain a claim of involuntariness in connection with the positive acts of applying for and obtaining naturalization in a foreign state, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1481(a) (1), or serving in the armed forces of a foreign state, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1481(a) (3) \u2014 acts which so clearly indicate a renunciation of American ties \u2014 than in the case of the much more equivocal act of voting in an election conducted under the aegis and urging of American occupation forces, as in this case. While it is true that the Government need not prove that a person, in order to be deprived of his citizenship, must intend or desire the result, Perez v. Brownell, 356 U.S. 44, 61, 78 S.Ct. 568, 2 L.Ed.2d 603 (1958), knowledge and intent are material elements in determining whether the act was voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Finally, even if I were to accept, <em>arguendo, </em>the majority\u2019s conclusion that there is no evidence that Tanaka \u201chad any reason to fear bodily harm or any form of oppression,\u201d I cannot agree that his testimony concerning community pressure failed to inject the issue of voluntariness. Since the loss of the precious birthright of American citizenship is involved, I would, construing both the law and the facts \u201cas far as is reasonably possible in favor of the citizen,\u201d Schneiderman v. United States, 320 U.S. 118, 122, 63 S.Ct. 1333, 1335, 87 L.Ed. 1796 (1943), conclude that the Government has failed to carry its burden of proving that Tanaka voluntarily expatriated himself by voting in the June 6, 1950, election; and, this failure cannot be excused by a hypertechnical conclusion, reminiscent of the rigid formalities of common-law pleading, see Dioguardi v. Durning, 139 F.2d 774 (2 Cir. 1944), that the issue of involuntariness was not injected by Tanaka. The record is replete with evidence that he raised the point and that the Government had adequate notice of Tanaka\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">In any event, and as a minimal requirement, this case should be transferred to the District Court for a hearing <em>de novo, </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a) (5) (B), because \u2014 notwithstanding the Government\u2019s factual concessions \u2014 a genuine issue of material fact was presented as to Tanaka\u2019s nationality. It is always better for an appellate court to treat difficult questions of law, especially those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>of constitutional dimension, after the facts have been fully developed and the issues refined by a trial judge. Indeed, summary judgment has, on occasion, been deemed inappropriate where a fuller record is thought to be an essential prerequisite to intelligent, informed resolution of complex questions of law. See Kennedy v. Silas Mason Co., 334 U.S. 249, 256-257, 68 S.Ct. 1031, 92 L.Ed. 1347 (1948); Miller v. General Outdoor Advertising Co., 337 F.2d 944 (2 Cir. 1964). And the courts have often held that genuine issues of material fact exist, within the meaning of the summary judgment rule, where, as here, reasonable men differ about the inferences to be drawn from undisputed basic facts. See Empire Electronics Co. v. United States, 311 F.2d 175, 179 (2 Cir. 1962) ; S. J. Groves &amp; Sons Co. v. Ohio Turnpike Comm., 315 F.2d 235, 237-238 (6 Cir.), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 824, 84 S.Ct. 65, 11 L.Ed.2d 57 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Contrary to the Government\u2019s view, transfer to the District Court might well accomplish something more than the confirmation of the facts already conceded before us. There are many important gaps in the skimpy record which, in the majority\u2019s view, indicates that the issue of involuntariness has not been adequately injected but which, in my view, does not support a finding of voluntariness. To give but one example, it may not be clear what Tanaka meant when he said, \u201cI had to protect myself from the suspicions and from the possible danger.\u201d I cannot be sure whether he meant mere fear of disfavor and economic reprisals, or physical attacks upon himself and his family. The Government\u2019s acceptance of Tanaka\u2019s testimony as <em>\u201ca </em>truthful and sincere account of the reasons underlying his decision to vote in the Japanese political election of June 4, 1950,\u201d should not foreclose further inquiry on a matter of such great importance, which leaves me in doubt because of the record\u2019s ambiguity. I should note, too, that at the time the hearing was held before the special inquiry officer in 1960, the new judicial review procedures of Section 106 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a, had not yet become law. Tanaka could reasonably assume that, in the event of an adverse decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals, further proof could be adduced in a <em>de novo </em>hearing before a District Court under the then prevailing procedures. The alternative course I suggest would not run counter to the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of Section 106 in Foti v. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service, 375 U.S. 217, 84 S.Ct. 306, 11 L.Ed.2d 281 (1963), for transfer would be utilized to assure an informed determination, and not as a dilatory tactic.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-13\">Finally, I must express some reservation over the applicability of Section 401 (e) to this ease. The expatriation-for-voting provision withstood constitutional attack in Perez v. Brownell, 356 U.S. 44, 78 S.Ct. 568 (1958), on the ground that Congress, as part of its power to regulate foreign relations, could denationalize American citizens for voting in foreign political elections because such activities might give rise to serious international embarrassment. Quite apart from the possibility that such embarrassment is. most unlikely in an election conducted under the auspices of American occupation forces,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> I question whether Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>401(e) should be read to cover the case of a dual national who voted in an election in the country of his second nationality. As Mr. Justice Frankfurter noted in Perez v. Brownell, 356 U.S. at 60, 78 S.Ct. at 577, \u201c[s]pecific applications are of course open to judicial challenge, as are other general categories in the law, by a \u2018gradual process of judicial inclusion and exclusion.\u2019 \u201d And Mr. Justice Whittaker\u2019s memorandum dissent, indicating that Section 401(e) would not apply if Perez were eligible, <em>as an alien, </em>to vote in Mexican elections, strongly suggests that the Court was not dealing with the peculiar situation of a dual national.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">If Perez is no longer controlling, then I am inclined to read Jalbuena v. Dulles, 254 F.2d 379 (3 Cir. 1958), as good authority for the proposition that the expatriation statutes have limited application to dual nationals. See also Dulles v. Katamoto, 256 F.2d 545, 548-549.(9 Cir. 1958). Jalbuena was a natural-born citizen of the United States who moved to the Philippines and, by operation of law, became a Philippine citizen. His action in applying' for and receiving a Philippine passport after subscribing to an oath to support the Philippine Constitution, it was held, did not constitute renunciation of his American citizenship ; Jalbuena was not expatriated, under the predecessor of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1481 (a) (2), for taking an oath or making an affirmation or other formal declaration of allegiance to a foreign state.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The Court of Appeals interpreted Perez as going no further</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-6\">\u201cthan to approve forfeiture of citizenship under Section 401 where the nature and circumstances of the allegedly expatriating conduct have been such as to indicate some flouting of obligations inherent in American citizenship, if not an implied renunciation of the tie.\u201d 254 F.2d at 381.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">I question whether Section 401(e) was designed to discourage dual nationality. Instead, should it not be construed in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s understanding of that concept, which</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-11\">\u201crecognizes that a person may have and exercise rights of nationality in two countries and be subject to the responsibilities of both. The mere fact that he asserts the rights of one citizenship does not without more mean that he renounces the other. * * * [D]ual citizenship * * * could not exist if the assertion of rights or the assumption of liabilities of one were deemed inconsistent with the maintenance of the other.\u201d Kawakita v. United States, 343 U.S. 717, 723-724, 725, 72 S.Ct. 950, 956, 96 L.Ed. 1249 (1952).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-12\">And from this recognition of the peculiar situation of the dual citizen, it follows that \u201cconduct which is merely declaratory of what one national aspect of dual citizenship [such as taking an oath of allegiance or voting] necessarily connotes, cannot reasonably be construed as an act of renunciation of the other national aspect of the actor\u2019s dual status.\u201d 254 F.2d at 381. This reasoning seems to have validity. It is questionable, therefore, whether by the mere act of voting in Japanese elections as a national of Japan \u2014 even if that act was voluntarily performed \u2014 Tanaka, possessed of dual citizenship at the time, can be treated as having renounced his American citizenship within the meaning of Section 401(e). \u201c[T]he dignity of citizenship which the Constitution confers as a birthright upon every person born within its protection is not to be withdrawn or extinguished by the courts except pursuant to a clear statutory mandate.\u201d Mandoli v. Acheson, 344 U.S. 133, 139, 73 S.Ct. 135, 138, 97 L.Ed. 146 (1952).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b493-9\">. The opinion for the majority suggests that, in order to put the Government to its proof on the issue of voluntariness, the citizen cannot show subjective fear alone, but must point to \u201csome additional circumstances to justify his fear.\u201d But the cases cited for this proposition do not, on my reading, support it. As already indicated, Nishikawa enunciated a broad rule applicable whether or not the expatriating act was legally compelled by the foreign state. In Doreau v. Marshall, 170 F.2d 721 (3 Cir. 1948), the court rejected as premature the Government\u2019s contention that the facts alleged, even if accepted, did not amount in law .to duress. And the test there framed \u2014\u201cextraordinary circumstances amounting to true duress,\u201d 170 F.2d at 724 \u2014certainly does not apply after Nishikawa imposed an exceedingly onerous burden of proof <em>on the Government. </em>See Kiyama v. Dulles, 268 F.2d 110 (9 Cir. 1959) (Government has burden of proving voluntariness). Finally, in Matter of G, 8 I. &amp; N. Dec. 317 (1959), the Board of Immigration Appeals held that the issue of voluntariness was adequately injected by a genuine, <em>hut unfounded, </em>fear of harm. Quoting from Nishikawa, 356 U.S. at 137-138, 78 S.Ct. 612, the Board wrote, \u201cNor can the district judge\u2019s disbelief of petitioner\u2019s story of his motives and fears fill the evidentiary gap [of affirmative evidence of voluntariness of the act] in the Government\u2019s case * * * [for] the Government must in each case prove voluntary conduct by clear, convincing and unequivocal evidence.\u201d 8 I. &amp; N.Dec. at 321 n. 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b494-7\">. The majority stresses Tanaka\u2019s admission that he never heard of anyone being assaulted in Japan after World War II <em>solely </em>because of failure to vote. I fail to see the importance of this because, in Tanaka\u2019s instance, the lack of interest in Japanese affairs that would be manifested by a failure to exercise the franchise, when conjoined with his neighbors\u2019 knowledge of his American nativity and citizenship, might well have provoked dangerous repercussions; at the very least, his situation differed from a case of \u201csolely\u201d failing to vote.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b497-7\">. Several courts have refused to apply Section 401(e) to \u201celections\u201d conducted in countries occupied by American forces, holding that the citizen had not voted in a \u201cpolitical election\u201d in a \u201cforeign state\u201d within the contemplation of the statute. See, e. g., Fujiko Furusho v. Acheson, 94 F.Supp. 1021 (D.Hawaii 1951) (Japan); Brehm v. Acheson, 90 F.Supp. 662 (S.D.Tex.1950) (Germany). Contra, Acheson v.

Brownell itself is open to some doubt at this time. Last Term the Supreme Court, in Schneider v. Rusk, 377 U.S. 163, 84 S.Ct. 1187, 12 L.Ed.2d 218 (1964), struck down Section 352(a) (1), which provided that \u201c[a] person who has become a national by naturalization shall lose his nationality by * * . * having a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>tinuous residence for three years in * * * a foreign state * * * in which the place of his birth is situated.\u201d Since a conclusion in favor of the statute could have been sustained by reliance on Perez, at least one eminent scholar has suggested that the Perez decision is \u201cprobably now moribund.\u201d Kurland, Foreward: \u201cEqual in Origin and Equal in Title to the Legislative and Executive Branches of the Government,\u201d 78 Harv.L.Rev. 143, 174 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
