The Government commendably conceded the latter claim, which would require a new trial if, after mental examination, appellant were judicially determined to be competent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We withheld action on this concession to await the outcome of a remand we ordered to develop further the speedy trial claim, which could entail dismissal of the indictment. After extensive hearings on remand, the trial judge concluded that appellant was \u201cdeprived of his constitutional right to a speedy trial\u201d by the Government\u2019s failure to make a diligent effort to apprehend a co-defendant whose testimony could provide the only possible corroboration for his defense of mistaken identity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Within our review authority, we find no basis for disturbing the judge\u2019s conclusion. It follows that the case must be reversed and remanded with instructions to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-21\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b473-13\">. Brown v.

Although the co-defendant eventually testified against Ward, the trial judge made no findings on remand that Ward acted in bad faith in refusing to be tried in his absence; nor does the record necessarily compel such a finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
