The Order directed the petitioner and others to cease and desist from merchandising by means of a game of chance, gift enterprise or lottery scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-22\"> On review of the record we are of the opinion that it presents substantial, and competent evidence to support the Commission\u2019s findings and Order. We are further of the opinion that the former proceeding of the Commission against the petitioner and others, J. C. Martin Corp. v. Federal Trade Commission, 242 F.2d 530 (7 Cir. 1957), did not bar its prosecution of the instant proceeding by reason of <em>res adjudicata </em>or collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-23\">For the reasons stated the Order of the Commission will be affirmed and enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
