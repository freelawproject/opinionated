The third conviction was affirmed by that court, 225 Md. 349, 170 A.2d 300. All else failing, Brown attacked his trial and appellate counsel. Maryland\u2019s Court of Appeals appointed other counsel, ordered a full inquiry by an independent judge and affirmed the denial of post conviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-27\">All of the earlier proceedings are reviewed in our opinion on the first petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We there held that Brown had been fairly tried and that his representation by his highly experienced attorney had been not in the least inadequate. It was plainly exceptional.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-28\">Now Brown returns again saying his representation was inadequate because he was not told he had a right to waive a jury trial and to be tried by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-29\">There is a stipulation that the trial attorney, if called as a witness, would tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>tify that he has no present recollection as to whether he talked with Brown about the alternatives of a trial to a jury or to the court, but that his only hope of avoidance of a verdict of guilty of murder was excitement of the sympathy of one or more jurors antipathetic to policemen. There was no other defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">In the first appeal, we thoroughly canvassed the earlier proceedings. In agreement with Maryland\u2019s Court of Appeals, we concluded that Brown\u2019s third trial was entirely fair and unexceptionable. Explicitly and intimately involved was the performance of Brown\u2019s trial counsel, who had expended so much time and effort in Brown\u2019s behalf and with substantial success in securing the reversal of the first two convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The present suggestion, in light of the stipulation as to the lawyer\u2019s answer, cannot alter our considered opinion that Brown was fairly tried and fairly convicted. The Maryland courts and Brown\u2019s appointed counsel have displayed a highly commendable concern for his rights and a talented effort to protect them.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The present contention cannot dissuade us from our earlier conclusion that Brown was fairly tried and more than adequately represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b199-30\">.
