E., this City.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-22\">At the location referred to appellee operates a restaurant with table and counter, and also curb or drive-in services. When operations began in 1959 both services were conforming uses under the Zoning Regulations. But in 1961 the Regulations were amended to exclude from the area in which the premises are located any type of drive-in restaurant. The drive-in portion of appellee\u2019s services then became a nonconforming use and was allowed to continue only by virtue of D.C.Code \u00a7 5-419,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-23\">\u201cprovided no structural alteration, except such as may be required by law or regulation, or no enlargement is made or no new building is erected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b884-24\">On the premises as originally constructed, and at present, is a storage area adjacent to the main building, bounded on two sides by an enclosure described as a basket-weave fence, without a roof. Appellee stores commissary carts in this area. The carts are used to transport food to the restaurant from Hot Shoppes\u2019 central commissary; the carts thus aid both the conforming and nonconforming uses of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-25\">In July, 1962 officials of the Health Department directed appellee to store its commissary carts under cover. Appellee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>thereafter applied for a building permit which proposed to transform the fenced-in area into a completely enclosed structure with a roof, matching the main building architecturally. The application was rejected after a hearing on the ground that the proposed construction was an \u201cenlargement\u201d which would extend the nonconforming use contrary to the Zoning Act and Regulations. Following an inspection of the property <em>ex parte, </em>the Board denied an appeal, concluding that \u201cit is obvious that the equipment can be placed somewhere inside the existing structure or perhaps other operational arrangements made\u201d and that appellee had \u201cfailed to sustain its burden of proof that a hardship within the meaning of the law does in fact exist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">The District Court decided that the proposed construction was not an \u201cenlargement\u201d but a \u201cstructural alteration\u201d and that as such would be \u201crequired by law or regulation\u201d under Section 5-419 if it were shown that there was no room to store the carts in the existing main structure. The court refused to accept the Board\u2019s conclusion that there was room in the main structure because of the <em>ex parte </em>nature of the Board\u2019s inspection and its failure to afford appellee an opportunity to refute any facts upon which its decision was based. The court accordingly remanded the case to the Board, -directing that if it were found that the carts could not be stored in the existing main structure appellee\u2019s application be granted, and that if the carts could be so stored, appellee\u2019s application be considered under the hardship proviision, D.C.Code \u00a7 5-420(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">I concur in remand for a fuller hearing before the Board of Zoning Adjustment, and for action by the Board upon the basis of such hearing, (1) with respect to whether or not the equipment can be placed inside the existing main structure, and (2) on the issue of hardship under Section 5-420(3) of the D.C.Code. But I dissent from the decision of this court in agreeing with the ruling of the District Court that should appellee be able to show on the remand that there was no room inside its restaurant building to store the carts then appellee\u2019s proposed alteration is to be approved as one \u201crequired\u201d by Section 5-419, D.C.Code. That provision, as stated above, is to the effect that \u201cno structural alteration, except such as may be required by law or regulation\u201d be permitted for such non-forming use as is here involved. While the Health Department has required the carts to be under cover, this does not mean that the present storage area is required by law or regulation to be altered as appellee seeks to do if no place for the carts is found in appellee\u2019s restaurant building. The Health Department decision that from a health, safety or sanitary standpoint the carts should be covered is far indeed from a requirement by law or regulation that such a structural alteration be made of the place the carts are now stored. As a structure that place has not even been criticized from a health, safety or sanitary standpoint.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-10\">A remand would no doubt furnish an opportunity to determine whether the District would be satisfied with some method of covering the carts where they have been stored, should they be permitted to remain there.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If this is not possible and it is found that the equipment cannot be placed inside the restaurant,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> then I would have the Board consider the appellee\u2019s application under the hardship provision, Section 5-420(3).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b885-7\">. No one from the Health Department testified at the hearing before the Board of Zoning Adjustment either as to the violation involved or its possible remedy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b885-8\">. The District Court opinion states that if the Board finds there is room inside the restaurant to store the carts then it may consider the hardship issue. This is unclear to me. If there is room in the restaurant building there would seem to be no hardship.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
