The defendants had not then filed their Answers to the plaintiff\u2019s interrogatories although they had been directed to do so by the District Court\u2019s Order dated May 25, 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Counsel for the defendants has now advised this Court that it is prepared to file Answers to the plaintiff\u2019s interrogatories. Inasmuch as such Answers may develop the existence of a genuine issue as to a material fact, the District Court\u2019s Judgment of December 7, 1964 will be vacated and the cause remanded so that the defendants\u2019 Answers to the plaintiff\u2019s interrogatories may be filed, with directions to the District Court to make such disposition as it may deem requisite upon consideration of such Answers.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
