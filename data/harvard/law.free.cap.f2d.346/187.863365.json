While the evidence by which Chierico\u2019s connection with the wagering operation was circumstantial, we have no doubt in concluding that the circumstances testified to, including statements made by appellant himself touching on what the jury could properly infer was the illegal operation, were more than sufficient to warrant submission of the issue to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-20\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
