Judge Blumenfeld, in a well-reasoned opinion, 240 F.Supp. 791 (1965), decided that the effort had not succeeded and dismissed the complaint. We agree with his disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">The complaint alleged the making of two contracts, as of April 20, 1959, relating to McFaddin Express, Incorporated, a motor carrier holding a certificate from the Interstate Commerce Commission, and L &amp; L Leasing Corporation, which leased equipment to it. One contract provided for the sale of all the stock of the two corporations to The Adley Corporation, also a certificated motor carrier; the other provided for temporary management and control of McFaddin and L &amp; L by Adley for a period of 180 days from the effective date of an order of the ICC authorizing the contract \u201cor to such earlier or later date as shall be ordered by said Commission, and unless otherwise ordered by said Commission until a final order is made by said Commission\u201d with regard to the sale. The contract of sale was subject to ICC approval of the management contract in accordance with 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 310a(b), and ultimate approval of the sale itself as required by 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5. Appropriate applications were made to the ICC which, on May 21,1959, issued an order, later extended, approving the temporary management contract. Serious disagreements occurred between the parties, federal tax liens on McFaddin\u2019s property were foreclosed, and McFaddin\u2019s service became largely dormant. In a report dated Oct. 15,1963, the ICC denied approval, 93 M.C.C. 378,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the management contract terminated in August, 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">The complaint charged, <em>inter alia, </em>that during the term of the management contract the defendants failed to pay current federal taxes and to comply with an agreement McFaddin had made for the discharge of past delinquencies; that at the time the contracts were made, defendants did not intend to comply with them in good faith; that they had mismanaged McFaddin and L &amp; L, both deliberately and negligently, had diverted the former\u2019s business to their own account, had induced creditors to repossess assets of McFaddin, had appropriated assets of McFaddin and L &amp; L, had terminated the employment of McFaddin\u2019s employees and hired some of them for Adley, had failed to segregate revenues or funds belonging to McFaddin and L &amp; L, and had failed on the expiration of the management contract to return the property and business of McFaddin and L &amp; L as the contract required. The first count of the complaint alleged in conclusory terms that the mismanagement and return of the corporations in their damaged state violated the ICC order approving the management contract. Reasserting the same facts, further counts set forth theories of fraud, constructive trust, and breach of contract. Damages and certain equitable relief were requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">In testing the complaint for sufficient assertion of a federal question, we apply, faute <em>de mieux, </em>the approach utilized with respect to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>in T. B. Harms Co. v. Eliscu, 339 F.2d 823, 826-828 (2 Cir. 1964), cert. denied, 85 S.Ct. 1534 (1965), namely, whether the complaint is for a remedy expressly granted by an act of Congress or otherwise \u201cinferred\u201d from federal law, or whether a properly pleaded \u201cstate-created\u201d claim itself presents a \u201cpivotal question of federal law,\u201d for example because an act of Congress must be construed or \u201c \u2018federal common law\u2019 govern [s] some disputed aspect\u201d of the claim. Compare ALI, Study of the Division of Jurisdiction Between State and Federal Courts 33 (Tent. Draft No. 3, 1965). Harms\u2019 exegesis of the \u201carising under\u201d language in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338 is well suited to the similarly worded \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1337; the more specific jurisdictional warrant of \u00a7 1336 \u2014 to bring in federal court any civil action to enforce an ICC order\u2014 merely poses the subsumed question whether a particular federal remedy embraces the facts here pleaded and can be discussed at the same time.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">If the complaint could fairly be read as asserting a substantial claim of violation of the ICC order approving the temporary management contract, the case could arguably go forward as one mandated by 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(12) \u201cfor the enforcement of such order,\u201d with jurisdiction squarely founded on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1336; or alternatively, the suit might take shape as one for an implied federal remedy for breach of the express federal duty raised by the ICC order, see Note, 77 Harv.L.Rev. 285 (1963), and so arguably meet the jurisdictional requirements of \u00a7 1331 or perhaps \u00a7 1337. There might still be some difficulty on either line of reasoning \u2014 on the first, for example, because McFaddin might be said to seek not so much enforcement of an order as compensation for past disobedience, and on the second, because \u201cimplication\u201d of a federal remedy is hardly automatic, particularly where an agency occupies the field. But such questions need not be resolved, for we do not think that the ICC \u201cordered\u201d Adley to obey the management contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">The critical language of the initial order of May 21, 1959, which is set out in the margin,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> states that Adley is \u201cauthorized\u201d to take control. The order is permissive only, in effect granting a temporary exemption from the prohibition of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5. If Adley had never assumed the permitted temporary control, it would have violated its contract but not the order. And if Adley did control McFaddin other than \u201cupon the terms and conditions set forth in the agreement filed with the application,\u201d perhaps Adley forfeited its exemption from \u00a7 5,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but again it has disobeyed no express command of the ICC. Doubtless the Commission does expect that a carrier authorized to exercise temporary control will use this permission in accordance with its agreement, so as to enable the controlled carrier to resume independent operation if approval under \u00a7 5 is ultimately denied. But we do not feel justified in reading the bland language of the order so that these expectations become ICC commands, especially when the Commission has been at such pains to make clear that it considers the private disagreements of the parties not to be its concern, see fn. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">The only other suggestion of a federal question is that the national interest in contracts such as the present ones is so great that \u201cfederal principles control the disposition of the claim,\u201d T. B. Harms v. Eliscu, supra, 339 F.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>828, which would otherwise be governed by state law. Accepting that application of \u201cfederal principles\u201d would bring the suit within 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 on the theory that \u201cthe \u2018laws\u2019 referred to in the statute are not confined to Acts of Congress, but include also such \u2018federal common law\u2019 as may exist,\u201d ALI, supra, at 34; see Kurland, The Romero Case and Some Problems of Federal Jurisdiction, 73 Harv.L.Rev. 817, 827-33 (1960),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we cannot find that plaintiffs have here shown that federal principles should supersede state law in any respect relevant to this case. That the contracts could not lawfully be carried out save with ICC approval does not, without more, demonstrate that Congress meant all aspects of their performance or non-performance to be governed by law to be fashioned by federal courts rather than by the state law applicable to similar contracts relating to businesses not under federal regulation. This is not to say that a particular issue concerning such a contract, e. g., whether ICC approval had or had not been granted prior to a particular date, cf. Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 339 U.S. 667, 70 S.Ct. 876, 94 L.Ed. 1194 (1950), would not require determination under federal principles. But the complaint does not suggest that any such issue is present here. On this point we must agree with Chicago &amp; No. W. Ry. v. Toledo, P. &amp; W. R. R., 217 F.Supp. 64 (S.D.Ill.), aff\u2019d, 324 F.2d 936 (7 Cir. 1963), rather than with what was stated as an alternative ground for decision in Florida East Coast Ry. v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., 328 F.2d 720, 722 (5 Cir.), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 830, 85 S.Ct. 59, 13 L.Ed.2d 38 (1964). International Ass\u2019n of Machinists v. Central Airlines, Inc., 372 U.S. 682, 83 S.Ct. 956, 10 L.Ed. 2d 67 (1963), which appellants strongly press upon us as sustaining federal jurisdiction, is not truly apposite; the general language on which they rely, 372 U.S. at 692, 83 S.Ct. 956, must be read in the light of the Court\u2019s statements that Congress had made it a statutory duty of the parties to establish the airline system board of adjustments whose award was sought to be enforced, 372 U.S. at 690, 83 S.Ct. 956, and that, although created by private contract, the Board was intended \u201c \u2018to be and to act as a public agency, not as a private go-between,\u2019 \u201d 372 U.S. at 695, 83 S.Ct. at 964. Pan American Petroleum Corp. v. Superior Court, 366 U.S. 656, 81 S.Ct. 1303, 6 L.Ed.2d 584 (1961), denying federal jurisdiction, is closer to the case in hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">On the basis of the reasons and authority cited in T. B. Harms Co. v. Eliscu, supra, 339 F.2d at 828-829, we also uphold Judge Blumenfeld\u2019s refusal to entertain the claims under state law on a theory of \u201cpendent jurisdiction.\u201d As has recently been written, \u201cWhere the federal element which is the basis for jurisdiction is disposed of early in the case, as on the pleadings, it smacks of the tail wagging the dog to continue with a federal hearing of the state claim.\u201d ALI, supra, at 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b475-5\">. Approval had earlier been denied in a report, 87 M.C.C. 665 (1961), which stated that because of certain disputes over the contract, Adley had sought denial of its own application. Noting that \u201cit is well established by Commission precedent that matters of controversy arising between the parties under private contracts must be left for settlement by the parties themselves or by the courts,\u201d 87 M.C.C. at 667, the Commission denied the application on the grounds that the acquisition would weaken Adley and would deprive shippers of competition. On further hearing Adley reversed its position and urged approval as a means of aborting the threatened litigation by McFaddin and its owners. Repeating that \u201cthis longstanding controversy is * * * a matter for the courts to decide if the parties cannot otherwise resolve the controverted matters,\u201d 93 M.C.C. at 382, the Commission again denied approval, this time largely on the basis \u201cthat it would not be consistent with the public interest to permit a carrier to purchase dormant operating rights which it intends to hold and possibly institute operations thereunder at some future time.\u201d 93 M.C.C. at 384.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b476-5\">. <em>\u201cIt is ordered, </em>That the said application under section 210a (b) be, and it is hereby granted, and that The Adley Express Company be, and it is hereby authorized to control McFaddin Express, Inc. through management, for a period not exceeding 180 days, beginning with the date hereof, unless otherwise ordered, upon the terms and conditions set forth in the agreement filed with the application under section 210a (b), but at a compensation payable to The Adley Express Company, and its employees and agents of not exceeding $1.00 per year.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b476-11\">. McFaddin does not suggest that \u00a7 5 has been violated, or that its present injuries would be compensable on that theory, and we do not consider the question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b477-4\">. What we said in In re Chicago Express, Inc., 332 F.2d 276, 279 (2 Cir. 1964), does not argue to the contrary. Relying in part on narrow statutory evidence, we wore there construing a provision of the Bankruptcy Act, not the jurisdictional grant of the Act of March 3, 1875, 18 Stat. 470. Furthermore, despite common reference to the rule of Fosdick v. Schall, 99 U.S. 235, 25 L.Ed. 339 (1879), there at issue, as \u201cfederal,\u201d that rule was not in fact one where \u201cthe source of the substantive rule * * * is national authority.\u201d Kurland, supra, 73 Harv.L.Rev. at 833. It has long been settled that \u201ca case does not arise under the laws of the United States simply because this court, or any other federal court, has decided in. another suit the questions of law which are involved.\u201d Leather Mfrs. Bank v. Cooper, 120 U.S. 778, 781, 7 S.Ct. 777, 778, 30 L.Ed. 816 (1887).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
