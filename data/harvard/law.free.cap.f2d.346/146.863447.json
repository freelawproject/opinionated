The Order of Dismissal appealed from shows that the dismissal was grounded upon petitioner\u2019s failure to allege that he had exhausted his post-conviction remedies under K.S.A. 60-1507. Counsel for appellant argues here that such remedies are inadequate and ineffective, with which argument we do not agree. For us to say that the statutory remedy is inadequate and ineffective, we would have to assume that the Kansas courts will construe the statute so as to make it inadequate and ineffective, which we will not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-26\">K.S.A. 60-1507 follows almost exactly the wording of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255, which statute has been construed to be \u201cthe substantial equivalent of federal habeas corpus.\u201d Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S. 1, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 10 L.Ed.2d 148 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-27\">We agree with the trial court that appellant has not exhausted the remedies available to him in the courts of Kansas) and that he has failed to show that circumstances exist rendering such state process inadequate and ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-28\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
