Authority was granted, provided that petitioner make surplus capacity of the project\u2019s transmission facilities available to the Government for 1he wheeling<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of Government power at Government expense. On this review petitioner challenges the authority of the Commission to impose such a condition, and seeks to have it declared invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-19\">On August 4, 1955, the Commission issued petitioner a fifty-year license under the Federal Power Act, supra, for a hydroelectric project to consist of three power developments located on that portion of the Snake River which forms the boundary between Oregon and Idaho. The license followed hearings on three separate applications by petitioner for the Oxbow, Hell\u2019s Canyon and Brownlee developments, which had been consolidated for hearing. The license applications contain specifications for the proposed project work, including the proposed primary transmission lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-20\">The applications were vigorously opposed on the ground that the resources should be reserved for public development by the United States. There being no formulated or contemplated plans for Federal development at that time, the Commission granted petitioner\u2019s appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>cation and the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia sustained the Commission\u2019s action. National Hells Canyon Ass\u2019n v. F. P. C., 99 U.S.App.D.C. 149, 237 F.2d 777 (1956), cert. denied, 353 U.S. 924, 77 S.Ct. 681, 1 L.Ed.2d 720 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">The license provides that the three developments shall be considered as units of one complete project. It specifically lists the individual project works licensed as part of the project. No transmission facilities were then specified. Instead, by Article 45 of the license, it was provided :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-5\">\u201cThe Commission expressly reserves the right to determine at a later date the question of what transmission lines and appurtenant facilities, if any, shall be covered in this license and included as part of the project works.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">Since the project was to occupy public lands, petitioner was required by Article 44 to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1008-7\">\u201c * * * pay to the United States such charges as may be specified hereafter for the purpose of recompensing the United States for the use, occupancy and enjoyment of its lands, including transmission right-of-way.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1008-8\">Thereafter, at petitioner\u2019s request, the license was amended several times to include transmission lines within the project license. No wheeling conditions were imposed in any of these orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-9\">In September, 1963, petitioner requested amendment of the license to include two 230,000-volt circuits extending a distance of about 100 miles, 27 miles of which were through Government land, and 1.75 miles within the Boise and Payette National Forests. The Commission advised the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior of the application, and requested their views.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-10\">The Secretary of the Interior recommended that any authorization for construction of the lines should be conditioned upon the Commission\u2019s reserving the right to require petitioner to wheel Government power over the company\u2019s entire main transmission system. He explained that this might enable the Government to defer construction by the Bonneville Power Administration of a high-capacity line connecting the main Federal Columbia River Power System to the Upper Snake River System; that Bureau of Reclamation plants in Southern Idaho would shortly be unable to meet their power requirements and would need a part of Bonneville\u2019s surplus.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-12\">The Secretary of Agriculture also recommended a wheeling condition, stating that this would \u201cminimize the use of public lands for transmission line rights of way\u201d and thus \u201ccontribute greatly to the objective of \u2018assuring an abundant supply of electric energy throughout the United States with the greatest possible economy and with regard to the proper utilization and conservation of natural resources.\u2019 Federal Power Act, \u00a7 202 (a) [49 Stat. 848 (1935), 16 U.S.C. 824a (a)].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-13\">On July 24, 1954, by amendment No. 9 to the license, the Commission granted the requested authority for the construction of the lines, subject to the condition that petitioner make available to the Government on a reasonable cost basis, all surplus transmission capacity within the primary lines of the project, and, upon appropriate request and at least one year\u2019s notice, increase the transmission capacity of the project transmission lines at the Government\u2019s expense. Under the license conditions, the Government\u2019s wheeling is limited to \u201csuch amounts as will not unreasonably interfere with the Licensee\u2019s use of said lines,\u201d and to transmission \u201conly to consuming facilities of the United States and to public bodies and co-operatives entitled to statutory preference in connection with the distribution and sale of electric energy by the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-14\">Petitioner, with the Commission\u2019s consent, filed an acceptance of the amendment, reserving the right \u201cto object, upon timely court review of the Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>sion\u2019s order, to the lawfulness of the wheeling condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-4\">The lawfulness of that condition is thus the issue here presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">The propriety and reasonableness of such a license condition is established by F.P.C. v. Idaho Power Co., 344 U.S. 17, 73 S.Ct. 85, 97 L.Ed. 15 (1952). In that case the power company applied for a license for a project which included, <em>inter alia, </em>two transmission lines. The FPC authorized the project but imposed the condition that the licensee permit the United States to connect with the transmission facilities and transfer power generated at its own plants over the licensee\u2019s lines. In discussing Part I of the Federal Power Act, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1E\">\u201cUnder these sections the Commission is plainly made the guardian of the public domain. The requirement that existing lines be fully utilized before additional lines are authorized would seem to be relevant to a decision under \u00a7 10 (a) that the project submitted was consonant with the \u2018comprehensive plan\u2019 for the waterway. And the Commission might well determine under \u00a7 4(g) that if public lands are to be used for the transmission of power, conservation of the \u2018water-power resources of the region\u2019 requires that public power as well as private power be transmitted over them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-6\">Sections 4 and 10 speak specifically of the public domain \u2014 waterways and public lands. Section 6 makes each license subject to all the terms and conditions of tl.j Act and to \u2018such further conditions, if any, as the Commission shall prescribe in conformity with this Act * * Section 6, read in the context of \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 10, would seem to give ample authority to the Commission to attach the conditions imposed here. Protection of the public domain, conservation of waterpower resources, development of comprehensive plans for the waterways \u2014 each of these might on the facts of a case be sufficient to authorize the grant of permission to a public utility company to use the public domain provided it agreed to use its excess capacity to transmit government power.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1009-8\">Petitioner seeks to distinguish that case upon the ground that there the condition attached to the license as originally issued. Here, it is asserted, the license issued included and contemplated the construction of necessary transmission lines. The future licensing of transmission lines was not reserved, it is asserted; what was reserved was only the right \u201cto determine at a later date\u201d what transmission lines \u201cshall be covered in this license and included as part of the project works.\u201d Our attention is directed to \u00a7 6 of the Federal Power Act, 49 Stat. 841 (1935), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 799 (1958), providing that \u201cLicenses may be altered * * * only upon mutual agreement between the licensee and the Commission * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-10\">Petitioner contends that the license as issued must be construed to include such transmission lines as are necessary, since anything less would leave the project incomplete; that the imposition of the wheeling condition amounts to an \u201calteration\u201d of the license, or to a refusal to do that which is essential to its completion unless petitioner submits to an alteration. This, petitioner contends, is alteration of the license by duress and not by agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-11\">We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-12\">These transmission lines are not, as petitioner argues, included within the license; they have been expressly withheld. No agreement has been reached as to them. If they are to be included the license must be amended to include them. Reasonable conditions can be attached to an amendment of the license, Montana Power Co. v. F.P.C., 112 U.S.App.D.C. 7, 298 F.2d 335 (1962), as well as to its original issuance, Federal Power Act \u00a7 204, 49 Stat. 841 (1935), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 799 (1958), and the reservation of a licensing of transmission lines reserves the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>right to attach reasonable conditions to the amendment by which they are licensed. If such conditions relate to the subject of the amendment, they then relate to that upon which agreement has been withheld, and do not constitute an \u201calteration\u201d of that which had already been agreed upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\"> The fact that the wheeling requirement attaches to already licensed transmission lines, as well as to those approved by the amendment, does not render the requirement to that extent unrelated to and an unreasonable condition of the amendment. The Commission as \u201cguardian of the public domain\u201d has simply and reasonably required \u201cthat existing lines be fully utilized before additional lines are authorized.\u201d F.P.C. v. Idaho Power Co., 344 U.S. 17, 23, 73 S.Ct. 85, 88, 97 L.Ed. 15 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">The order of the Commission is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1007-21\">. \u201cWheeling\u201d is the transmission of one company\u2019s power over another company\u2019s system.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
