Count 1 of the same indictment charging appellant with aiding and abetting his co-defendant Felix in obtaining the latter\u2019s unlawful entry into the United States was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-25\">The Trial Court had jurisdiction under said \u00a7 174, and under Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. This Court has jurisdiction under Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 1294.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-26\">Appellant on this appeal assigns two alleged errors: (1) that the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>used to convict the appellant was obtained by unreasonable search and seizure, and (2) that the court misled the jury by comment and failed to properly instruct on possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">Immigration inspectors have authority without a warrant to interrogate, search or arrest aliens in pursuance of the inspectors\u2019 duty to detect and prevent unlawful immigration of aliens. 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1357(a) and (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">Appellant at the time of the trial was a Mexican national, then and for about four years a resident of Chula Vista, California, about five miles from Tijuana, Mexico. He had resided in this country 18 years during which time he said he had been employed principally as a truck driver, but due to his employer\u2019s recent economy measures, his truck driving employment was terminated and then he took up the business of collecting and selling wooden boxes. During his Chula Vista residence, he had almost daily visited Tijuana, Mexico where about as often he saw and associated with his co-defendant Felix. After only a few months in that box business, he said he took a vacation and went to Central Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">On January 23, 1964, while returning from his Mexican vacation, appellant happened to meet on Miguel Aleman Bridge in Mexicali, Mexico his friend Felix who joined appellant in appellant\u2019s car, and they drove to the home of appellant\u2019s cousins\u2019 family in Mexicali where they had breakfast and visited. Felix accepted appellant\u2019s invitation to return to Tijuana with appellant, and they, in appellant\u2019s car, began that trip stopping at a gasoline filling station in Mexicali, Mexico. Felix at the trial testified for the government and stated that when he got in appellant\u2019s car and later when they stopped at that filling station, he saw on appellant\u2019s car seat a cigarette package or box. He said that after they left the filling station, appellant suggested that, because appellant\u2019s car was not working very well, they, instead of going to Tijuana, drive from Mexicali, Mexico to Los Angeles, which they undertook to do. Felix further testified that they crossed the Mexican-California line; that while travelling appellant gave Felix that cigarette box and stated that it contained heroin; that later when they observed a patrol car trailing them, appellant requested Felix to put the cigarette box in his pocket which Felix did; and that from the time they left Mexico they made no stops and met no one, but drove continuously on northward until detained by the immigration inspectors at a check point, now to be more fully explained.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">As an immigration roving checking unit, immigration patrol inspectors Farnan and Sweeney on said January 23d were in the course of their official duty as such inspectors working at or near an immigration check point on Highway 99 in California about 45 miles northward from the Mexican border at Mexicali. At that check point there is normally maintained a road block where northbound cars are halted and inspected by immigration inspectors, but, because of that day\u2019s high wind and the inspectors\u2019 fear that thereby the movable roadblock structures would be blown across the road and cause a traffic hazard, inspectors Farnan and Sweeney did not on that occasion block the highway. Instead, in order to facilitate their inspection work on that day, they in their official vehicle moved about on the highway and at times temporarily parked their vehicle so as to observe passing vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">About noontime on the above stated date, the inspectors observed a northbound car passing the place where the inspectors were parked. Two men were in the car, clothing was hanging in the back section of the car, and inspector Farnan testified the car \u201cfitted a pattern that we watch for\u201d. The inspectors decided to question the car\u2019s occupants respecting their citizenship, and in order to do so they drove their official vehicle after the car and by using the official vehicle\u2019s stop flash caused that northbound car to pull over and stop by the roadside.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>Thereupon, both of the persons in that stopped car stepped out of it, walked back towards the inspectors\u2019 vehicle, were met by and frankly talked with the inspectors, and disclosed that one of them was appellant who was the driver of the stopped car and that the other was Felix who was a passenger in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">Felix let inspector Farnan see a folder containing several things including Felix\u2019s 1-186 border-crossing card. The wind conditions interfered with talking outside, so Farnan invited Felix to sit in the inspectors\u2019 patrol car. As Felix was being there questioned by inspector Farnan and while the latter was examining the contents of Felix\u2019s folder, Farnan learned from inspector Sweeney who had been talking with the appellant that luggage belonging to Felix was in the stopped car. This led Farnan to believe that Felix might be planning to violate his immigration status by overstaying in the United States the time allowed to him as a holder of an 1-186 border-crossing card, and also to believe that Felix might be planning to seek employment while in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">Pursuing that belief, Farnan continued to question Felix, and after a short time he surprised inspector Farnan by frankly stating he intended to overstay the time allowed him by his 1-186 border pass. Thereupon, Farnan told Felix he had entered intending to violate his status and that the inspectors would have to return him to Mexico. As they talked, Farnan noticed that Felix was holding in his hand a small notebook which upon Farnan\u2019s request to see it Felix hesitatingly gave to Farnan who was looking for other documents, such as possibly a social security card or something, to show whether Felix had been working in this country and was then returning to his job here.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">As Felix handed over that notebook, Farnan noticed that he was trembling, and as Farnan looked through the notebook once he observed that Felix was \u201cnear to hysteria\u201d, and upon Farnan\u2019s going through the notebook a second time, he saw in it a small package which he opened and found in it a powdery substance. Farnan then asked Felix if he was an addict and if that powdery substance was heroin, and Felix answered \u201cyes\u201d to both questions. Farnan estimated that only three to four minutes elapsed between the time Felix entered the inspectors\u2019 vehicle and the time of his discovering the heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">Thereupon, Farnan and Felix stepped out of the inspectors\u2019 vehicle and a search was made which further disclosed in Felix\u2019s pocket-the above mentioned cigarette box containing a contraceptive with powdery contents later identified as heroin. A search was made of appellant also, but no narcotics were found on his person. Both Felix and appellant were then by the inspectors formally taken into custody, which as well as the search and seizure of the heroin was without a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">While appellant and Felix were confined in the El Centro jail following their arrest, appellant wrote several incriminating notes to Felix urging him to tell the authorities that appellant had nothing to do with the charges and \u201ctell them that I do not know nothing about nothing\u201d, and urging him to make other false statements favorable to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-11\">It seems clear to us, considering the fruits of inspector Farnan\u2019s inspection of Felix\u2019s effects and papers including the heroin taken from Felix\u2019s notebook and Felix\u2019s \u201cyes\u201d answers to Farnan\u2019s questions whether Felix was an addict and whether the powdery substance received from Felix\u2019s notebook was heroin, that Farnan had ample probable cause to believe a crime was then being committed by Felix, that thereupon Farnan was justified and acted reasonably in arresting Felix and in searching him and seizing from his person said cigarette box with its heroin contents, that the arrest of Felix was a lawful arrest, and that such search and seizure were incident to that lawful arrest. We conclude that such evidence so obtained by inspector Farnan from Felix which was used to convict appellant was not in fact or law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>obtained by unreasonable search and seizure, and that on the contrary such evidence so obtained from Felix was obtained reasonably, and upon probable cause for the inspectors to believe that appellant was then committing a crime, and upon all the related evidence then before the Court was properly admitted against appellant at the trial as further indicated below.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">Respecting appellant\u2019s first error assignment that the evidence<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> used to convict him was obtained by unreasonable search and seizure, we emphasize that the inspectors had before appellant was arrested intercepted the car in which appellant and Felix were travelling on a thoroughfare leading from the Mexican border northward through the Imperial Valley to the Los Angeles area, which was widely known for its large number of Mexican residents and extensive narcotics trade. The inspectors before stopping the car observed that those in it were Mexicans, and before appellant was arrested the inspectors knew that he was the driver of the car, that Felix was a passenger in it, that Felix had shown his border-crossing card Form 1-186 to inspector Farnan and had told Farnan of his intention to overstay the time limit of his border-crossing card, that Farnan Lad</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-5\">\u201ctold him (Felix) he had entered the country illegally when he entered to violate his status. And I (Farnan) told him we were going to have to return him to Mexico. We talked, and he (Felix) indicated that he was familiar with our practice on these things, which is merely to return the Mexican National back to the Border and let them go back\u201d (Parentheses added),</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">and that Felix had had on his person the narcotics just received by Farnan from Felix during the inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">It could have reasonably been believed by the inspectors, as it undoubtedly was, and as it probably would have been by any person of reasonable experience, prudence and caution, that appellant and Felix, travelling together in appellant\u2019s car, were collaborating in smuggling heroin from Mexico into this country for the Los Angeles area. Those officers applying ordinarily prudent and cautious consideration to the situation at hand probably believed, as they reasonably could have, that Felix by possessing the heroin and appellant by in his car transporting Felix, the possessor of the heroin before it was received from him by the inspectors, were and had been at all material times before the heroin left Felix\u2019s possession making common cause in smuggling the contraband into this country from Mexico and in furthering its movement to destination, and that when the car was intercepted and when the narcotics were received from Felix before appellant\u2019s arrest he was, with Felix, an active partner knowingly participating with Felix in committing the smuggling crime and, on the same smuggling trip, in further pursuing the uncompleted related plan of putting the heroin into the Los Angeles narcotics trade. Grier v. United States, 9 Cir., 1965, 345 F.2d 523 (decided May 11, 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">The inspectors, although looking for written information concerning Felix\u2019s citizenship and right to be in this country, were not required to blind their eyes and refuse to see the heroin given to Farnan among Felix\u2019s effects and papers shown to Farnan in response to the latter\u2019s proper request to see Felix\u2019s citizenship papers.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-11\">We hold that the narcotics evidence received from Felix and admitted at the trial over appellant\u2019s objection was properly admitted, and that appellant\u2019s first assigned error must be and is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-12\"> As to appellant\u2019s second assignment of error relating to the Trial Court\u2019s comment to the jury, we have carefully reviewed the record, and find that the only such comment made was innocuous and harmless, being obviously on<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>ly a correct explanation of the state of the record rather than a comment on the credibility or weight of any evidence; and that respecting appellant\u2019s contention that the Trial Court failed to properly instruct the jury by omitting to define constructive possession, we believe that, from the instructions given, the jury was not left inadequately advised of the meaning of constructive possession. That is strongly indicated by the fact that appellant\u2019s counsel, Mr. Tatus, upon the Trial Court\u2019s concluding its instructions to the jury and before the jury retired to deliberate upon its. verdict, was asked by the Trial Court \u201cMr. Tatus, do you have any objections to the instructions given, or to the omission of any instructions * * \u201d, and to that Mr. Tatus answered \u201cI have no objections to the instructions given or omissions\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\">Additionally, we here point out that, respecting the second assigned error relating to the Trial Court\u2019s alleged failure to properly instruct the jury on the meaning of constructive possession, appellant has not complied with Rule 30, F.R.Cr.P., providing that a party may not assign as error any part of the instructions given or any omission therefrom</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXl\">\u201cunless he objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which he objects and the grounds of his objection\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Appellant has failed to sustain his second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">The action of the Trial Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b906-8\">. The evidence relating to heroin received from Felix was admitted at the trial over appellant\u2019s objection. His motion to strike was denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b907-7\">JERTBERG, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Ahl\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">I concur in the result reached in the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">Section 1357, Title 8 U.S.C., provides in pertinent part that any officer or employee of the Immigration Service has the power, without warrant\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-10\">\u201c(1) to interrogate any alien or person believed to be an alien as to his right to be or to remain in the United States; * * *;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-13\">\u201c(3) within a reasonable distance from any external boundary of the United States, to board and search for aliens * * * any * * * vehicle, * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b907-14\">It was under such authority that the appellant and his passenger, Felix, were stopped and interrogated by the immigation inspectors. See Fernandez v. United States, 321 F.2d 283 (9th Cir., 1963). During the interrogation by the inspector of Felix concerning his status in the United States, Felix voluntarily handed to the immigration inspector a small notebook in which, among other things, was a small package which contained a powdery substance which Felix stated was heroin. In my view such facts constituted probable cause for the inspector to search the person of Felix. Such search revealed in Felix\u2019s pocket a cigarette box containing a powdery substance which was later identified as heroin. Such search was reasonable and based upon probable cause. In these circumstances the District Judge properly overruled appellant\u2019s objections to the introduction into evidence of the heroin obtained from Felix.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
