Hudgins, the claimant, filed an application with the Department of Health, Education and Welfare seeking to establish a period of disability and to collect insurance benefits under the provisions of Title II of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 401ff. After several administrative hearings, including a hearing before an examiner, the Hearing Examiner denied Hudgins\u2019s application. The Appeals Council, Bureau of Hearings and Appeals, declined to review the decision of the Hearing Examiner. Hudgins filed suit in the United States District Court for judicial review of the decision of the Hearing Examiner. The Secretary, who had been made a party to the suit, moved that the district court remand the case to the department for the taking of further evidence. After receiving additional evidence, the Hearing Examiner again denied Hudgins\u2019s application and the Appeals Council rendered a decision affirming the Hearing Examiner. Thereupon the decision of the Appeals Council became the \u201cfinal decision\u201d of the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-17\">In the opinion below, the district court noted that it had \u201ccarefully reviewed\u201d the record in this case, including a 215-page transcript, the pleadings, and \u201cvery able briefs filed by both parties\u201d. The court concluded that the decision of the Secretary was not supported by substantial evidence and should be reversed. This Court, too, has carefully reviewed the record and briefs. There is little, if anything, that we can add to the opinion of the district court. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
