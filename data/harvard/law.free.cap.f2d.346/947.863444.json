Incorporated in 1920, the defendant is engaged in the business of furnishing its 13,900 refrigerator cars and their refrigeration, heat and other protective service to sixty-seven railroads. It also provides the service stated to refrigerator cars owned by others.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It engages independent contractors, such as Rubel to perform the service. It does not engage in the business of transporting cargo or passengers in intrastate or interstate commerce. It does not own any track, rolling stock, or motive power except that used and maintained in its own repair yards.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-4\">At the time here relevant it had outstanding 109,121 shares of stock owned by nineteen railroads. Its business has been independently operated, at all times, by its own officers and employees, free of control or direction by any of its railroad stockholders. Its board of directors does not interlock with the boards of its stockholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">It charges a uniform rate to the railroads for the furnishing of its refrigerator cars. The rate is fixed by the Association of American Railroads.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">At the time of the accident no employee of the defendant was present. The defendant had no control over the \u201cicing\u201d operation in which the decedent was employed nor did it attempt to exercise any control. The decedent was employed only by Rubel and was solely under Rubel\u2019s control.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-10\">On this appeal the plaintiff urges that (1) the defendant is a \u201ccommon carrier by railroad\u201d because it furnishes its refrigerator cars and servicing operations to common carriers by railroad and is wholly owned by railroads; (2) the \u201cicing\u201d service furnished by Rubel under its contract with the defendant was a non-delegable duty of the defendant, and since \u00a7 55 of the Act prohibits a \u201ccommon carrier by railroad\u201d from delegating its duties by contract, the decedent was, accordingly, an \u201cemployee\u201d of the defendant within the meaning of the Act, and (3) the defendant breached its duty to provide the decedent with a \u201csafe place to work\u201d in violation of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-11\">We are of the opinion that the District Court correctly held that the defendant is not a \u201ccommon carrier by railroad\u201d within the meaning of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-12\">We need go no further than to cite Gaulden v. Southern Pac. Co., 78 F.Supp. 651 (N.D.Cal.1948), aff\u2019d per cur. 174 F.2d 1022 (9 Cir. 1949), where it was held that the Pacific Fruit Express Company, which conducted a business similar in all critical aspects to that of the defendant, here, and which was also wholly owned by railroads, was not a \u201ccommon carrier by railroad\u201d within the meaning of the Act. It would serve no useful purpose to here restate what was so well said in Gaulden in its analysis and application of the Act or to make repetitious reference to the cases therein cited in support of the court\u2019s holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>It should be noted that a similar result was reached in Moleton v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., 118 Utah 107, 219 P.2d 1080 (1950), cert. den. 340 U.S. 932, 71 S.Ct. 495, 95 L.Ed. 672 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">Further, even assuming, arguendo, that the defendant is a \u201ccommon carrier by railroad\u201d, we are of the opinion that the District Court correctly held that the decedent was not an \u201cemployee\u201d of the defendant at the time he was injured, within the meaning of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">It is the plaintiff\u2019s position that while the decedent was employed by Rubel, an independent contractor, he was, at the time of the accident, also an \u201cemployee\u201d of the defendant \u201cpro hac vice.\u201d Citing Sinkler v. Missouri Pacific Railroad Company, 356 U.S. 326, 78 S.Ct. 758, 2 L.Ed.2d 799 (1958), she urges that the words \u201cemployee\u201d and \u201cemployed\u201d have no special significance, and they are not limited to describing persons working solely for a \u201ccommon carrier by railroad\u201d. She says that the decedent, at the time of the accident, \u201cwas doing the work that defendant was legally bound to do as a common carrier and [which was] traditionally performed by railroad employees;\u201d and that being so, he was within the protection of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">The Act provides in relevant part in \u00a7 51 that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-7\"><em>\u201cEvery common carrier by railroad </em>while engaging in * * * [interstate commerce] shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury <em>while he is employed </em>by such carrier in such commerce, or, in case of the death of such employee, to his or her personal representative, for the benefit of the surviving widow or husband and children of such <em>employee. </em>* * *\u201d (emphasis supplied),</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8Q\">and in \u00a7 55:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-8\">\u201cAny contract, rule, regulation, or device whatsoever, the purpose or intent of which shall be to enable any common carrier to exempt itself from any liability created by this chapter, shall to that extent be void.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-11\">\u2022* * *\u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1000-12\">In Robinson v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Company, 237 U.S. 84, 35 S.Ct. 491, 59 L.Ed. 849 (1915) where the meaning of \u201cemployee\u201d was at issue, it was said (p. 94, 35 S.Ct. p. 494):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-13\">\u201c * * * Congress used the words \u2018employee\u2019 and \u2018employed\u2019 in the statute in their natural sense, and intended to describe the conventional relation of employer and employee. It was well known that there were on interstate trains persons engaged in various services for other masters. Congress, familiar with this situation, did not use any appropriate expression which could be taken to indicate a purpose to include such persons among those to whom the railroad company was to be liable under the act.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1000-15\">It was there held that a porter on a railroad car owned by the Pullman Company, who was \u201chired, directed, and paid\u201d by Pullman, was not an \u201cemployee\u201d of the railroad even though the Pullman car was part of an interstate train and the porter had regularly collected tickets for the railroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-16\">In Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Company v. Bond, 240 U.S. 449, 36 S.Ct. 403, 60 L.Ed. 735 (1916) one Turner, determined by the Court to be an \u201cindependent contractor\u201d, was hired by the railroad to remove coal from its cars to be placed in coal chutes for use on its engines. He was killed while walking along the railroad\u2019s track when a train backed into him and ran him down. It was held that there was no liability under the Act, regardless of \u201cwhether the services in which [Turner] was engaged were in interstate commerce\u201d, because \u201cTurner was not an employee of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>the company, but an independent contractor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">We had occasion to consider a similar situation in Del Vecchio v. Pennsylvania Railroad Company, 233 F.2d 2 (1956), cert. den. 352 U.S. 909, 77 S.Ct. 146, 1 L.Ed.2d 117. There, the Northern Contracting Company was engaged by the defendant to handle coal which had been brought to its railroad pier to be loaded onto waiting vessels, for transshipment. On our holding that Northern was an \u201cindependent contractor\u201d, recovery was denied under the Act to its employee injured while performing its work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">In Norman v. Spokane-Portland &amp; Seattle Ry. Co., 101 F.Supp. 350 (D.Or. 1950), aff\u2019d per cur. 192 F.2d 1020 (9 Cir. 1951), cert. den. 342 U.S. 945, 72 5. Ct. 559, 96 L.Ed. 703 (1952), the plaintiff, an employee of the Gilpin Construction Company, was injured while doing repair work on a railroad bridge and trestle. There, too, it was contended that the railroad had a nondelegable duty to do the work involved, and that, therefore, any workman who performed it came within the protection of the Act despite the fact that he was an employee of an independent contractor. In rejecting this contention it was said (p. 352):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-8\">\u201cOf the hundreds of cases which have been reviewed by the court, none suggests that an employee of a true independent contractor erecting or repairing a bridge on a right of way becomes an employee of the railroad company because the duty of construction and repair of such bridges cannot be delegated. <em>No case suggests that the employee of an independent contractor becomes an employee pro hac vice under such circumstances. </em>* * * [E]mployees of the contractor do not become employees of the railroad by any legal theory. This does not derogate from the duty of the railroad to construct and repair such structures. But the duty is not to plaintiff but to its passengers.\u201d emphasis supplied) <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATA\">In Kelly v. Delaware River Joint Commission, 85 F.Supp. 15 (E.D.Pa.l949) the plaintiff, an employee of J. I. Hass Co., Inc., an independent contractor, was injured while painting part of the structure overhanging the Philadelphia Transportation Company\u2019s right of way across the Delaware River Bridge connecting Philadelphia and Camden, New Jersey. It was contended that the plaintiff\u2019s employer was engaged in a joint enterprise with two common carriers by railroad and that therefore he was \u201cemployed\u201d within the meaning of the Act. The Court, in granting the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, said (pp. 17-18):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AR_\">\u201cMere participation in interstate commerce or in assisting in the maintenance of a \u2018common carrier by railroad\u2019 does not make J. I. Hass Co., Inc., such a \u2018common carrier by railroad.\u2019 * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-13\">There is no allegation that there was any employer-employee relationship between plaintiff and either of the two \u2018common carrier\u2019 defendants. No suit can be entertained against the \u2018common carrier\u2019 if the injury is sustained by an employee of an independent contractor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1001-14\">The sum of the foregoing cases, and we have found none to the contrary, is that one who is employed by an independent contractor is not an \u201cemployee\u201d of, or \u201cemployed\u201d by, a \u201ccommon carrier by railroad\u201d merely because the activity in which he is engaged at the time of his injury is such that it could be characterized as an integral part of the railroad\u2019s business, or in the words of the present plaintiff, \u201cwork that defendant was legally bound to do as a common carrier and [which was] tradi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>tionally performed by railroad employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">This, too, must be said:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">Sinkler v. Missouri Pacific Railroad Co., supra, heavily relied on by the plaintiff, is inapposite. That case did not consider the question of who is an \u201cemployee\u201d of the railroad for purposes of the Act, but rather was concerned with who are \u201cagents\u201d of the railroad for determining liability to one clearly an \u201cemployee\u201d. Baker v. Texas &amp; Pacific Railway Co., 359 U.S. 227, 79 S.Ct. 664, 3 L.Ed.2d 756 (1959), decided after Sinkler, makes it abundantly clear that the interpretation of the words \u201cemployed\u201d and \u201cemployee\u201d found in Robinson v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Company, supra, and applied by its progeny, is still the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">Since the facts in the instant case establish that the decedent was not an \u201cemployee\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 51 of the Act, \u00a7 55 is inapplicable here. Robinson v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Company, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-7\">For the reasons stated the Order of the District Court entered January 13, 1964, dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action, will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b998-10\">. 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 51 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b998-11\">. Other points presented in the plaintiff\u2019s brief asserted under the laws of the State of New Jersey have been abandoned.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b998-12\">. The truck was parked parallel to, and alongside, a railroad track in a railroad yard of the Pennsylvania Railroad in Jersey City, N.J.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-13\">In the operation in which the decedent and a fellow employee were engaged, it was necessary to crush into small pieces, cakes of ice forming the cargo of the truck, by means of a gasoline engine driven crusher affixed to the inner side of the body of the truck. The operation involved the placing of large pieces of ice into a vertical hopper, above the grinding mechanism of the crusher, by which they were normally fed by gravity into and through the throat of the hopper, where they were ground and crushed by a horizontally revolving cylinder with metal spokes protruding from the circumference of the cylinder, which shredded or reduced to small size the pieces of ice as they came between the revolving cylinder or base of the hopper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYtO\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>While attempting to insert or assist the movement of a piece of ice into the hopper, a rubber glove, which the decedent was wearing to protect his hands from the cold of the ice, was caught by one of the revolving sticks of the cylinder. His hand was drawn into the hopper and he suffered injuries which necessitated the amputation of one arm a short distance below the shoulder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b999-8\">He thereafter made application for, and was awarded or received by voluntary payment, workmen\u2019s compensation from or on account of his employer, Rubel, \u25a0upon the basis of a permanent disability consisting of a hundred per cent of the left arm and two per cent of total disability neurological.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b999-15\">He died February 22, 1960, some twenty-two months after the accident. Alleging that his death was the result of this accident, the instant action was thereafter timely filed insofar as claims asserted under the FELA are concerned.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b999-16\">. The refrigerator car which was being \u201ciced\u201d at the time of the accident was owned by the Western Fruit Express Company.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1000-9\">. The continued vitality of this interpretation of the statute is evidenced by Baker v. Texas &amp; Pacific Railway Co., 359 U.S. 227, 228, 79 S.Ct. 664, 3 L.Ed.2d 756 (1959); Mazzucola v. Pennsylvania Railroad Company, 281 F.2d 267, 269, 91 A.L.R.2d 518 (3 Cir. 1960); Byrne v. Pennsylvania Railroad Company, 262 F.2d 906, 911, 912 (3 Cir. 1958), cert. den. 359 U.S. 960, 79 S.Ct. 798, 3 L.Ed.2d 766 (1959).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1001-10\">. A similar result was reached in Dougall v. Spokane, P. &amp; S. Ry. Co., 207 F.2d 843 (9 Cir. 1953), cert. den. 347 U.S. 904, 74 S.Ct. 429, 98 L.Ed. 1063 (1954). There the plaintiff was injured while in the employ of an independent contractor engaged by the railroad to carry out certain maintenance activities on its roadway and right of way.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1002-8\">BIGGS, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AIL\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-9\">I concur in the view expressed in the majority opinion that Fruit Growers Express Company is not a \u201ccommon carrier by railroad\u201d. Gaulden v. Southern Pac. Co., 78 F.Supp. 651 (N.D.Cal.1948), aff\u2019d per curiam, 174 F.2d 1022 (9 Cir. 1949), is on all fours with the case at bar on this issue and was, I think, correctly decided. The opinion of the court could have stopped here for, with the decision of the court on this point, the case is at an end.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-10\">In respect to the second issue decided by this court that Hetman was not an employee of Fruit Growers at the time of the accident, I state that I do not understand the court\u2019s ruling to encroach upon our decision in Byrne v. Pennsylvania R. R., 262 F.2d 906 (1958), cert. denied, 359 U.S. 960, 79 S.Ct. 798, 3 L.Ed. 2d 766 (1959), for the decision in the cited case turned largely on the extent of the control exercised by the Railroad over Byrne, while in the case at bar it is neither alleged nor asserted that Fruit Growers exerted any measure of control over Hetman.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
