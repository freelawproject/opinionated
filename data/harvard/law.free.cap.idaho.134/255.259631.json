The Industrial Commission denied the claim on the basis that the claimant\u2019s injuries were pre-existing. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">On the evening of July 3, 1996, claimant Larry K. Barrett (Barrett) of the Nampa City Fire Department (Fire Department) responded with two other firemen to a brush fire in Nampa. Upon arriving, the firemen began pulling water hoses off the fire truck to contain the fire. As the firemen entered the field, each in turn fell into an irrigation ditch which was covered with weeds. Barrett testified that he fell into the ditch headfirst, hitting his head and knocking his helmet off. When the fire was extinguished, Barrett entered the following into the daily log book: \u201cKelsar fell in ditch on fire cut head, Barrett fell in ditch and hit head and snapped neck with fall, Ebbers fell in ditch didn\u2019t seem to have and [sic] problems.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">At the time of the injury, Barrett had been employed by the Fire Department for twenty-one years. He was a battalion chief and was responsible for keeping a log of daily activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">In 1993, Barrett had been involved in an automobile accident which injured his knee and back. Because of persistent neck stiffness and restricted left-arm movement, Barrett sought chiropractic cervical adjustments periodically. On May 31, 1996, Barrett consulted with Dr. Walker, a chiropractor, concerning the onset of arm tingling and neck pain. On July 3, 1996, prior to his falling into the ditch, Barrett met with Dr. Gary D. Botimer who had operated on Barrett\u2019s knee following the car accident. Dr. Botimer\u2019s notes of that visit relate that Barrett was complaining of pain in his neck and pain down his forearms. Dr. Botimer examined Barrett and told him that if the pain persisted Barrett should see Dr. Michael Djemes, a neurologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">A week later, Barrett went to see Dr. Djemes concerning pain in his neck and numbness and tingling in some of his fingers. Both the doctor\u2019s and the nurse\u2019s notes indicate that Barrett could not identify any specific event which could have caused his pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">On October 18,1996, Barrett filed a Notice of Injury and Claim for Benefits relating to pain in his neck and arms. Around the same time, Barrett filled out a Supervisor\u2019s Accident Report form. On July 27,1997, Barrett filed a Worker\u2019s Compensation complaint, listing the Nampa Fue Department and the State Insurance Fund (respondents) as his employer and its insurance carrier. A hearing was held on February 8, 1998. On September 4,1998, the hearing referee entered a recommendation that Barrett\u2019s claim be denied because Barrett had failed to prove that his injuries resulted from his July 3, 1996 fall. The Industrial Commission adopted the referee\u2019s findings and entered an order denying the claim on November 10,1998. Following the Industrial Commission\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration, Barrett appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-13\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b294-14\">When this Court reviews a decision from the Industrial Commission, it exercises free review over questions of law but reviews questions of fact only to determine whether substantial and competent evidence supports the Commission\u2019s findings. <em>Ogden v. Thompson, </em>128 Idaho 87, 88, 910 P.2d 759, 760 (1996). Substantial and competent evidence is \u201crelevant evidence which a reason-' able mind might accept to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Boise Orthopedic Clinic v. Idah</em>o <em>State Ins. Fund (In re </em>Wilson), 128 Idaho 161,164, 911 P.2d 754, 757 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-15\">Whether an injury arose out of the course of employment is a question of fact to be determined by the Commission. <em>Kessler ex rel Kessler v. Payette County, </em>129 Idaho 855, 859, 934 P.2d 28, 32 (1997). The Commission\u2019s conclusions on the credibility and weight of evidence will not be disturbed unless the conclusions are clearly erroneous. <em>Zapata v. J.R. Simplot Co., </em>132 Idaho 513, 515, 975 P.2d 1178, 1180 (1999). On appeal, this Court is not to re-weigh the evidence or consider whether it would have reached a different conclusion from the evidence pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>sented. <em>See Warden v. Idaho Timber Corp., 132 </em>Idaho 454, 457, 974 P.2d 506, 509 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">A. The Decision Of The Industrial Commission To Deny Barrett\u2019s Claim Was Supported By Substantial And Competent Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">The Industrial Commission concluded that Barrett had not provided sufficient evidence to establish that the pain in his neck and arm was the result of his fall on July 3, 1996. Barrett claims that this conclusion is not supported by substantial and competent evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">Contrary to Barrett\u2019s claim, there is substantial and competent evidence to support the Industrial Commission\u2019s conclusion. While the record is replete with support for this conclusion, three examples are particularly eleai\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">First, it is well documented that Barrett had suffered from neck and arm pain prior to his fall on July 3, 1996. Barrett\u2019s testimony from the hearing was that in the afternoon of July 3,1996, he saw Dr. Miller about a minor skin rash. While in the office, Barrett met Dr. Botimer who shared office space with Dr. Miller. Barrett sought Dr. Botimer\u2019s advice concerning his arm tingling. While Barrett maintained that Dr. Botimer did not examine him, the doctor\u2019s chart notes that \u201cLarry was in with pain in his neck. Flexation of his neck causes pain going down to the lateral aspect of the forearm and down to the fourth and fifth fingers.\u201d Barrett also testified that he had been x-rayed during that visit. The x-rays revealed degenerative changes. The x-ray technologist recorded that Barrett complained of \u201cpain down both arms. Numbness &amp; tingling in left arm.\u201d Barrett\u2019s complaints of neck and arm pain hours <em>before </em>he fell into the ditch lend support to the Industrial Commission\u2019s conclusion that Barrett had failed to prove the fall caused his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">The facts surrounding Barrett\u2019s visit to Dr. Djemes\u2019 office, one week after the fall, provide the most compelling evidence to support the Industrial Commission\u2019s findings. Barrett went to see Dr. Djemes on July 10, 1996. The nurse\u2019s notes of that visit reflect that \u201c[pjatient here for check of pain in both forearms and left hand and hand numb and tingling at times. Problem since 5-15-96. No apparent injury.\u201d On cross-examination Barrett admitted that at that appointment he could not recall any incident which could have caused the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-12\">Additionally, the doctor\u2019s notes from that same visit record that \u201c[pjatient states that since May he has been experiencing pain in his forearms. This is particularly bothersome on the left side. He initially thought that he had tendonitis____ He denies any injury which may have triggered or precipitated his symptoms.\u201d As brought out more clearly on cross-examination, Barrett testified that he could not remember, even when prodded by the doctor, about an injury he received one week earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-15\">On October 11, 1996, Barnett went to see Dr. Joseph M. Verska, a neurologist. Barrett testified that prior to the examination, he filled out a questionnaire. When asked \u201cWhen did this most recent episode of neck pain begin?\u201d Barrett responded \u201cMay of \u201996.\u201d Dr. Verska\u2019s notes for the visit state, \u201cLarry works as a fire fighter and had this left aim numbness and tingling that seems to go into his long ring and small finger since an injury in May of 1996.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-16\">When pressed, Barrett admitted that after his claim was denied, he contacted Dr. Verska and had him change the dates in his notes. Barrett stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-17\">Yes I did. That was after workmen\u2019s comp denied it and said there was a problem with the date. I went back and talked with him - I said - all of them I went back and talked to them. At that time - I don\u2019t remember the exact date that that was and said, I told them we have a problem, because they say May is causing the problem. And I said \u201cI told you it was in July.\u201d As far as I knew everybody went back and changed the date to July. Dr. Verska did. He made several references to that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Thus, the record supports the Industrial Commission\u2019s conclusion that Barrett failed to prove that his injuries were caused by his fall into the ditch. First, he was seen by Dr. Botimer for pain in his neck and arms hours <em>before </em>he fell. Then a week later he could not remember any injury which could have caused the pain, and stated that the pain had begun in May of 1996. Finally, he admitted that after his claim was denied he contacted Dr. Verska and \u201cthe others\u201d and had them change the dates in their notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Third, the Industrial Commission determined that the only medical testimony Barrett provided to prove the cause of his injury was from Dr. Verska, at a post-hearing deposition. At the deposition, Dr. Verska was questioned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\">Q. Without the surgery that you feel that he should submit to, is there any way that you can distinguish between the percentage of preexisting and what percentage of impairment the accident caused?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">A, It\u2019s oftentimes very difficult to do so. In these types of situations usually if the - usually what I do is if the car - if an accident or traumatic injury caused the symptoms that require surgery, I try to attribute most of that to the injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">Q. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-8\">A. Someone could make an argument saying five percent or - you know, these kind of interpretations of how much is preexisting is difficult for me to do, but if the gentleman hadn\u2019t had the injury he wouldn\u2019t have required the surgery, therefore, it would have been no big deal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-9\">Q. Okay. So you -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-10\">A. I apportion almost all of it to the injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-11\">Q. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-12\">A. If not ah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-13\">Q. Can we be more specific, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-14\">A. One hundred percent to the injury of July \u201996.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-15\">On cross-examination, however, Dr. Verska admitted that he had not been informed of Barrett\u2019s preexisting injuries. He responded that he had not been told of Barrett\u2019s injury from the car accident, nor of Barrett\u2019s repeated visits to the chiropractor or the other physicians. Finally, he was asked, \u201cDr. Verska, is it possible if you were given the opportunity to review Mr. Barrett\u2019s medical records documenting treatment he received from various medical providers prior to the time you had an opportunity to examine him, that your opinion with respect to causation might change?\u201d To which Dr. Verska replied, \u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-17\">Therefore, the Industrial Commission had sufficient reason to conclude that the only medical witness to testify as to the causation of the injury had based his opinion on substantially less than all of the facts. This testimony supports the Industrial Commission\u2019s finding that Barrett had failed to prove his injury was caused by his fall on July 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-18\">This evidence supports the finding of the referee and the order of denial issued by the Industrial Commission. The decision of the Industrial Commission is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-19\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-20\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b296-21\">The decision of the Industrial Commission to deny Barrett\u2019s claim is supported by substantial and competent evidence. Therefore the decision of the Industrial Commission is affirmed. Costs are awarded to respondents.</p>\n<judges id=\"b296-22\">Chief Justice TROUT and Justices SILAK, SCHROEDER, and WALTERS, concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
