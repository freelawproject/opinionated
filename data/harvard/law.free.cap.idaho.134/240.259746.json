On January 27,1995, Kathy Vawter, Employer Compliance Specialist for the Commission, sent a letter informing Quick the Commission had no record of worker\u2019s compensation in effect for Quick, and penalties could be imposed for failure to maintain coverage. After receiving further information regarding Quick\u2019s alleged use of non-exempt employees without maintaining coverage for worker\u2019s compensation, the ease was assigned to Lola Tucker, Employer Compliance Investigator, for investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-12\">On December 19, 1996, Tucker visited Quick\u2019s business location in Payette, Idaho. During this visit, Tucker was informed that Quick had no non-exempt employees. Tucker asked Quick to provide a list of all corporate officers, then* titles, and percentages of ownership in the corporation. One of Quick\u2019s officers, Mary Cradduck, agreed to provide the requested documentation. On January 27,1997, having not yet received the requested information, Tucker sent a letter to Quick again requesting the documentation and advising Quick of the applicable penalties for failure to maintain worker\u2019s compensation coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-14\">In February 1997, the compliance department received some information from Mary Cradduck. A letter was then sent to Quick requesting updated information and notifying Quick that, based on the information in the possession of the compliance department, it appeared Quick was using non-exempt employees in violation of Idaho\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation law. The letter also informed Quick of the compliance department\u2019s decision to assess penalties for the violation and that the matter had been referred to the Attorney General\u2019s office for legal action. There is nothing in the record to indicate the Commission held a hearing or approved in writing the findings contained in the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-15\">On March 26, 1997, the Commission filed a complaint in district court alleging Quick had violated the worker\u2019s compensation statutes by employing individuals without a policy of worker\u2019s compensation insurance in effect. The complaint sought statutory penalties for the period of the violation, as well as an injunction. Later, the magistrate judge issued an order allowing the Commission to amend its complaint in order to increase the period of violation and the penalty amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-16\">Both the Commission and Quick filed motions for summary judgment. On October 16, 1997, the magistrate judge issued an order granting Quick\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissing the Commission\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Following this decision, the Commission filed a motion for reconsideration, which was ultimately denied. Next, the Commission filed a notice of appeal with the district court. After briefing and argument, the district judge affirmed the magistrate judge\u2019s decision dismissing the Commission\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. This appeal then followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>ii.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">When reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment, this Court employs the same standard properly employed by the trial court when ruling on the motion. <em>Student Loan Fund of Idaho v. Duerner, </em>131 Idaho 45, 49, 951 P.2d 1272, 1276 (1997). Summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id </em>Additionally, the record must be liberally construed in favor of the party opposing summary judgment, drawing all reasonable inferences and conclusions supported by the record in favor of that party. <em>Id. </em>Finally, when this Court reviews the decision of a district judge rendered in his appellate capacity, the Court reviews the record of the trial court independently of, but with due <em>regard for, </em>the district judge\u2019s decision. <em>Wilson v. Wilson, </em>131 Idaho 533, 535, 960 P.2d 1262, 1264 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Because the magistrate judge granted the motion for summary judgment based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction, we must decide whether, under I.C. \u00a7 72-707 and our prior decisions, the Commission had exclusive jurisdiction over the question of whether a violation had occurred, the duration of the violation, and the amount of penalties to be assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">1. The magistrate judge erred in concluding he lacked subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">A. <em>I.C. \u00a7 72-707 does not bar the magistrate judge from hearing this case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">The magistrate judge determined the Commission had exclusive jurisdiction over this case based upon the language of I.C. \u00a7 72-707. The statute provides: \u201cAll questions arising under this law, if not settled by agreement or stipulation of the interested parties with the approval of the commission, except as otherwise herein provided, shall be determined by the commission.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 72-707. The Commission argues the magistrate judge incorrectly interpreted this provision because this exclusive grant of jurisdiction was intended to apply only to eases involving injured worker disputes. The Commission asserts the magistrate judge\u2019s interpretation is incorrect because it requires reading the statute out of context with the rest of Chapter 7 of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act. As the Commission notes, with the exception of the workplace safety statutes, all of Chapter 7 deals with the Commission\u2019s role in deciding injured worker eases, not with the Commission\u2019s role as an executive agency. Therefore, if I.C. \u00a7 72-707 is read in context with the rest of Chapter 7, the Commission argues that the exclusive grant of jurisdiction contained in the statute relates only to those eases involving injured workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-13\">There are two flaws in this argument. First, according to the compiler\u2019s notes to I.C. \u00a7 72-707, the words \u201cthis law\u201d refer to I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 72-101 to 72-805, essentially the entire body of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act. Thus, it appears the legislature\u2019s grant of exclusive jurisdiction to the Commission was intended to cover more than just disputes involving injured workers. From the plain words of the statute, the Commission was intended to have exclusive jurisdiction over all disputes arising under the worker\u2019s compensation statutes, unless the legislature otherwise provided. Secondly, even if the compiler\u2019s notes did not make it clear I.C. \u00a7 72-707 referred to more than just injured worker cases, this Court\u2019s past interpretation of that section would still make the Commission\u2019s position untenable. For example, in <em>Smith v. O/P Transportation, Inc., </em>120 Idaho 123, 814 P.2d 23 (1991), this Court addressed the question of whether the Commission had exclusive jurisdiction to decide if a contract for worker\u2019s compensation insurance existed between the employer and the insurance company. Citing I.C. \u00a7 72-707, the Court held the Commission did have exclusive jurisdiction over the question because the dispute arose under I.C. \u00a7 72-311(2). Therefore, under the plain words of I.C. \u00a7 72-707 and this Court\u2019s interpretation of that statute, the Commission has exclusive jurisdiction over all disputes arising under the work<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>er\u2019s compensation law, unless the legislature has otherwise provided. Because there is no question this ease involves the worker\u2019s compensation statutes, we must next decide whether the legislature has otherwise provided the district court with jurisdiction over disputes arising from I.C. \u00a7 72-319.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">B. <em>Idaho Code \u00a7 72-319 fits within the \u201cexcept as otherwise herein provided\u201d language of I.C \u00a7 72-707.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">At the outset, we note we have never directly addressed the issue of a district court\u2019s jurisdiction under I.C. \u00a7 72-319. In <em>State v. Indian Country Enterprises, </em>130 Idaho 520, 944 P.2d 117 (1997), we addressed the question of whether the Commission could enforce worker\u2019s compensation law on a tribal reservation. The Commission had filed a complaint in district court under I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 72-319(4) and (5) seeking penalties and an injunction against Indian Country Enterprises for employing workers without carrying worker\u2019s compensation insurance as required by I.C. \u00a7 72-301. The district judge dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction. On appeal, we held state courts have jurisdiction over an action to enforce worker\u2019s compensation laws against a tribal member operating a business on the reservation pursuant to 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 290. Our focus in <em>Indian Country </em>was on the jurisdiction of state courts over businesses on a tribal reservation; not on whether the district court, as opposed to the Commission, had jurisdiction under I.C. \u00a7 72-319. Therefore, <em>Indian Country </em>is not dispositive of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The issue of whether I.C. \u00a7 72-319 grants the district court jurisdiction over this case involves a question of statutory interpretation. An interpretation of a statute is a question of law over which the Court exercises free review. <em>State v. Hagerman Water Right Owners, </em>130 Idaho 727, 732, 947 P.2d 400, 405 (1997). If the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, the Court need merely apply the statute without engaging in any statutory construction. <em>Id. </em>However, if it is necessary for the Court to interpret a statute, then it will attempt to ascertain legislative intent. <em>Id. </em>at 733, 947 P.2d at 406. Finally, in construing a statute, this Court may examine the language used, the reasonableness of the proposed interpretations, and the policy behind the statute. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 72-319(4) and (5) provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-9\">(4) Any employer required to secure the payment of compensation under this law, who fails to do so, may be liable for a penalty of either two dollars ($2.00) for each employee for each day or twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for each day during which such failure continues, whichever is greater ... to be recovered for the time during which such failure continued, but for not more than three (3) consecutive years, in an action brought by the commission in the name of the state of Idaho; any amount so collected shall be paid into the industrial administration fund; for this purpose the district court of any county in which the employer carries on any part of its trade or occupation shall have jurisdiction. In determining whether penalties should be assessed or collected for the employer\u2019s failure to secure the payment of compensation, the commission may consider the following factors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-10\">(a) When the employer was notified that such employer\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation insurance coverage had been canceled or that such insurance was required;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-11\">(b) The length of time that elapsed between when the employer was notified that worker\u2019s compensation insurance coverage was required or that such employer\u2019s coverage had been canceled, and the date that such coverage was put into effect;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-12\">(c) Whether the employer is able to document attempts to secure worker\u2019s compensation insurance coverage during the period of time that such employer was without such coverage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-13\">(d) Whether there were prior instances in which the employer failed to keep worker\u2019s compensation insurance in effect or such coverage was canceled, and the reasons for such failure or cancellation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-14\">(e) The reasons that the employer is unable to obtain or keep in effect workei\u2019\u2019s compensation insurance coverage; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>The above factors are not exclusive and the commission may consider any other relevant factor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-4\">(5) If any employer required to secure the payment of compensation under this law is or has been in default under section 72-301, Idaho Code, the employer may be enjoined by the district court of any county in which such employer candes on any part of its trade or occupation from carrying on such business while any default under section 72-301, Idaho Code, exists. All proceedings in the courts under this section are to be brought by the industrial commission in the name of the state of Idaho.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">As is clear from the language of the statute, I.C. \u00a7 72-319 provides the district court with jurisdiction over this case. The statute plainly states employers who are required to carry worker\u2019s compensation insurance and fail to do so may be liable for statutory penalties, and the district court has jurisdiction over an action filed to recover those penalties. The determination of whether to seek penalties lies with the Commission, but the statute does not require the Commission make its determination in its quasi-judicial capacity. Instead, the statute simply lists some of the mitigating factors the Commission is to consider when deciding whether to pursue penalties against an employer who violates I.C. \u00a7 72-301. In this case, the Commission followed the procedure set forth unambiguously in the statute. The Commission, in its executive agency capacity, determined penalties should be assessed against Quick for violating the requirements of I.C. \u00a7 72-301 and forwarded the case to the attorney general\u2019s office. The attorney general then filed this action in district court to collect the statutory penalties against Quick. Under the plain language of the statute, the magistrate judge had jurisdiction to determine if a violation has in fact occurred and the length of the violation. If he had found Quick in violation of I.C. \u00a7 72-301, the magistrate judge could have imposed the statutory penalties<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and could have imposed an injunction against Quick to prevent it from operating the business without the required insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">Quick argues I.C. \u00a7 72-319 does not provide the magistrate judge with jurisdiction over this case, by focusing on the language of I.C. \u00a7 72-707 and this Court\u2019s interpretation of that statute. Quick argues I.C. \u00a7 72-707 deprives the district court of jurisdiction over this case because the question of whether Quick is in fact required to carry worker\u2019s compensation insurance arises under the worker\u2019s compensation law. As noted earlier, I.C. \u00a7 72-707 provides the Commission with exclusive jurisdiction \u201cexcept as otherwise herein provided.\u201d In this case, the legislature has provided otherwise by specifically vesting the district courts with jurisdiction to hear these types of cases, and has not required the Commission to hear the ease in its quasi-judicial capacity prior to bringing an action to assess penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">Quick also argues it will be denied due process if the Commission is allowed to bring the action in district court because it will never have the opportunity to contest the Commission\u2019s decision finding Quick in violation of I.C. \u00a7 72-301. This is an incorrect reading of both the statute and the Commission\u2019s position. Once the Commission decides to bring an action to enforce penalties against an employer it believes is not in compliance with I.C. \u00a7 72-301, the district court then has jurisdiction to decide whether a violation has occurred and the length of the violation. Quick would be entitled to present evidence supporting its position that it was exempt from the requirements of I.C. \u00a7 72-301. While it is true Quick would not be able to contest the amount of any penalty once the magistrate judge has determined the existence of a violation and the length of the violation, that is only because the penalty is set by statute. In fact, the legislature may well have decided to grant the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>jurisdiction over these types of cases so that the Commission is not acting as both prosecutor and judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Finally, Quick argues I.C. \u00a7 72-319 cannot be read to allow the Commission to file an action in district court without first having heard the matter in its judicial capacity because such an interpretation would create a conflict with I.C. \u00a7 72-506. I.C. \u00a7 72-506 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\">(1) Any investigation, inquiry or hearing which the commission has power to undertake or hold may be undertaken or held by or before any member thereof or any hearing officer, referee or examiner appointed by the commission for that purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-6\">(2) Every finding, order, decision or award made by any member, hearing officer, referee, or examiner pursuant to such investigation, inquiry or hearing, when approved and confirmed by the commission, and ordered filed in its office, shall be deemed to be the finding, order, decision or award of the commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Quick therefore argues the \u201cinvestigation\u201d into Quick\u2019s lack of worker\u2019s compensation insurance could only be delegated to a Commission hearing officer, referee, or examiner, and not to the Employer Compliance Supervisor. Additionally, Quick argues even if the matter was properly delegated to the Employer Compliance Supervisor, I.C. \u00a7 72-506 also requires the Commission approve and confirm the \u201cfindings\u201d of the Supervisor before any action can be filed in district court pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 72-319.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">However, we believe I.C. \u00a7 72-506 was intended to apply only to the Commission\u2019s role as a tribunal in deciding injured worker cases, not to the Commission\u2019s role as an executive agency enforcing the worker\u2019s compensation law. The Commission argues the word \u201cinvestigation\u201d as used in I.C. \u00a7 72-506 was not intended to apply to investigations of uninsured employers by the compliance department. Rather, it refers to the power of the Commission, or a duly appointed referee, hearing officer, or examiner, to conduct whatever investigations it feels are necessary in relation to worker\u2019s compensation eases. <em>See </em>I.C. \u00a7 72-714(3). When the Commission makes such an investigation, it is acting in its role as a judicial tribunal, not an executive agency. Consequently, any findings made pursuant to those investigations by a duly delegated hearing officer, referee, or examiner would have to be approved by the Commission and filed in the Commission office before they would be considered findings of the Commission. I.C. \u00a7 72-319 does not require an order or written finding from the Commission approving the decision to submit the case to the attorney general and, absent some evidence the Commission did not approve of pursuing this in the district court, we presume the compliance department officers acted legally. Because I.C. \u00a7 72-319 provides the magistrate judge with jurisdiction over this case, we hold the magistrate judge erred in granting Quick\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">2. Attorney fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">The Commission argues it should be awarded attorney fees on appeal pursuant to I.A.R. 41 and I.C. \u00a7 12-121. Attorney fees are proper under these provisions \u201conly when this court is left with the abiding belief that the appeal was brought, pursued or defended frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation.\u201d <em>Minich v. Gem State Developers, Inc., </em>99 Idaho 911, 918, 591 P.2d 1078, 1085 (1979). Applying this standard to the facts of this case, we do not believe Quick\u2019s arguments were frivolous, unreasonable or without foundation. We have never faced this particular issue before and, given the complexity of the worker\u2019s compensation law, it does not appear Quick\u2019s interpretation of I.C. \u00a7 72-319 was completely unreasonable. Therefore, we decline to award attorney fees to the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-13\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b284-14\">We reverse the decision of the magistrate judge granting Quick\u2019s motion for summary judgment and remand this ease for further proceedings. We award costs, but not attorney fees, to the appellants.</p>\n<judges id=\"b284-15\">Justices SILAK, SCHROEDER, WALTERS and KIDWELL, concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b283-6\">. In his opinion and order, the magistrate judge held that because he lacked discretion to determine the amount of penalties, the legislature must have intended the Commission to make the penalty determination in its quasi-judicial capacity. However, the magistrate\u2019s lack of discretion to reduce the statutorily proscribed penalty does not deprive the court of jurisdiction to hear the case. Similarly, the fact the statute grants the Commission discretion in deciding whether to bring an action for penalties against an employer, does not deprive the district court of jurisdiction over the matter once the Commission has decided to assess penalties.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
