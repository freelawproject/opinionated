The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>dismissed the plaintiffs case based upon the two-year statute of limitation found in I.C. \u00a7 5-219(4). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">John Brennan was exposed to asbestos during his employment as a union sheet metal worker for various employers in Idaho. On April 20, 1991, Brennan attended a medical screening for asbestos-related diseases sponsored by the Sheet Metal Workers\u2019 Union. In a letter dated July 26, 1991, Dr. Richard King told Brennan that the preliminary screening showed scarring of the lung consistent with asbestos exposure. Dr. King recommended that Brennan seek a further evaluation and referred him to Dr. Richard Robinson. Brennan was examined by Dr. Robinson on June 15, 1992. In a report dated June 29,1992, Dr. Robinson noted that Brennan was a heavy smoker and concluded that his lung disease was more likely related to his smoking than to asbestos exposure. Brennan\u2019s attorney forwarded his medical records to Dr. Laura Welch at George Washington University Medical Center in Washington, D.C. Dr. Welch did not perform any tests on Brennan. Her evaluation was based entirely upon the tests and evaluations done by Drs. King and Robinson. In a letter dated October 7, 1992, Dr. Welch stated that Brennan had some smoking-related lung disease, but the majority of his impairment was due to asbestosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">Brennan filed a complaint against several different defendants on July 15,1993. Brennan\u2019s complaint was not served within six months and was dismissed pursuant to I.R.C.P 4(a). On October 3, 1994, Brennan filed a second complaint seeking damages for his alleged asbestos-related lung disease. On a motion made by one of the defendants, the district court found that Brennan\u2019s complaint was barred by the two-year statute of limitation on personal injuries found in I.C. \u00a7 5-219.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">The district court determined that objective medical proof supporting the existence of Brennan\u2019s asbestos-related injury existed no later than the date of Dr. Robinson\u2019s July 1992 report. Consequently, the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants. On appeal, Brennan argues that the statute of limitation did not begin to run until he received Dr. Welch\u2019s report indicating that his impairment was due to asbestosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">ISSUE ON APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">Did the district court err in granting the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the ground that Brennan\u2019s complaint of October 3, 1994, was barred under the two-year statute of limitation for personal injuries set forth in Idaho Code \u00a7 5-219(4)?</p>\n<p id=\"b839-11\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">Summary judgment is appropriate where \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d I.R.C.P. 56(e). Where there are no disputed issues of material fact, what remains is a question of law, over which this Court exercises free review. <em>Friel v. Boise City Housing Authority, </em>126 Idaho 484, 485, 887 P.2d 29, 30 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-13\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b839-14\">Idaho Code \u00a7 5-219(4) provides that all tort actions for professional malpractice or personal injury accrue \u201cas of the time of the occurrence, act or omission complained of.\u201d In <em>Davis v. Moran, </em>112 Idaho 703, 735 P.2d 1014 (1987), this Court stated that the cause of action accrues under \u00a7 5-219(4) on the date that the injury became \u201cobjectively ascertainable.\u201d This means that the cause of action accrues when \u201cobjective medical proof would support the existence of an actual injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 706 n.4, 735 P.2d at 1020 n.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-15\">In his report of July 26, 1991, Dr. King advised that he had performed an examination of Brennan in order to detect asbestos-related diseases. His preliminary findings were that Brennan\u2019s chest x-ray \u201cshowed scarring of the lung, of the kind that can be seen after asbestos exposure.\u201d He further stated: \u201cthe changes in your lung are consistent with the type of injury and disease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>that can be seen after asbestos exposure.\u201d He opined that the presence of pleural plaques or scarring in the lining surrounding Brennan\u2019s lung \u201ctells us that you have had a lot of asbestos exposure, and so you are at increased risk for lung cancer, other cancers, and a worsening of your scarring as years go by.\u201d In addition to recommending a followup-evaluation, Dr. King wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-4\">Anyone with past exposure to asbestos, with or without disease from asbestos, needs periodic medical care. Everyone over 40 needs a yearly examination of stool for microscopic blood, and a rectal examination, to find possible signs of colon cancer. In addition, you should see your personal doctor if you develop persistent chest pains, a persistent cough, or any other persistent problem.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Doctor King\u2019s findings reflect objective medical proof that would support the existence of an actual injury resulting from exposure to asbestos.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">We conclude that the accrual of Brennan\u2019s cause of action commenced at the time Dr. King rendered his report, for the purpose of the limitation expressed in I.C. \u00a7 5-219(4). It follows that the limitation period was not extended until the existence of an asbestos-related medical condition demonstrating actual injury was later confirmed by Dr. Welch. The district court correctly entered summary judgment dismissing Brennan\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">The summary judgment dismissing Brennan\u2019s complaint is affirmed. Costs to respondents. No attorney fees on appeal are allowed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b840-9\">Chief Justice TROUT and Justices SILAK, SCHROEDER and KIDWELL concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
