We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-25\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-26\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b233-27\">On August 15, 1992, Dewey Trimble was seriously injured when the vehicle he was driving was struck by a vehicle driven by Rex Engelking. Engelking was insured by Horace Mann Insurance Company (Horace Mann). Trimble\u2019s attorney contacted Horace Mann about Trimble\u2019s injuries, and learned that Engelking had died in May of 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-28\">Trimble filed a complaint on August 10, 1994, naming Engelking only, and not Engelking\u2019s estate as a defendant. The complaint acknowledged that Engelking was deceased, but claimed a right to recovery pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 15-3-803(d) (subsequently renumbered 803(e), regarding the nature of a claim brought to establish liability under an insurance policy).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-29\">On November 17, 1994, Engelking\u2019s estate filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, claiming that the suit was a \u201cnullity\u201d because it failed to name a living person. On December 20, 1994, Trimble replied with a motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>to amend his complaint. The district court, on September 29, 1995, granted Engelking\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissed the complaint. Trimble appealed the district court\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">On appeal, this Court determined that I.C. \u00a7 15-3-803 \u201cdoes not authorize suits brought directly against decedents.\u201d <em>Trimble v. Engelking, </em>130 Idaho 300, 302, 939 P.2d 1379, 1381 (1997). This conclusion, however, was not fatal to Trimble\u2019s complaint. The Court explained that because the district court had relied on the nullity theory, which the Court expressly chose not to adopt, the ease had to be remanded. On remand, the district court was to determine \u201cwhether Trimble met the requirements of I.R.C.P. 15(c)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for amendment of the complaint and relation back to the date of the original filing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 303, 939 P.2d at 1382. The Court concluded that \u201c[wjhile the court below did discuss Rule 15(c) in its decision, we conclude that it did not fully explore its exercise of discretion under that rule.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">On July 9, 1998, the district court issued its memorandum decision and order on remand. The district court began its decision by expressing its confusion at this Court\u2019s instruction on remand. It then noted that the statute Trimble was arguing on remand, I.C. \u00a7 15-3-802(b), had first been raised to this Court on Trimble\u2019s first appeal. The district court then held that it did not have the jurisdiction to consider the statute because it was not raised prior to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">After setting out and reviewing the requirements of I.R.C.P. 15(e), the district court determined that Trimble failed to meet the requirement that \u201c \u2018notice of the institution of the action\u2019 [be provided] to the Estate within \u2018the period provided by law for commencing the action.\u2019\u201d This determination resulted from the court\u2019s conclusion that even though Horace Mann might have been aware of Trimble\u2019s intent to file a complaint, cases from this Court require that notice \u201cpertains to an action that has already been commenced, not one that the parties intend to file.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">The district court then ruled that Trimble\u2019s \u201cmisnomer\u201d argument was not applicable because Trimble was trying to do more than just correct the spelling of a name \u2014 he was, in fact, trying to add a new party defendant. Holding that Trimble had failed to meet the requirements of I.R.C.P. 15(c), the district court again denied Trimble\u2019s motion to amend his complaint. Trimble appeals that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-12\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b234-13\">\u201cThe decision to grant or deny a party\u2019s motion to amend a pleading is left to the trial court\u2019s discretion, and we will not reverse such a ruling absent an abuse of this discretion.\u201d <em>Trimble, </em>130 Idaho at 303, 939 P.2d at 1382; <em>see also Vaught v. Dairyland Ins. Co., </em>131 Idaho 357, 360, 956 P.2d 674, 677 (1998). When determining whether the trial court has abused its discretion, this Court applies a three-factor test. <em>Cook v. State, Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>133 Idaho 288, 296, 985 P.2d 1150, 1158 (1999). These factors are: \u201c1) whether the trial court correctly perceived the issue as one of discretion, 2) whether the trial court acted within the boundaries of this discretion and consistent with legal standards applicable to the specific choices available to it, and 3) whether the trial court reached its decision by an exercise of reason.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-15\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b234-16\">The District Court Abused Its Discretion On Remand When It Failed To Consider The Applicability Of I.C. \u00a7 15-3-802(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-17\">Trimble asserts that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>I.C. \u00a7 15-3-802(b) (providing a four-month tolling of the applicable statute of limitations following a decedent\u2019s death). On remand, the district court held that, even though the application of this statute would likely be dispositive of the issue, the district court did not have jurisdiction to consider the issue because it was first raised on appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">After considering all relevant issues raised on appeal, this Court remanded the case and issued a decision which required the district court to \u201cfully explore its exercise of discretion under\u201d I.R.C.P. 15(c). <em>Trimble, </em>130 Idaho at 303, 939 P.2d at 1382. As the district court noted in its decision on remand, the only element of I.R.C.P. 15(c) which Trimble was lacking was that Trimble failed to provide Engelking, or his estate, with notice of the lawsuit within the period of time provided for by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">It is well settled law in Idaho that Idaho appellate courts will not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Post Falls Trailer Park v. Fredekind, </em>131 Idaho 634, 637, 962 P.2d 1018, 1021 (1998); <em>Schiewe v. Farwell, </em>125 Idaho 46, 49, 867 P.2d 920, 923 (1993). However, in the present ease, while the issue of the applicability of I.C. \u00a7 15-3-802(b) was not specifically cited by Trimble prior to his first appeal, the issue of timeliness of notice to the decedent\u2019s estate was central to Trimble\u2019s appeal. Thus, this is not a case where the issue was raised for the first time to the trial court on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">This Court recently discussed the nature of the district court\u2019s jurisdiction on remand. In <em>J.R. Simplot Co. v. Chemetics Int'l Inc., </em>130 Idaho 255, 939 P.2d 574 (1997), the nature of the appeal involved a commercial transaction which subjected the litigation to an award of attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3). <em>Id. </em>at 257, 939 P.2d at 576. The Court remanded the case \u201cso that Simplot\u2019s attorney fee award as the prevailing party on Count III may be modified in accordance with this opinion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">On remand, the district court reduced Simplot\u2019s award of fees by one-half. Chemetics then sought an award of costs and fees because it had prevailed on the issue appealed. <em>Id. </em>However, the district court determined that it did not have jurisdiction to award costs and fees because it was not specifically directed by this Court to do so on remand. <em>Id. </em>On the second appeal, this Court discussed the nature of the district court\u2019s limitations on remand, holding that \u201ca trial court is free to correct any error in its original findings and conclusions as to matters not passed on by the appellate court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 257-58, 939 P.2d at 577-78. Determining that it had not passed on the issue in the first appeal, the Court ruled that the award of attorney fees for the issue of the prevailing party was \u201ca subsidiary issue fairly comprised therein.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 258, 939 P.2d at 577 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">While not discussed in the Court\u2019s order on remand, the issue of the applicability of I.C. \u00a7 15-3-802(b) was considered by this Court on Trimble\u2019s first appeal. The direction to the district court on remand to \u201cfully explore its exercise of discretion under\u201d I.R.C.P. 15(e), <em>Trimble, </em>130 Idaho at 303, 939 P.2d at 1382, was intended to require the district court to consider all applicable laws relating to the issue of timeliness of notice to the decedent\u2019s estate. Thus, we hold that the district court abused its discretion on remand when it failed to consider the applicability of I.C. \u00a7 15-3-802(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-12\">Further, it should be noted that at oral argument before this Court both parties conceded that if I.C. \u00a7 15-3-802(b) is applicable then the motion to amend the complaint should be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-13\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-14\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b235-15\">The applicability of I.C. \u00a7 15-3-802(b) was the within this Court\u2019s order to the district court on remand to fully explore whether the requirements of I.R.C.P. 15(c) had been met. The decision of the district court is vacated and the matter remanded to the district court to consider the applicability of I.C. \u00a7 15-3-802(b) to Trimble\u2019s amended com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>plaint.
