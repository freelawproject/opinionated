Roberts received positive performance reviews in June 1992 and April 1993. In the summer or early fall of 1993, Roberts joined the Pocatello Education Association (PEA). Beginning in June of 1994, Roberts began to receive reviews which were much less complimentary and which reflected parent and student complaints concerning Roberts\u2019 use of profanity with students.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-22\">On December 16, 1993, School District transportation director Jerry Skaggs (Skaggs) sent a letter to Roberts which stated he was recommending to personnel director, Gordon Waford (Waford), that Roberts be placed on probation. In his letter, Skaggs referred to: (1) Roberts\u2019 unauthorized stop at a Maverick convenience store which made Roberts late in picking up students who became wet and cold; (2) Roberts\u2019 rude and discourteous remarks to Head Start personnel; (3) Roberts\u2019 kicking a student off the bus without authority; and (4) Roberts\u2019 use of profane language with students which had resulted in complaints. Waford sent Roberts a letter on December 22, 1993, stating she would be placed on probation through the end of the 1993-1994 school year.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-23\">Roberts filed a grievance on January 26, 1994 and alleged she had been placed on probation in retaliation for joining the PEA. On June 16, 1994, Roberts filed a grievance concerning her June 8, 1994 performance review and alleged the negative evaluation and extension of probation were in retaliation for the January 26,1994 grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-24\">A three member arbitration panel held a meeting on June 2,1994, to determine whether the School District violated Roberts\u2019 right to join the PEA and whether the School District placed Roberts on probation in retaliation for her membership in the PEA. The panel concluded the evidence was insufficient to determine the district\u2019s sole motivation for placing Roberts on probation was her participation in the PEA. The panel also concluded Roberts\u2019 unauthorized stop at the Maverick convenience store seemed logical and she did not have an interpersonal relations problem. The panel recommended that probation was too severe a reprimand and Roberts was taken off probation shortly thereafter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b930-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>Roberts\u2019 supervisor, Craig Leiby (Leiby), wrote a memo to Roberts on October 18, 1994, concerning problems with Roberts\u2019 attitude and professionalism and referenced an incident in which Roberts used the term \u201cbullshit\u201d and became defiant and uncooperative with Skaggs. In addition, numerous written and oral complaints from parents were received against Roberts which reflected Roberts\u2019 use of profane language with students. George Bateman (Bateman), Roberts\u2019 immediate supervisor, collected comments from twenty students who rode Roberts\u2019 bus and similarly expressed complaints regarding Roberts\u2019 use of profanity and mistreatment of students.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">Bateman prepared a written warning on July 26, 1995. Bateman warned Roberts that if additional complaints concerning Roberts\u2019 mistreatment of students were received, Roberts would be terminated. Leiby also issued Roberts a written warning on August 27,1995. Bateman sent a letter to Waford in January 1996 regarding the parent complaints, his discussions with Roberts, his pri- or warnings to her, and recommended Roberts\u2019 employment be terminated. Waford terminated Roberts\u2019 employment on January 22, 1996. Roberts submitted a grievance concerning her termination, contending the termination was retaliatory in response to her union activities. Bateman denied the grievance on January 31, 1996 (Step One hearing). Roberts appealed that decision to the Superintendent of Schools who designated Waford as the hearing officer. (Step Two hearing). Waford concluded there was no connection between his decision to terminate her and Roberts union activities. Roberts then appealed the denial to a three-person arbitration panel which included Waford, one person designated by Roberts, and one neutral member.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">A hearing was held and the arbitration panel issued its decision, concluding Roberts had been improperly dismissed, should be reinstated with back pay and benefits, and had been terminated as harassment for her PEA activities. The decision was drafted by the panel\u2019s neutral member. Roberts\u2019 designee concurred in the opinion and Waford dissented, noting a lack of evidence establishing that Roberts\u2019 discharge violated public policy. The School District appealed the arbitration panel\u2019s decision to the Board. One week later, on August 28, 1996, after considering the arguments of attorneys representing Roberts and the School District, the Board overturned the arbitration panel\u2019s decision, finding the School District had cause to terminate Roberts\u2019 employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-10\">Roberts filed a complaint against the School Board and later filed an Amended Petition for Judicial Review. The Board filed a Motion to Determine Agency Record, seeking an order that the record before the Board and the district court would include all exhibits presented to the arbitration panel. Roberts filed an Objection to Agency Record on the same day, arguing the record should consist only of those documents provided to the Board at its August 28, 1996 meeting, <em>i.e., </em>the arbitration panel\u2019s decision and the Board\u2019s Finding of Fact overturning the panel\u2019s decision. The district court determined the agency record included \u201call Exhibits submitted to the arbitration panel.\u201d The district court issued its Memorandum Decision and Order on July 1, 1998, affirming the Board\u2019s Findings of Fact and Resolution overturning the arbitration panel\u2019s decision and denying Roberts\u2019 Amended Petition for Judicial Review. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-12\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b930-13\">As we recently held in <em>Idaho Historic Preservation Council, Inc. v. City Council of the City of Boise, </em>134 Idaho 651, 8 P.3d 646, although Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 84 governs judicial review of administrative and local governing bodies, the Rule does not provide a specific standard of review. <em>Id. </em>at 654, 8 P.3d at 649; <em>Comer v. County of Twin Falls, </em>130 Idaho 433, 437, 942 P.2d 557, 561 (1997). Instead, the Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>states \u201c[t]he scope of judicial review on petition from an agency ... shall be as provided by law.\u201d I.R.C.P. 84(u). We therefore apply the general standard of review for eases in which the district court acts in an appellate capacity. <em>Idaho Historic Preservation Council, </em>134 Idaho at 654, 8 P.3d at 649. In such eases, we review the record independently of the district court\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>Additionally, in this case, the scope of judicial review of the school board\u2019s decision is expressly set forth in I.C. \u00a7 33-517(2)(e). That provision provides the Board\u2019s decision may be set aside only upon a finding \u201c(i) [tjhat the findings of fact are not based on substantial, competent evidence; (ii) [tjhat the board of trustees has acted without jurisdiction or in excess of its powers; (iii) [tjhat the findings by the board of trustees as a matter of law do not support the decision.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 33-517(2)(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">A. The Board acted in excess of its powers by failing to comply with the statutory procedure set forth in I.C. \u00a7 33-517(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">As a preliminary matter, we note that Roberts is an at-will employee of the school district. Ordinarily, an at-will employee \u201cmay be terminated at any time for any or no reason which does not violate public policy____\u201d <em>Ray v. Nampa School Dist. No. 131, </em>120 Idaho 117, 120, 814 P.2d 17, 20 (1991). Here, Roberts has alleged her termination was in retaliation for her union activities, an allegation which, if true, would constitute a violation of public policy. We have previously held an employee must provide more than mere allegations regarding a violation of public policy. <em>Id. </em>at 121, 814 P.2d at 21. In this ease, as noted in the factual summary, two different independent bodies have found at least some merit to Roberts\u2019 allegations in the past. Thus, we believe she has carried her burden of presenting more than mere allegations regarding the cause of her termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">Roberts argues the Board violated her state and federal due process rights when it overturned the decision of the arbitration panel. However, we do not believe it is necessary to reach the issue of whether Roberts\u2019 constitutional rights were violated. Even if Roberts was not entitled to procedural due process prior to her termination, she was nevertheless entitled to grieve that termination through the grievance procedure provided by I.C. \u00a7 33-517. Implicit in the requirement that the Board provide a grievance process is that the process will provide the employee with a meaningful opportunity to be heard in a fair and impartial manner. Without such a requirement, the grievance process provided by I.C. \u00a7 33-517 becomes a meaningless formality rather than a legitimate means of appealing employment related decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-13\">We addressed a somewhat similar situation in <em>Brown v. Caldwell School Dish No. 132, </em>127 Idaho 112, 898 P.2d 43 (1995). In <em>Brown, </em>a non-tenured teacher sued the school district for violations of the statutory procedure set forth in I.C. \u00a7 33-514. We noted that because Brown was a non-tenured teacher, she was not entitled to procedural due process before she could be terminated. However, the Board was still required to comply with the statutory procedure contained in I.C. \u00a7 33-514. Under I.C. \u00a7 33-514, if a school board decides not to reemploy a non-tenured teacher, the board is required to give a statement of reasons for that decision and the teacher is given the opportunity for an informal review of that decision by the Board. In <em>Brawn, </em>the District had informed Brown its decision not to reemploy her was based \u201con the Board\u2019s belief that the school district\u2019s interest would be best served by not continuing a contract relationship with you.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 116, 898 P.2d at 47. We held that this statement did not comply with the requirements of I.C. \u00a7 33-514. In so holding, we first noted the general rules of statutory construction that a statute should be interpreted so as to give effect to all of its provisions, and that we do not presume that the legislature performed an idle act by enacting a meaningless provision. <em>Id, </em>at 117, 898 P.2d at 48. Applying these rules to the statute in <em>Brawn, </em>we held the statement of reasons given by the Board did not meet the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>requirements of I.C. \u00a7 33-514 because it did not convey any real information as to why Brown\u2019s contract was not renewed. Thus, \u201cBrown was given no <em>meaningful opportunity </em>to show why the decision was incorrect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). We therefore reversed the decision of the district judge on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">Although the ease at hand deals with a different statutory procedure than the one in <em>Brown, </em>we believe the same rationale applies. It is clear the statutory grievance procedure set forth in I.C. \u00a7 33-517 is intended to give an employee the opportunity to have an adverse employment decision reviewed, and perhaps modified. However, if the review is not done in a fair, impartial, and meaningful manner, this procedure becomes a useless exercise. Thus, because, as is discussed below, the Board did not provide Roberts with a meaningful opportunity to be heard in a fair and impartial manner, it also necessarily failed to comply with the statutory procedures set forth in I.C. \u00a7 33-517(2). Thus, we hold the Board exceeded its authority in terminating Roberts and vacate its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">The grievance procedure contained in I.C. \u00a7 33-517 provides a multi-step process by which a noncertificated employee may appeal matters related to his or her employment. Specifically, Section 33-517(2) provides the following grievance procedure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-6\">(a) A noncertificated employee of the district may file a grievance about any matter related to his employment____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-8\">(b) If a noncertificated employee files a grievance, the employee shall submit the grievance in writing to his or her immediate supervisor ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-9\">(c) If the noncertificated employee is not satisfied with the response of the immediate supervisor ... the employee may appeal the grievance to the superintendent of the district or the superintendent\u2019s designee ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-10\">(d) If the noncertificated employee is not satisfied with the response of the superintendent or his designee ... the noneertificated employee may request a review of the grievance by a hearing panel ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-11\">(e)The panel\u2019s decision shall be the final and conclusive resolution of the grievance unless the board of trustees overturns the panel\u2019s decision by resolution at the board of trustees\u2019 next regularly scheduled public meeting or unless ... either party appeals to the district court ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b932-12\">Roberts began the grievance procedure by submitting a grievance to her immediate supervisor, Bateman. Following Bateman\u2019s denial of her grievance, Roberts appealed to the superintendent of the school district. The superintendent appointed Director of Personnel Waford, the person who made the decision to terminate Roberts, as his designee for the appeal. After Waford denied Roberts\u2019 grievance, she then appealed to the arbitration panel. Idaho Code \u00a7 33-517(2)(d) states that the arbitration panel shall consist of three persons, \u201cone (1) designated by the board of trustees, one (1) designated by the employee, and one (1) agreed upon by the two (2) appointed members____\u201d Roberts accordingly designated Peggy Park, the Board designated Waford, and Peggy Park and Waford designated Rhonda Rivera. Thus, Waford, the person who made the initial decision to terminate Roberts, and who had been sued by Roberts for anti-union activities, participated in the grievance process at two different levels. While the statute does not specifically prohibit Waford\u2019s involvement, we believe such involvement creates, at a minimum, the appearance of bias in the process. Thus, we hold Waford\u2019s involvement at two different levels of the grievance procedure denied Roberts the benefit of a fair and impartial process implicit in the provision of a statutory grievance procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-15\">Even if Waford\u2019s involvement did not deny Roberts a fair and impartial process, Roberts was also denied a meaningful opportunity to be heard by the Board\u2019s failure to review the record before overturning the arbitration panel\u2019s decision. As a general rule, there is a presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties by public officers. <em>See, e.g., Homer v. Ponderosa Pine Logging, </em>107 Idaho 1111, 1114, 695 P.2d 1250, 1253 (1985). However, \u201cthis presump<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>tion can be rebutted by a production of evidence showing [the Board] failed to review the record.\u201d <em>Macrae v. Smith, </em>126 Idaho 788, 790, 890 P.2d 739, 741 (1995). Here, there is sufficient evidence in the record to rebut the presumption the Board properly considered the record from the arbitration hearing. Roberts has presented the affidavit of her attorney during the grievance proceedings which states at no time during the Board\u2019s open session did he see any documents or exhibits from the arbitration hearing. Additionally, the Board\u2019s order reversing the arbitration panel\u2019s decision simply states the Board\u2019s findings of facts are based upon the \u201cpresentations and arguments of both parties____\u201d In response, the Board submitted the affidavit of Waford which states the record was \u201cavailable\u201d to the Board during its deliberations. However, in order to provide Roberts with a meaningful opportunity to be heard, it is incumbent upon the Board to actually review the <em>evidence, </em>including testimony and exhibits, presented by both parties and make a fair and impartial decision based upon that evidence. Where, as here, it is unclear as to what, if any, evidence from the record the Board relied on in making its decision, the Board has failed to provide the grievant with a meaningful opportunity to be heard and to respond to the charges against her. Additionally, because it is impossible to determine what evidence the Board used in making its decision, we cannot determine whether the decision was based on substantial and competent evidence in the record. Thus, we vacate the decision of the Board overturning the arbitration panel\u2019s decision, and remand the case to the Board for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">B. Attorney Fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">On appeal, the School District has requested attorney fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-121. However, because the School District is not the prevailing party on appeal, the District is not entitled to an award of fees under that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">For the reasons set forth above, we vacate the Board\u2019s decision terminating Roberts\u2019 employment with the school district and remand the case to the Board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b933-12\">Justices SILAK, SCHROEDER and WALTERS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b929-18\">. Prior to mid-August, 1994, Roberts and several other bus drivers filed a lawsuit against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>School District, Waford and Skaggs to prevent the district from harassing them for joining the PEA. Judge William Woodland entered his Judgment in Roberts\u2019 civil action against the School District on June 13, 1996, permanently enjoining the School District from discriminating against any person because of union membership.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b933-13\">Justice KIDWELL,</author>\n<p id=\"AXj\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-14\">It appears to me that the record indicates the School Board followed the procedure mandated by I.C. \u00a7 33-517, the statutory grievance procedure. Further, I believe Marcia Roberts, an at-will employee, was given a meaningful opportunity to be heard in a fail* and impartial manner. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-15\">The majority finds it somehow suspect that Gordon Waford, the Director of Personnel, was involved in two levels of the grievance procedure. However, I.C. \u00a7 33-517(2)(d) does not prohibit the involvement of an employee familiar with the dispute. In fact, this provision specifically allows the board of trustees to appoint one person to the panel. Waford may very well have been a logical candidate as he was not only the Director of Personnel, but also was familiar with the parties and their respective positions. It should be noted that a school board may be functioning under limited resources and may not have the ability to fill a spot on an arbitration panel with a professionally qualified person unfamiliar with the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-16\">The majority finds that Roberts was denied a meaningful opportunity to be heard due to the Board\u2019s failure to review the record from the arbitration panel hearing. However, the record does not establish that the Board did, in fact, fail to review the record. The district court specifically found it likely that the Board did review the record. The district court noted that even though there was no recording or transcription of the hearing panel\u2019s proceedings, the exhibits presented to the hearing panel were available to the School Board before it made it\u2019s decision. Additionally, the School Board had ample opportunity to review the hearing panel\u2019s decision which contained a detailed listing and explanation of the evidence present<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>ed before the hearing panel. Finally, the detail and contents of the Board\u2019s decision demonstrate that the Board was aware of the exhibits contained in the record and suggests that the Board reviewed the record prior to issuing it\u2019s resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">Under I.C. \u00a7 33-517, the board of trastees is given the power to overturn a decision made by the grievance panel. The School Board acted within the power granted by the statute when it decided to terminate Roberts. This decision was not only based upon substantial and competent evidence, but was in accordance with the School Board\u2019s duty to protect the children in the school district. Although Robert\u2019s argued that her termination was in retaliation for her association with the union, there was virtually no evidence in support of this position. As noted by the district court, the School Board\u2019s findings of fact clearly showed that the true reason behind Robert\u2019s termination was her inadequate performance as a school bus driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">By not giving credence to the School Board\u2019s decision, this Court has failed to apply the well-established presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties by public officers. Accordingly, I believe the school district board of trustees\u2019 decision terminating the employment of this at-will employee should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
