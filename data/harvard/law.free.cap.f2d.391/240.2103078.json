Wechsler, 392 F.2d 344 (4th Cir. 1967), decided today, involves the bribery of a member of the Board of Supervisors of Fairfax County, Virginia, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952. John P. Parrish, an attorney and member of the Board of Supervisors, and Isadore Parzow, a real estate developer, were convicted under a two-count indictment of conspiring to violate and of substantively violating the statute. From the evidence and under proper instructions, the jury could have found that Parzow and Parrish made an agreement whereby Parrish voted in favor of re-zoning a tract of land to permit its use as a shopping center. In exchange for that vote Parzow bought 1,000 shares of Kent-Washington stock for $5,-250.60 from a broker in Washington, D. C. and caused the certificates to be mailed to Parrish in Virginia. Parrish accepted delivery of the shares by signing a receipt and returned it by mail to the broker in the District of Columbia. As we more fully explained in <em>Wechsler, </em>supra, facts such as these contain all the elements necessary to support the convictions for conspiracy and we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-16\">The appellants urge that a charge of conspiracy to commit bribery cannot be maintained when the only persons involved are the persons who give and who receive the bribe. They place great reliance on cases which hold that where cooperative action is necessary to commit the substantive offense, a preliminary agreement between the same parties to commit the offense cannot be punished as a conspiracy,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but their reliance is misplaced. We have no occasion now to question the thrust of those cases for, as we pointed out in <em>Wechsler, </em>the defendants are not charged with a conspiracy to commit bribery, but rather with a conspiracy to violate \u00a7 1952.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-17\">We have given careful consideration to the other assignments of errors and find nothing in, any of them to justify reversal or a new trial. We have no doubt that the use of facilities in interstate commerce was sufficiently related to the carrying on of the unlawful activity. See, United States v. Wechsler, supra, 392 F.2d at 347, n. 4; United States v. Wingo (6th Cir. 1967);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Unit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>ed States v. Hawthorne, 356 F.2d 740, 742 (4th Cir. 1966). Nor do we think that the trial court improperly refused the motion for change of venue. See, Rees v. Peyton, 341 F.2d 859 (4th Cir. 1965). And we are convinced that the indictment was sufficient to satisfy the principles established in Brokaw v. United States, 368 F.2d 508 (4th Cir. 1966); United States v. Chunn, 347 F.2d 717 (4th Cir. 1965); United States v. Martell, 335 F.2d 764 (4th Cir. 1964); and Finn v. United States, 256 F.2d 304 (4th Cir. 1958).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b317-10\">. Since identical and concurrent sentences were given to both defendants on each count, we find no need to consider problems raised in connection with the substantive counts. Hirabayashi v.
