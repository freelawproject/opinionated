He was sentenced on February 24, 1966, to serve three years; and there was no direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-25\">The appellant contended that his court-appointed counsel improperly induced his guilty plea by falsely promising him an eighteen-month sentence and a probated sentence for his cousin, who was his co-defendant. He also contended that he should have been permitted to confer with counsel in greater privacy, and that the same attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>should not have been appointed to represent both defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The district court was entitled to conclude that appellant\u2019s testimony attacking the guilty plea was convincingly refuted by that of the appointed counsel, as well as by that of appellant\u2019s cousin and of a Deputy U. S. Marshal. We find no error in the proceedings below. See Smith v. Heard, 5 Cir. 1963, 315 F.2d 692.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
