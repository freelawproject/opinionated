Accordingly, he was adjudged to be guilty and sentence was imposed. He was represented by court appointed counsel during his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-18\">On this appeal it is contended that error was committed in permitting an incriminating statement made to an P.B.I. Agent to be admitted into evidence and in failing to grant a motion for a directed verdict of acquittal. It is further claimed that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-20\">The record in this case shows no error. Quite to the contrary the record amply supports the verdict and judgment and clearly demonstrates that the appellant received a fair trial. Battles v. United States, 388 F.2d 799 (5 Cir. 1968\u2014No. 24743); Stephens v. United States, 354 F.2d 999 (5 Cir. 1965); Garrison v. United States, 353 F.2d 94 (10 Cir. 1965); Rua v.

United States, 273 F.2d 417 (5 Cir. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-21\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
