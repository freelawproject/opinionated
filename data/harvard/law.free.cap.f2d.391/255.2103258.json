The uncontroverted evidence establishes reasonable cause to believe the act has been violated and that the remedial purposes of the act will be frustrated unless relief <em>pendente lite </em>is granted. NLRB v. Aerovox Corp., of Myrtle Beach, 389 F.2d 475, 67 L.R.R.M. 2158 (4th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-16\">The Board\u2019s motion will be granted to this extent: the respondent must cease and desist from enforcing a no solicitation rule in nonworking areas of the plant during nonworking time, and from continuing to discriminate against employees who are union supporters with respect to the terms and conditions of employment. The Board\u2019s motion to require reinstatement of discharged employees <em>pendente lite </em>is denied. Counsel for the Board is directed to submit to the court a proposed order after furnishing a copy to counsel for the respondent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
