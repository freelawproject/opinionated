We hold that he cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-5\">This is a personal injury case in which plaintiff\u2019s daughter, Carole Lu Kaiser, was killed when the automobile in which she was riding was struck by an automobile driven by defendant-appellee, Carroll O. Loomis. Federal jurisdiction was claimed on grounds of diversity of citizenship under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 (1964).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1084-7\">The case was tried before a District Judge in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan. A jury verdict of $30,000 was returned for plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-8\">Jurisdiction over the controversy had been contested from the outset of the litigation, with defendant claiming that the required diversity of citizenship did not exist. The District Judge reserved this question for decision until after the taking of the jury verdict. He ultimately granted defendant\u2019s motion to reopen proofs and then made certain findings of fact and dismissed the whole cause of action for lack of diversity of citizenship.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-9\">The Judge\u2019s opinion said in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-10\">\u201cIn the amended complaint, the plaintiff claims that the defendant was, at the time of the institution of suit, a citizen of the State of Illinois. Admittedly, the defendant was not at that time a resident; that is, was not domiciled, was not living, in the State of Illinois. He was at that time a resident or living or domiciled, using all those terms as synonymous, in Ad-dis Ababa, Ethiopia, as a medical missionary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-14\">\u2022Jr * *X* * -X-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-15\">\u201cOur attention is called to the fact that the defendant has on numerous instances given his permanent address the place at which he could always be reached, as Anna, Illinois, which, according to the proofs, is the residence of his parents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-16\">\u201cIt appears affirmatively that the defendant has not in fact, resided, been domiciled at, or lived at Anna, Illinois, for a number of years. In the interim period he has lived in Michigan as a trainee at the Berrien County Hospital. He has lived in New York temporarily as a trainee for overseas duty as a missionary doctor. He now lives in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, obviously on a temporary basis by any criteria that has been brought to the attention of the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-17\">\u201cFrom all of the proofs, it appears that the defendant was at one time a resident of Anna, Illinois. He moved from Anna, Illinois, several years before the institution of this suit. There is nothing in the evidence in the nature of affidavit, deposition or answer to interrogatory which convinces this court that the defendant has had the intention of being a resident or citizen of the State of Illinois for many years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-18\">\u201cUnfortunately for the plaintiff\u2014 and the court does deem it unfortunate \u2014it appears to the satisfaction of the court that, in reality, the defendant does not have any actual citizenship in any specific state. He comes directly under the ruling of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Pemberton v. Colonna, 290 F.2d 220. He is a citizen of the United States residing abroad. But he hasn\u2019t the slightest intention, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>according to what this court can gather from the proofs adduced, of making Addis Ababa, a place where he is now living, anything in the way of a permanent residence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1085-5\">\u201cIf we were depending on residence, it does not appear that Addis Ababa is his residence. It is only the place where he, as a medical missionary, is temporarily living, subject to his receiving an assignment to the same or a later post at the discretion of the assigning authorities of the Presbyterian Church. Admittedly, they can\u2019t require him to go any place else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1085-6\">\u201cBut from all the evidence before the court, there isn\u2019t anything from which the court can conclude that as of the time that, this lawsuit was filed in July, 1964, the defendant, Carroll O. Loomis, was a citizen of the State of Illinois.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1085-7\">The additional fact supplied by the record and undisputed-is that defendant was born in Illinois to parents who then did and still do live there. He resided there (aside from two years in service) until he moved to Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-8\">The District Judge held \u201cthat, in reality, the defendant does not have any actual citizenship in any specific state * * *. He is a citizen of the United States residing abroad.\u201d He concluded that dismissal of this suit was required by the rule of Pemberton v. Colonna, 290 F.2d 220 (3d Cir. 1961). In <em>Pemberton, </em>however, the facts as found showed that plaintiff had established domicile in Mexico. The Third Circuit held on those facts that plaintiff was not a citizen of any state but was a citizen of the United States \u201cdomiciled\u201d abroad. The critical distinction between this case and the <em>Pemberton </em>case is the difference between \u201cresidence\u201d and \u201cdomicile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-10\">\u201cCitizenship\u201d for purposes of the diversity statute is synonymous not with \u201cresidence\u201d but with \u201cdomicile.\u201d Napletana v. Hillsdale College, 385 F.2d 871 (6th Cir. 1967); Williamson v. Osenton, 232 U.S. 619, 34 S.Ct. 442, 58 L.Ed. 758 (1914).</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-11\">We cannot agree that any facts shown in this record lead to the legal conclusion reached by the District Judge that \u201cthe defendant does not have any actual citizenship in any specific state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-12\">\u201cCitizenship\u201d for purposes of the diversity statute is determined as of the date of commencement of the action. Smith v. Sperling, 354 U.S. 91, 93 n. 1, 77 S.Ct. 1112, 1 L.Ed.2d 1205 (1957); Mullen v. Torrance, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 237, 6 L.Ed. 154 (1824). It is clear that when this action was started, defendant was a resident of Ethiopia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-13\">But the well-supported findings of the District Judge pertaining to the temporary character of defendant\u2019s residence in Addis Ababa prohibit any finding of domicile in a foreign country.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-14\">When defendant was born in Illinois to parents who were domiciled there, he took the domicile of his father. Lamar v. Micou, 112 U.S. 452, 470, 5 S.Ct. 221, 28 L.Ed. 751 (1884); Bjornquist v. Boston &amp; A.R. Co., 250 F. 929, 5 A.L.R. 951 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 248 U.S. 573, 39 S.Ct. 11, 63 L.Ed. 427 (1918); Yarborough v. Yarborough, 290 U.S. 202, 211, 54 S.Ct. 181, 78 L.Ed. 269 (1933). That domicile persists until and unless it is changed. Mitchell v. United States, 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) 350, 353, 22 L.Ed. 584 (1874). In this last case the United States Supreme Court also dealt with the factors which establish a change of domicile :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1085-15\">\u201cTo constitute the new domicile two things are indispensable: First, residence in the new locality; and, second, the intention to remain there. The change cannot be made except <em>facto et animo. </em>Both are alike necessary. Either without the other is insufficient. Mere absence from a fixed home, however long continued, cannot work the change.\u201d Mitchell v. United States, 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) 350, 353, 22 L.Ed. 584 (1874).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1085-16\">In Stine v. Moore, 213 F.2d 446, 448 (5th Cir. 1954), the court said, \u201ccitizen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>ship is not necessarily lost by protracted absence from home, where the intention to return remains.\u201d And dealing with burden of proof on the issue of citizenship for diversity purposes, the court stated: \u201cThe burden of proving diversity jurisdiction, when challenged, is upon the plaintiff; but when it is shown, as in this case, that the [party] had a former domicile in [another state], the presumption is that it continues to exist, and the burden shifts to the defendant to prove that it has changed.\u201d Stine v. Moore, 213 F.2d at 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-4\">The record we have reviewed requires the conclusion that defendant was domiciled in and was a citizen of Illinois at least up to 1960. It also supports the District Judge\u2019s finding that his residence in Ethiopia is temporary in character and, hence, could not effect a change of domicile.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-5\">The question remaining is whether or not defendant bore the burden of proof to show that defendant changed his domicile from Illinois to Michigan during his residence in the latter state.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-6\">At oral argument of his motion to dismiss, counsel for defendant conceded that defendant was not a citizen of Michigan at the time of filing of this complaint. The language employed, however, suggests that this concession may have been made as a result of misapprehension of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-7\">Since the proofs are somewhat in dispute on this score, we think this question is in the first instance one for the District Judge to resolve.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-8\">We find no merit to appellant\u2019s claim pertaining to inadmissibility of certain evidence. The issue of jurisdiction is heard by the judge alone. We feel the District Judge is capable of weighing the extent of hearsay or of self-service motivation involved in the contested statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-9\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1084-11\">. \u201c\u00a7 1332. <em>Diversity of citizenship; * * *</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1084-12\">(a) The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $10,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and is between\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-19\">(1) citizens of different States;</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-20\">(2) citizens of a State, and foreign states or citizens or subjects thereof; * * * \u00bb</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
