In light of the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Federal Power Commission v. United Gas Pipe Line Company, 386 U.S. 237, 87 S.Ct. 1003, 18 L.Ed.2d 18 (1967), and this Court\u2019s decision in the same case on remand, United Gas Pipe Line Company v. Federal Power Commission, 388 F.2d 385 (January 10, 1968), we now hold that the Commission\u2019s refusal in this case to consider those taxes which would have been paid had separate returns been filed was not erroneous or contrary to its statutory authority. In this case no income tax payments were actually made for the years involved. Federal Power Commission v. United Gas Pipe Line Co., supra, 386 U.S. at page 245, 87 S.Ct. at page 1008, 18 L.Ed.2d at page 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-24\">Petition for rehearing granted in part and in part denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
