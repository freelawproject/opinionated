Celebrezze, 370 F.2d 373, 376 (4th Cir. 1966). Inexplicably, the District Court awarded claimant\u2019s attorney over $2200 more than the estimated maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-20\">We find the award of $3960, only $1.73 less than the statutory maximum of 25% of the claimant's accrued benefits,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to be excessive and incompatible with the principles laid down in McKittrick v. Gardner, 378 F.2d 872 (4th Cir. 1967) and the earlier <em>Redden </em>ease, supra, in which we noted, \u201cRoutine approval of the statutory maximum allowable fee should be avoided in all cases. In a great majority of cases, perhaps, a reasonable fee will be much less than the statutory maximum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b746-21\">The District Court, stating no reasons for its determination, appears to have automatically adopted the statutory maximum. No extraordinary services are indicated and no showing is \u2014 or could be\u2014 made that the attorney took any substantial action on behalf of the claimant after this court\u2019s decision wherein it was suggested what would constitute fair and reasonable compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-22\">Concluding, therefore, that the District Court\u2019s order awarding $3960 to counsel must be modified, we direct the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>ant, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, to certify for payment to counsel the sum of $1750, as full compensation for the attorney\u2019s services and as reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses. The remainder of the statutory maximum which the Secretary has withheld pending determination of this issue should be paid forthwith to the claimant and his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Order of District Court modified accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b746-23\">. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 406(b) (1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
