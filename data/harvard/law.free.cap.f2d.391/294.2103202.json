The Board adopted the findings and conclusions of the Trial Examiner to the effect that section 8(a) (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>had been violated by interrogation of and attempts to influence employees, and that section 8(a) (3) had been violated in the discharge of employee Cowart because he had engaged in union activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The findings on the section 8(a) (1) charges are fully supported by the evidence. The evidence concerning the section 8(a) (3) charge is conflicting and the Board\u2019s decision rested on credibility choices. Being bound by these credibility determinations, Nabors v. N. L. R. B., 5 Cir. 1963, 323 F.2d 686, 692, we conclude that there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the Board\u2019s finding that Cowart was discharged in violation of section 8(a) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b370-24\">. 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(a) (1), (3).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
