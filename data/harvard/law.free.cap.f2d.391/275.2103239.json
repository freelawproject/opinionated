McDaniel, was tried and convicted of theft on February 26, 1953. McDaniel had failed to pay his State Bar dues for the years 1951-1953, but in September 1953 he paid his delinquent dues.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-20\">In McKinzie v. Ellis, 5 Cir. 1961, 287 F.2d 549, we overturned a conviction where the defendant had been represented by McDaniel early in 1953. We observed that the law of Texas required that a defendant accused of a capital crime be represented by a \u201cpracticing\u201d attorney, and that the Constitution required no less: that appointed counsel \u201cmust be authorized to practice in the court where the trial will occur.\u201d 287 F.2d at 551. In holding that an attorney delinquent in paying his Bar dues was not a \u201cpracticing\u201d attorney, we relied on the Texas case of Martinez v. State, Tex.Cr.App.1958, 318 S.W.2d 66, which held that an attorney who had not paid his Bar dues was \u201cnot at the time authorized to practice law in this State, as provided and required by the statutes and the rules of the Supreme Court of Texas.\u201d 318 S.W.2d at 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-21\">Martinez v. State has been overruled by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. In Hill v. State, Tex.Cr.App.1965, 393 S.W.2d 901, 904, that court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQF\">The status of a delinquent attorney not being a member of the State Bar of Texas does not place him in the position of being \u201cunlicensed to practice law in this State\u201d. <em>He only has to pay his dues </em>* * * to resume his status as a \u201cpracticing lawyer\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-22\">The court considered the State Bar Act retroactive in its application; thus, \u201cwhen the delinquent attorney-member pays his delinquent dues he then is restored to the status that he occupied prior to becoming delinquent.\u201d 393 S.W.2d at 904. Turning to our <em>McKinzie </em>decision, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-23\">We construe the opinion of the 5th Circuit in McKinzie\u2019s case, supra, as being bottomed on our opinion in Mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>tinez. * * * We do, however, feel that our disavowal of this Court\u2019s holding in Martinez\u2019s case will cause the various Federal Courts to take a new appraisal of questions of this kind in light of our opinion herein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Texas courts now consider that lawyers who are delinquent in paying Bar dues are still \u201cpracticing attorneys\u201d. So shall we. Barfield\u2019s theft conviction must therefore stand. The judgment of the district court granting habeas must be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
