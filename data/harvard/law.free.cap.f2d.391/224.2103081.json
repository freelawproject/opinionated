In fact, the state offenses were dismissed after his plea of guilty in United States District Court. He also claims that he was promised a sentence of no more than five years. Actual sentences imposed were a five-year sentence on Count One and a concurrent ten-year sentence on Count Two. The transcript of the arraignment and plea proceedings shows that Pursley is a recidivist and would have been faced with a life sentence if he had been convicted on the state charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-21\">After this motion was filed (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255), the district judge decided that the records in the criminal case \u201crefute petitioner\u2019s contention,\u201d and denied the motion without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-22\">At arraignment and when sentence was imposed, Pursley was represented by competent, court-appointed counsel, and the district judge conducted these proceedings in a commendably thorough manner. Pursley was advised, \u201c * * * You <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>cannot plead guilty unless you are actually guilty * * * If you do that (plead not guilty), the government will be required to prove you are guilty beyond a reasonable doubt * * This careful district judge also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">The federal court determines the penalty if a person is convicted, whether it is on a verdict of the jury, or on a plea of guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">The Court has not talked to anybody about your case. The Court will not talk to anybody about your case except here in your presence, where you and your lawyer and the representatives of the government are all present. The Court will not ask for and will not receive any recommendations from the government regarding the penalty in any case. If you are convicted, the Court will hear pleas for leniency from your lawyer, and from you. The penalty will be decided on the basis of the facts that are heard here. That means that you should not depend on any statement or promise that might have been made to you by anybody, whether connected with law enforcement, the government, or not, as to what the penalty will be. If you plead guilty, you must \u2014 your plea must not be induced by any promise, coercion, or force of any kind. When I speak of force, that includes coercion and psychological coercion. Your plea must be purely voluntarily made and it must be entered just because you are guilty and for no other reason.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-19\">Shortly after this detailed explanation on the point, Pursley was called upon to plead. He stated that he understood his rights and wanted to go ahead. He then entered his pleas of guilty to each of the two counts. To demonstrate the adequacy of the proceedings which followed, a transcript of the relevant portion thereof is set out in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-20\">It is difficult to conceive of anything else that could have been done by the district court before sentencing Pursley, and we agree with the district court that Pursley\u2019s present claims are completely refuted by' the files and records of the district court.
