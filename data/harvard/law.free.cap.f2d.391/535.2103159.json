Two types of plans were offered. The first, or Systematic Accumulation Plan with Insurance, provided plan completion insurance to guarantee the monthly payments should the planholder die during the term of the plan. The issuance of such plans was contingent on the acceptance of the applicant by the appellee insurance companies. Plans were also offered without the accompanying insurance, in which case the plan terminated at the time of the holder\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-14\">On September 16, 1959, the elder Calhoun, then 77 years old, applied for a Plan with Insurance or, if he were \u201cnot acceptable for insurance by the insurance companies,\u201d for a Plan without Insurance. Although his application for the requisite insurance was denied, the appellant\u2019s father was mistakenly informed that he had qualified for the plan with insurance by being mailed a \u201cStatement of Insurance\u201d and the \u201cSystematic Accumulation Plan with Insurance\u201d forms. Within the week, before the elder Calhoun could take any action in reliance on this correspondence, the error was discovered and he was so notified. This notice was confirmed about a week later by registered letter. Thereafter, for five years, Calhoun made his monthly payments and received notices showing that no deductions were being made for insurance but that the entire amount was credited to his investment account.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-15\">Appellant contends that a binding agreement was created by the initial communication, erroneously sent and promptly corrected. For the reasons fully stated by the District Court,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we reject this contention and affirm its order granting defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b612-17\">.
