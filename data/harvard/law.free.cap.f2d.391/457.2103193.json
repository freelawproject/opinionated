Looking out of his window he saw standing at his front door a man in a police uniform who said \u201cPolice. Someone stole your battery.\u201d Lincoln could see that the hood of his automobile had been raised. Turning on his porch light he again scrutinized his visitor, saw that it was, apparently, a policeman and opened the door. The pretext had succeeded. As the door was opened he saw that man had drawn a gun, and he then struck Lincoln with it and said \u201cHoldup.\u201d Thereupon Lincoln struggled with the intruder, was shot in the hand, dragged into his kitchen and tied up. The assailant was Parker according to Lincoln, identified at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">With the front door open, two more men entered. One of them tied up Mrs. Lincoln after threatening her with a knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">Parker maintained surveillance over Lincoln as the other confederates ransacked the house. They found approximately $3,000. They lighted matches and burned Lincoln several times in their insistence that he disclose the location of yet additional funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">In due course the three robbers left the house, Mrs. Lincoln worked herself free and then untied her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">Parker was arrested about one month later in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Lincoln and a detective from the Metropolitan Police Department went to Pittsburgh and viewed a police line-up of six men where Lincoln identified Parker as his assailant. At the removal prOceedings in Pittsburgh, Parker was represented by his own attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-14\">The latter did not then call as a witness a Mrs. Everett who was nonetheless produced at trial to testify that Parker was at her home in Pittsburgh every day in the week in question; that he was in her house on the evening of Sunday, October 17, when she gave a party attended by five women friends whose names and addresses she supplied at trial. None had been called as witnesses in Pittsburgh before the commissioner or at trial. Mrs. Everett testified that also present were her 15-year-old son and a younger daughter neither of whom was produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-15\">Following removal to the District of Columbia, Parker was brought before the United States Commissioner, bail was set at $10,000 and the appellant was held for grand jury action. Following indictment on February 7, 1966, counsel was appointed to represent Parker.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-16\">No challenge was levied then or later concerning proceedings at the removal hearing in Pittsburgh.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-17\">After Mrs. Everett had testified to Parker\u2019s presence in Pittsburgh on the evening of October 17, 1965, the Government called as a witness one Mrs. Anderson. She testified that at her house in the District of Columbia, Parker had appeared in a blue uniform on October 15, 1965. On cross examination defense counsel brought out that Parker had been dressed in a police uniform when he appeared at the Anderson house and that he had tried to gain admittance on the pretext of investigating a reported disturbance there. She refused to allow Parker to enter, but she had placed him in Washington at a time and date when Mrs. Everett had testified that Parker was in Pittsburgh.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-18\">We purposefully omit detailed discussion, for the factual background in support of the jury\u2019s verdict is ample. The alleged errors and the rulings complained of come fully within decisions of this court which are adverse to the contentions urged upon us and which are disposed of by our order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
