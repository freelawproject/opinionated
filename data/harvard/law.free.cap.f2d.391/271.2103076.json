He alleged in his complaint that jurisdiction existed under the Jones Act, \u201cincorporating 45 U.S.C.A., sections 55 and 60\u201d, because in his view his \u201crelief\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>from duty was attributable to his July, 1967, damage action.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Pursuant to procedures provided by the Basic Labor Agreement, the plaintiff\u2019s union, on August 21, 1967, filed a \u201cGrievance\u201d, signed by the plaintiff, in which he alleged he had \u201cbeen unjustly and unfairly treated\u201d, and requested \u201cimmediate reinstatement with restoration for all time lost\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">On September 22, 1967, the District Court, after hearing and consideration of affidavits setting forth the foregoing facts, granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment in its favor, which was premised on the contention that the plaintiff had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">On review of the record we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">The Order of the District Court granting summary judgment in favor of the defendant will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b347-26\">. 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 688.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b348-15\">.
