However, the judgment of $411.50 for costs in taking the deposition should be permitted to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">As a further ground for its order the court below determined there was no genuine issue as to any material fact. Rule 56. In view of the deposition of Mr. Howard we cannot agree for the reasons which follow. A question of fact is presented as to whether the letter of January 10, 1963 from Langley-Howard, Inc. to the Bank embraces the whole of the obligation of Langley-Howard, Inc. on its \u201cput\u201d obligation or whether the letters of December 31, 1962 and January 8, 1963, from Langley-Howard, Inc. to The Onego Corporation, requiring as a condition of the purchase of the Pipe Line stock that there be no substantial change in its \u201cassets, corporate structure or business\u201d, should be integrated with the letter of January 10 to determine Langley-Howard, Inc.\u2019s obligation. A further question of fact is presented as to when the Bank actually made its loan commitment. Depending on the resolution of the above questions, another question of fact may be presented, viz., whether or not there was a material change in the condition of the Georgia Pipe Line Corporation to relieve Langley-Howard, Inc. from the performance of its obligation. The case at bar is one which is not suitable for determination under Rule 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court below will be reversed save that portion thereof which imposes costs of $411.50 upon Langley-Howard, Inc. The ease will be remanded to the end that a trial of the issues referred to may be had.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
