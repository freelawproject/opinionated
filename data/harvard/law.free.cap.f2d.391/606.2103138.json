There was considerable additional evidence, including some six or seven medical reports and certificates of physicians who differed widely in their opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>ions. The hearing examiner made elaborate and detailed findings, as a result of which he decided that the claimant is not entitled to have a period of disability established or to disability insurance benefits. The Appeals Council affirmed the hearing examiner\u2019s decision. The district court reviewed the decision pursuant to section 205(g) of the Act, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 405(g). Upon such review it is provided that, \u201cThe findings of the Secretary as to any fact, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive.\u201d The district court found that substantial evidence supports the findings and determinations of the Secretary and affirmed the decision. After careful consideration of the record on appeal, including the administrative transcript, we find that the findings are supported by substantial evidence and that the Secretary applied the proper legal standards. Those are the two basic questions to be decided on this appeal. Gardner v. Smith, 5 Cir. 1966, 368 F.2d 77. The judgment is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"ALXf\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
