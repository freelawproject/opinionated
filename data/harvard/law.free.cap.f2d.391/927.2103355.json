The basis of appellant\u2019s argument is that the Master, although a private citizen, was at the time of the search acting in the capacity of a law enforcement officer of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>We reject this concept, as we are fully convinced that appellant\u2019s disorderly conduct and bizarre behavior fully justified a search of appellant\u2019s effects for \u201cdope\u201d by the Master, a man of considerable maritime experience; that the protection of the crew, the vessel and its cargo warranted the Master\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">We have held in Barnes v. United States, 1967, 373 F.2d 517, and we reaffirm our prior holding, that the Fourth Amendment does not require exclusion of incriminating evidence obtained through a search by a private citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
