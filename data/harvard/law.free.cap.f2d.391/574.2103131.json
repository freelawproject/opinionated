The appellants allegedly represented a class of eighty-six employees and sought an accounting and payment of amounts owing them under a pension plan established by Armour in 1952. They brought the suit under Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(a)] claiming the accounting and payment were owed them under a collective bargaining agreement between Armour and the appellants\u2019 union, Local 249, General Teamsters, Chauffeurs, and Helpers of America (\u201cTeamsters Local 249\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">The 1952-3 collective agreement first made Armour\u2019s Pension Plan effective for appellants.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This pension plan coverage was apparently continued in the agreements negotiated every year until 1964.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In 1964, Teamsters Local 249 obtained Armour\u2019s agreement to make payments to the Teamsters Pension Plan. The 1964 contract said nothing about the Armour plan; it merely provided that Armour would pay certain sums per employee per week into the Teamsters Pension Plan.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The apparent gravamen of appellants\u2019 complaint is that they have never seen the documents governing the actual \u201c1952\u201d Armour Pension Plan. (It is noted that such pension plan does not appear in the record.) Furthermore, they claim they have no idea of the amounts accumulated for each employee under the \u201c1952\u201d plan. The appellees, on the other hand, aver under oath <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that in negotiations for the 1964 agreement, Teamsters Local 249 agreed that all employees would withdraw from and cease to have any right, title or interest in the Armour Pension Plan or Pension Fund, with the exception of five named employees who could not qualify for the Teamsters Pension Plan.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As evidence of this alleged agreement, appellee points to Exhibit III of its Answer, a \u201cSupplemental Agreement\u201d to the 1964 contract, and the provision that \u201cin settlement of grievances or working conditions * * * it is recognized that * * * [the five] employees will continue to be covered by the Armour Plan. * * * \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Armour contends that the necessity of making such an agreement proves that all employees, including the five later exceptions, were otherwise totally out of the Armour Pension Plan. An appellants\u2019 affidavit by an employee who allegedly attended all negotiations of the 1964 contract, denied that Teamsters Local 249 ever waived any employee\u2019s \u201cright, title and interest in and to the Armour Pension Plan and the Armour Pension Fund.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-16\">After the complaint and answer were filed, Armour asked for summary judgment, alleging that the appellants had not exhausted the contractual grievance procedure. The district court granted a stay of all proceedings to allow appellants to pursue the grievance procedure. After the appellants had taken their grievance through the three steps provided in the 1964 agreement, both sides stipulated an end to the stay. Appellants asked that the trial under Section 301 again proceed; Armour amended its motion for summary judgment stating that the grievance procedure had resulted in a final rejection of the appellants\u2019 grievance. Interpreting the grievance procedure of the 1964 contract as making the rejection of appellants\u2019 grievance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>\u201cfinal,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and finding the decision in Haynes v. United States Pipe &amp; Foundry Company, 362 F.2d 414 (5th Cir. 1966) persuasive that the \u201cfinal\u201d determination was binding on the court,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the district court granted Armour\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\"> We do not agree with the District Court that on this record no substantial issue of fact remains. As a major step in any reasoning that permits the conclusion below, it must be decided that the present controversy is a \u201cdifference * * * between the Company and employees\u201d as that phrase was intended in Article XIV of the 1964 contract.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is conceivable that a request for an accounting and payment under an \u201cold\u201d employer pension plan is not a \u201cdifference\u201d as that word is used in this present contract. Furthermore, there must also be a preliminary determination that the \u201cgrievance procedure\u201d in the 1964 contract is the appropriate procedure in this case and not the \u201cgrievance procedure\u201d of Article #14 of the 1952 agreement which has as its apparent final step:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-15\">\u201cIf a mutual understanding cannot be arrived at, said grievance shall be turned over to the local for further study and a decision.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ab5\">Although the \u201cold\u201d contract was apparently terminated by the union June 19, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>1964, it is possible that the \u201c1952\u201d grievance procedure is the appropriate one in this case. The pension fund at issue was made effective under the old contract and the notes of the hearing on the stay referred to the \u201capplicable grievance procedure\u201d. The parties then proceeded to employ the 1964 grievance procedure. But the record does not give any indication that the district court ever decided this question of which grievance section should be employed to decide pension plan rights granted under the earlier \u201c1952\u201d contract. This latter grievance provision might well require a different conclusion as to whether exhaustion of its provisions produced a \u201cfinal\u201d decision on a \u201cdifference\u201d between Armour and its employees.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">It is appropriate in this case, however, also to point out the legal rules applicable if the district court again decides that these individual employees have obtained a \u201cfinal\u201d decision under the relevant contract grievance procedure. It seems proper under Federal Labor Law that such suits by individuals under Section 301 of the L.M.R.A. not be dragged out indefinitely by procedural or preliminary controversies and that individual claims, if they are properly before the court under Section 301 jurisdiction, be decided on the merits without unnecessary delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-11\">The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that under Section 301, individual employees have the right and the standing to sue on collective bargaining contracts negotiated by their union and their employer.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The broad grant to employees in the early cases, however, has been considerably circumscribed in subsequent decisions. Accordingly, one present rule is that an individual may not sue under Section 301 unless he has first had recourse to the \u201cgrievance\u201d procedures under the collective bargaining contract.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-12\">Under this rule, initially procedural in nature, certain consequences may ensue for the complaining employee with regard to the \u201cmerits\u201d of his suit. As the question is presented on the present record, if the \u201cgrievance procedure\u201d of his contract provides for a \u201cfinal\u201d determination of the \u201cmerits\u201d of his complaint, is an employee barred from further suing under Section 301 ? <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As the district court recognized, the Supreme Court has not yet answered this precise question.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> But other decisions offer some guidance. The Supreme Court\u2019s \u201carbitration\u201d cases,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> suggest that when a comprehensive contractual procedure is available, such as arbitration, federal labor policy demands both initial recourse to such procedures and limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>appeal from the decisions reached.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> One avenue of recourse, however, to allow further suit under Section 301 for individual rights in a collective contract, opens when an employee proves that his union violated its duty of fair representation in representing his interests in the contractual procedure.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Another means of escape from \u201carbitration\u201d finality would also seem possible when an employee shows that the \u201carbitration\u201d is a sham, or is substantially inadequate or unavailable<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has indicated by these decisions that, although a suit may be brought under Section 301 by individual employees, they will escape being bound by a \u201cprivate\u201d decision on the merits of their complaint in only a very few instances.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Frivolous complaints should not clog the courts.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Claims intimately related to a collective bargaining relationship should not allow courts to strait-jacket unions and employers.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> And run-of-the-mill disputes should be settled by the union, on behalf of the employee, because such a procedure substantially assists the union as the employees\u2019 representative.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-13\">But we do not think the teaching of the Supreme Court\u2019s \u201carbitration\u201d decisions means that regardless of the employee claim involved, an agreement between the union and management that the claim was without merit should bind the courts. Rather we think that in a case such as the one at the bar, the district court should consider in some detail whether or not to accept the private determinations made under the contract and thus use it as a basis for summary judgment.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> For instance in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>present case, it might appear that an \u201caccounting\u201d for pension funds is not the type of dispute contemplated by the grievance procedures of the contract.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> What most probably underlies the present dispute are the terms of the Armour Pension Plan and Fund and the contractual provisions relating to \u201cvesting\u201d or termination of coverage.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> While the controversy over or the status of such \u201cold\u201d funds may well be a critical item in the collective bargaining relationship between Armour and Teamsters Local 249, this fact could also show that an employee would have to oppose both Teamsters Local 249 and Armour to get such an accounting.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In deciding whether the grievance procedure provides an acceptable \u201cmerits\u201d determination, in light of the possible unity of union and management interest, the type of procedure afforded becomes relevant.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> For instance, both the 1952 and 1964 contract in the present case did not provide arbitration to resolve disputes. The process contemplated might therefore work only when the union and management took different positions. On the present record their positions on the Pension Plan cannot be determined. In analysing the above factors, before a district court should accept a contractual \u201cmerits\u201d determination as a basis for granting summary judgment under Section 301, the judge should be satisfied that the quality of the contractual grievance procedures, in actual practice and \u201clegally,\u201d is commensurate with the substantiality of the claim or dispute presented by the employee. If the procedures suffer because a union is in breach of its duty of fair representation, clearly the individual should have recourse to the courts.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> If an infirmity less than that is present, federal labor policy would suggest that the rights of a few (the individual employees with complaints) be carefully balanced against the concerns of the many (all employees, who have a collective interest in the bargaining position of their union and the integrity of the contract) .<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>For the foregoing reasons we will reverse the order of June 9, 1967 granting appellee summary judgment, and remand the case for disposition in accordance with the above opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b652-6\">.

Adhering to their earlier decision, 295 F.2d 658 (6th Cir. 1960), the court cited the union\u2019s lack of any bad faith, lack of conspiracy with the employer, or breach of its duty of fair representation as reasons directing a verdict against the employee for \u201cno cause of action.\u201d A second case stemming from the same situation was decided on the same grounds, Simmons v.

Highway Truck Drivers &amp; Helpers Local 107, 233 F.Supp. 115 (E.D.Pa.1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b656-11\">. While \u201carbitration\u201d is clearly favored under federal labor policy, e. g., the Steelworkers cases, supra, note 11, other types of \u201csettlement\u201d may not be as intrinsically satisfactory since further from a \u201cjudicial\u201d model. Factors in evaluating the contract procedure might include consideration of whether an employee can intervene personally [cf. \u00a7 9(a) of the N.L.R.A., 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159(a)), whether he signs a waiver or otherwise overtly consents to the union\u2019s representation, whether a \u201cthird\u201d party acts as the decision maker.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b656-12\">.

The presence of a genuine class action, as alleged in the present case, may serve to differentiate this suit from one involving the complaint of a single employee among many. See cases, supra, footnote 23, and compare Aughenbaugh v. North America Refractories Co., supra, footnote 10, where the suit was brought by several employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
