It reasoned that the facts did not establish such contacts with North Carolina as to allow the defendant to be sued in the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-14\">Upon the findings and conclusions stated by the District Judge in his written opinion, 281 F.Supp. 368, we sustain the judgment now on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
