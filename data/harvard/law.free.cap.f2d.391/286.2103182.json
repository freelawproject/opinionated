State of Alabama, 5 Cir. 1966, 367 F.2d 243, the district court held an evidentiary hearing on appellant\u2019s contentions that a written confession had been coerced from him and that he had had ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-29\">From a review of the record including the transcript of the evidentiary hearing, we conclude that the district court committed no reversible error in these findings.
