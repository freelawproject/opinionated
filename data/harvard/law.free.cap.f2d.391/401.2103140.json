We hold that the Secretary failed to inquire into an important aspect of the matter and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-28\">In 1963 Miss King filed an application for benefits, alleging disability by reason of rheumatic heart disease from March, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>1946, to the date of application. The application was denied, and upon reconsideration at her request the disallowance was affirmed. A hearing was held before an examiner at Miss King\u2019s request, at which she was represented by an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Evidence produced at this hearing (and in earlier dealings with the Secretary) tended to show the following: Miss King was born June 10, 1929, and was eighteen on June 10, 1947. She was considered a sickly child and at about the age of six had rheumatic fever with a possible recurrence in 1946. Her father died in 1962 and she since has lived quietly with her mother in Mt. Vernon, Texas. In 1947 she had a \u201cfainting spell\u201d that was diagnosed by a chiropractor as a heart attack. She is considerably overweight, believes that she has a serious heart condition, and avoids physical exertion. She testified to chest pains, to a \u201csqueaking\u201d noise from her heart so loud that it could be heard in other rooms and that her present condition probably was worse than a year preceding. She also is afflicted with a number of physical ailments unrelated \u2014 or only indirectly related \u2014 to any existing heart condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">After high school, Miss King was employed for several months as a practical nurse at a local hospital. She testified that although not assigned heavy tasks she worked only sporadically and \u201ccouldn\u2019t hold out.\u201d For one week she kept books for an uncle, and for less than one month clerked in a five and ten cent store. In an early interview with the Social Security Office, Miss King reported that she had unsuccessfully tried to find work in Mt. Vernon.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Two physicians who had treated Miss King diagnosed her condition as rheumatic heart disease of a static or slowly progressive nature. A third noted that she had an unusual heart murmur and that he had hospitalized her in 1950 with a diagnosis of congenital heart disease with possible secondary rheumatic fever. Dr. Walling, who had treated Miss King from 1958 to the time of application, diagnosed her condition as rheumatic heart disease with mitral stenosis, and indicated that the condition was static; he observed that she was unable to work because of fatigue symptoms but that X-rays taken in 1957 showed her heart normal in size and shape.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">A physician who examined Miss King under authorization of the Secretary reported that an electrocardiogram taken after exercise showed multiple premature beats which disappeared with rest. Chest X-rays showed clear lung fields and normal heart shadow. He concluded that Miss King \u201cdoes not take very good care of herself in the fact that she has allowed herself to become very obese and she smokes cigarettes. By stopping smoking and losing her excess weight and improving her general physical condition she should be able to carry on her normal household activities without difficulty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">The hearing examiner found that Miss King had never been married and was dependent upon her father, an insured individual within the meaning of section 202(d), at the time of his death. This never has been disputed and we treat it as established. After finding that Miss King had suffered from rheumatic fever \u201cor some form of heart disease\u201d when five or six years old, the examiner concluded that any impairment which occurred was remediable<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and consequently found \u201cno need to further burden [the] decision with a lengthy recital of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>jobs and opportunities the claimant can do within her many residual capabilities.\u201d Since she had not shown \u201cmedically determinable physical impairments of long-continued and indefinite duration which will preclude her from engaging in substantial gainful activity,\u201d Miss King was held not entitled to benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">A request for review was granted by the Appeals Council. After a review of the evidence presented to the hearing examiner, the Council concluded that although Miss King had had rheumatic fever before the age of eighteen the only objective signs of present heart disease were a heart murmur and temporary electrocardiographic changes after exercise. Consequently it held that she presently did not have \u201csignificant heart disease\u201d and did have the physical reserve and the educational background to perform at least light work activity. She had not, therefore, been under a \u201cdisability\u201d as defined in the Act since the age of eighteen.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The present action was then filed to obtain judicial review of this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The sole question before the district court, and now before us, is whether the Secretary properly concluded that at the time of the application Miss King was not under a disability which began before the age of eighteen. Section 202(d) (1) uses \u201cdisability\u201d as defined in section 223(c), 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 423(c):</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">\u201c(2) The term\u2018disability\u2019means\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-13\">(A) inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months * * <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-14\">It is clear from the statutory language that the determination of disability involves a two-step inquiry. First, it is necessary to determine whether \u201cany medically determinable physical or mental impairment\u201d exists. Second, it is necessary to inquire whether this impairment is causally related to an \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity.\u201d See Cyrus v. Celebrezze, 341 F.2d 192, 194 (4th Cir., 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-15\">The statutory requirement that an impairment be \u201cmedically determinable\u201d has been elaborated upon by the Social Security Administration Regulations, 20 C.F.R. 404.1510(a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We do not read the findings of the hearing examiner and of the Appeals Council as determining that no impairment meeting the statutory definition was present. While Miss King\u2019s testimony as to her symptoms \u2014 severe pain, fatigue, shortness of breath, etc. \u2014 may have been insufficient to establish an impairment (a question we need not here decide),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>the Appeals Council specifically found a presently-existing heart murmur and temporary electrocardiograph changes after exercise. We agree that this constitutes sufficient evidence of \u201cmedically discernable * * * physiological aberrations\u201d to establish a \u201cmedically determinable physical * * * impairment\u201d under the Regulations. But whether that impairment is substantial enough to constitute a disability within the meaning of the Act involves another inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">In determining whether or not the impairment was serious enough to result in a disability within the meaning of the Act both the hearing examiner and the Appeals Council gave primary consideration to whether the impairment would prevent Miss King from performing the tasks involved in employment situations. Both concluded it would not and that she was physically able to perform \u201calmost any task which would not require arduous or sustained, vigorous physical activity\u201d (in the words of the examiner) or \u201cat least light work activity\u201d (according to the Appeals Council\u2019s finding). We accept these as having support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">But this does not end the inquiry. In Gardner v. Smith, 368 F.2d 77 (5th Cir., 1966) we made clear that the determination of disability did not end with a determination that an impairment did not affect the ability of the claimant to perform the work involved in theoretically available employment but must continue to a determination of whether the claimant has \u201ca reasonable opportunity to be hired if [jobs] were open and applications for employment were being taken.\u201d We noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">\u201cIf a physical or mental impairment prevents one from obtaining a job, or from even being considered for the job, he is just as unable to engage in that activity as he would be were he unable to perform the work after he had obtained the employment. The ability to perform work existing in the appropriate labor market requires a determination of whether the claimant would be considered for employment if a job vacancy occurred. If, in practice, the claimant could not reasonably be expected to be hired, then no job exists for him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">The record contains no findings \u2014 and almost no inquiry \u2014 regarding this important issue. As this court said in Bridges v. Gardner, 368 F.2d 86 (5th Cir., 1966):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-11\">\u201cMere ability to perform * * * jobs is insufficient to justify a denial of disability benefits. Specific findings * * * are necessary on the issue of whether claiment\u2019s physical condition would prevent him from being hired or from competing for jobs for us to determine whether correct legal standards have been applied in deciding this case. If claimant\u2019s physical condition is such that he can engage in some substantial gainful activity, such as light work * * * it is necessary also that there be a showing of a reasonable opportunity for the claimant to compete in the manner normally pursued by persons genuinely seeking work, for a job within his determined capabilities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azq\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-14\">\u201cUntil proper findings are made we are unable to sustain the present decision as supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>The same disposition was made in Harrison v. Gardner, 369 F.2d 172 (5th Cir., 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"AAS\">We therefore direct the remand of the case to the Secretary for further proceedings in light of the standard set out in Gardner v. Smith, supra.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b477-16\">. \u00a7 402.

Allegations of inability to work as a result of impairment such as dyspnea (shortness of breath), pain, lack of musculoskeletal function, decreased vision or hearing, decreased memory, etc., should be shown to result from structural, physiological or psychological changes which can be identified by the use of clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques. An alleged impairment is medically determinable only if it can be verified by the use of clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b479-17\">. See Davidson v. Gardner, 370 F.2d 803 (6th Cir., 1966) where the opinion of the court (with two members of the panel concurring in the result) indicated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>if the regulation meant that \u201cimpairments, in order to be medically determinable, must be verified by <em>clinical and laboratory diagnostic </em>techniques\u201d, the court would decline to approve application of the regulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b480-8\">. The absence of inquiry into or findings concerning this question would alone justify remand. But this disposition is further indicated by a statement of Miss King\u2019s attorney who, the record suggests, was an older, well-established member of the community. In response to the examiner\u2019s questions, \u201cNow is there anything that you know of in her background that would go to the heart of this disability question that we haven\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>brought out this morning and isn\u2019t in the file or in the record?\u201d, the attorney stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-11\">\u201cI do know that from the general knowledge that the people have in Mt. Vernon of her condition renders it impossible for her to secure employment of any kind, even if she wanted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-12\">If it is true, as this suggests, that the prospective employers in the geographic area are aware of Miss King\u2019s impairment and erroneously believe that it would prevent her from performing the physical activities involved in employment, a disability may well exist. If, of course, any unwillingness to consider her for employment is due to physical conditions unrelated to her heart problems, no causal relationship between the impairment with which we are concerned and inability to engage in employment would exist.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b481-13\">. It may be necessary for the Secretary to reach the issue of remediability. See 20 C.F.R. 404.1502(g). But only if the problems remediable are those on which the alleged disability is based; see note 2, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b481-7\">WISDOM, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A7T\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"AVu\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">This case is one of a lengthening line of cases which, to my mind, frustrates the will of Congress by converting the disability insurance provisions of the Social Security Act into an unemployment compensation law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">With deference to my brothers in this case and in the cases relied on by the majority, I feel compelled to dissent from what I regard as a judicial intrusion on the administrative process and the Congressional scheme of insurance disability benefits. This intrusion imposes on the Secretary the affirmative duty of determining employability as well as disability, i. e. of finding (naming) particular jobs available in the claimant\u2019s community or geographic working area to persons having the claimant\u2019s special skills and particular impairment. The effect is to define disability in the very terms Congress carefully avoided. It turns the statutory burden of proof topsy-turvy. It ignores the Secretary\u2019s broad power and expertise in determining evidentiary standards. The Court\u2019s approach violates the words and the spirit of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"AXD\">T</p>\n<p id=\"b481-14\">When this case was before the district court and when it was briefed and argued before this Court, the parties agreed that the only question at issue was whether substantial evidence supported the administrative findings. The Court has sent that issue into orbit. Now, without the Secretary\u2019s having an opportunity to address himself to the point, the Court considers that the sole issue is whether the Secretary applied the proper standard in denying disability. This standard is not a statutory standard but is a judge-made rule that the Secretary cannot deny disability benefits without first making a \u201cdetermination of whether the claimant has \u2018a reasonable opportunity to be hired if [jobs] were open and applications for employment were being taken\u2019.\u201d Gardner v. Smith, 5 Cir. 1966, 368 F.2d 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-15\">Taking the test at its face value, I do not understand why the findings fail to meet the Court\u2019s requirement. The Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>peals Council adopted the examiner\u2019s finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-5\">\u201cClaimant\u2019s present activities indicate strongly that with the acquisition of some stamina she could perform almost any task which would not require arduous or sustained, vigorous physical activity. Claimant is an educated, intelligent lady. She has an interest and knowledge of medical problems far beyond the average high school graduate. With proper health care, the claimant would be in physical condition to undertake training as a student nurse, training for practical nursing, x-ray, physical therapy, and many other similar fields which are suitable for a lady of her age and her educational background. In our economy at this time, there is a serious shortage of ladies who possess such training. * * * Inasmuch as the Examiner has concluded the claimant has not suffered any significant impairment that is not readily remediable, there is no need to further burden this decision with a lengthy recital of the jobs and opportunities the claimant can do within her many residual capabilities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATo\">The Examiner could just as easily have translated his reference to the specific jobs which the claimant was capable of filling into the loose generalization on which the Court relies. I would hold that substantial non-medical as well as medical evidence supports the finding. However, in this area of administrative law, in striking contrast with all other areas, the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard is a test to be seen but not heard.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">The Court rests its holding on tests laid down in Gardner v. Smith, 5 Cir. 1966, 368 F.2d 77, and Bridges v. Gardner, 5 Cir. 1966, 368 F.2d 86.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These decisions distinguish away or overrule, sub silentio, the following recent Fifth Circuit decisions: Hicks v. Flemming, 302 F.2d 470; Celebrezze v. O\u2019Brient, 323 F.2d 989;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Aldridge v. Celebrezze, 339 F.2d 190; Celebrezze v. Raley, 330 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>755; Witherspoon v. Celebrezze, 328 F.2d 311; Frith v. Celebrezze, 333 F.2d 557; Robinson v. Celebrezze, 326 F.2d 840; Celebrezze v. Sutton, 8 Cir., 338 F.2d 417; and Clinch v. Celebrezze, 328 F.2d 778.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">In discussing this group of cases, a commentator has noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGM\">\u201cThe minority view, which is most consistent with both the statutory language and the legislative history of the program, follows the position maintained by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. This approach places upon the claimant the burden of proving not only that he is disabled from performing his usual occupation, but also that his impairments are so severe that they prevent him from engaging in <em>any </em>form of substantial gainful employment, including work of a physically or mentally lighter type. Thus, unless the claimant adduces unequivocal evidence of a medically-determined total and permanent disability, he must prove a broad negative- \u2014 his inability to do any substantial gainful work \u2014 in order to receive benefits. In denying benefits, the Secretary may find it necessary to rebut the claimant\u2019s contention that his failure to obtain employment has resulted from his physical condition; however, under the Fifth Circuit approach, the Secretary need not prove the <em>availability </em>of specific employment conditions which the claimant can obtain and adequately perform. Consequently, courts adopting this view generally confine the Secretary\u2019s burden on an appeal to the production of credible evidence of the claimant\u2019s ability to do any kind of work, and are correspondingly hesitant to overrule the Secretary\u2019s finding.\u201d Note, Social Security Disability Determinations: The Burden of Proof on</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AyO\">Appeal, 63 Mich.L.Rev. 1465, 1466-67 (1965)..</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">The effect of the instant case, Gardner v. Smith and, to a lesser extent, Bridges v. Gardner is to engraft upon the law the very thing Congress deliberately tried to avoid \u2014 definition of disability in occupational terms. These cases reject as \u201cunrealistic\u201d or merely \u201ctheoretical\u201d the test: \u201cability of the claimant * * * to perform the work were he able to obtain the employment\u201d. Instead, the test is the claimant\u2019s \u201cactual\u201d employability. The Court does not go quite so far as to say that the Secretary must find vacancies available to a claimant, but the Secretary must prove, as an additional substantive element to negative disability, availability of actual employment to the claimant, in light of his skills and particular impairment. The effect is to shift to the Secretary part of the claimant\u2019s statutory burden of proving inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity and, ultimately, to shift to the Secretary the burden of persuasion. A further consequence of this Circuit\u2019s \u201crealistic\u201d test of disability is to require, \u201ceven though there is no present vacancy\u201d, a \u201creasonable expectation that the claimant may be expected to compete for such a job in the future\u201d. Thus the question is not whether available jobs \u201cexist within the national economy\u201d; the question is whether there is a \u201creasonable availability of jobs within the geographical areas within which the claimant would normally be expected to consider if regularly in the labor market\u201d. Gardner v. Smith, 368 F.2d at 83, citing Celebrezze v. Kelly, 5 Cir., 331 F.2d 981.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>In the instant ease the Court seems to think that the appropriate labor market is Mt. Vernon, Texas (1960 population: 1338). See footnote 7 to the Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">The Court\u2019s willingness to consider job availability only in a limited \u2014 in this case, a very limited \u2014 geographic area clearly ties occupational terms into the definition of disability. I say again: \u201cCongress might well have defined disability in broad terms under the Social Security Act and related it to unemployment by qualifying \u2018any substantial gainful activity\u2019 with the words \u2018available in the claimant\u2019s immediate working area\u2019 or similar words. That is not the statutory test; the Act is not an unemployment compensation law.\u201d Celebrezze v. O\u2019Brient, 5 Cir. 1963, 323 F.2d 989, 992.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">The commentators are in agreement with the Secretary in his reading of the legislative history of the disability program. \u201cAs the Secretary has pointed out [U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, 83 Cong.2d Sess. 1954, p. 3730], the legislative history of the disability program strongly suggests that the occupational test was not intended by Congress\u201d, Longshore, The Social Security Disability Insurance Program \u2014 An Example of the Necessity for Judicial Review of Administrative Decisions, 25 Ala.Law. 282, 293 (1964). \u201cIt is to be noted that the statute did not contemplate an occupational disability. * * * [Interpretations that the plaintiff has carried his burden if he has shown] occupational disability and inability to perform work available in his vicinity * * * plainly thwart congressional intent and fly in the face of statutory language\u201d. Rowland, Judicial Review of Disability Determinations, 52 Geo.L.J. 42, 53, 79 (1963). \u201cHowever, requiring the introduction of evidence of actual employment opportunities as an additional element necessary to support the Secretary\u2019s disallowance of a claim seems untenable. The legislative history and language of the Social Security Act clearly prohibit consideration of this factor in determining disability. Moreover, taking account of specific job opportunities in the immediate geographical area brings the program very close to granting compensation for mere unemployment rather than for physical or mental disability. If the availability of employment opportunities is to be recognized to some degree as a substantive element in determining disability (as certainly it is under current judicial practice) the Secretary\u2019s superior access to employment and vocational information and the policy considerations discussed above perhaps justify allocating to him the burden of proving the availability of particular jobs in the <em>national </em>labor market.\u201d Note, Social Security Disability Determinations: The Burden of Proof on-Appeal, 63 Mich.L.Rev. 1464, 1472 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">The legislative history of the law is replete with statements that the definition of disability is \u201cstrict\u201d or \u201cconservative\u201d.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Congress devised the disability insurance system to meet the problems of the permanently disabled,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> carefully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>worded the statutory requirement that the claimant be \u201cunable to engage in any substantial gainful activity,\u201d and put the burden of proof on the claimant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Congress was afraid that a loose application of the law would endanger the Old Age Survivors Insurance trust fund.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Since it first appeared in the 1952 amendments to the Social Security Act (66 Stat. 771) the definition of \u201cdisability\u201d has been virtually the same. The definition has always required an ability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of a physical or mental impairment. From the very first Congress equated \u201cdisability\u201d with \u201ctotal disability\u201d. House Rep. No. 1944, 82nd Cong., 2d Sess., p. 2; Conf. Rep., House Rep. No. 2491, 82nd Cong., 2d Sess., U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1952, p. 2363; House Rep. No. 1698, 83rd Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 22-24; Senate Rep. No. 1987, 83rd Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 20-22, U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1954, p. 3710. Moreover, Congress contemplated that a person would have to be precluded from <em>any </em>work before he would be considered disabled. House Rep. No. 1698, 83rd Cong., 2d Sess., at p. 23; Senate Rep. No. 1987, 83rd Cong., 2d Sess., at p. 21:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">The physical or mental impairment must be of a nature and degree of severity sufficient to justify its consideration as the cause of failure to obtain any substantially gainful work. Standards for evaluating the severity of disabling conditions will be worked out in consultation with the state agencies. They will reflect the requirement that the individual be disabled not for his usual work but also for any type of substantially gainful activity. U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1954, p. 3730.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">There was no change in 1956 when the disability insurance benefits provisions were enacted. House Rep. No. 1189, 84th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 2, 5, 28; Conference Rep., House Rep. No. 2936, 84th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 26, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1956, p. 3877. In its report, the House Committee on Ways and Means said (House Rep. No. 1189, 84th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 5):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-10\">Thus, an individual who is able to engage in any substantial gainful activity will not be entitled to disability insurance benefits <em>even though he is in fact severely disabled. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">Uniform application of the disability provisions of the Social Security Act would be precluded, as a matter of definition, if the test of disability should turn on the availability of jobs a claimant could perform in his home community. The legislative history of the Social Security Act, however, explicitly requires uniform application of the disability provisions. The House Committee on Ways and Means, reporting on H.R. 9366 (containing the provisions for a disability wage freeze), commented that state agencies were to apply the standards developed for evaluating the severity of impairments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-12\">This will promote <em>equal treatment of all disabled individuals </em>under the old-age and survivors\u2019 insurance system <em>in </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number><em>all states. </em>(Emphasis added.) (House Rep. No. 1698, 83rd Cong., 2d Sess., p. 24)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">See also Senate Rep. No. 1987, 83rd Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 20-22, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1954, p. 3730. Similarly, the Conference Report on the H.R. 7225, 84th Cong., 1st Sess. stating that the purpose of having the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare review the disability determinations of state agencies was (House Rep. No. 2936, 84th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 26):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-5\">To assure uniform administration of the disability benefits and to protect the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund from unwarranted costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Finally, a report of the House Committee on Ways and Means, H. Rep. No. 213, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 87, 88, U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1965, p. 1943, in regard to the 1965 amendments to the Social Security Act, notes that in providing disability benefits \u201cCongress designed a conservative program\u201d. The report states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">In line with the original views expressed by our committee and since reaffirmed, to be eligible an individual must demonstrate that he is not only unable, by reason of a physical or mental impairment, to perform the type of work he previously did, but that he is also unable, taking into account his age, education, and experience, to perform any other type of substantial gainful work, <em>regardless of whether or not such work is available to him in the locality in which he lives. </em>. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-8\">******</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">I am as ready as the next judge to fill interstices in federal statutes. To the best of my ability, I guard zealously the judicial function. Moreover, I recognize the hiatus between disability and unemployability in our social security legislation. But Congress deliberately created this hiatus. It is for Congress to fill.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b481-17\">. Professor Jaffe writes: \u201cFascinating and significant is the continuing tug-of-war between the federal courts and the Social Security Agency on the administration of the federal disability payments and the related \u2018disability freeze.\u2019 \u2018Total disability\u2019 is the key condition of entitlement. The applicant has the burden of proof and the agency findings are final if supported by the substantial evidence. A continuing stream of cases comes to the federal district and circuit courts attacking refusal of relief; and in reading them one is struck by their disposition to reject both the agency\u2019s interpretations of \u2018total disability\u2019 and its findings of fact.\u201d Jaffe, Judicial Control of Administrative Action 608 (1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b482-6\">. \u201cThe disability benefit amendments to <em>the </em>Social Security Act have provided the federal courts with a severe test of their ability to deal effectively with an administrative process. In the nine years since Congress passed the first part of the disability program, agency determinations have fared poorly in the reviewing courts, to the extent that 35.3 per cent of the decisions rendered by the district courts have been reversals. While this percentage of reversals is unusual in itself, what is more significant is the fact that the percentage reflects a trend toward increasing judicial review of disability determinations. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that there has also appeared a trend toward use of the remand as a more subtle means of interfering with agency action.\u201d Rowland, Judicial Review of Disability Determinations, 52 Georgetown L.J. 42 (1963). \u201cDuring the calendar year 1964 the district courts affirmed the Secretary\u2019s decision in 415 cases, reversed 239 cases, and remanded 277 cases for further consideration by the Department.
