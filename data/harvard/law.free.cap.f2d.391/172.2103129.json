BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Although the new wrinkle, Mike Hooks, Inc. v. Pena, 5 Cir., 1963, 313 F.2d 696, 1963 AMC 355, is that it sneaks in the back way on removal, this Court is once more confronted with the highly precarious action of dismissal of a complaint on the bare bones pleadings for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Without expressing any opinion whatsoever on its ultimate provability as a Florida claim, we hold here only that this case, like so many already, is now added to the casualty list to worsen the mortality rate. Cf. Barber v. Motor Vessel \u201cBlue Cat,\u201d 5 Cir., 1967, 372 F.2d 626, and cases cited at 627 n. 1. For to the usual looseness must be added the further factor that in testing fraudulent joinder it is enough to show a good faith expectation, not a legal certainty, that the attacked claim is good under state law. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">Plaintiff sued Whirlpool, the Manufacturer,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and its Agent Suleski<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in the Florida State Courts. The Manufacturer removed the case to the Federal Court on the ground that the Agent was joined' as a party for the fraudulent purpose of defeating removal. No motion to remand was filed, nor did the Court on its own raise the question of removability \u2014 in reality the Court\u2019s jurisdiction. But the Agent filed and the Trial Court granted a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. F.R.Civ.P. 12(b). This was done, and is here defended, on the Florida merits, or more accurately the lack of them. After a like fate to the amended complaint which eliminated any possible formal defects to a good claim and the plaintiff declining to amend further, the District Court dismissed the claim against the Agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">The plaintiff appeals from this dismissal which is both \u2018final\u201d for appeal <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and res judicata in any future suit in the Florida Courts. The parties by brief continued to wage battle on the Florida merits with scarcely a deferential genuflection toward the spectre of removability. Not so the Court. For to this Court, calling for supplemental briefs, Florida substantive liability, although a significant issue, is tangential to removability and hence jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-12\">It rounds out this prologue to point up this little irony. On Manufacturer\u2019s thesis of removability, at the hands of a Court which acquired jurisdiction over him because he ought never to have been in the case at all so that had he not formally been a party, the corporate nonresident could have removed on simple diversity, the Agent is adjudged finally to have no liability. Federal jurisdiction rests on the fiction that the resident defendant is not really a party, not really \u201cpresent,\u201d yet the Court below adjudicated finally the rights of the one not \u2018there.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>The complaint charged both defendants \u2014 Manufacturer and Agent \u2014 with making misrepresentations about the heating ability of air heating-conditioning units sold to plaintiff for installation in a multi-unit apartment construction project, and with being negligent in making the representations. In considerable factual detail it set out the transaction. Plaintiff, then constructing the apartment project, made a written contract (attached) with Manufacturer for the air units. After examination of the building plans, both Manufacturer and Agent represented by the attached writings that the units would adequately heat the apartments.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiff relied on the representations as Manufacturer and Agent, experts in the field, knew it would. But the units did not heat.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As a result plaintif sustained damages ($450,000.00) for removal, renewal costs plus consequential loss of tenants, revenues and ability to amortize the mortgage. By Count II it was specifically alleged that \u201cdefendants were negligent in making recommendations to plaintiff to use said air conditioning units.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-16\"> Unlike the parties who joust for victory on who wins or loses our sole concern is: Who tries the case? State or Federal Court? For to us we cannot escape the problem of removability. The Agent-appellee makes the initial contention that plaintiff cannot contest the jurisdiction of the Federal Court since it failed to contest the petition for removal and has never moved to have the cause remanded. The result of plaintiff\u2019s inaction, says the Agent, is to admit all the allegations in the Manufacturer\u2019s petition for removal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As a general rule this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>is true when the allegations concern questions of fact, O\u2019Campo v. Hardisty, 9 Cir., 1959, 262 F.2d 621, but Manufacturer\u2019s petition asserts only that as a matter of law plaintiff has not stated a cause of action against Agent which makes the joinder fraudulent. That legal contention is controverted, plaintiff says, not by facts touching on motive for removal but by plaintiff\u2019s demonstration that the Florida law is different from what they think it to be. See Smith v. Southern Pac. Co., 9 Cir., 1951, 187 F.2d 397.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To this may be added the now considerable doubt whether under <em>Finn </em>(note 7 supra) the right to challenge removability is ever lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">To the Court\u2019s expressed concern that <em>Finn </em>(note 7 supra) and its reading of \u201cseparate and independent claim\u201d in section 1441(c) <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> could sustain removal, the parties quickly join in a disavowal. Manufacturer is first to acknowledge that removal rests on sections 1441(a) <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and (b) <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and the still viable Judge-imported concept of fraudulent joinder. Wilson v. Republic Iron &amp; Steel Co., 1921, 257 U.S. 92, 42 S.Ct. 35, 66 L.Ed. 144. We have held this to be unaffected by revisions of the 1948 Judicial Code.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Covington v. Indemnity Ins. Co., 5 Cir., 1958, 251 F.2d 930; Bentley v. Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Co., 5 Cir., 1949, 174 F.2d 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-14\">We have stated the standard for determining this in Parks v. New York Times Co., 5 Cir., 1962, 308 F.2d 474, at 478:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-15\">\u201c[T]here can be no fraudulent joinder unless it be clear that there can be no recovery under the law of the state on the cause alleged, or on the facts in view of the law * * *. One or the other at least would be required before it could be said that there was no real intention to get a joint judgment, and that there was no colorable ground for so claiming.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-16\">This is an <em>Erie </em>problem in part, but only part. In the usual diversity situation a Federal Court, no matter how difficult the task, must ascertain (and then apply) what the state law is. Cf. United Services Life Ins. Co. v. Delaney, 5 Cir., 1962, 308 F.2d 484, reheard en banc, 1964, 328 F.2d 483, on receipt of answer to certification, 1966, 358 F.2d 714, cert. denied, 385 U.S. 846, 87 S.Ct. 39, 17 L.Ed.2d 77. But here the question is whether there is arguably a reasonable basis for predicting that the state law might impose liability on the facts in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>volved. If that possibility exists, a good faith assertion of such an expectancy in a state court is not a sham, is not colorable and is not fraudulent in fact or in law. Albi v. Street &amp; Smith Pub., Inc., 9 Cir., 1944, 140 F.2d 310; Gillette v. Koss Const. Co., W.D.Mo., 1957, 149 F.Supp. 353; Richardson v. Southern Idaho Water Power Co., 9 Cir., 1913, 209 F. 949.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Thus we get to the question: Is there a reasonably good chance that Florida today will hold the Agent to some liability? In answering it, we assume without deciding that we must look to the original state court pleading,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> not the amended complaint filed after removal. We may readily do this if we read it through the Federal, not Florida, lenses. Barber v. Motor Vessel \u201cBlue Cat,\u201d 5 Cir., 1967, 372 F.2d 626, of Conley v. Gibson, 1957, 355 U.S. 41, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-6\">\u201c[T]he accepted rule [is] that a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Id. at 45-46, 78 S.Ct. at 102, 2 L.Ed.2d at 84.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This is especially true since the <em>Erie </em>lights, of significant, but not decisive, importance are, for a change, rather bright.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-13\"> The Florida law of actionable misrepresentation was recently capsulated into the following elements in Kutner v. Kalish, Fla.Dist.Ct.App., 1965, 173 So.2d 763, 765:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-14\">\u201c(1) a misrepresentation of material fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-15\">(2) [a] knowledge of the representor of the misrepresentation, or, [b] representations made by the representator without knowledge. as to either truth or falsity, or, [c] representations made under circumstances in which the representor ought to have known, if he did not know, of the falsity thereof,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-16\">(3) an intention that the representation induce another to act on it, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-17\">(4) resulting injury to the party acting in justifiable reliance on the representation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-18\">See Joiner v. McCullers, 1947, 158 Fla. 562, 28 So.2d 823; Watson v. Jones, 1899, 41 Fla. 241, 25 So. 678; Wheeler v. Baars, 1894, 33 Fla. 696, 15 So. 584. We have set out the Florida elements of fraud in full above because its law is different from most jurisdictions in that the representor does not have to have knowledge of the falsity of his statement to be held liable<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Instead, negligent misstatement is enough. See Watson v. Jones, 1899, 41 Fla. 241, 25 So. 678, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>where the Court said that \u201cwhen it is shown that the statement was material and false, and that the defendant\u2019s situation or means of knowledge were such as to make it incumbent upon him as a matter of duty to know whether the statement was true or false, the conclusion is almost irresistible that he did know that which his duty required him to know.\u201d Id. at 254, 25 So. at 682. Of course we realize, as do the Florida Courts, that this formula \u2014 negligence equals knowledge \u2014 is a fiction. But fictions can be useful to plug up holes in legal theory. Thus to provide a remedy where the rigidity of the fraud action failed, Forida has held a representer liable for negligence. Cf. Derry v. Peek, 1889, 14 App.Cas. 337; see generally Prosser, Torts \u00a7 102 (3d ed. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Comparing the Florida requisites of a fraud action with the <em>Conley </em>reading of plaintiff\u2019s complaint, we are satisfied that a reasonable possibility exists that plaintiff could persuade Florida Courts that he has a cause of action against the Agent.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-16\">Nor will this Florida result be different because Agent was an agent for a disclosed principal. That such an agent may be liable personally in an action for fraud has been well-settled in Florida since Wheeler v. Baars, 1894, 33 Fla. 696, 15 So. 584, where the Court said that \u201cfor deceit and false representations made by an agent in the course of his employment <em>both the agent and his principal are civilly liable </em>* * (Emphasis added.) Id. at 713, 15 So. at 589.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We detect no movement in Florida away from <em>Wheeler,</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and we ascertain nothing to make us doubt that Agent was indeed moving within his sphere of authority.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-17\">In the unique role this removal question assigns to us it is more than ordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>narily appropriate to emphasize certain things. Whether plaintiff can make out a case we do not know. Whether he can do so is a matter for the Florida Courts to decide on the evidence brought forward and in the light of legal theories Florida is free to embrace. There may be deficiencies in the proof on affirmative defenses.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> And not for the first time,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> the Florida Courts may disagree with either our declaration or prediction of Florida law.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Thus requiring remand the case ends as it began: A Florida suit involving Florida law to be determined by a Florida Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b250-8\">.

But it is not disinterested nor are its interests either neglected, unasserted, or unrevealed. For Agent Suleski\u2019s able counsel have with propriety and vigor appeared expressly for both.

It only gets more incongruous when Manufacturer, arguing with some plausibility that removability must be tested by the Federal Court on the pleadings as filed in the State Court, asserts that when the Federal Court impliedly adopts the theory of non-liability of the local defendant to continue its jurisdiction over the nonresident defendant, such court is powerless to allow amendment to the claim against the local defendant. Probably the only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>time, the only place, the only situation in which a plaintiff gets a single shot at a sitting duck defendant, such a declaration this late in the twentieth century would surely make the skeletons rattle.

The horse proved to be unsound, and Shaw sued Oliver\u2019s administrator, Swann, and collected a judgment. Swann, as administrator of Oliver\u2019s estate, then brought suit against Croom, the principal, for indemnification. The issue on appeal was whether the record in Shaw v. Swann (which evidently was not appealed) could be introduced in the suit for indemnification. Thus anything said in <em>Croom </em>about an agent\u2019s liability would be dicta. Whether that dicta, even supposing that it forecasts non-liability for an agent, is still valid in light of the clear expressions of Florida law in later cases is a question we need not decide, but may merely say that it is not clear that as a matter of law that Agent is not liable in the present suit.
