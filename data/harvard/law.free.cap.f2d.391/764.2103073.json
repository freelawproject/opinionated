Appellant, Western Casualty &amp; Surety Company, insured Teel Laundry with a General Comprehensive Liability policy excluding coverage for bodily injury \u201cto an employee of the insured arising out of and in the course of his employment of the insured.\u201d Bonnie Gates, a minor, was injured while operating a freight elevator within the premises of Teel Laundry on September 14, 1965. Bonnie Gates instituted an action by her father and next friend, John Gates, in the District Court of Muskogee County, Oklahoma, against the Teels, Langes and Mortons, doing business as Teel Laundry and Dry Cleaning Company and these defendants demanded that appellant assume the defense of the action and protect their interest by reason of the above mentioned policy. Appellant initiated this federal Declaratory Judgment action to have its rights as insurer determined alleging that no obligation existed as the policy excluded bodily injury to an employee of the insured arising out of and in the course of his employment by the insured and that at the time of the injury Bonnie Gates was an employee of the insured Teel Laundry. The trial court found that Bonnie Gates was not an employee and that the accident was covered by the insurance policy issued by appellant. Appellant takes issue with this determination. An appeal was also taken by appellees Bonnie Gates and John Gates who sought in a motion for new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>trial to have the declaratory action dismissed on the grounds that the district court should not have assumed jurisdiction because there was pending in the state court an identical suit between identical parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">The first issue considered is the denial of the motion for new trial on the grounds that the federal court should not have assumed jurisdiction of a matter when there was pending in the state court an action wherein the same issues would be raised. This argument is based upon the principle stated by this court in Franklin Life Insurance Co. v. Johnson, 10 Cir., 157 F.2d 653, that a federal court will generally not entertain jurisdiction in a declaratory action if the identical issues are involved in another pending proceeding.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellee Gates argues that because Western Casualty is an insurer of the Teel Laundry Company, defendant in the state court action, it is an interested party in that proceeding. This court in Duggins v. Hunt, 10 Cir., 323 F.2d 746, at 748, stated, \u201cThe questions of when to exercise jurisdiction, when to hold jurisdiction in abeyance, and when to reject jurisdiction are to be determined initially by the trial court, * * * and the judgment of the trial court will be reviewed by this court only to consider whether a clear abuse of discretion appears.\u201d It was also recognized by this court in Franklin Life Insurance Co. v. Johnson, supra, that courts should not be deterred from \u201cgiving full force and effect to the purpose of the Declaratory Judgment Act.\u201d In the instant case there was clearly no abuse by the trial court in refusing to grant appellee\u2019s motion. In Maryland Casualty Company v. Consumers Finance Service, Inc., 3 Cir., 101 F.2d 514, it was held that a trial court abused its discretion in refusing to exercise its jurisdiction in a case substantially the same as the instant case. The decision was based upon well recognized law that jurisdiction may not be refused merely on the ground that another remedy is available or because of the pendency of another suit if the controversy between the parties will not necessarily be determined in that suit. Since the issues raised by the insurer would not be determined in the state court suit by the injured party it was held to be an abuse of discretion not to hear the Federal Declaratory Judgment action. The fact that such issues might later arise in a garnishment action in the state courts does not mean that the federal courts should refuse to exercise its jurisdiction under the Declaratory Judgment Act. It was additionally recognized by this court in Franklin Life Insurance Co. v. Johnson, supra, that a declaratory action by an insurer to establish nonliability under casualty insurance was one of the prime purposes of the Declaratory Judgment Act. It should be further noted this issue was first raised on motion for new trial after trial had been held and the judgment entered. By invoking the principle asserted by appellee judicial proceedings would not be conserved but actually wasted. The potential interference with state proceedings would have to be extremely great to justify reversal of the trial court\u2019s decision to accept jurisdiction when the-issue was not raised until after trial was completed. Certainly the facts of this case do not present such an extreme case.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">The sole argument raised by appellant Western Casualty was that the insurance exclusion clause was unambiguous as determined by this court in Tri-State Casualty Insurance Co. v. Loper, 10 Cir., 204 F.2d 557, and that therefore its terms are to be understood in their plain, ordinary and popular sense, citing Order of United Commercial Travelers of America v. Edwards, 10 Cir., 51 F.2d 187. The issue in the instant case was whether Bonnie Gates was an employee of Teel Laundry. Appellee argues that the trial court failed to determine if Bonnie Gates was an employee as that term is understood in its plain, ordinary and popular sense, but instead feels that \u201cThe joinder of the case involving work<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>men\u2019s compensation may have caused the Trial Court to erroneously apply in this case a legal or technical meaning to the term \u2018employee\u2019 as used in the Oklahoma Statutes involving child labor. * * * It is apparent that the Trial Court failed to distinguish between the compensation case and the one at bar, and applied to each the same definition of the term \u2018employee.\u2019 \u201d This assertion is based upon a statement made by the trial court at the conclusion of the trial when upon request of counsel the court made an oral statement of its probable decision. Therein the court stated, \u201cNow everyone seems to feel that Bonnie Gates was an employee, at least in the non-legal or popular meaning of the word. If I understand correctly, or remember correctly, she herself in the state court action has assumed that position. But, I do not consider her an employee of the company in any way. I am of the opinion she was not an employee of the Teel Laundry in any sense of the word.\u201d This statement does not in any way support the position taken by appellant. It is patently clear that the trial court did not consider Bonnie Gates to be an employee in any sense of the use of that term, either in the plain and ordinary meaning or in the legal sense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This is made further clear by the trial court\u2019s findings of facts, wherein the court states, \u201cThe Court finds that * * * Bonnie Gates, a minor, was not an employee of Teel Laundry and Dry Cleaning Company, either legal or illegal, and that the Court, from the evidence finds that Bonnie Gates, a minor, was not a legal or illegal or any type of employee of the defendant, Teel Laundry and Dry Cleaning Company and the owners of the said organization.\u201d Since the trial court did not find Bonnie Gates to be an employee in any sense of the word including the popular meaning of the term, the sole issue that remains is whether the evidence supports the findings of facts necessary for the court to make the conclusion that Bonnie Gates was not an employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\"> The basic facts of Bonnie\u2019s relationship to Teel Laundry are not in dispute. These facts are that Bonnie\u2019s mother, Mrs. Eleanor Jane Gates, was a regular employee at Teel Laundry. During the summer preceding the accident Bonnie Gates and other children whose mothers were also employed at Teel Laundry, folded rags and towels at the Teel Laundry on a more or less irregular basis. No set hours for their folding work were made and reimbursement for this work was to the mothers on the basis of the number of towels folded by the children. The children were under no direct supervision and the folding work done by the children was also done by regular employees of the Teel Laundry. The trial court in its findings of fact No. 4 found \u201cThe court further finds that the presence of Bonnie Gates in said Teel Laundry and Dry Cleaning Company was shown by the evidence to be a practical way of maintaining employee relations with her mother the same as they did with other mothers under similar circumstances and was a method of controlling the children while in the plant by way of giving them something useful to do, by letting them and Bonnie Gates fold towels or rags and this was not done as an employee of Teel Laundry and Dry Cleaning Company and was not done as a part of an operation of steam laundry, dry cleaning and pressing and was not done with any machinery and was not a dangerous operation, * * and further that Bonnie Gates, a minor, was not an employee of Teel Laundry and Dry Cleaning Company and that she was not paid by Teel Laundry and Dry Cleaning Company even though extra money was added to the pay check of the mother for the folding of said towels and that in essence that Bonnie Gates was an employee of the mother, and the defendant, Teel Laundry and Dry Cleaning Corn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>pany, did not see that the pay, that was added to the mother\u2019s check, was to go to said Bonnie Gates, but that this entire transaction was upon the agreement and under the direction of the mother of Bonnie Gates which made her in essence if she was anybody\u2019s employee, which this court doubts, an employee of her mother.\u201d This finding of fact concerning the relationship and intention of the parties concerning the relationship is not clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> From this basic factual relationship it is clear that the court\u2019s conclusion that Bonnie Gates was not an employee of the Teel Laundry and Dry Cleaning Company is correct and that therefore even if the employee exclusion clause of the insurance policy is construed as meaning employee in the commonest sense the trial court was correct in holding that Bonnie Gates was not excluded from coverage under this policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-20\">Although the above discussion is sufficient to affirm the trial court\u2019s decision it might give an impression of affirmance of appellant\u2019s position that the language of the employee exclusion clause of the insurance was to be interpreted as meaning an employee in any sense of the word. To place such an interpretation upon this phrase raises the possibility that a person might be found an employee sufficient to apply the exclusion clause of the public liability insurance and yet not sufficient to come within the meaning of employee for coverage under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation laws. That such a result would have been intended by the insured seems unlikely for it would mean that an area would exist for which he would not have any insurance coverage. There is no Oklahoma case dealing with the interpretation of the exclusion clause in question.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Other courts, however, have rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>ognized the relationship between the employee exclusion from public liability policies and coverage under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation laws. It is stated in Vol. 12, Couch on Insurance 2d, \u00a7 44:483 \u201cWhere the distinction made by an employer\u2019s public liability policy is phrased so as to exclude \u2018employees\u2019 that term is treated as the equivalent of a reference to those persons who are .entitled to compensation under the workmen\u2019s compensation act.\u201d Also in Turnage v. State Farmers Mutual Tornado Insurance Co., Mo.App., 388 S.W.2d 342 at 346, the court states, \u201cWhile the idea did not originate in this court, the Missouri courts (and those in some other states) have consistently turned to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act and the decisions thereunder in questions involving the meaning of the word \u2018employee\u2019 as used in exclusion clauses of liability insurance policies. * * * \u201d See also Weiss v. Employers\u2019 Liability Assur. Corp., 131 Misc. 301, 226 N.Y.S. 732; Shapiro v. Employers\u2019 Liability Assur. Corp., 139 Misc. 454, 248 N.Y.S. 587; and I-L Logging Co. v. Manufacturers &amp; Wholesalers Indemnity Exchange, 202 Or. 277, 275 P.2d 226; and Lumber Mutual Casualty Insurance Co. v. Stukes, 4 Cir., 164 F.2d 571. This court in B &amp; H Passmore Metal &amp; Roofing Co. v. New Amsterdam Casualty Co., 10 Cir., 147 F.2d 536, held that the phrase of an exclusion clause \u201cengaged in business\u201d is to be construed differently than the workmen\u2019s compensation phrase \u201carising out of and in the course of his employment\u201d and, therefore, that the two coverages do not necessarily match. The case involved transportation given an employee after his work was over and during which time the court found that he was not an employee as intended by the employee exclusion clause although he might have been considered an employee under workmen's compensation laws. The Passmore decision, however, is not authority for holding that the instant employee exclusion clause is not to be construed in accordance with the Workmen\u2019s Compensation laws as a significant difference exists in the language of the two employee exclusion clauses. Great reliance was placed by this court in the Passmore decision upon the use of the words \u201cengaged in business\u201d whereas in the instant employee exclusion clause the phrase is \u201carising out of and in the course of his employment,\u201d the same phrase that is universally used in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Statutes. This is, we believe, a clear expression of intent of the two parties that the employee exclusion clause as used in the public liability insurance is intended to correspond to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation coverage. The correct interpretation of the employee exclusion clause used in this case would be gained by considering whether Bonnie Gates was a legal employee as that term is construed under the Oklahoma Workmen\u2019s Compensation cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">In Rock Island Coal Mining Co. v. Gilliam, 89 Okl. 49, 213 P. 833, the Oklahoma Supreme Court held that employment of minors which was illegal under the Child Labor Laws did not come within coverage under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Statutes. The undisputed evidence in this case showed that Bonnie Gates was 13 years of age at the time she was working in the Teel Laundry, which was a steam laundry. 40 Okl.St.Ann. \u00a7 71 states, \u201cNo child under the age of 14 years shall be employed or permitted to work in any * * * steam laundry * * It is, therefore, clear that the district court was correct in saying that Bonnie Gates was not a legal employee and, therefore, construing the employee exclusion clause of the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>liability insurance policy as corresponding to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Statutes, Bonnie Gates should not be excluded from coverage under that policy. See New Amsterdam Casualty Co. v. Soileau, 5 Cir., 167 F.2d 767, and Scarpelli v. Travelers Indemnity Co., 7 Cir., 248 F.2d 791.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b842-7\">. Brillhart v. Excess Ins.
