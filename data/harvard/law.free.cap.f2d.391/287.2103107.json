He was sentenced on April 3, 1967, to serve two concurrent sentences of twenty years. There was no direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-14\">There is no merit to the contention of the appellant that the judgment should be vacated because the district court misled him as to the sentence which could be imposed, so that his plea of guilty was not made with full understanding of its consequences. Appellant received a lesser sentence than either that which the district court informed appellant it could impose or the maximum sentence provided by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-15\">The maximum term of imprisonment, however, which can be imposed for violation of \u00a7 2113, subsections (a), (b) and (d), where there has been but one bank robbery, is twenty-five years. These subsections do not create separate offenses; rather, they create different maximum punishments for a single offense depending on whether aggravating circumstances exist. Heflin v. United States, 5 Cir., 1955, 223 F.2d 371; United States v. Williamson, 5 Cir., 1958, 255 F.2d 512, cert. denied, 358 U.S. 941, 79 S.Ct. 348, 3 L.Ed.2d 349, reversed on another ground, 265 F.2d 236; United States v. Gardner, 7 Cir., 1965, 347 F.2d 405, cert. denied, 382 U.S. 1015, 86 S.Ct. 626, 15 L.Ed.2d 529; [Heflin v. United States, 358 U.S. 415, 79 S.Ct. 451, 3 L.Ed.2d 407 (1959), held that consecutive sentences cannot be imposed for violations of subsections (c) and (d) of \u00a7 2113.] One of the concurrent sentences imposed in this cause must, therefore, be vacated, and, for this purpose the cause is reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
