Appellant attacks his conviction in Tennessee Courts as federally unconstitutional on the grounds that along with the charge of burglary, he was likewise charged with being an habitual criminal, and under then existing Tennessee law<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> prior convictions were admitted as to the latter charge before the jury which also heard the burglary charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-17\">Here the District Judge found \u201climiting instructions\u201d at the state trial designed to tell the jury that such convictions should be \u201cadmissible * * * only as proof\u201d on the habitual criminal charge. See T.C.A. \u00a7 40-2804.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-19\">As the District Judge pointed out in his opinion, the majority of the United States Supreme Court has squarely determined that this procedure is not violative of the federal Constitution, even though the instructions may be \u201cinadequate\u201d to vitiate the prejudice.

State of Texas, 385 U.S. 554, 562, 87 S.Ct. 648, 17 L.Ed.2d 606 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-20\">For these reasons and those advanced in the opinion of the court, the judgment of the United States District Court is affirmed.
