The committee, therefore, decided to allocate the 18,720 acres of cotton in the hardship and inequity reserve on a pro rata basis. Appellees, owners of farms in Hockley County with a cotton allotment of less than 7% of their cultivated acres, the average cotton allotment being 37.5% of the total crop land in each farm in the county, appealed to the Review Committee contending that their allotments should have been further increased in such manner and proportion as would increase their ratio of cotton allotment to total crop land to the average of comparable neighboring farms. The decision of the county committee was upheld by the Review Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-16\">Appellees petitioned the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas for review of the Review Committee\u2019s determination respecting appellees\u2019 allotments. The district court ruled that the hardship and inequity reserve was arbitrarily distributed on a pro rata basis in violation of the Act and the pertinent Acreage Allotment Regulations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court then concluded that the farms operated by appellees fell within the meaning of \u201cinequity and hardship\u201d under the terms of the Act, and therefore, as a matter of law, appellees were entitled to have their allotments increased on the basis of inequity and hardship to the extent necessary to provide them with cotton allotments with respect to their respective farms \u201cto the approximate average of comparable neighboring farms\u201d in the county. The court remanded the case to the Review Committee with direction that it make the proper determinations in accordance with the court\u2019s judgment. We affirm as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>The district court correctly ruled that the hardship and inequity reserve can not be distributed on a pro rata basis.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, that portion of the district court\u2019s judgment holding that appellees\u2019 farms fell within the meaning of \u201cinequity and hardship\u201d and that appellees\u2019 allotments should have been increased to the approximate average of comparable neighboring farms in Hockley County is erroneous. It is not within the competence of the district court to decide whether appellees\u2019 farms are hardship or inequity cases or to determine precisely what action the Review Committee should take to rectify the hardship or inequity, if one exists. It is for the several administrative committees to consider the various factors enumerated in 7 C.F.R. 722.211(c) (4)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and to allocate the hardship and inequity reserve in accordance with its evaluation of the particular circumstances of each individual farm. Glad<em>ney </em>v. Review Committee, 380 F.2d 929 (5 Cir. 1967); Review Committee v. Gladney, 354 F.2d 990 (5 Cir. 1966).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">\u201cAdjustments in farm allotments to correct inequities and to prevent hardship. The county committee shall determine the acreage required from the county reserve to supplement any acreage allocated to the county from the State reserve to correct inequities in farm allotments and to prevent hardship. Such reserves may also be used for establishing and adjusting farm allotments as provided in paragraph (g) of this section and to provide fair and reasonable allotments where the county committee had insufficient information to make proper adjustments at the time the original allotment for the farm was established. Any acreage from the county reserve and any allocation to the county from the State reserve to correct inequities and prevent hardship may be used by the county committee for making adjustments in farm allotments to correct inequities and to prevent hardship, <em>talcing into consideration for the farm the acreages planted to cotton in the farm base years, the land, labor, and equipment available for the production of cotton; crop rotation practices; the soil and other physical facilities affecting the production of cotton; and abnormal conditions or production and any other factors </em>for correcting inequities and preventing hardship.\u201d (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">Consequently, the court\u2019s decision is modified in the following respects: The final language in the second paragraph, holding appellees\u2019 farms to be within the meaning of inequity and hardship and that they are entitled to have their allotments adjusted, beginning immediately after the words \u201cSecretary of Agriculture\u201d is hereby eliminated.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Further the ordering paragraph of the District Court\u2019s judgment<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> directing the Review Committee to increase the appellees allotments is changed and modified to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-9\">IT IS, THEREFORE, ORDERED and DECREED by the Court that the respective causes be, and they are hereby remanded to the Review Committee, Venue II, Defendant herein, for further proceedings in accordance with the rule set forth in the decisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>this court in Gladney v.
