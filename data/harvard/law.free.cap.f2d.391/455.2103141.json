BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Appellant, his father and a brother were indicted for violating and conspiring to violate 50 App. U.S.C. \u00a7 462(a), a part of the Universal Military Service and Training Act, by hindering and interfering with administration of the Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The father and the brother were acquitted. Appellant was convicted on evidence of an assault upon a member of his Local Board. The case arose out of the circumstances now to be stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Appellant was given initially a 3-A hardship deferred classification. Thereafter the Board reclassified him as 1-A. He then sought deferment for a year to help his father on his farm. This was denied. There was evidence that about a week later appellant met up with Mr. Joseph M. Brogdon, a member of the Board, and asked, \u201cAre you going to change your mind ?\u201d, to which Mr. Brogdon replied, \u201cAbout what?\u201d, to which appellant responded, \u201cYou know what,\u201d with Mr. Brogdon then saying \u201cI can\u2019t change my mind,\u201d whereupon appellant assaulted Mr. Brogdon. There is some' evidence to the effect that Mr. Brogdon struck the first blow.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Appellant and his father testified that the altercation was not due to appellant\u2019s classification and denial of deferment but to a dispute with Mr. Brogdon over payment for the hauling of his cattle by the Chambers. They denied any intention of hindering or impeding the Board or its members in their duties. Thus, assuming that appellant was the aggressor, there was an issue for the jury as to whether appellant\u2019s intent at the time of the altercation brought the matter within section 462(a), note 1 supra, or whether there was only an assault within state jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-14\">Appellant urges that his conviction must be reversed because, <em>inter alia, </em>he was not properly advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights before making the incriminating statements which were admitted into evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-15\"> This case is squarely governed by our recent decision in Windsor v. United States, 5 Cir., 1968, 389 F.2d 530. There as here appellant was advised of his right to speak to or consult with an attorney, but was not advised that \u201che was entitled to the <em>presence </em>of an attorney, retained or appointed, during the interrogations.\u201d We held in <em>Windsor </em>that this did not meet the <em>Miranda </em>criteria for admissibility. Similarly, lack of compliance with the standards of <em>Miranda </em>is apparent here. The incriminating statements were inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-16\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b532-10\">. 50 App.U.S.C. \u00a7 462(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-11\">* * * any person or persons who shall knowingly hinder or interfere or attempt to do so in any way, by force or violence or otherwise, with the administration of this [said sections] or the rules or regulations made pursuant thereto * * * shall, upon conviction in any district court of the United States of competent jurisdiction, be punished by imprisonment for not more than five years or a fine of not more than $10,000, or by both such fine and imprisonment * * *.
