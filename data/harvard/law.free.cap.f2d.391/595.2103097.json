Mrs. Horton was paid $10,000 in settlement of her injury claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-23\"> Paris sued State Farm to compel payment under an insurance policy issued by State Farm to Paris, which covered such an accident. The District Court granted State Farm\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground that Paris had not complied with certain conditions precedent to liability on the policy. Paris appealed. The policy in question explicitly provides that an insured may not sue the company unless all terms of the policy have been fully met. Among the terms of the policy are provisions that written notice of any accident must be given \u201cas soon as practicable,\u201d and that the \u201cinsured shall immediately forward to the Company every demand, notice, summons or other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>process received by him or his representatives.\u201d Written notice of the accident was first given over nine months after the accident occurred. Papers pertinent to the suit brought by Mrs. Horton against Paris were not forwarded to State Farm until almost two months after the suit was brought and after defensive pleadings had been filed. In these circumstances the District Court was clearly correct in holding that Paris had not complied with the notice provisions of the policy, and that, therefore, no action could lie against the company.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b672-12\">. Paris\u2019 contention that State Farm is estopped from asserting failure to comply with the notice provisions is unavailing since Paris has failed to show an \u201cintended deception\u201d or \u201cgross negligence\u201d by State Farm.
