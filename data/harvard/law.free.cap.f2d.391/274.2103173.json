The Tax Court found that under the facts and circumstances of this case, taxpayer had no \u201chome\u201d within the meaning of section 162(a) (2), and that he could not, therefore, deduct his unreimbursed living expenses. The record plainly shows that taxpayer was an itinerant during the years in question, and as such he is not entitled to the deduction under section 162(a) (2). James v. United States, 9 Cir. 1962, 308 F.2d 204; Whitman v. United States, W.D.La.1965, 248 F.Supp. 845.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b350-15\">. Frank Scotten\u2019s wife, Mary, is a party to this action only because she filed joint income tax returns with her husband during the years in question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b350-24\">. Taxpayer alternatively contended that his home was in Chicago, the location of his employer\u2019s headquarters.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
