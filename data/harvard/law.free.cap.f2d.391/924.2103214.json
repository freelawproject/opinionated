As a result the internal and external surfaces of the relays became coated with' an oil film which proved to be nonremovable, destroying their usefulness. The district court, sitting without jury, found that the goods had been \u201ccontaminated\u201d by the oil within the meaning of the exclusion clause, and entered judgment for the defendant. Plaintiff appeals.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">Plaintiff asserts that a common meaning of the verb \u201ccontaminate\u201d is to introduce a foreign substance effecting a deleterious change in the product. This is true enough. It concedes, however, as it must, that a product is commonly spoken of as contaminated when the foreign substance merely injures its usefulness without affecting the original physical characteristics. Milk rendered unfit by the introduction of bacteria is contaminated, but so is it by the commingling of an inactive substance which makes it unacceptable to the eye or tongue. We agree with the district court, 283 F.Supp. 211 that \u201cwhile the introduction of an * * * [undesirable] element may change the product itself, it is not essential to contamination that it do so.\u201d Indeed, no dictionary we have found suggests otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-10\">Plaintiff does not so much deny this as reply that if a word has two common meanings it is ambiguous, and hence the policy is to be construed against the company. This proves too much. Applied literally, the company would always lose, for the insured could always insist upon whatever was the nonapplicable meaning in the particular case. Rather, the rule must be that if both meanings are commonly understood and equally familiar, both must apply unless there is some reason for selecting only one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-11\">Under the reach of this clause, unless the originating external cause was fire, lightning, windstorm, vandalism, theft or other listed cause, the policy excluded among others, all losses due to dampness, dryness of atmosphere, change of temperature, shrinkage, loss of weight, rust and contamination. We cannot see how anyone could reasonably think that whether the contaminant entered into a chemical reaction with the spoiled goods was in any way significant. Cf. American Cas. Co. of Reading, Pa. v. Myrick, 5 Cir., 1962, 304 F.2d 179, 96 A.L.R.2d 1352. Even apart from the broad context of this clause, common usage does not imply separate meanings divided by this factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-12\">The district court may also have been correct in relying on another exclusion provision in the policy, concerning property \u201cbeing actually worked upon,\u201d but we find it unnecessary to reach that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1001-7\"> Whether Connecticut or Minnesota law applies is unclear, but the parties agree that both states read insurance contracts in the usual way.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
