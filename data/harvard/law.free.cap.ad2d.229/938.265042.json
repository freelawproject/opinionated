Memorandum: There is no merit to the contention of defendant that the People violated <em>Brady v Maryland </em>(373 US 83). Upon our review of the record, we conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>that the verdict is not against the weight of the evidence <em>(see, People v Bleakley, </em>69 NY2d 490, 495). The sentence is not unduly harsh or severe. (Appeal from Judgment of Wyoming County Court, Dadd, J.\u2014Sexual Abuse, 1st Degree.) Present\u2014 Lawton, J. P., Fallon, Callahan, Doerr and Davis, JJ.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
