However, the court stayed entry of a judgment on the issue of liability pending determination of whether the plaintiff had sustained a serious injury pursuant to CPLR 5102 (d). Thereafter, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the plaintiff had not sustained a serious injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">In opposition to the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff tendered, <em>inter alia, </em>sworn medical reports which demonstrated that she had suffered fractured ribs as a result of the subject automobile accident. Therefore, the plaintiff successfully established the existence of a triable issue of fact as to whether she sustained a \"serious injury\u201d as defined by Insurance Law \u00a7 5102 (d). Since the plaintiff has already been awarded summary judgment on the issue of liability, she is entitled to a trial on the issues of serious physical injury <em>(see, </em>1 PJI 2.75 [1996 Supp], at 188-189) and damages, if any.
