A portion of the goods were so delivered, when defendant\u2019s factory was burned down. <em>Held, </em>that, under the circumstances, nothing short of an actual manual delivery on plaintiff's orders could be deemed a delivery, and that defendant was liable for the balance of the deposit.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-12\">Appeal from judgment in favor of plaintiff, entered on verdict, and from order denying motion for a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-13\">On or about June 1, 1891, the respondent, James B. Guild, desiring to purchase goods of defendant, and as a security for the performance of his agreement with defendant, deposited with defendant six hundred and forty-two ($642) dollars, the value of goods so to be purchased by him, in consideration of which defendant agreed to furnish and deliver to the respondent glassware of a certain quality, in such quantities and at such times as he should require and order the same, of the said value of $642.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-14\">Between said 1st day of June, 1891, and the 20th day of November, 1891, defendant filled respondent\u2019s orders and delivered goods pursuant to his orders and to said agreement of the value of $117.36 only.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-15\">Between November 17 and November 24, 1891, inclusive, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>respondent gave defendant further orders on account of said deposit of the value of $26.21, which last orders defendant failed and refused to fill, and said last named orders have never been filled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-3\">On or about November 26, 1891, defendant\u2019s factory was burned, and on or about the 29th day of December, 1891, defendant paid to respondent the sum of two hundred and four dollars ($204), and refused to pay the balance still remaining, viz., $320.-64, or to furnish goods of that value to respondent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-4\">The respondent then brought his action for said sum of $320.-64, and on a trial before this court and a jury, on May 9, 1892, recovered judgment therefor with interest and costs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b615-5\"><em>Brunnemer &amp; Bennett, </em>for resp\u2019t;</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ACD\"><em>Edwin R.

The testimony tends to show, and the jury thereupon finds, that the plaintiff agreed to purchase, at fixed prices, certain goods from the defendant, to be manufactured, the defendant agreeing to retain possession thereof at his own risk till they were actually delivered upon plaintiff\u2019s orders. We see no reason to disturb this finding of the jury that the goods were not delivered. The testimony that the goods were to be retained by defendant at his own risk till they were actually delivered upon plaintiff's orders was clearly admissible, under the pleadings, to show that it was the intention of the parties that nothing short of actual manual delivery, on plaintiff\u2019s orders, should be deemed a delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Judgment and order must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">Clement, Ch.
