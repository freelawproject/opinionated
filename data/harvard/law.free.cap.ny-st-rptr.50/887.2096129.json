After a large number of payments had been made, defendant claimed that the policy was void because the application was not signed by the insured. <em>Held, </em>that the knowledge of the agent was to be imputed to defendant, and that, with knowledge of such fact, it had no right to receive the money and has no right to retain it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b941-11\"><em>2. </em>Same\u2014Money had and received.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b941-12\">An action for money had and received is the proper remedy in such a case.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b941-13\">Appeal from judgment in favor of plaintiff, entered on verdict.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b941-14\"><em>Arnoux, Hitch &amp; Woodford, </em>for app\u2019lt;</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AA7T\"><em>Albert I.

Stone, insured for her own benefit, made application for such insurance to defendant through one Walsh, who was its agent, and who called at plaintiff\u2019s residence for the purpose of obtaining insurers in defendant\u2019s company.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-19\">Her father, at that time, resided in Ohio. She signed his name to the application blank in the presence of defendant\u2019s said agent, who then signed his name to it, certifying that he had seen and examined Jacob 0. Stone, and recommended that he be accepted by defendant. Subsequently two policies were issued by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>The premiums on such policies were payable weekly, $.60 each week. This snm was collected in that way by defendant\u2019s collector until plaintiff had paid $106.60. She then called upon defendant\u2019s secretary, Mr. Gaston, who refused to admit that said policies were valid against defendant; but according to plaintiff\u2019s story he said that they were void.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-3\">Plaintiff then demanded the sum of money paid by her to defendant, which was refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">Thus this action was commenced for the recovery of the same. The complaint is for money had and received by defendant for plaintiff. Judgment was ordered for plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">The agent of the defendant, Yralsh, had authority to receive applications for insurance; that, apparently, was the purpose of his employment by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">He called everywhere and anywhere where he supposed that the object of his employment would be gratified. The insured was required to sign in his presence and he was privileged even to certify to the fitness of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">All knowledge and information communicated to him and which was within the province of his authority, was communicated to defendant itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-8\">Therefore, the defendant knew at that time, for as above shown its authorized agent knew, that Jacob C. Stone never signed the application for insurance but that the same was signed by plaintiff, and that the policies of insurance issued in pursuance and as a sequence of such application were void as against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-9\">Hnless the signature of insured was waived, which was not done, Walsh while acting within the scope of his authority knew that Stone did not sign the application, but that the same was signed by plaintiff, she signing her father\u2019s name and, therefore, defendant is deemed, to have known that fact also, although never communicated to it. <em>Cox v. </em>Pearce, 112 N. Y., 640; 21 St. Rep., 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-10\">The policies being void <em>ab initia </em>as against defendant, and known to be so by it, it suffered no risk, it should not have received but should have refused the money paid by plaintiff. And it would be wrong and unjust to permit it to retain the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-11\">Although the statement made by Walsh to plaintiff, that she had the right to sign her father\u2019s name to the application, was unauthorized and not binding upon defendant, yet such statement was certainly relied upon by her ; she paid defendant the money received by it reiving upon such representation, and it would not be .just or equitable to permit it to profit by its agent\u2019s wrong doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-12\">The form of this action is proper the case falls within the familiar doctrine that money in the hands of one person equitably due another may be recovered in such an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-13\">The action for money had and received to the use of another is the form in which courts of common law enforce the equitable jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-14\">Where one person has money in his possession which he cannot conscientiously retain from another, the latter may re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>cover in this form of action. <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Ely, </em>113 N. Y., 131; 22 St. Rep., 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-3\">The defendant, by claiming right and title to plaintiff\u2019s money, while refusing to her the benefit flowing from the policies issued to her because of the irregularity mentioned, is doing an unconscionable thing which should not receive the sanction of a court of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-4\">I do not think it is the policy or purpose of the law to aid in the consummation of such wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">The trial justice, upon the testimony submitted, would have been justified in directing a verdict for the plaintiff upon his. own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">Finding no error, the judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b943-7\">Ehrlich, Oh.
