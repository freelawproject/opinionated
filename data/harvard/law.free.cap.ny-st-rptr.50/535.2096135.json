Mr. Secor was an attorney and counsellor, admitted by the supreme court to practice law in <em>all </em>the courts of the state. In courts of record his authority would be presumed. <em>Denton </em>v. Noyes, 6 Johns., 296, followed as an authority in <em>Vilas </em>v. <em>P. &amp; M. R. R. Co.,, </em>123 N. Y., at p. 453; 34 St. Rep., 67. True, the rule never applied to justices\u2019 courts, because there are no attorneys within the professional meaning of that term in these courts. <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Mulvey, </em>1 Sandf., 92; <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>8 Barb., 355; <em>Sperry </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>65 N. Y., 179. There is another reason. Prior to the constitution of 1846, and the judiciary act of 1847 passed in aid of it, each court of record, even the old marine court, regulated the admission of its own attorneys, and had separate rolls on which appeared their honored names. In this manner the attorneys entitled to practice in each court were made known to its judges, see N. Y. Const. of 1777, art. 27, but these regulations never reached the justices courts, which seem to have been regarded as sort of \u201cgo-as-you-please\u201d tribunals, in which anyone was entitled to practice, whether licensed to do so or not The power emanated from the client, not the court The cases cited, founded on the old rule, no longer apply to the district courts, in which attorneys are recognized as officers by force of express statute. The act of 1857, chap. 344, \u00a7 70, provides for an extra allowance of costs where an attorney is actually engaged in the prosecution or defense of the action, and by the Laws of 1862, chap. 484, it is not only a misdemeanor to practice in these courts without being admitted to the bar, but all the rules and regulations of the supreme court are made applicable thereto so far as the same can be made applicable, and those relating to attorneys and counsellors may well be so applied in all their rigor. This was evidently the legislative-intent, and effect must be given to it. See <em>Newburger </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>9 Daly, 102. The act of 1862, <em>supra, </em>was designed to effect a radical change by driving away from these courts a class of irresponsible, unlicensed practitioners, tolerated under the old rule, by substituting in their stead, under the new one, attorneys of the supreme court, whose office protected both court and litigants from all fear of imposition. It was an effort to elevate the tone, character and dignity of the district court by improving its surroundings. It was a much needed reform, and has worked well. When progress is made, its concomitants go with it; all look forward, not backward. Such being the present relation between the district court and supreme court attorneys, the justice, who knew Mr. Secor was an attorney, had no power to call upon him to produce a special authority to appear for Mr. Allen ; his office conferred that right. The tenant did not question Mr. Secor\u2019s right to appear, and the justice was not called upon tq dispute it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b591-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>The nature and extent of the remedy now applied for will next be considered. The distinction is, of course, to be observed between a direction to an inferior tribunal to act and a command by <em>mandamus </em>directing it <em>how </em>to act. Thus, <em>mandamus </em>may command the inferior tribunal to act and proceed to judgment, yet it will not, as a rule, prescribe what judgment to give. The mandate is that the officer proceed, adjudicate and exercise his judgment upon the questions of law and fact involved, leaving whatever error may be committed to be corrected on appeal after the decision is filed. While the determination of the inferior court upon the merits will not be controlled by <em>mandamus, </em>yet, if it has erroneously decided some question of law or of practice presented as a preliminary objection, and upon such erroneous construction has refused to go into the merits of the case, and there is no other remedy, <em>mandamus </em>will lie to compel it to proceed. Cas<em>tello </em>v. <em>St. L. C. Ct., </em>28 Mo., 259. In <em>People </em>v. <em>The </em>Mayor, 10 Wend., 395, 397, Nelson, Oh. J., referring to <em>mandamus, </em>said that \u201c whenever a legal right exists, the party is entitled to a legal remedy, and when all others fail, the aid of this may be invoiced.\u201d This case and others show that when a specific duty is imposed by statute on public officers, they may be compelled to execute it by <em>mandamus. </em>The office of the writ and its extent are well stated by Chief Justice Spencer in <em>People </em>v. <em>Supervisors, </em>12 Johns., 415, and that is \u201cto require the persons to whom it is directed to do some particular thing which appertains to their office or duty, and which the court issuing it supposes to be consonant to right and justice; and that if the party making the application has a legal right, and no other specific remedy, the writ generally goes.\u201d The party aggrieved is bound to show as the foundation of the proceeding that the specific act sought to be coerced is the duty of the person against whom the writ is directed, and that such person has no discretion as to its exercise. The statute under which the original proceeding in this matter was taken provides that \u201c if <em>sufficient </em>cause is not shown upon the return day of the precept, * * * the justice <em>must </em>make a final order, awarding to the petitioner the delivery of the possession of the property.\u201d Code, \u00a7 2249. The phrase \u201csufficient cause \u201d to the contrary, means some legal reason why the order should not be made, such as the filing of an answer creating an issue, or the discovery of objections fatal to the proceeding or the jurisdiction of the magistrate. In cases where no such impediment exists, the statute is mandatory that the justice \u201cmust\u201d make the final order, and he has no discretion concerning it. While the justice had the right to take whatever time was needed to examine the papers to determine whether they followed statutory requirements, he had no power to unreasonably delay the proceeding, nor had he authority to adjourn it on his own motion, without the filing of an answer, or the consent of parties, <em>Ahrens </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>63 How. Pr., 50, and all his proceedings taken after the return day of the precept are in consequence <em>coram non judice </em>and void, and the matter must be treated as if no such proceedings had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>followed. The writ of <em>mandamus </em>has been given to compel the entering of judgment where nothing remained but the mere ministerial duty of making the proper entry. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>5 Cold., 60; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>38 Conn., 105. Indeed, in a case like the present, the signing of the final order might be considered as merely ministerial, corresponding in this respect with the duty of the clerk of a court of record in entering the judgment of the court, an act clearly enforceable by <em>mandamus. Smith </em>v. <em>Moore, supra. </em>The clerk could not, by adjourning the performance of the act for a week, or any other stated period, absolve himself from his statutory duty, nor could he then, by any act of his, declare the proceeding terminated and avoid his duty. There is no substantial difference between the case put and the one now before the court. The statute, as its title indicates, intended the proceeding to be \u201csummary,\u201d short, sharp, decisive, and the legislative purpose and intent must be respected. If an answer had been filed, or if objections had been made which necessitated an adjournment or required judicial examination, a case calling for the exercise of judicial judgment might have been presented, and a different question would have arisen; so in regard to motions to adjourn after issue joined. Code, \u00a7 2248. The tenant not having questioned Mr. Secor\u2019s authority, there was no issue of that kind raised calling for decision, and the justice had no alternative but to obey the plain mandate of the law, by making the final order which the statute requires he shall make where no legal reasons exist to the contrary. The justice having neglected to perform the specific duty imposed by statute, the party making the application having a legal right to its performance, with no other remedy, and the question being one about which there was no discretion, <em>mandamus, </em>which is a remedial writ, will lie to compel the performance of the duty omitted, and this without infringing any of the elementary rules before referred to. Although of a <em>quasi </em>judicial nature, the act required was purely clerical or ministerial in its character, not calling for the exercise of judgment and admitting of but one result, which was that imposed and specifically pointed out by the statute conferring the authority to act, and as Judge Davies in <em>People </em>v. <em>Willis, </em>5 Abb. Pr., at p. 212, held, the justice \u201cnot having performed a duty clearly enjoined upon him by law, a <em>mandamus </em>is the proper remedy to compel him to do so,\u201d or otherwise there would be a complete failure of justice, the party aggrieved having no other remedy to obtain his legal rights. The relator is, therefore, entitled to a peremptory <em>mandamus </em>commanding the justice to sign the final order as of September 30, 1892, and to issue his warrant thereon in due form, Code, \u00a7 2251, that the relator may obtain the possession to which he is by law entitled.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b592-2\"><em>William H. Secor, </em>for resp\u2019t;</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A7Ik\"><em>William Allen, </em>for app\u2019lt.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b592-3\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"A0A\">The relator is the owner and landlord of premises No. 259 West Forty-seventh street, in the 11th judicial district in the city of New York. On the relator\u2019s petition a precept was issued, requiring a tenant to remove from the premises, or show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>cause before tlie district court for said district, on the 30th day of September, 1892, why the possession of the said premises should not be delivered to the landlord. The petition and precept met the requirements of the statute in both form and substance; and the precept was duly served upon the tenant. The controversy arises over what occurred in the court at the time the precept required the tenant to show cause, to wit, the said 30th day of September, 1892. At that time, one William H. Secor, for many years a member of the bar of the state of ISTew York, a frequent practitioner in said court,and personally well known to the justice of said court, arose and stated to the court that he appeared as attorney for the landlord in the proceeding under consideration. The justice demanded of said Secor that he show some proof of his authority to appear. Said Secor refused and failed to show the justice any evidence of his right or authority to appear in said proceedings, and moved for judgment and the usual warrant to dispossess the tenant for nonpayment of the rent; the said tenant, although present, having failed to file an answer as required by \u00a7 2244 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The justice, thereupon, on his own motion, adjourned the proceedings to the following court day, which was the third day of October, 1892, for the purpose, as stated by said justice, \u201c of enabling said Secor to produce some proof of his authority to appear for said landlord in said proceedings.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b593-3\">At the adjourned day, on October 3d, the tenant appeared in person; Secor did not appear, nor was the landlord present or represented by attorney; and thereupon, the justice dismissed the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">Upon the application of the landlord, supported by affidavits, this court thereupon made an order requiring the said justice to show cause why a peremptory <em>mandamus </em>should not issue, directing the said justice to issue a warrant for the possession of said premises pursuant to the prayer of the landlord\u2019s petition. The moving affidavits and the order lo show cause were served both upon the justice and the tenant, but the tenant failed to appear. The justice appeared, submitted an affidavit substantially charging Mr. Secor, upon information and belief, with misconduct in prior cases, and claiming this to have been sufficient to call upon him for proof of his authority to appear in the proceeding in question, and a hearing was thereupon had which disclosed the facts above stated, as well as the additional fact that Mr. Secor had been fully authorized by the landlord to appear as he did, and finally resulted in an order granting the landlord\u2019s application and commanding the justice to make the proper final order and to issue a warrant in conformity therewith. From this order the justice alone appeals. On the appeal it was conceded that the <em>mandamus </em>has been complied with, that the warrant has been issued and executed and that the tenant has acquiesced.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The facts being as stated, the substantial question presented by the appeal is, whether the said justice had power to adjourn the proceeding to a future day on his own motion and without an answer having been filed by the tenant. The power to adjourn is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>conferred by statute, viz. : \u00a7 2248 of the Code, and is to be exercised only at the time when issue is joined, at the request of either party, and upon proof that an adjournment is necessary to-enable the applicant to procure his necessary witnesses. If sufficient cause is not shown on the return of the precept, which includes a case in which no answer is filed by the tenant, the justice-under \u00a7 2249 must make the final order, and under \u00a7 2251 must-issue his warrant. These sections constitute substantially an incorporation into the Code of Civil Procedure of the provisions of a former statute which had been enacted.for the express purpose of giving to a landlord a summary remedy against a defaulting-tenant The remedy thus provided is not an action, but a. summary proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-2\">In a case arising under the former statute, <em>Boller </em>v. <em>The Mayor, </em>40 N. Y. Supr., 523, in which, by the way, a counter affidavit had been filed, it was expressly held by this court at general term that in such a summary proceeding there is no power or jurisdiction in the justice to adjourn the hearing, except upon the-request of either party, and for the purpose of enabling the party applying to procure his witnesses, if that should appear to be-necessary. '</p>\n<p id=\"b594-3\">In <em>Kiernan </em>v. <em>Reming, </em>7 Civ. Pro., 311, the same rule was; laid down and enforced upon the authority of <em>Boller </em>v. <em>The Mayor, supra, </em>in a case which had arisen under the present Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">In <em>Ahrens </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>63 How. Pr., 50, decided in 1881, the general term of the court of common pleas, as the appellate tribunal for the determination of appeals from district courts, expressly held that even in an action the justices of the district courts in the city of Hew York have no power to adjourn the case' without an answer having been filed on the return day.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">And' in <em>Deutermann </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>15 Civ. Pro., 411, decided in 1888, the general term of the court of common pleas, in passing-upon the power of the clerk of a district court to adjourn the-court in the absence of the justice, expressly stated that the justice cannot adjourn the hearing of a summary proceeding without, an answer having been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">These four cases have never been overruled by the court of appeals, and consequently we find ourselves concluded by authority,, at least as far as summary proceedings are concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">True there are some cases which seem to lend color to the contention of the appellant, but they can be readily distinguished. <em>Merwin </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>24 St. Rep., 496, and <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Auchmoody, 7 </em>Wend., 200, were actions, and not summary proceedings, and the-question involved related to the personal liability-of the justice. In <em>Brown </em>v. <em>The Mayor, </em>66 N. Y., 385, there was a request by the sub-tenant and consent by the landlord.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">Some other cases hold that where the parties consent or do not-object to an adjournment, the jurisdiction is not lost. But it is-not necessary to enlarge upon them, because they do not apply. In the case at bar the landlord appeared by a duly authorized attorney,, consented te nothing, waived nothing, and insisted upon his right, to the final order and warrant in default of an answer by the tenant..</p>\n<p id=\"b595-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>We also fail to see how the decision of <em>Boller </em>v. <em>The Mayor, supra, </em>can be criticised, as was done in <em>Goff </em>v. <em>Vedder, </em>12 Civ. Pro., 358, by a reference to the decision by the general term of the supreme court, fourth department in <em>People ex rel White </em>v. <em>Loomis, </em>2 Civ. Pro., 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-3\">The case last referred to presented a question as to the time a justice of the peace had in summary proceedings to render his final decision \"after the submission of the cause to him, and it was held, the statute being silent in regard to it, the provision applicable to an action in the court of such a justice applied, and that under that the final decision should have been rendered within four days after the submission of the cause to him, and in coming to that conclusion the general statement was made that where .summary proceedings are instituted before a justice of the peace, all the provisions in respect to the mode of procedure in actions in justice\u2019s courts apply to such proceedings, <em>except as otherwise prescribed by statute.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">In <em>Boller </em>v. <em>The Mayor, </em>it was held that the statute did prescribe that no adjournment should be had except as authorized by its terms, and this construction of the statute has never been disapproved by the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Other questions involved in the application for the <em>mandamus </em>have been so fully discussed by the learned judge who made the order appealed from, that further elaboration is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Suffice it to say that the justice had no power to adjourn the proceeding in default of an answer on the part of the tenant, that the authority of Mr. Secor to appear for the landlord was to be presumed, and that under the circumstances it was the duty of the justice to make the final order and issue a warrant in conformity therewith. And it further appearing on the motion for a <em>mandamus </em>that Mr. Secor in fact had had ample authority to appear for the landlord as he did, and that the tenant had nothing to say in opposition to the motion, the case was a proper one for a <em>\u25a0mandamus </em>commanding the said justice to do what on the 30th day of September, 1892, he ought to have done.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with fifty dollars costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">Freedman and Gtldersleeve, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
