Rep., 179; <em>Hobart </em>v. Littlefield, 13 R. I., 342 ; <em>McNeal </em>v. <em>Braun, </em>53 N. J. Law, 617. But, upon the arrival of the oil in the city of Hew York, at the pier where the defendants knew the railroad company would discharge its freight, there was a delivery of the oil in conformity with the terms of the contract; and from that time forth the company became the agent of the defendants, and the plaintiff was absolved from all responsibility for its conduct. <em>Pacific Iron Works </em>v. <em>The Long Island Railroad Co., </em>62 N. Y., 272. True, as contends the learned counsel for the appellants, in particulars the case varies from the one at bar; still, for the propositions in support of which it is cited, it is an explicit and decisive authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">The oil arrived at the pier in the city of Hew York between four and five o\u2019clock P. m., of the 31st October ; and as the plaint- - iff had to the last hour of the day within which to deliver, the delivery was seasonably made pursuant to the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">Our conclusion is that, as matter of law, the plaintiff performed I its agreement by due delivery ; but if a question of fact on the evidence, the parties consented, by motions for a verdict, that the judge should determine it, and we are not at liberty to review his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-13\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-14\">Bookstaver and Bischoff, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
