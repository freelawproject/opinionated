The transfer to the defendants, absolute in form, was made prior to that time, and title was passed to them, so that by the subsequent sale by the sheriff of the \u201c right, title and interest\" of the vendor, an intangible equity, the purchaser acquired no title that bars a suit in equity by a receiver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>representing the corporation vendor and all its creditors. The transfer to the defendants was good as against the sheriff\u2019s sale; void as to plaintiff. The plaintiff is, therefore, entitled to a decree as prayed for. Findings passed upon and filed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b276-3\"><em>Dill, Chandler &amp; Seymour </em>and <em>Charles D.

Baeder and Howard B. Kern. Inasmuch as the transfer to Perkins, Good\u2018 win &amp; Co. was void, if the sheriff had levied upon the identical property and sold the same in hostility to. said transfer, the purchaser at the sale, under the ordinary rules of law applicable to execution sales of property fraudulently conveyed, might well have become vested with the whole title to the property. And such a result might well have followed whether' in such a case the sheriff in form sold the property itself or the right, title and interest of the corporation in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">The burden of proof rested upon the defendants, and they were bound to establish by competent evidence such a levy and sale as matter of fact. But the evidence which they did furnish did not warrant such a finding. In point of fact, the sheriff did not purport to act in hostility to the transfer to Perkins, Goodwin &amp; Co., but only purposed to sell whatever remaining right, title and interest the Hew York Book Company had on and after August 2, 1888.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">Moreover, no levy was made, and the property was not present at the sale and within the view of the purchasers. Ho valid absolute sale of the property itself could be made under these circumstances. Code Civ. Pro., \u00a7 1428 ; <em>Roth </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>29 N. Y., 471; <em>Hathaway </em>v. <em>Howell, </em>54 id., 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">The defendants, therefore, had no right to a finding contrary to the real facts, and the concession made by the plaintiff that the sheriff put up for sale, and purposed to sell, all the right, title and interest of the Hew York Book Company, which it had on and after August 2, 1888, in and to the said property, is of no help to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>For the reasons stated, the learned trial judge properly refused to find an absolute sale of the property itself, and properly refused to hold that the sale, as had, constitutes a bar to the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-3\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">(rILDERSLEEVE, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
