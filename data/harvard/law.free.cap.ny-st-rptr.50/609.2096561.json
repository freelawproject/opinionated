To disprove such testimony plaintiffs were allowed to show, under objection, that thermometers had been extensively used for advertising purposes in in other lines of business than that of a brewer. <em>Held, </em>that the evidence was properly admitted to affect the credibility of the defendant\u2019s agent, who concluded the contract, and, therefore, was directly interested in its avoidance.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b663-10\">Appeal from a judgment of the general term of the city court of New York, which affirmed a judgment for plaintiffs entered upon a verdict in their favor, and which also affirmed an order-denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial upon the minutes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b663-11\">Action to recover damages for defendant\u2019s breach of contract to accept and pay for a quantity of thermometers manufactured by plaintiffs, at defendant\u2019s instance, for use as an advertising medium in the latter\u2019s brewing business.

Pro., \u00a7 3191; <em>Wilmore </em>v. Flack, 96 N. Y., 512; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Pryor, </em>16 Daly, 169; 30 St. Rep., 553, and without proper exception founded upon a motion for dismissal of the complaint, or that a verdict be directed for defendant, we are not permitted to search the evidence for its sufficiency in support of the verdict. <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Third Ave. R. R. Co., </em>45 N. Y., 628; <em>Schwinger </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>105 id., 648; 7 St. Rep., 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-3\">On plaintiff\u2019s direct examination he was asked, \u201c Por what purpose did you call upon defendants after they had refused the thermometers ? \u201d This question was allowed against objection by defendant\u2019s counsel, but in view of the fact that the witness had theretofore testified to the purport of his visit without objection, the answer was mere reiteration. Ho ground of defendant\u2019s objection was given, and so the exception is ineffectual. <em>Cruikshank </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>118 N. Y., 178; 28 St. Rep., 784.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">Alfred M. Beadleston, a witness for defendant, was asked, on his direct examination, \u201c Did he (meaning plaintiffs\u2019 agent) say anything as to whether any other brewer had such thermometers?\u201d This was clearly leading and so properly excludedbut, assuming the exclusion of the question to have been error, it was waived, and the exception thereto rendered ineffectual by the witness\u2019 testifying, without objection, to the next two following questions of defendant\u2019s counsel: \u201c Go on and state anything else he said.\u201d and \u201c Was anything said as to other breweries having these thermometers, and if so, what ? \u201d <em>Neil </em>v. <em>Thorn, </em>88 N. Y., 270, 277; <em>Crosby </em>v. <em>Day, </em>81 id., 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The remaining exceptions present but one question, and may, therefore, be considered collectively. The defense was that at the time of entering into the contract for supply of the thermometers, Beadleston, representing the defendant corporation, stated to Bonnell, plaintiffs\u2019 agent, that defendant desired an advertising medium for the brewing business of novel and original design in that line of business; that Bonnell represented that plaintiffs had not theretofore supplied any brewer with the thermometers; that relying upon the truth of this representation he (Beadleston) was induced to make the contract on defendant\u2019s behalf; and that it subsequently transpired that the representation was false and untrue. Beadleston\u2019s testimony tended to establish this defense, and to disprove it plaintiffs were permitted to introduce evidence from which it appeared that thermometers had for a considerable time before the making of the contract been extensively and notoriously used, in the city of Hew Yorlc'and elsewhere, as an advertising medium in a variety of businesses other than that of a brewer. To the introduction of this evidence defendant objected on the ground that the fact in issue was whether, or not, thermometers had been previously used as an advertising medium in the brewing business, not whether or not they had theretofore been used for such purpose in any business. The objection was overruled, and due exception taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">We are of the opinion that the evidence was properly admitted. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>The credibility of a witness is always in issue, and evidence of any fact which tends to impeach it or to demonstrate the improbability of the truth of his assertions is relevant to the issue and admissible. Beadleston having concluded the contract for defendant, was chargeable with its improvidence and directly interested in its avoidance. His credibility was for that reason a main element for the consideration of the jury in reaching a conclusion concerning his alleged motive in making the contract and his communication of that motive to plaintiff\u2019s agent. <em>Canajoharie Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Diefendorf </em>123 N. Y., 191; 33 St. Rep., 389. Evidence tending to show that thermometers had for a long time before the contract with defendant been in general use as a medium of advertisement unquestionably affected the probability of the truth of Beadleston\u2019s assertion that he was induced to make the contract because he wanted a medium \u201c of novel and original design \u201d in the brewing business, and the jury were at liberty to infer therefrom that the claimed importance of the exclusion of thermometers, as a means of advertising, from other breweries, was a mere subterfuge resorted to by defendant to rid itself of a contract improvidently made by its agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-3\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">Daly, Ch.
