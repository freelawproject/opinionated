THOMPSON, JUDGE:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Dale Thomas Hammond appeals from the judgment and sentence of the Jefferson Circuit Court following a jury trial. He argues the trial court abused its discretion by excluding his expert witness and admitting a prejudicial photograph. We agree the trial court abused its discretion by excluding Hammond's expert's testimony about sexual role playing without conducting a proper\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   hearing and admitting the photograph of Hammond's genitals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In September 2015, Hammond was indicted for unlawful use of electronic means to induce a minor to engage in sexual or other prohibited activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Hammond's jury trial began on March 21, 2017. During the trial, Investigator Matt Hedden testified Hammond responded to an advertisement Investigator Hedden placed on Louisville Craigslist personals section from a young woman named \"Jenna Bruce\" who was new to the area and seeking companionship. Investigator Hedden, who posed as Jenna, testified he exchanged texts and emails with Hammond. Although Jenna informed Hammond that she lived at home with her mother, she was fifteen and did not want to get pregnant given her age, Hammond sent Jenna very sexually explicit messages discussing the sexual acts he wished to perform on her, sent her a photograph of his erect penis and attempted to meet with her. A greatly enlarged version of the photograph Hammond sent Jenna was admitted into evidence\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   despite Hammond's attempts to exclude it through a previous motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   and contemporaneous objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Hammond testified that he did not believe Jenna was fifteen and instead believed he was chatting with an adult who was role playing. Hammond attempted to introduce testimony of an expert witness to explain sexual role playing and fantasies to support his own testimony. The trial court excluded this testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The jury found Hammond guilty of unlawful use of electronic means to induce a minor to engage in sexual or other prohibited activities and recommended a sentence of one year of incarceration. On June 1, 2017, in a judgment of conviction and sentence, Hammond was sentenced in accordance with this recommendation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Hammond filed a motion for a new trial or judgment notwithstanding the verdict on several grounds. The trial court denied this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Hammond argues the trial court abused its discretion by excluding his expert's testimony, which prevented Hammond\n   from adequately presenting his defense that he did not believe he was communicating with a fifteen-year old girl but was engaging in role play with an adult pretending to be such a girl. The Commonwealth argues the circuit court properly excluded this evidence as the expert's testimony did not assist the trier of fact because it is common knowledge to ordinary people that there is sexual role playing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The expert Hammond wished to call was Dr. James Beggan. During a\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   hearing, Dr. Beggan testified he is a University of Louisville sociology professor with almost twenty-eight years of experience teaching psychology and sociology. His area of research is human sexuality and over the last ten to fifteen years, he has published ten to twelve research-based papers relating to human sexuality in peer-reviewed journals. He has taught the topic of human sexuality for about twelve years including teaching about sexual fantasies and role playing as supported by scientific research and studies. Dr. Beggan reviewed the messages between Hammond and Jenna and opined they appeared to be consistent with behavior he has seen between people who are role playing or fantasizing and, though it could be possible that this exchange was an honest exchange, it seemed implausible that they would communicate in this way without it being a form of sexual role play or fantasy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Commonwealth objected to Dr. Beggan's expert testimony because his research was not focused on child sex predators, his testimony was used to bolster Hammond's testimony and because Dr. Beggan was informed of the defendant's defense before he reviewed the transcripts. Hammond countered that in\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   the jury's lack of responses to his questions about sexual role playing and fantasies indicated they could benefit from Dr. Beggan's testimony in understanding that sexual role playing and fantasizing exists and is studied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The trial court excluded Dr. Beggan's testimony, explaining it was significant that Dr. Beggan had never testified as an expert before, he was told his conclusion before he began to work on the case, and his opinion would not assist the trier of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Hammond preserved Dr. Beggan's testimony through avowel. Dr. Beggan testified that sexual fetishes, fantasies and sexual role playing are confirmed behaviors people engage in that are studied in his field and reiterated his opinion that in reviewing the transcript of the messages between Hammond and Jenna the implausibility of the conversation supported the idea that this was sexual role playing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We review the trial court's decision to exclude the testimony of an expert witness for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Garrett v.

App. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The first two reasons the trial court gave for excluding Dr. Beggan's testimony are not acceptable bases for such an action. An expert's testimony should be permitted if the expert is \"qualified to render an opinion on the subject matter[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Stringer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11894097\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/956/883/#p891\">\n    956 S.W.2d at 891\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Just because Dr. Beggan had never testified as an expert and was told Hammond's defense in the hope that Dr. Beggan could support this defense did not mean Dr. Beggan was not qualified to render an opinion. Every expert who testifies must at some point testify for the first time. Every expert knows why that expert is being hired, though of course not every expert will ultimately be able to testify in the manner desired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   It was not appropriate to exclude Dr. Beggan's testimony simply because the trial court or the Commonwealth disagreed with his conclusions. \"The proper avenue ... to address ... concerns about the methodology and reliability of [an expert's] testimony [is] through cross-examination, as well as through the testimony of [the Commonwealth's] own expert.\"\n   <em>\n    Garrett v.

KRE 702 provides for the admission of expert testimony \"[i]f scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue[.]\" Essentially, this determination is about relevance and reliability.\n   <em>\n    Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v.

In both cases, the defendants were convicted under 18 United States Code \u00a7 2422(b) of attempting to persuade a minor to engage in unlawful sexual activity through conversations over the internet with undercover detectives, a crime very similar to the one for which Hammond was convicted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Hite\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266108,4285518\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/769/1154/\">\n    769 F.3d at 1168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the defendant attempted to call an expert witness who would testify as to \"the difference between a desire actually to engage in sexual activity with a minor and mere fantasy and role playing,\" in support of the defendant's \"fantasy-only\" defense. In holding that the expert witness should have been allowed to testify, the Court explained this testimony could \"shed light on what may be an unfamiliar topic to most jurors: sexual fantasy involving children, particularly the kind that unfolds in the virtual realm of the Internet\" and \"expert testimony that generally explains the world of sexual fantasy on the Internet is permissible.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266108,4285518\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/769/1154/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266108,4285518\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/769/1154/\">\n    at 1170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Joseph\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3841574\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/542/13/\">\n    542 F.3d at 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the jury had to decide whether the defendant \"enticed 'Julie' to meet with him for the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual conduct with a person he thought was a minor, or whether, as he claimed, he was engaged only in role-playing, met her to determine her true identity, and had decided not to have any involvement with her if she turned out to be a minor.\" After the Court reversed the defendant's conviction and ordered a retrial, it urged the trial court to give more thorough consideration to allowing the admission of the defense expert who was excluded from testifying \"about role-playing in the context of sexually explicit conversations on the Internet[,] ... [the] distinct culture of the Internet in which one can become a 'fantasy character[,]' [and] ... the realities and motivations of online role-playing via chatrooms and email.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3841574\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/542/13/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3841574\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/542/13/\">\n    at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We conclude this testimony would have helped the jury determine whether Hammond was engaging in role playing behavior and would have aided the jury in determining whether Hammond knew Jenna was fifteen, a necessary element of the crime.

Aug. 21, 2008) (opining that a photograph depicting the condition of a murder victim's body when it was found, was not automatically excludable as \"unduly prejudicial or appalling\" simply because the victim's genitals were visible in the photograph.).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Prior to trial, Hamond admitted he sent the text messages to Jenna which included the photograph of his genitals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Where a defendant challenges his identity during direct examination, what is depicted in the photograph could provide useful evidence on cross examination of the defendant or on rebuttal to positively identify the defendant as the person who sent the texts. Too, if a defendant acknowledged he sent the texts but denied he was attempting to induce anyone to engage in sexual acts by sending such a photograph, the particular state of the genitals depicted might confirm or belie such an assertion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   We also do not discount that photographs of genitals when sent to persons defendants believe are minors can be probative for proving that defendants unlawfully used electronic means to induce minors to engage in sexual or other prohibited activities. However, such a photograph necessarily has less probative value when text messages were admitted stating sexual acts the defendant would like to engage in with the victim and there was testimony stating that the defendant sent a photograph of his genitals in conjunction with such messages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Hammond did not dispute that he sent the photograph or the accuracy of Investigator Hedden's testimony about what it depicted or that it was sent with the purpose of enticing Jenna to entice to engage in sexual acts with Hammond. There was more than enough evidence to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Hammond committed the crime at issue if the jury did not believe his defense that he believed he was engaging in role-playing with an adult.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Considered in this context, while the photograph was relevant, its probative value was fairly low compared with the potential it had for prejudicing the jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The photograph showed an erect penis, much like any other, and there was no reason why Investigator Hedden could not adequately describe what was depicted in the photograph.\n   <em>\n    Compare with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rucker v.

The visceral reaction jurors could expect to have in being confronted with an explicit photograph of Hammond's erect penis, with Hammond having ostensibly sent it to a fifteen-year-old, could indeed have a deleterious effect on a jury and be unfairly prejudicial as it could arouse the jury's sense of horror, provoke its instinct to punish, or base its decision on something other than the established propositions in the case. Therefore, the decision to admit this photograph was prejudicial and not harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Accordingly, we reverse and remand the judgment of the Jefferson Circuit Court based on the admission of the prejudicial photograph for a new trial. Should the Commonwealth retry the case, the circuit court must hold a new\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   hearing in accordance with KRE 702 and make a determination as to the admissibility of Dr. Beggan's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   ALL CONCUR.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    The version of the photograph the jury saw was an eight-inch by ten-inch color photograph.
