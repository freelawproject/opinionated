Guinn claimed that he suffered hearing loss and tinnitus as a result of his exposure to industrial noise while working at Solo Cup Company (\"Solo Cup\"). The Commission denied compensation because it found that both his claims were barred by the statute of limitations. Guinn contends that the statute of limitations does not bar his claims. For the reasons that follow, this Court reverses and remands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Guinn, born in December 1949, began work at Solo Cup in 1987, where he was exposed to harmful industrial noise over a prolonged period of time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result of this exposure he sustained a disability in the form of hearing loss. There was an \"excessive noise level\" in the area where Guinn worked. By 1993, Guinn's hearing tests performed at Solo Cup's direction \"began to show a threshold shift.\" By 2005, he had a \"calculated hearing impairment\" of 15.0 for the left ear and 17.5 for the right ear. Guinn also experienced \"ringing in his ears possibly as early as 1987-1989.\" This ringing in his ears continued at the same level through the time of the hearing before the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) in 2017. Around March 1, 2006, Guinn left his job at Solo Cup.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 17, 2013, Guinn filed his claim against Solo Cup, alleging hearing loss and tinnitus. On May 22, 2013, Dr. P. Brent Koprivica conducted an independent medical examination, where he opined that Guinn's hearing loss was caused by occupational exposure at Solo Cup. He also opined that Guinn had tinnitus related to work exposure at Solo Cup. On April 11, 2014, Guinn settled his claim against Solo Cup. On May 7, 2014, Guinn filed his claim against the Fund for the occupational diseases of hearing loss and tinnitus.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In January, 2017, a hearing was held before the ALJ, who rendered its award in favor of Guinn. The Fund appealed this decision, and the Commission reversed the ALJ's decision in a split 2-1 decision. In its Findings of Fact, the Commission found, contrary to the ALJ's decision, that it was \"reasonably discoverable and apparent to [Guinn] that he had sustained an injury related to his occupational exposure on January 17, 2013[,]\" the date that Guinn filed his claim against Solo Cup. The Commission found that on January 17, 2013, the statute of limitations for claims against the Fund began to run. Accordingly, Guinn's claims for hearing loss and tinnitus were \"barred unless [they were] filed either within one year of January 17, 2013, or two years from the date of injury, whichever is later.\" The Commission used March 1, 2006 as the relevant date of injury under \u00a7 287.430\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   as it was \"identified by [Guinn] in his claim and used throughout this proceeding[.]\" The Commission found that since Guinn did not file his claim against the Fund until May 7, 2014, it was time-barred because May 7, 2014 was over a year after January 17, 2013 and more than two years after March 1, 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In a footnote, the Commission acknowledged the provisions of \u00a7 287.197.7 and \"Division rule 8 CSR 50-5.060(8)\" that relate to claims for occupational deafness. The Commission determined that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Because we conclude that [Guinn]'s claim against the Second Injury Fund alleging both tinnitus and hearing loss was, in any event, untimely filed pursuant to \u00a7 287.430, we need not consider or determine herein whether those authorities should be read to require us to impose an earlier two-year statute of\n   limitations running [from] the \"date of disability\" (here, April 1, 2006), or alternatively whether those authorities describe an independent tolling mechanism modified by the \"reasonably discoverable and apparent\" test set forth under \u00a7 287.063.3.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Appeals of the Commission's decision are governed by the Missouri Constitution and \u00a7 287.495. \"On appeal, this Court reviews the Commission's decision to determine if it is 'supported by competent and substantial evidence upon the whole record.' \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Johme v.

The analysis of a statute of limitations defense involving a claim against the Fund begins with \u00a7 287.430, which provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    Except for a claim for recovery filed against the second injury fund,\n   </strong>\n   no proceedings for compensation under this chapter shall be maintained unless a claim therefor is filed with the division within two years after the date of injury or death, or the last payment made under this chapter on account of the injury or death.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A claim against the second injury fund shall be filed within two years after the date of the injury or within one year after a claim is filed against an employer or insurer pursuant to this chapter, whichever is later\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00a7 287.430 (emphasis added). The relevant inquiry is: what was the date of injury for Guinn's occupational disease of hearing loss?\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   When an employee is injured by a distinct event that occurs at a particular point in time, determining the date of injury is straightforward.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     McGhee\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7323684\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/312/447/#p451\">\n    312 S.W.3d at 455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is not true of an occupational disease, by which an employee is injured through a process that occurs gradually over time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     id\n    </strong>\n    .\n   </em>\n   For this reason, the statute of limitations set forth in \u00a7 287.430 is modified when an occupational disease is involved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A Chapter 287 occupational disease is defined as \"an identifiable disease arising with or without human fault out of and in the course of the employment.\" \u00a7 287.067.1. The description of occupational disease in \u00a7 287.067 explicitly includes a category for hearing loss due to industrial noise:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    \"Loss of hearing due to industrial noise\"\n   </strong>\n   is recognized as an occupational disease for purposes of this chapter and is hereby defined to be a loss of hearing in one or both ears due to prolonged exposure to harmful noise in employment.\n   <strong>\n    \"Harmful noise\"\n   </strong>\n   means sound capable of producing occupational deafness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00a7 287.067.4 (emphasis in original). When a claim of occupational disease is involved, the \"date of injury\" language in \u00a7 287.430 is modified in the following fashion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   The statute of limitation referred to in section 287.430 shall not begin to run in cases of occupational disease until it becomes reasonably discoverable and apparent that an injury has been sustained related to such exposure, except that in cases of loss of hearing due to industrial noise said limitation shall not begin to run until the employee is eligible to file a claim as hereinafter provided in section 287.197.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00a7 287.063.3. We are required to strictly construe this language. \u00a7 287.800.1. Therefore, this Court is not authorized to add words to, subtract words from, or ignore the plain meaning of words chosen by the legislature.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Dickemann v.

Because loss of hearing due to industrial noise is an occupational disease, the statute of limitations on Guinn's hearing loss claim did not begin to run until it was reasonably discoverable and apparent to Guinn that he had sustained an injury related to noise exposure. The Commission made a factual finding that this occurred on January 17, 2013. Therefore, the Commission misapplied the law by using March 1, 2006 as the date of injury and by deciding\n   that Guinn's hearing loss claim was barred by the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Our decision on this legal issue is not at odds with the additional language in \u00a7 287.063.3 stating that, \"except that in cases of loss of hearing due to industrial noise said limitation shall not begin to run until the employee is eligible to file a claim as hereinafter provided in section 287.197.\" \u00a7 287.063.3. A review of the relevant case law and statutes convinces us that this dependent clause was intended to delay, rather than accelerate, the time when the statute of limitations begins to run on an occupational hearing loss claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The first case in Missouri to recognize hearing loss as an occupational disease was\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Marie v.

Thus, \u00a7 287.430's statute of limitations for purposes of occupational disease must be applied through the lens of the \"reasonably discoverable and apparent\" language of \u00a7 287.063.3.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Lawrence\n    </strong>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7323450\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/310/248/#p250\">\n    310 S.W.3d. at 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, the Commission made a specific finding of fact that Guinn's tinnitus was reasonably discoverable and apparent on January 17, 2013. The Commission noted in its conclusions of law that \"[t]he determination of when an occupational disease becomes reasonably discoverable and apparent to an employee is a factual one.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   This factual determination made by the Commission dictates when the statute of limitations for purposes of Guinn's tinnitus claim began to run: January 17, 2013. The Commission erred when it determined that March 1, 2006 was the date of injury for Guinn's tinnitus claim and, at the same time, determined that January 17, 2013 was when it became \"reasonably discoverable and apparent\" to Guinn that he had suffered a work-related injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Lawrence\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7323450\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/310/248/#p250\">\n    310 S.W.3d at 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Pursuant to Section 287.063.3, the statute of limitations did not begin to run on Claimant's claim of tinnitus until it became reasonably discoverable and apparent that her tinnitus was related to the noise exposure while working for Employer.\"). Since the Commission held that January 17, 2013 was the date it was \"reasonably discoverable and apparent\" to Guinn that he had sustained an injury related to his occupational exposure,\n   this date became the \"date of injury\" under \u00a7 287.430. It follows that he had two years from this date to file a claim against the Fund, and therefore his claim filed on May 7, 2014 was timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Fund argues \u00a7 287.063.3 (which outlines when the statute of limitations begins to run for occupational diseases) simply does not apply to claims made against the Fund. Specifically, the Fund's position is that \"[t]here is no provision for filing a claim against the Fund within two years of the date the occupational disease is reasonably discoverable.\" We reject this interpretation as it would require reading an exception into \u00a7 287.063 that is not specifically stated.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     McGhee\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7323684\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/312/447/#p451\">\n    312 S.W.3d at 455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (observing that when no exceptions are made to a statute's terms, exceptions will not be made by implication or construction). Moreover, this Court on one other occasion has implicitly applied the two-year statute of limitations to occupational disease claims made against the Fund.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Lorenz v.

App. S.D. 2001).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Fund also takes the position that Guinn's claim provided March 2006 as his \"date of injury, or occupational disease\" and cites to the filing of his original claim against Solo Cup. The Commission also concluded that because \"[t]he date of injury identified by employee in his claim and used throughout this proceeding is March 1, 2006[,]\" it is the relevant \" 'date of injury' for purposes of \u00a7 287.430.\" This conclusion is erroneous because the Commission must make a factual determination as to when an occupational disease becomes \"reasonably discoverable and apparent\" to Guinn under \u00a7 287.063.3.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Lawrence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7323450\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/310/248/#p250\">\n    310 S.W.3d at 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The question as to when a compensable injury becomes reasonably discoverable and apparent is a question of fact to be determined by the Commission.\").

Because the majority of the Commission used the date of January 17, 2013 as the date from which \"it was reasonably discoverable and apparent to [Guinn] that he had suffered the occupational injuries of tinnitus and hearing loss[,]\" this premise leads to the conclusion that the \"two-year statute of limitations under \u00a7 287.430 for filing a claim against the Second Injury Fund runs from [January 17, 2013], not the date of last exposure on March 1, 2006.\" Therefore, Guinn's claim against the Fund, filed on May 7, 2014, was timely.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    There is no dispute that Guinn's Second Injury Fund claim, filed May 7, 2014, was filed over one year after his claim was filed against his employer, Solo Cup.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    This time frame was shortened to one month in 2005.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Lawrence v.
