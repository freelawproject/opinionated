He claims in three points on appeal that the Commission erred because he was not discharged for misconduct and that the Deputy failed to make an intelligent review. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, a memorandum has been provided to the parties. The judgment is affirmed. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
