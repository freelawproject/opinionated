Because we find the Commission's decision to be based on competent and substantial evidence, we affirm the Commission's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   No jurisprudential purpose would be served by a written opinion. However, we have provided the parties a memorandum setting forth the reasons for our decision. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed under Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
