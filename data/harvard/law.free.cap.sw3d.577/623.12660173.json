Coleman's Efforts to Learn About the Informant Pre-Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A grand jury indicted Coleman for possession of methamphetamine in an amount of four or more grams but less than 200 grams, a second-degree felony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20481.102\">\n    Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 481.102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6), .115(a), (d).

As a result, Coleman filed two pretrial motions in an attempt to learn the identity of the informant. First, Coleman filed a request for discovery pursuant to Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 39.14.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 39.14. Second, Coleman filed a motion seeking the disclosure of the identity of the informant. After conducting a hearing regarding Coleman's disclosure motion, the trial court held an in camera hearing with the arresting officer to determine whether the State should be required to disclose the informant's identity. After the in camera hearing, the trial court sent a letter to the parties in which it ruled that the State was not required to disclose the identity of the informant. In the letter, the trial court expressed that because the informant was not at the scene when the arresting officer apprehended Coleman and discovered the methamphetamine, the informant could not provide any information or testimony that would go to the determination of whether Coleman possessed the methamphetamine. The trial\n   court also stated in the letter that \"[a]t the time the [tip] was provided[,] the informant did not have any criminal charges pending[,] to the [arresting officer's] knowledge, but [the informant] has from time to time had criminal cases.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After receiving this letter ruling, Coleman filed a third discovery motion asking for production of any materials \"pertaining to the Confidential Informant that was utilized, relied on[,] or referenced to in this cause.\" Coleman claimed that he was entitled to this information under\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/#p87\">\n    373 U.S. at 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/#p87\">\n    83 S.

Trial Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Detective Fitzgerald Testifies.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At trial, Detective Craig Fitzgerald with the City of Denton Police Department testified that on March 24, 2015, he received a phone call from an informant who told him that Coleman was in possession of methamphetamine. Fitzgerald said he was familiar with Coleman because he had both received information about him and made personal contact with him in the past. Regarding the informant's tip, Fitzgerald stated that the informant told him where Coleman was and that he was riding a bicycle and was in possession of methamphetamine. According to Detective Fitzgerald, based on this information, he proceeded in his unmarked police cruiser to Saint Andrews Church in Denton, which he knew served meals to the homeless. Fitzgerald testified that when he arrived, he saw Coleman getting off his bicycle. By Fitzgerald's account, Coleman began to walk away, but Fitzgerald caught up to him and asked him what he was doing. Fitzgerald said that Coleman appeared nervous and fidgety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Detective Fitzgerald testified that he told Coleman he had received a tip that Coleman was carrying methamphetamine. Coleman denied this claim but, according to Fitzgerald, began to sweat, became even more nervous, and shifted from side to side. Fitzgerald said that he asked Coleman if he would empty his pockets, and Coleman did so, emptying his pockets onto the hood of Fitzgerald's cruiser. Among the items that Coleman allegedly placed on the hood was a SunMaid raisin box. Fitzgerald stated that he then opened Coleman's raisin box and saw what he believed to be \"a lot\" of methamphetamine. At that point, Fitzgerald's partner\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   arrived, and they arrested Coleman. Both initial field testing and later laboratory testing confirmed the substance to be almost twenty-one grams of methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   During cross-examination, defense counsel asked Detective Fitzgerald about the informant. Fitzgerald averred that he knew the informant for more than twenty years and found the informant credible. When asked whether \"[d]uring that period of time\" the informant had a \"criminal history,\" Fitzgerald stated that he did not recall. Defense counsel then asked Fitzgerald whether he was saying that he did not know if \"this person ha[d] any criminal history?\" Fitzgerald answered, \"I don't know if they've been arrested. I know recently they've been arrested, but I don't know if they've been arrested prior to that.\" Detective Fitzgerald then stated that he believed the informant's recent arrest involved narcotics. Fitzgerald said that the informant was a person who was not paid for information and was not \"working off [a] case[ ].\" He also said that he did not ask the informant how the\n   informant knew that Coleman possessed methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Coleman Testifies.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After being fully admonished by his attorney and the trial court about the consequences of testifying in his own defense, Coleman testified. Coleman said he had lived in Denton since roughly 1984 and was currently homeless and living in a tent. Coleman testified that on March 24, 2015, he had ridden his bike to Saint Andrews Church to get a hot meal. By Coleman's account, just after he got off his bike, Fitzgerald approached him and told him he had a warrant for his arrest, he was under arrest, and he needed to empty his pockets. According to Coleman, he emptied his pockets onto the hood of Fitzgerald's cruiser. Coleman said the items in his pockets included cash, lottery tickets, a lighter, and cigarettes. He denied having a raisin box in his pocket and stated he did not know where it came from: \"I didn't see any raisin box until [Fitzgerald] had gotten between me and the car. And the next thing I know there's a raisin box-he's walking around with a bag, and I'm like-I don't know what is going on.\" Coleman testified that (1) when Fitzgerald showed him the baggie of what appeared to be methamphetamine inside the raisin box, he explained to Fitzgerald that he no longer did drugs; and (2) he would not have had the money to purchase that amount of methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On cross-examination, Coleman would not say that Fitzgerald \"planted\" the methamphetamine on him, but he persistently said he did not know where it came from. Coleman stated he no longer used methamphetamine and that when he used it in the past, it was for recreational purposes on the weekends and the most he might have used at a given time was half a gram. He also testified that Fitzgerald had lied to the jury when he said (1) the raisin box came from Coleman's pockets and (2) another officer in a marked police cruiser transported Coleman to jail. Coleman stated Fitzgerald had driven him to the police station. Finally, Coleman testified he had a lengthy criminal history, had been incarcerated multiple times, and had been charged with possession before.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Detective Fitzgerald Testifies Again.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After Coleman testified, defense counsel asked to question Detective Fitzgerald outside the presence of the jury. During the questioning, Fitzgerald stated that his previous testimony in front of the jury regarding whether the informant in this case had a criminal history may have been confusing and the informant did have a criminal case \"pending right now.\" Fitzgerald also said that in the pretrial in camera hearing, he told the trial judge that he had written a letter on the informant's behalf concerning his or her pending case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The next day, the trial court gave the parties redacted copies of the transcript from the in camera hearing. The trial court also ruled that it would allow defense counsel to recall Fitzgerald to ask him about the possible conflict between his testimony during a prior hearing that the informant did have criminal charges pending and his initial testimony in front of the jury that he was unaware whether the informant had any criminal charges pending. The trial court instructed the parties to not refer to the hearing as an in camera hearing; rather, the parties were to refer to it as \"a prior hearing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Later, in the presence of the jury, defense counsel called Detective Fitzgerald back to the stand. Fitzgerald said that while he had not intentionally misled the jury about the informant's criminal history, he incorrectly testified that he was\n   unaware of whether the informant had any criminal charges pending and he had in fact testified in a prior hearing that he had written a letter on the informant's behalf regarding a matter in which the informant had been implicated. Fitzgerald averred, however, that the letter he wrote was written about a year after he arrested Coleman and he was unaware whether the informant had been convicted of anything when he received the informant's tip on March 24, 2015, that Coleman possessed methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Coleman is Convicted and Sentenced.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and the trial proceeded to the punishment phase the next day. Before testimony on punishment began, defense counsel stated on the record that she had conferred with Coleman \"and he would not have testified ... had [they] known about that ... concrete prior inconsistent statement [by Detective Fitzgerald] as well as the additional information that came out.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As the punishment phase began, Coleman pled true to the enhancement paragraphs and formally stipulated to the truth of the State's evidence regarding the two felony offenses alleged therein. He also stipulated on the record to the admissibility of the State's exhibits regarding his criminal history. Coleman's criminal history included convictions for forgery, possession of a controlled substance, possession with the intent to distribute a controlled substance, driving under a suspended license, credit card abuse, theft, and failure to identify as a fugitive. The punishment record shows that Coleman had been incarcerated on at least two prior occasions and that the maximum time he had previously spent incarcerated was three years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As the State was giving its closing arguments, the following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [Prosecutor]: Now, in our regular everyday lives, lies are bad. We shouldn't lie. We should tell the truth. Think about the consequences of your normal everyday life. When we're talking about lies, little white lies, those kind of lies that children tell, what are the consequences? Very minimal. In a court of law, lies have consequences.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   I don't think I'm exaggerating to tell you that a court of law, a place where the truth is sacrosanct, is a bedrock principle of our government, our civilization, how we conduct our lives. We live in a world where truth is in flux. Saw a headline the other day asking if truth in the public sphere even exists anymore.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   But in a court of law, when you put your hand up and promise that judge and the jury that you're going to tell the truth, what happens when you tell a lie. In the State of Texas, it's a third-degree felony. The State could, if we wanted to, and we won't, charge [Coleman] with another third-degree felony.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, I'm going to object to this line of statements regarding lies and-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   THE COURT: That's an improper objection, overruled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [Defense Counsel]: I'll object to his misstatement of facts in this case and improper close and ask that the jury be ordered-or instructed to disregard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   THE COURT: The objection is overruled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [Prosecutor]: A third-degree felony for this [Coleman], as you know now, is a sentence of twenty-five to ninety-nine\n   or life. When he lied to you, he attacked a bedrock principle of our State Constitution, our United States Constitution, how we live as Americans. He exposed himself to another felony offense-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, I'm going to object again to this-any reference to him lying or perjuring himself has not been proven. [Coleman] has not-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   THE COURT: Please make a proper legal objection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   [Defense Counsel]: Judge, it's not-it's a misstatement of facts. It's not before this jury. It has not-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   THE COURT: Your objection is overruled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   After closing arguments, the jury retired to the jury room to deliberate. The jury returned a sentence of 99 years. The trial court rendered judgment accordingly, and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Brady\n    </em>\n    and Disclosure of Confidential Informant Information\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In part of his first issue, Coleman argues that the State violated his due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution by failing to learn the identity of the informant and by not disclosing it to him prior to trial and thus the State failed to conform with the edicts of\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    California v.

In these cases, the question of whether the State is required to disclose an informant's identity turns on whether the informant was an eyewitness to the alleged offense or merely provided information that ultimately led police to an arrest.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Washington v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10015803\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/902/649/#p657\">\n    902 S.W.2d 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 657 (Tex. App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1995, pet. ref'd) (holding that the identity of informant whose information was used only to establish probable cause for search warrant did not need to be disclosed).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In line with the authorities discussed herein, we hold that the State is not required to disclose information about a confidential informant when that informant is a mere tipster who has not participated in the charged offense. In this case, we further hold that the informant was a mere tipster and the trial court did not err by not requiring disclosure of the identity of the informant or information regarding the informant's criminal history; thus, the State did not violate\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   by not disclosing information about the informant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Here, the record shows that Detective Fitzgerald received a call from an informant who told him that Coleman was\n   in possession of methamphetamine and that he was riding his bike near Saint Andrews Church. Fitzgerald drove to the location, without the informant, and confronted Coleman. Although Coleman's and Fitzgerald's accounts of what transpired once Fitzgerald arrived at the church differ, there is no evidence in the record that, at the time Fitzgerald arrested Coleman, the informant was in any way participating in the charged offense-Coleman's methamphetamine possession. Even if the tipster had been wholly noncredible and unreliable, it would not change the fact that once Fitzgerald arrived at Saint Andrews Church, the entire interaction between Fitzgerald, Coleman, and any other authorities who arrived afterwards was completely divorced from the informant's tip and from the informant's presence. Again, we conclude that because the informant in this case was a mere tipster and not a participating witness in the crime of possessing methamphetamine, neither the State (by failing to learn the tipster's identity), nor the trial court (by denying Coleman's request for disclosure), violated Coleman's rights under\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bourbois\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"621262\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/530/3/#p3\">\n    530 F.2d at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Under the current version of Article 39.14 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure (part of legislative revisions to the code known as \"the Michael Morton Act\"), once the State has charged the defendant with a crime, it has a duty to disclose to the defendant any exculpatory information that tends to negate the defendant's guilt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex.

In fact, the record shows that the State learned information about the informant at the same time and in the same manner that Coleman did, namely, through the trial court's trickling disclosures from the in camera hearing. Thus, the State did not violate Coleman's Article 39.14 rights by not disclosing the identity and criminal history of the informant because the State had nothing to disclose to Coleman about the informant. We also hold that the State was not required to seek out this information for the defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Palmer v.

If it appears from the evidence in the case, or from some other showing by a party, that an informant may be able to give testimony necessary to a fair determination of a material issue on guilt or innocence, and the State invokes the privilege, the judge must give the State an opportunity to show in camera facts relevant to determining whether the informant can, in fact, supply that testimony. Tex. R. Evid. 508(c)(2).

But, if the informant's information was used only to establish probable cause for a search warrant or if the informant merely provided information that led police to investigate a potential offense and the informant was neither a participant in the offense for which the accused was charged nor present when a search warrant was executed or an arrest was made, then the identity of the informant need not be disclosed because the testimony is not essential to a fair determination of guilt or innocence.\n   <em>\n    Ford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8995326\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/179/203/#p210\">\n    179 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   210 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Southwell v.

The trial court correctly ruled that the informant's identity did not need to be disclosed by the State.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Here, Coleman argues that because he showed that Detective Fitzgerald swore in his probable cause affidavit for an arrest warrant for Coleman that the impetus for looking for Coleman was the informant's information that he was in possession of methamphetamine, Coleman made a plausible showing that the informant's testimony or information may be important. More specifically, Coleman argues that no one else, other than Fitzgerald, could corroborate that Coleman was in possession of methamphetamine. Coleman further argues that the informant could have revealed whether Fitzgerald had \"planted\" the methamphetamine on him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   As to the probable cause affidavit, the law is clear that if an informant merely provides information leading to probable cause for a warrant, the informant's identity is not subject to disclosure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8995326\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/179/203/#p210\">\n    179 S.W.3d at 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As to the argument that only the informant could corroborate that Coleman was in possession of methamphetamine when Fitzgerald approached him and asked him to empty his pockets, it is nothing more than mere speculation that the informant could have established whether Fitzgerald planted the methamphetamine on Coleman. Indeed, the informant was not present at the church when Fitzgerald encountered Coleman and therefore could not provide any information on whether Fitzgerald planted the raisin box on Coleman. All the informant could have testified to was whether the informant had seen Coleman with methamphetamine before Fitzgerald encountered him. The informant's testimony that Coleman was in possession of methamphetamine would actually have worked to increase the prosecution's quantum of proof in this case. Further, even though this court concludes that the trial court was not required to conduct an in camera hearing because Coleman did not make a plausible showing that the informant's testimony was important to the resolution of his case, the trial court did in fact conduct a hearing and revealed portions of the testimony of the hearing to the parties \"out of an abundance of caution.\" And, we have examined the unredacted in camera testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   We conclude that the trial court was within the zone of reasonable disagreement when it determined that the State was not required to disclose the identity of the informant.

Right to Confrontation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In the remainder of his second issue, Coleman argues that the trial court's denial of his motion to disclose the identity of the informant \"deprived him of the right to confront his accuser under the Confrontation Clauses of the United States and Texas Constitutions.\" This argument is erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Other than citing Justice Harry Blackmun's concurring opinion in\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania v.

Moreover, Coleman does not explain what witness he did not have the right to confront. Assuming that the witness he is arguing he could not confront is the informant, as discussed above, the informant was not a \"crucial prosecution witness.\" Indeed, not only did the State not call the informant to testify, the State did not know the identity of the informant. If the \"crucial prosecution witness\" that Coleman is alluding to was Detective Fitzgerald, Coleman was given ample opportunity to confront Fitzgerald. And, even though the trial court was not required to conduct the in camera hearing, it did allow Coleman to eventually attempt to impeach Fitzgerald through testimony that he gave at the in camera hearing.

Arguing\n   to the jury that Coleman could be charged with an \"additional third-degree felony\" because he allegedly lied to them invited speculation as to what charges might be brought against Coleman in the future.

Because the prosecutor repeatedly emphasized this improper argument, it is likely that the jury placed substantial weight on this argument in their deliberations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holliman v.

App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1994, no pet.) (reasoning that because State emphasized improper jury argument after trial court overruled defense's objection, the jury likely gave undue weight to prosecutor's argument). Because there were no curative instructions given by the trial court; because the trial court overruled Coleman's objections, thereby sanctioning the argument;\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   and because the prosecutor emphasized and repeated the improper argument, this factor also weighs in favor of finding harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   As to the third factor, the certainty of punishment, the State's punishment case was fairly strong, but the State did not put on any evidence to indicate that Coleman was deserving of a 99-year sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Indeed, the evidence offered during the punishment phase demonstrated that although Coleman had previously been convicted of possession and possession with intent to distribute he had never served a term of incarceration longer than three years. Under the unique facts of this case, we conclude that this factor is neutral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   To recap, the first two factors weigh in Coleman's favor, and the third, given the unique facts of this case, is neutral at best. We determine that the prosecutor's argument was prejudicial because it encouraged the jury to consider that Coleman had committed an additional, third-degree felony that the State had not proven. The trial court magnified this harm by overruling Coleman's objections, thereby giving its stamp of approval to the prosecutor's improper argument, and the prosecutor continued to emphasize the improper argument after Coleman's objections. Finally, the State's punishment evidence, while strong, did not demonstrate that Coleman would receive such a lengthy sentence. We therefore hold that the trial court should have sustained Coleman's objections, and we hold that its failure to do so was harmful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Having overruled Coleman's first three issues but having sustained his fourth issue, we affirm the trial court's judgment of conviction, but we reverse the judgment as to punishment and remand this case back to the trial court for a new punishment trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex.
