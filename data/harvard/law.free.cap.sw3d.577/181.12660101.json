Michael Swiney, C.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This appeal arises from the termination of a father's parental rights. John C. and Kellee C. (\"Petitioners\"), uncle and aunt respectively of Apex R. (\"the Child\"), filed a petition in the Circuit Court for Knox County (\"the Trial Court\") seeking to terminate Dustin R. (\"Father\")'s parental rights to the Child. After a trial, the Trial Court entered an order terminating Father's parental rights on the grounds of willful failure to visit and support. The Trial Court found also that termination of Father's parental rights is in the Child's best interest, all by clear and convincing evidence. Father appeals, arguing among other things that the Trial Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to decide the case under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (\"the UCCJEA\") because the Juvenile Court for Jefferson County, Alabama (\"the Alabama Court\") made the initial custody determination, the Child's mother remained in Alabama, and the Alabama Court never relinquished its exclusive and continuing jurisdiction. We hold that the Trial Court had subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the termination petition. We hold further that grounds for termination were proven by clear and convincing evidence and that termination of Father's parental rights is in the Child's best interest. We affirm the judgment of the Trial Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Background\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Child was born out of wedlock to Father and Laura C. (\"Mother\") in Florida in October of 2014. Father was identified as the Child's father on his birth certificate. Father and Mother never married. Indeed, Mother was married to someone else at the time of the Child's birth. Mother had driven to Florida a few days before the Child was born because Father had insisted Mother come to Florida for the birth of the Child. Mother and Father lived with the Child in Florida for several weeks. Mother later took the Child with her to live in Alabama.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In March 2015, Father filed a complaint for paternity and child support in the Alabama Court. Father also filed a petition for dependency and custody. In April 2015, the Alabama Department of Human Resources (\"DHR\") filed a petition for dependency regarding Mother. The Child was placed in temporary custody. Various issues cropped up in effecting service upon Mother for her court appearances. While this was underway, Father moved from Florida to Alabama to be closer to the proceedings. Father eventually returned to Florida. In May 2015, the Alabama Court awarded physical custody of the Child to Petitioners, who live in Tennessee. Mother\n   and Father were granted supervised visitation. DHR filed a petition for child support against Mother. In March 2016, upon DHR's motion, the case was closed. Legal custody of the Child was awarded to Petitioners. An order stemming from the March 3 proceedings featured a handwritten statement: \"DHR's motion to close is granted, over [Father's] objection. Custody of [the Child] is hereby placed with [Petitioners] per approved ICPC.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Another order states: \"[Father] is not the legal father. Petition is hereby dismissed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Father and Petitioners maintained a deeply antagonistic relationship throughout, blame for which is disputed. In August 2016, Petitioners filed a petition in the Trial Court seeking termination of Father's parental rights. In October 2016, Petitioners filed an amended petition. Along with the amended petition, Mother submitted an oath consenting to adoption and surrender of her parental rights. Father filed a response in August 2017. In September 2017, DNA confirmation that Father was indeed the Child's biological father was submitted to the Trial Court. This matter was tried in October 2017. The evidence at trial focused chiefly on Father's failure to visit or support the Child, and his explanations for this failure. Father testified to his efforts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Q. Well, let me ask you this: You claim you want to establish a relationship with your child, and we set up visits and you don't have them, we set up visits and you cancel them, and then you get mad and you call my client a piece of shit. And then how are you supposed to develop a relationship with your child with that kind of behavior?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   A. I was upset and frustrated at the time, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Q.

What resistance was there to the Father's Day?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   A. (Pausing.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Q. What resistance was there to the next visit that you cancelled?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   A. Okay, you want these --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Q. What resistance was there --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   A. These are text messages, you don't know. There was also follow-up conversations that --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Q. Alright. Suffice it to say there were no more visits that were tried to be planned after October the 15th by mutual agreement; you agree with that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   A. No, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Q. Alright. They had given you their address on two different occasions. After this last attempted visit on October the 14th of 2015, let me ask you this: What did you do to try to schedule any further visits?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   A. I sent text messages on multiple occasions; every holiday, my birthday, Valentine's Day, Christmas, Thanksgiving, my grandmother's birthday --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Q. Over what period of time?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   A. Over a year.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Q. Alright, so your testimony is, the only thing you did was send texts, and that you thought they were just ignoring you for eight months?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Q. You didn't write any letters --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   A. No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Q. -- to the post office box they gave you; is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   A. That's correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Q. You didn't file anything in court asking to be granted visitation in Tennessee with the child; is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   A. That's correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Q. Okay, alright. So after the depositions, you sent, for the first time ever, $ 250 to Mrs. [C.]; is that right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   A. It is. As soon as they mailed me the paperwork that stated that I was the biological father.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Q. So, is it your position that you would've not paid child support without the DNA testing?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   A. If it's not my son why would I pay for him?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Q. Well, I mean, because previously, as we saw in your message to them, you said, \"Can I have your address to send some money to help with my child?\" You were going to do that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   A. Yeah, I was going to as well.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Q. And you didn't?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   A. That's correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Continuing his testimony, Father testified regarding child support:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Q. So prior to the petition to terminate, you hadn't sent a penny, had you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   A. No, ma'am.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Q. Not a birthday card, not a Christmas card, not a stuffed animal for Christmas. You have not sent one red anything before the petition to terminate was filed, had you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   A. That's correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Q. And then, even after the petition to terminate was filed, you did not send anything until a year in, you've asked for DNA testing; is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   A. Um-hum. (Moving head up and down.) I wanted 100% proof that he's my boy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Father testified also as to his improved financial situation, and why at one point in the case he moved to Alabama:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Q. Alright. Okay, so because of the death of your father and now the death of your brother, you're saying that you came into a significant amount of money?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   A. Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Q. My recollection in the deposition was you said that was about $ 675,000?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   A. Well, in stock.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Q. In stock in a company?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   A. Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Q. You said that your income changed, according to your affidavit, July 1, 2017. So since July 1, 2017 up through today, you've had at least $ 6,300 a month in income; is that right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   A. Give or take. I mean, I've taken a lot of time off, too, to be traveling, so I haven't had another $ 2,000 from my job. We can deduct that as well because I've been traveling back forth to here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Q. When you moved to Alabama, the change of address forms we looked at, was there a period of time that you were going back and forth between Florida and Alabama?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   A. Yes, multiple times.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Q. And eventually, you moved to Alabama, did you live with your mother?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   A. I did, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   Q. Why did you move to Alabama?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   A. I moved to Alabama because I exhausted all of my funds. I had flown up to file and I had to fly back. And because she was married, I didn't have a birth certificate, so I had to fly back down to Vital Statistics, flew back up, filed again. And at that point, I had nothing left. And I [had] no choice, it\n   was more economic for me to be in Alabama to be going to the Jefferson Courthouse every other week.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   Q. You moved to Alabama because of the court proceedings there; is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   A. Yes, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Mrs. C., a Petitioner and the Child's aunt, testified as to her perspective on communications with Father:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   Q. Based on what happened with the texts that were sent to you, what did you do?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   A. I ended up blocking him from my cellphone.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   Q. Did you block him from anything other than your cellphone?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   A. Not -- I blocked him from Facebook but not Facebook Messenger.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   Q. And why did you do that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   A. Because I was tired of receiving just the irate texts, and the profanity of the messages that were sent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   Q. Were the messages abusive to you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   A. I felt like they were.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   Q. Was the reason that you blocked your phone number and the Facebook page in order to interfere with his visitation?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   A. No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   Q. What led you to decide to pursue adoption of the child?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   A. After having [the Child] for a year and-a-half, I mean, we fell in love with him. I mean, he's, we just melt over him. And we decided that we haven't seen any, um, we haven't heard from or had any interaction anymore with [Father]. So, we, I called you and asked you how to go about getting him adopted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   Q. Alright. Describe the relationship that you and this child have.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   A. It's definitely a mother/son relationship. He knows us as his parents, um --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   Q. What does he call you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   A. Mommy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   Q. And what does he call your husband?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   A. Daddy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   When pressed on communication and cooperation with Father, Mrs. C. testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   Q. But you couldn't drive an extra twenty minutes for him to see his father; correct? You were unwilling to do that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   A. It's not that I was unwilling, I didn't want to meet at the Aquarium. And he was getting irate. I think I was bending over backwards to even drive to meet him, the mother came all the way to Knoxville.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Mrs. C. testified that her sister, Mother, \"lives in Birmingham, or the outskirts.\" Mrs. C. states that the Child believes Mother is his aunt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In November 2017, the Trial Court entered an order terminating Father's parental rights to the Child. The Trial Court found that the grounds of willful failure to visit and willful failure to support were proven by clear and convincing evidence. The Trial Court also found by clear and convincing evidence that termination of Father's parental rights is in the Child's best interest. The Trial Court found, in part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   The minor child was born in Florida to co-petitioner [Mother] on October 13, 2014. [Mother] was married to but estranged from her husband, co-petitioner, Teddy M. [Mother] was romantically involved with Respondent [Father], and he is listed as the father on the child's birth certificate. Petitioners John C. and Kellee C. are the maternal uncle and aunt of the child, Kellee being [Mother's] sister.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    [The Alabama Proceedings]\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   [Mother] and the child stayed with [Father] in Florida for a few weeks after\n   the child's birth. At some point, [Mother] left with the child. According to [Father], he was not certain where [Mother] went, although he was aware of her living with friends for a period of time and also with [Father's] mother in Alabama for a period of time. According to [Father], [Mother] had a substance abuse problem. On March 2, 2015, [Father] filed a complaint for paternity and child support in Jefferson County, Alabama, alleging that \"mother is an endangerment.\" That case bears docket number CS-2015-87. On April 6, [Father] filed a Petition in the same court, alleging that [Mother] \"has a history of drug use, and I found syringes in purse with blood on 3.24.15 when she was at my grandfather's house. I also found (3) - (4) other types of pills in her purse and took pictures. Multiple felon in AL/TN/FL for drugs. I am seeking custody of my son.\" That case bears docket number JU2015-652.01.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   On April 9, 2015, the Alabama Department of Human Resources (\"DHR\"), filed a Dependent Petition, alleging that the child was dependent and had been placed in protective custody due to mother being arrested on drug-related charges. That case bears docket number JU2015-652.02. On April 10, 2015, a hearing was held, and legal custody of the child was vested in the DHR. On April 22, 2015, [Petitioners] filed a Dependency Petition, docket number JU2015-652.03, seeking custody of the child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   An initial hearing took place on April 24, 2015 in cases JU2015-652.01, .02, and .03. All parties were present, except Teddy M. The Court's Order reflects that [Mother] stipulated to a general need for services. The Order provides that custody of the child remained vested with the DHR and allowed [Mother] to have supervised visitation of the child. A second hearing took place on May 15, 2015. Again, all parties were present, and [Father] was represented by counsel at this hearing. No transcript of the hearing has been provided, but the Court's Order reflects that physical custody of the child was vested with the [Petitioners]. [Mother] and [Father] were allowed supervised visitation \"as agreed to and arranged by the parties.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   Regarding [Father's] petition in case number CS-2015-87, a hearing was scheduled for July 20, 2015. [Father] appeared, but [Mother] had not yet been served in that case. Accordingly, the case was re-set to August 6, 2015. This Court was not provided with any documentation regarding what, if anything, occurred on August 6, 2015. Subsequently, the State of Alabama filed its own petition for support against [Mother] on September 25, 2015. That case bears docket number CS-2015-901135.00.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   To summarize the pleadings, three dependency petitions were pending-one filed by [Father] (JU2015-652.01), one filed by the Alabama DHR (JU2015-652.02), and one filed by [Petitioners]. (JU2015-652.03). Two support petitions were pending-one filed by [Father] (CS-2015-87), and one filed by the State of Alabama (CS-2015-9011135.00).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   In the dependency cases, another hearing took place on October 22, 2015. Again, all parties were present.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At this hearing, the Court maintained physical custody of the child with [Petitioners] and legal custody with the DHR.

In the two support cases, [Father's] lawyer filed a motion to consolidate the cases. On March 2, 2016, [Father's] lawyer filed a motion to continue the dependency cases in light of the pending support cases. The motion asserts that [Mother] was just served in case number CS-2015-87 on February 27, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   A hearing was held on March 3, 2016. The Order reflects that the Court granted the DHR's motion to close cases 652.02 and .03 over [Father's] objection, denied his motion to continue, and dismissed his dependency petition (652.01) because he was not the legal father of the child. The Order so reflecting was filed on March 9, 2016. No appeal from this Order was filed by [Father]. This Court has not been provided with evidence of any further activity on [Father's] Alabama support case (CS-2015-87). [Petitioners] filed the present Petition to adopt the child and terminate parental rights on August 30, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    [Willful Failure to Visit and Willful Failure to Support]\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   The Court will first address the allegation of abandonment by willful failure to visit. The relevant time period is April 29 through August 30, 2016. It is undisputed that [Father] did not visit the child during that time period. [Father] contends, however, that his failure to visit was not willful because the conduct of [Petitioners] thwarted his visitation, both early in the proceedings when he claims they would not work with him on scheduling visitation, and later when, unbeknownst to him, Kellee blocked his text messages. [Father] relies primarily upon the case of\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     In re Lyric J.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%207182075\">\n    2014 WL 7182075\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 16, 2014). In that case, the Court of Appeals reversed the Trial Court's finding of willful failure to visit. The Court of Appeals noted that the father, who lived in another state, had called the child's grandmother, who had physical custody of the child, once per month to set up visitation; however, the grandmother always told the father that visitation was not a good idea at the time. In addition, the grandmother testified that she was afraid to let the father visit the child because she feared the father would take the child. The Court of Appeals held that a parent who has tried to visit his or her child but has been \" 'thwarted by the acts of others and circumstances\n   <strong>\n    beyond his [or her] control'\n   </strong>\n   has not willfully failed to visit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5 (quoting\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     In re Adoption of A.M.H.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8333798\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/215/793/#p810\">\n    215 S.W.3d 793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 810 (Tenn. 2007) (emphasis added)). The Court determined that a parent's failure to visit may be excused by a third party's conduct if the conduct \"actually prevents the person with the obligation from performing his or her duty, or amounts to a significant restraint of or interference with the parent's efforts to support or develop a relationship with the child.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8333798\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/215/793/#p810\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     In re Audrey S.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8994255\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/182/838/#p864\">\n    182 S.W.3d 838\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 864 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005) ). The Court went on to note that it had deemed the following actions to be a significant restraint or interference with a parent's efforts to develop a relationship with a child: \"(1) telling a man he is not the child's biological father, (2) blocking access to the child, (3) keeping the child's whereabouts unknown, (4) vigorously resisting the parent's efforts to support the child, or (5) vigorously resisting a parent's efforts\n   to visit the child.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8994255\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/182/838/#p864\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   First, the Court notes that cases involving termination of parental rights are always fact specific. It is, therefore, somewhat difficult to equate the fact pattern of one case to another when trying to determine whether a failure to visit was willful. [Father] contends that his situation is directly analogous to that in\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     In re Lyric J.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Although there are some similarities, the Court finds that there are several important distinguishing facts. First, unlike the grandmother in\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     In re Lyric J.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   , [Petitioners] were not afraid to allow [Father] to visit, nor did they make scheduling visitation difficult. The evidence shows that from May to October of 2015, [Father] made six attempts to see the child. In May, he requested to see the child on Father's Day, and the C.'s agreed. On May 31, he requested to see the child the following weekend, and the C.'s agreed. Both visits were either cancelled or were not followed up on by [Father]. On July 15, [Father] requested to see the child because he would be in Cleveland for a whitewater rafting trip, but Kellee objected based on the last-minute nature of the request and the fact that the family already had plans. The Court does not find Kellee's decision unreasonable. In August, [Father] requested dates for visitation, and the C.'s informed him that August was wide open for scheduling a visit. This, of course, ultimately resulted in the disagreement between the parties about the location of the visit, which culminated in [Father] refusing to travel to Cleveland for a visit, stating to Kellee that \"karma is karma and we shall engage in court,\" and announcing on social media that the C.'s were all \"POS.\" [Father] requested an airport visit for October 14 and another visit on October 27, to which the C.'s did not respond. Kellee blocked [Father's] cell phone number because of the derogatory and threatening nature of his texts and social media posts. From October 2015 to the filing of the petition in August 2016, [Father's] only attempts at communication, other than the Facebook message sent to John, calling him a \"POS,\" were via text. Those text messages cannot be construed as a legitimate attempt to schedule a visit with the child. Instead, the messages are insulting and threatening. The Court notes that during this entire time, [Father] never attempted to call John, call the C.'s landline, write the C.'s, or try any other form of communication other than texting Kellee. [Father] did not petition any court for visitation. In sum, the proof simply does not support [Father's] contention that the C.'s thwarted visitation with the child. The C.'s did quite the opposite. [Father] cannot behave in such a way that Kellee had to block his text messages, then complain that he could not communicate with Kellee via text to schedule a visit. In short, any difficulty [Father] had communicating with the C.'s was a problem of his own making.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   With respect to willful failure to support, the law is clear that \"biological parents must, as a general matter, support their children until they reach the age of majority.... The parent's obligation to support, as well as the child's right of support, exist regardless of whether a court order exists, and regardless of whether the parents were ever married.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-1-102\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-1-102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(H). It is again undisputed that [Father] did not pay any money for the support of the child during the four months preceding the filing of the petition. [Father] offers various reasons for his failure to provide support. First, [Father] contends that he was not required\n   to provide support until paternity was confirmed. [Father] also contends that he was financially unable to provide support. In his deposition, [Father] testified that he did not pay support because the C.'s \"were keeping my kid and not working with me at all. So, they were not being flexible on any dates for me to see my son, at all, and I don't trust what they were gonna do with the money.\" Finally, [Father] testified in his deposition that he did not pay support because \"the courts have not told me to pay anything to them at this time.\" The Court finds these excuses to be disingenuous.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   First, [Father's] contention that he did not want to pay support until confirmation of paternity is inconsistent with his previous statements and behavior. On two occasions, [Father] asked [Petitioners] for their address so that he could send money and gifts to the child. [Father] never did. In addition, [Father] told the C.'s several times, forcefully via text, that the child was his child. [Father] cannot now come before this Court and use the lack of paternity confirmation as an excuse for his failure to support the child. Furthermore, [Father] did not actively seek paternity confirmation after [Mother] was served or once the Alabama proceedings concluded. Even when the present petition was filed, [Father] waited for a year before seeking paternity testing. Again, [Father] cannot wait until the eve of trial to obtain paternity confirmation, then use the lack of such confirmation as an excuse for two years of failure to support.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   With respect to ability pay, the Court first notes that [Father] did not provide any tax returns because, apparently, he has not filed any. This is because some jobs were worked \"under the table,\" according to [Father]. [Father] testified that he is currently enrolled in a helicopter academy and has been for some time. Tuition of $ 80,000 was paid up front from trust funds from his father's death.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Since May of 2015, [Father] has worked for JCM Performance as an apprentice technician, for MidSouth Aviation, T.T. Motosports, and SpeedStar Customs. He is a professional chassis technician, and he builds and races motorcycles. He provided an Affidavit of Income and Expenses from June 30, 2017 and prior, which reflects a net income of $ 2,933.33 and expenses of $ 2,924.05. His expenses include $ 755.00 for attorney's fees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   The Court finds that [Father] had an ability to pay something toward the support of his child, even if only a meager amount. Examining the Affidavit of Income and Expenses and assuming it to be true,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Father] could have sent just $ 10.00 per month, which would have been better than nothing. To the extent [Father] contends that he could not afford to send support payments because of his attorney fees, this argument was rejected by the Tennessee Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     In re Makenzie L.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%203793788\">\n    2015 WL 3793788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 24, 2015) (rejecting the argument that \"when parents are compelled to redirect their finances to seek legal representation to protect their right to parent their child, the abandonment by failure to pay financial support is not grounds for termination.\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   In conclusion, the Court finds that the petitioners have established by clear and convincing evidence that [Father] willfully failed to visit the child and willfully failed to support the child. [Father's] efforts at visitation early on were half-hearted at best. When [Father] finally appeared ready to actually visit the child, he refused to do so because he did not like the location chosen by the petitioners. His subsequent actions resulted in Kellee having to block him from texting, and [Father] made no genuine effort at visitation since October of 2015. The same is true with respect to support. [Father] offered various excuses as to why he did not support the child, and the Court is persuaded by none of them. The Court's overall impression of [Father] with respect to his efforts at a relationship with his child are that he talked a lot but did very little.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    [The Trial Court's Best Interest Analysis]\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The Court finds that the following factors are relevant in this proceeding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   (3) Whether the parent or guardian has maintained regular visitation or other contact with the child;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   (4) Whether a meaningful relationship has otherwise been established between the parent or guardian and the child;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   (5) The effect a change of caretakers and physical environment is likely to have on the child's emotional, psychological and medical condition;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   (7) Whether the physical environment of the parent's or guardian's home is healthy and safe....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   (9) Whether the parent or guardian has paid child support consistent with the child support guidelines promulgated by the department pursuant to \u00a7 36-5-101.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   First, with respect to factors three and four, [Father] has not seen the child in over two years. [Father] has no relationship with the child. In his deposition, [Father] testified that he believed the child would recognize him because \"I set there and talked to him while he was in the womb for months and months, we watched motorcycles, played with things. And when he was born and heard sounds I made he lit up, he knew exactly who I was.\" At trial, however, [Father] acknowledged that he would be a stranger to the child. In his deposition, [Father] acknowledged that when he met with the guardian ad litem, she discussed therapeutic visitation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   He denied that she instructed him to take steps to set up therapeutic visitation. He also denied that she discussed reactive attachment disorder with him. The Court finds that these denials are not credible. In his deposition, [Father] was asked whether he had taken any steps to get himself reacquainted with the child, and he testified that he did not know.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   With respect to factor nine, [Father] did not make child support payments. Even when he came into money shortly before trial, he sent only $ 250.00 for two months.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   With respect to factors five and seven, the Court first notes that the proposed physical environment of [Father's] home appears to be healthy and safe. [Father] has recently moved to a larger home in Florida that would have ample space for the child, and he has worked with a\n   friend to locate a pediatrician and daycare services. This factor weighs in [Father's] favor. However, the Court must also consider that that [Petitioners] are the only parents this child has known, and the child knows them as \"mom\" and \"dad.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Petitioners] have two older daughters who interact with the child like a brother. [Petitioners] have provided the child with a safe, stable, and loving home since the child was approximately seven months old. They have paid for and provided the child with food, shelter, clothing, and doctor visits. If the child were removed from this home and placed with [Father], the Court finds that the possibility for significant emotional harm exists.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   Having considered the foregoing factors, the testimony of the parties, and the record as a whole, and keeping in mind the significant consequences of severing the child's ties with his biological father, the Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that it is in the child's best interest to remain with [Petitioners] in the only home the child has known.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   In sum, the Court finds that [Father's] parental rights should be terminated for abandonment based on clear and convincing evidence of willful failure to visit the child and willful failure to support the child. The Court further finds that it is in the child's best interest to remain with [Petitioners] and that their adoption proceeding shall move forward.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   (Footnotes in original but renumbered).

The court has subject matter jurisdiction to modify the other state's child custody determination only if the other state has lost its exclusive, continuing jurisdiction or declined to exercise it and the court of the new state would have jurisdiction to make an initial custody determination under the present circumstances.

Placement, as such, is not contested here. No one disputes the soundness of the Child's placement. Rather, the question is whether a Tennessee court may make the ultimate modification to another state's initial custody determination-that is, termination of a parent's parental rights. Petitioners appear to overlook the fact that no adoption can take place while Father's parental rights to the Child are intact, and the Alabama Court awarding custody of the Child to Petitioners in Tennessee in an ICPC-approved placement does not resolve the jurisdictional issue which is distinct from placement. We conclude that, given the plain language of the UCCJEA and Tennessee case law interpreting it, the UCCJEA is implicated in this parental rights termination case where the initial custody determination was rendered in Alabama. We therefore proceed to apply the UCCJEA to determine whether the Trial Court had subject matter jurisdiction to decide this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   The Child and Petitioners live in Tennessee.

Code Ann. \u00a7 36-6-221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   The Alabama Court rendered the initial custody determination, therefore cementing its exclusive, continuing jurisdiction until one of the statutory conditions necessary to lift it occurred. Also, Mother continues to live in Alabama, which appears to prevent a court of another state from exercising jurisdiction on the basis that all relevant parties left Alabama. All circumstantial evidence in the record, including the testimony of Kellee C., Mother's sister, indicates that Mother never has moved out of the State of Alabama. Finally, there is evidence that Father still has a pending action in Alabama for paternity and child support. All of these facts tend, superficially at least, to bolster Father's argument. However, a closer inspection reveals Alabama's continued jurisdictional grasp of the case to be far less sure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   First, the record contains orders from the Alabama Court granting DHR's motion to close and dismissing Father's dependency petition. Second, while Mother continues to live in Alabama, Mother also has submitted an oath reflecting her desire to surrender her parental rights to the Child. Mother has stated her position unequivocally and going forward will have no legal interest in proceedings regarding the Child upon finalization of her bid to surrender. That would be equally true either in Tennessee or Alabama. Finally, as to Father's pending action in Alabama for paternity and child support, Father's paternity already has been established conclusively by DNA testing. There is nothing new that the Alabama Court can glean in that area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   Alabama's connection to this case is now so tenuous as to be non-existent. The only parent remaining in Alabama wishes to surrender her parental rights. Father only moved to Alabama in the first place to be closer to the legal proceedings there but no longer lives in Alabama. The relationship between Mother and the Child now is so attenuated that there is no longer any significant connection to or substantial evidence in Alabama. To be clear, Mother could not stipulate to subject matter jurisdiction. Instead, we hold that the fact of Mother's consent to termination and adoption nullifies her continued residence in Alabama as a barrier to the Trial Court's exercise of subject matter jurisdiction. There is no prospect here of the kind of jurisdictional competition between states the UCCJEA was designed to prevent. We conclude that Alabama no longer retains exclusive and continuing jurisdiction in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   Turning to the question of whether Tennessee may assert jurisdiction, it is undisputed that Tennessee is the home state of the Child. The Child has lived here for years now. Furthermore, we find no reason why the Trial Court should decline to decide the case. Having answered the three part threshold jurisdictional analysis as we have, we hold that the Trial Court properly exercised subject matter jurisdiction in adjudicating the petition to terminate Father's parental rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   We next address whether the Trial Court erred in entering the final order of adoption after Father perfected his appeal of the judgment terminating his parental rights. Father argues that because the Trial Court entered an adoption order while his appeal of the termination of his parental rights is pending, he may lose the right to contest the adoption if the appellate process is delayed. Father cites\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-1-122\">\n    Tenn.

This provision is intended as a statute of repose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-1-122\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 36-1-122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   As it stands, the Trial Court in two orders adjudicated all matters put before it as to the petition filed by Petitioners seeking to terminate Father's parental rights and to adopt the Child. Father timely appealed. Father now is exercising fully his appeal as of right. The possible outcome he hypothesizes is a mere conjecture, and is one that, given our decision as to the termination of Father's parental rights, is now moot. We find no merit to this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   We now turn to the grounds for termination of Father's parental rights found by the Trial Court. The Trial Court found two grounds under abandonment against Father, which are established by statute as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-216\">\n   (g) Initiation of termination of parental or guardianship rights may be based upon any of the grounds listed in this subsection (g). The following grounds are cumulative and nonexclusive, so that listing conditions, acts or omissions in one ground does not prevent them from coming within another ground:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-217\">\n   (1) Abandonment by the parent or guardian, as defined in \u00a7 36-1-102, has occurred;\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-1-113\">\n    Tenn.

Father argues that Petitioners blocked him from enjoying visitation\n   with the Child. The Trial Court made detailed findings as to this issue. The evidence does not preponderate against the Trial Court's findings on this or any other issue. This is especially so given the Trial Court's unfavorable credibility determination as to Father. Like the Trial Court, we conclude that Father's problems with communicating with Petitioners were of Father's own making. Father behaved woefully and spitefully toward Petitioners. In spite of that, Petitioners left alternative means of communication open to Father, of which he did not avail himself. Father chose instead to quibble over arrangements to meet with Petitioners to visit the Child. In the four month period prior to the filing of the petition to terminate parental rights, Father could have and should have visited with the Child and yet did not. We find, as did the Trial Court, that the ground of willful failure to visit was proven against Father by clear and convincing evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   We next address whether the Trial Court erred in finding the ground of willful failure to support. Father did not pay any support for the Child during the four months leading up to the petition seeking to terminate Father's parental rights. Father offers a range of explanations. On the one hand, Father argues on appeal that it never was established that he had the means during the relevant period to pay support. On the other hand, Father argues that it was reasonable for him to withhold support until he was certain he was the Child's biological father. These alternative explanations are contradictory rather than complementary, as Father acknowledges he could pay but that he did not because he was uncertain he was the Child's father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   \"It is well settled in Tennessee that biological parents must, as a general matter, support their children until they reach the age of majority.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Furthermore, it is more than clear and convincing from Father's testimony that his basis for not sending money was his ever-present hostility toward Petitioners, not a lack of means. Finally, the Trial Court found that Father is a professional chassis technician, who could have and should have been able to pay support for the Child during the relevant four month period, even if his support was minimal. None of Father's excuses for failing to pay support hold any merit. We find, as did the Trial Court, that the ground of willful failure to support was proven against Father by the standard of clear and convincing evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   The final issue we address is whether the Trial Court erred in finding that termination of Father's parental rights is in the Child's best interest. The statutory factors to consider are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-229\">\n   (i) In determining whether termination of parental or guardianship rights is in the best interest of the child pursuant to this part, the court shall consider, but is not limited to, the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-230\">\n   (1) Whether the parent or guardian has made such an adjustment of circumstance, conduct, or conditions as to make it safe and in the child's best interest to\n   be in the home of the parent or guardian;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-231\">\n   (2) Whether the parent or guardian has failed to effect a lasting adjustment after reasonable efforts by available social services agencies for such duration of time that lasting adjustment does not reasonably appear possible;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-232\">\n   (3) Whether the parent or guardian has maintained regular visitation or other contact with the child;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-233\">\n   (4) Whether a meaningful relationship has otherwise been established between the parent or guardian and the child;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-234\">\n   (5) The effect a change of caretakers and physical environment is likely to have on the child's emotional, psychological and medical condition;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-235\">\n   (6) Whether the parent or guardian, or other person residing with the parent or guardian, has shown brutality, physical, sexual, emotional or psychological abuse, or neglect toward the child, or another child or adult in the family or household;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-236\">\n   (7) Whether the physical environment of the parent's or guardian's home is healthy and safe, whether there is criminal activity in the home, or whether there is such use of alcohol, controlled substances or controlled substance analogues as may render the parent or guardian consistently unable to care for the child in a safe and stable manner;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-237\">\n   (8) Whether the parent's or guardian's mental and/or emotional status would be detrimental to the child or prevent the parent or guardian from effectively providing safe and stable care and supervision for the child; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-238\">\n   (9) Whether the parent or guardian has paid child support consistent with the child support guidelines promulgated by the department pursuant to \u00a7 36-5-101.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2036-1-113\">\n    Tenn.

Father, for instance, has inherited a large sum of money. Father has a large home in Florida. In material terms, Father could provide for the Child. However, the factors weighing in Father's favor are outweighed heavily by those against. As found by the Trial Court, Father made no child support payments other than the $ 500.00 he made after he inherited this sum of money. Father, by his own actions as we have discussed above, has no relationship with the Child whatsoever. This contrasts sharply with Petitioners' deep familial relationship with the Child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   Father has made various attempts in this case to assert his fatherhood, like moving to Alabama to be closer to proceedings there, as well as filing various petitions. Nevertheless, Father failed to follow up in any meaningful way. We find no error in the Trial Court's decision that termination of Father's parental rights is in the Child's best interest. We affirm the judgment of the Trial Court in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   The judgment of the Trial Court is affirmed, and this cause is remanded to the Trial Court for collection of the costs below.
