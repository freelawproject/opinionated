In two points on appeal, Gray claims the trial court erred when it found a lack of subject matter jurisdiction and when it found he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. We reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Gray is currently confined in a facility maintained by the Missouri Department of Corrections (\"the Department\"). On July 11, 2018, Gray filed a petition for declaratory judgment in the Cole County Circuit Court. He claimed he was entitled to six years of additional jail-time credit toward service of his sentences. The Department filed a motion to dismiss alleging that Gray had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies before filing the petition and, thus, the court lacked jurisdiction to grant the requested relief. The trial court found it lacked subject matter jurisdiction and dismissed Gray's petition\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"This Court reviews the trial court's grant of a motion to dismiss\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Foster v.

App. W.D. 2000), and alleged that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because Gray had not exhausted all administrative remedies. The trial court dismissed the petition. Its judgment also cited\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   and stated: \"Because Gray has not exhausted his administrative remedies, this Court does not have subject-matter jurisdiction to grant the relief Gray seeks.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   was decided prior to\n   <em>\n    J.C.W. ex rel.

Accordingly, while section 506.384 identified statutory prerequisites to an offender filing a civil action against the Department, those statutory prerequisites do not impact a circuit court's subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Webb\n   </em>\n   , the Missouri Supreme Court made clear that there are only two kinds of jurisdiction: subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208536\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/275/249/#p254\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208536\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/275/249/#p254\">\n    at 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   In evaluating the jurisdiction of circuit courts, there are cases that, in\n   <em>\n    dicta\n   </em>\n   , purport to recognize a third concept, \"jurisdictional competence,\" which often is confused with subject matter jurisdiction.... [T]hese cases generally concern situations in which there is no question as to the court's authority to decide the general issue before it, but there is a question whether the issue or parties affected by the court's judgment are properly before it for resolution at that time.... [T]hese cases do not question the court's subject matter or personal jurisdiction and really go to the court's authority to render a particular judgment in a particular case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [T]here is no constitutional basis for this third jurisdictional concept for statutes that would bar litigants from relief. Elevating statutory restrictions to matters of \"jurisdictional competence\" erodes the constitutional boundary established by article V of the Missouri Constitution, and robs the concept of subject matter jurisdiction of the clarity that the constitution provides. If \"jurisdictional competence\" is recognized as a distinct concept under which a statute can restrict subject matter jurisdiction, the term creates a temptation for litigants to label every statutory restriction on claims for relief as a matter of jurisdictional competence. Accordingly, having fully considered the potential ill effects of recognizing a separate jurisdictional basis called jurisdictional competence, the courts of this state should confine their discussions of circuit court jurisdiction to constitutionally recognized doctrines of personal and subject matter jurisdiction; there is no third category of jurisdiction called \"jurisdictional competence.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208536\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/275/249/#p254\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208536\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/275/249/#p254\">\n    at 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In this case, the Department's argument that the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction is premised entirely on the statutory prerequisites set forth in section 506.384. \"The exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine has traditionally been characterized as a jurisdictional requirement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Coleman v.

App. W.D. 2010) (explaining that issues directed to the circuit court's statutory authority to go forward with hearing and deciding the matter are in the nature of affirmative defenses, and \"[a]ffirmative defenses may be waived\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Department states in its brief that Gray waived any argument that the failure to exhaust administrative remedies is not related to subject matter jurisdiction because he did not present the argument to the trial court. This claim entirely ignores the standard of review. It also ignores the precedent set forth\n   <em>\n    supra.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Department cites\n   <em>\n    Fuller v.

App. S.D. 2010) for the proposition that \"[t]his Court has continued to recognize Section 506.384's exhaustion requirement since the\n   <em>\n    Webb\n   </em>\n   decision.\" The issue is not whether we recognize the mandate in section 506.384. Instead, the issue is whether such mandate deprives the circuit court of subject matter jurisdiction. As noted,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , it does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Department also cites several cases clarifying that the circuit court lacked authority as opposed to jurisdiction. This comports with our analysis. The Department notes that it raised the issue of failure to exhaust administrative remedies at the earliest opportunity and that a party may file a motion for failure to state a claim under Rule 55.27(a)(6) where it appears from the face of the petition that an affirmative defense is applicable. The Department did not file a motion for failure to state a claim, however. Instead, it filed a motion to dismiss that was premised entirely on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The judgment of the trial court is reversed and the matter is remanded. If the Department raises as an affirmative defense in its responsive pleading the claim that Gray has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as required by section 506.384, the circuit court will be required to ascertain if, in fact, Gray has exhausted such remedies so as to evaluate the circuit court's\n   <em>\n    authority\n   </em>\n   to permit his suit to proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The point is granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    Point II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In his second point on appeal, Gray claims the trial court erred in finding he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. He argues that his claim was not a contested case. Given our disposition of Gray's first point on appeal, we need not address his second point on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The circuit court's judgment of dismissal is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with our ruling in this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   All concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    We note that the current case is very similar to\n    <em>\n     McDonald v.
