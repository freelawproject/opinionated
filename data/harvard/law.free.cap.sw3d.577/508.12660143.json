In his sole point on appeal, Santamaria challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction, arguing that the State failed to prove deliberation because he was too intoxicated to have coolly reflected on his actions. Finding that there was sufficient evidence of deliberation, we affirm. Rule 30.25(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
