We conditionally grant the writ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The underlying case arises from a vehicle-bicycle accident. The cyclist, plaintiff/real party-in-interest John Colwell, was riding his bicycle eastbound on Seawall Boulevard in Galveston. He crossed into the intersection at 31st Street, and the vehicle driven by defendant/relator Christian Cambell collided with the cyclist and his bicycle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The cyclist sued the driver. In the jury trial that followed, the trial court issued a charge, asking the jury in Question 1 if the negligence, if any, of the driver or the cyclist proximately caused the occurrence. After having certain testimony about the accident read back to them, the jury answered \"Yes\" as to both the driver and the cyclist. In response to Question 2, predicated on two \"yes\" responses for Question 1, the jury assigned a percentage of responsibility to the driver and cyclist, finding the driver 17% responsible and the cyclist 83% responsible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The cyclist filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (\"JNOV\"), in which he discussed the evidence and contended there was no evidence to support the jury's answer to Question 1 that he was negligent. Like the cyclist, in responding, the driver detailed the evidence. The driver also noted the trial court must have believed there was some evidence of the cyclist's negligence because the trial court submitted that issue to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The trial court held a hearing on the JNOV motion. At the hearing, both parties discussed the evidence in detail, just as they had done in the briefing. The driver also pointed out the jury deliberated for six hours. The trial court said it would take the matter under advisement. The record does not contain a written ruling on the JNOV motion; rather, the trial court implicitly denied the motion by signing a judgment on the verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The cyclist filed a motion for new trial. Unlike his detailed JNOV motion, the motion for new trial was skeletal, stating in its entirety: \"The jury's verdict as to contributory negligence and as to comparative responsibility are against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence. Accordingly, Plaintiff moves the Court to grant a new trial.\" Construed broadly, the motion challenges the factual sufficiency of the evidence to support the answers to both Question 1 (\"contributory negligence\") and Question 2 (\"comparative responsibility\"). The driver responded by incorporating his JNOV response. It appears the trial court held no hearing on the motion for new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The trial court signed an order granting the cyclist's motion for new trial, stating in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   ... [T]he Court, having considered the following uncontroverted facts adduced at trial [sic]:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   1. Defendant [the driver] was stopped at the stop sign at the intersection of 31st St. and Seawall Blvd. just prior to the collision and saw Plaintiff [the cyclist]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   on his bicycle on the sidewalk approaching the crosswalk from Defendant's right;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   2. The Defendant then looked to his left and then proceeded through the crosswalk onto Seawall Blvd., striking the Plaintiff who was directly in front of Defendant in or near the middle of the crosswalk; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   3. There was a lack of evidence of careless or otherwise improper conduct on the part of the Plaintiff as he approached and entered the crosswalk.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   It is the considered opinion of the Court that the combination of these facts and lack of evidence undermines the jury's finding of 83% comparative responsibility on the Plaintiff and 17% on the Defendant, making the finding against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence and requiring the granting of a new trial ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In numbered statements 1 and 2 the trial court summarizes certain evidence. Numbered statement 3 concerns the plaintiff/cyclist's negligence (or lack thereof), and therefore refers to the jury's answer to Question 1 that the plaintiff/cyclist's negligence proximately caused the occurrence. The unnumbered statements in the final paragraph concern the division of responsibility, and therefore refer to the jury's answer to Question 2 that the defendant/driver was 17% responsible and the plaintiff/cyclist was 83% responsible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PETITION FOR MANDAMUS AND RESPONSE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In his petition for writ of mandamus, the driver contends the trial court abused its discretion in signing the new-trial order because the jury's findings of 83% responsibility for the cyclist and 17% responsibility for the driver do not go against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence. He asserts the trial court in its order incorrectly adopts the cyclist's view of the evidence as \"uncontroverted facts.\" At this court's request, the cyclist responded to the driver's petition for mandamus relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    III. MANDAMUS STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   To obtain mandamus relief, a relator generally must show both that the trial court clearly abused its discretion and that the relator lacks an adequate remedy at law, such as an appeal.\n   <em>\n    In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9146465\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/148/124/#p135\">\n    148 S.W.3d 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 135-36 (Tex. 2004) (orig. proceeding). A trial court clearly abuses its discretion if it reaches a decision so arbitrary and unreasonable as to amount to a clear and prejudicial error of law or if it clearly fails to analyze the law correctly or apply the law correctly to the facts.\n   <em>\n    In re Cerberus Capital Mgmt.

If this court were to give deference to the trial court's ruling when determining whether the trial court abused its discretion in granting a new trial based on the factual insufficiency of the evidence to support a jury finding, this deference would be inconsistent with the supreme court's precedent requiring no deference when the trial court denies a new trial based on assertions of factual insufficiency. Because this court must give no deference to a trial court's determination that the trial evidence is factually sufficient to support a jury finding, principles of consistency and the need to protect the right to trial by jury under the Texas Constitution support this court's holdings that we also give no deference to the trial court when the trial court concludes that the evidence is factually insufficient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Conway v.

Summary of Evidence regarding the Collision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The evidence at trial concerned two main topics: the collision and the cyclist's damages. Other than three photos of the intersection or of Seawall Boulevard, all the evidence about the collision comes from the testimony of the driver and the cyclist, summarized as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Driver's Testimony\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   1. The driver drove an SUV south on 31st Street until he reached the intersection at Seawall Boulevard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   2. The driver was familiar with the area.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   3. The driver stopped at the stop sign at the intersection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   4. The driver saw a pedestrian, an older woman, crossing 31st from his left (east).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   5. When the pedestrian was about a quarter of the way across the street, the driver looked to his right (west) and saw the cyclist riding towards the intersection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   6. After the pedestrian crossed, the driver \"creeped up a little bit\" to see around the cars parked on Seawall.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   7. The driver looked to his left. At trial, he first testified he did not look to his right again after looking to his left. He then testified the opposite: he said he looked to his right for a second time, did not see the cyclist, and looked to his left again.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   8. The driver went forward and the SUV collided with the cyclist.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Cyclist's Testimony\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   1. The cyclist knew the rules of the road for riding a bicycle. The cyclist knew that when he was riding a bicycle right next to the road, he had to follow the same rules as any other vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   2. Before the accident, the cyclist traveled approximately 4,000 miles a year on his bicycle on the shoulder of the road. The cyclist rode his bicycle on the right side of the\n   shoulder because that is part of the rules of the road.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   3. On the day of the accident the cyclist was riding his bicycle eastbound on Seawall Boulevard on the left-hand (north) side, alternating between the left-hand (north) sidewalk and the left-hand (north) \"parking lane,\" going in the direction opposite from the direction of the closest traffic on Seawall Boulevard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   4. The cyclist rode on the left-hand (north) sidewalk from a department store to 30th Street, at which point the cyclist moved into Seawall's left-hand (north) parking lane because there was a \"four-wheel bicycle\" in his path. Just before the accident, the cyclist moved back onto the left-hand (north) sidewalk.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   5. The cyclist saw the SUV [driver's vehicle] at a \"dead stop\" at 31st Street from 20 to 30 yards west.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   6. When the cyclist saw the SUV, he stopped pedaling and put his hands on the brake levers of the bicycle in case he needed to use them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   7. The cyclist could see a female passenger in the SUV, and he and the passenger made eye contact.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   8. The cyclist could not see the driver due to the sun's glare on the windshield.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   9. The SUV \"was at a dead stop\" and \"just sat there.\" The cyclist assumed the driver saw him and was allowing him to cross in front of the SUV.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   10. The cyclist started to cross in front of the SUV.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   11. The cyclist heard the SUV's engine \"rev up,\" then felt the SUV hit him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Factual Sufficiency of the Evidence to Support the Jury's Findings.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The new-trial order cites to only two facts about the cyclist: (1) \"just prior to the collision,\" the cyclist was \"on his bicycle on the sidewalk approaching the crosswalk from the [driver's] right\" and (2) when the driver struck the cyclist, the cyclist \"was directly in front of Defendant in or near the middle of the crosswalk.\" Those facts are said to support the trial court's conclusion that the record contains no evidence the cyclist was negligent and the jury's apportionment of responsibility at 83% for the cyclist and 17% for the driver goes against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    a.

The new-trial order omits several pieces of evidence, any or all of which the jury reasonably could have credited in support of its determination of negligence. The driver testified he looked to his right and saw the cyclist, then looked to his left and saw the pedestrian, then looked to his right a second time but no longer saw the cyclist. From that testimony, the jury reasonably could have inferred the cyclist already had moved into the intersection and the jury reasonably could have believed that the cyclist's doing so was unreasonable under the circumstances. The jury could have assigned more weight to the driver's testimony that he \"creeped up a little bit\" than to the cyclist's testimony that the driver was \"at a dead stop\" and \"just sat there\" and then \"revved\" his engine. The jury reasonably could have found the cyclist's assumption that the driver could see him and was letting him go first was unreasonable, such that the cyclist's riding into the intersection was negligent. Likewise, the jury reasonably could have found the cyclist's riding his bicycle on the left-hand (north) side of Seawall Boulevard rather than on the right-hand (south) side was negligence that proximately caused the occurrence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Because the evidence is legally sufficient to support the jury's finding that the cyclist was negligent, the trial court erred in concluding there was a lack of evidence that the cyclist was negligent as the cyclist approached and entered the crosswalk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   We presume that the trial court found the trial evidence factually insufficient to support the jury's finding that the cyclist's negligence proximately caused the occurrence. After considering and weighing all the evidence, we conclude the trial evidence supporting this finding is not so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence as to be clearly wrong and unjust.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maritime Overseas Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11812024\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/971/402/#p406\">\n    971 S.W.2d at 406-07\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The record does not support the reasons the trial court gave for granting a new trial. Thus, we conditionally grant the petition for writ of mandamus and direct the trial court to vacate its August 3, 2018 order granting a new trial. We are confident the trial court will act in accordance with this opinion. The writ of mandamus will issue only if the trial court fails to do so.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    The driver does not assert that the trial court's new-trial order fails to satisfy the requirements for facial validity, so we do not address this issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    <em>\n     Bent\n    </em>\n    also involved the conflation of legal-insufficiency and factual-insufficiency points in a new-trial order.

In other words, the trial court determined the jury's finding was not supported by factually sufficient evidence.
