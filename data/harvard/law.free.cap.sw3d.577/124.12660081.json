Wilson, Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Andrew Barnett (\"Barnett\") appeals the circuit court's judgment following a jury trial convicting him of first-degree assault and armed criminal action. Barnett argues the circuit court erred in failing to submit a self-defense instruction. This Court has jurisdiction under article V, section 10 of the Missouri Constitution. Because there was substantial evidence to support the submission of a self-defense instruction, the circuit court's judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Barnett was charged with first-degree assault and armed criminal action. The following evidence was adduced at trial. On the night in question, Barnett and Victim were both at the Little Bar (\"the bar\"). Throughout the night, Victim urged Barnett to go outside so the two could fight. Later in the evening, Victim approached Barnett in a threatening manner, and the two got into a physical altercation. The bartenders ordered both men to leave the bar. Before Barnett left, a friend gave Barnett back his knives the friend had\n   been holding. After exiting the bar, Barnett stopped to urinate near a dumpster. At that time, Victim approached Barnett from behind and shouted threatening obscenities, such as \"now you're going to die you [expletive].\" The two got into a physical altercation, and Barnett saw a \"metal and shiny\" object in Victim's hand coming toward Barnett's face. In response, Barnett testified he knocked Victim's hand away, shoved Victim to the ground, and left the scene. A witness who saw the altercation from afar claimed he saw Victim \"drop like a bag of rocks.\" Shortly thereafter, Victim was lying on the ground, bleeding severely, and appeared to have several stab wounds. A few hours after the incident, police officers asked Barnett if he stabbed Victim in self-defense, but Barnett adamantly denied stabbing Victim at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   During the jury instruction conference, Barnett offered a self-defense instruction. The state objected, claiming Barnett was not entitled to such an instruction because he denied committing the stabbing. The circuit court sustained the state's objection. The circuit court submitted an instruction for first-degree assault, along with a mitigating heat of passion instruction. An instruction for armed criminal action also was submitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The jury found Barnett guilty of first-degree assault and armed criminal action, and Barnett was sentenced accordingly. Barnett filed a motion for new trial, arguing, among other things, the circuit court erred by refusing to submit a self-defense instruction. The circuit court overruled the motion for new trial. Barnett appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The state claims Barnett is not entitled to a self-defense instruction principally because Barnett expressly denied stabbing Victim. According to the state, Barnett is entitled to a self-defense instruction only if the evidence supporting the theory of self-defense was offered by the state or injected by the testimony of a third party. Because neither the state nor a third party introduced the issue of self-defense, the state concludes Barnett was not entitled to the requested instruction. For the reasons set forth below, the Court rejects this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In determining whether a defendant is entitled to an instruction, this Court has long held if there is substantial evidence to support the theory propounded in the requested instruction, the court is required to submit that instruction to the jury.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In making this determination, a court must view \"the evidence in a light most favorable to the defendant[ ] in order to determine whether the evidence was sufficient to support and authorize instructions on the mentioned matters.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Cole\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10161265\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/377/306/#p307\">\n    377 S.W.2d 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 307 (Mo. 1964).

This inconsistency in the law, which is addressed in Section III, has caused the state mistakenly to rely on cases holding an exception to the rule in\n   <em>\n    Bidstrup\n   </em>\n   exists when a defendant attempts to introduce his own testimony contrary to the requested instruction. Because no such exception exists, the state's reliance on these cases is improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The rule that a court is required to submit an instruction when there is substantial evidence to support it does not change when the defendant's testimony contradicts the requested instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Bidstrup\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=140%20S.W.%20904\">\n    140 S.W. at 907\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the opposite were true, the court - not the jury - would be tasked with determining which version of the defendant's statements to believe.

As a result, when the evidence supports two conflicting versions of events, even when both versions have been provided by the defendant, the court must refrain from determining which version is correct.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6938942\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/433/390/#p399\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The question of whether a defendant is entitled to an instruction cannot turn on which party introduced the evidence supporting the instruction.\n   <em>\n    Bidstrup\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=140%20S.W.%20904\">\n    140 S.W. at 907\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This remains true when the evidence supporting the instruction is the defendant's own testimony because, in making a sufficiency of the evidence determination, a court must \"consider all the evidence in the case, without regard to the party by whom it was introduced.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=140%20S.W.%20904\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It is irrelevant \"whether the issue arises from the testimony of the one side or the other, or both, [because in each instance] a question of law is presented upon which it becomes the duty of the court to instruct the jury for their information in giving their verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=140%20S.W.%20904\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=140%20S.W.%20904\">\n    at 908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Applying\n   <em>\n    Bidstrup\n   </em>\n   (among other cases), the Court found substantial evidence existed to support a manslaughter instruction because the defendant testified the victim assaulted the defendant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 562. The Court also correctly resolved the conflict by overruling any case that held a defendant was not entitled to an instruction because the defendant's testimony was the sole basis for the inconsistent instructions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   About a decade later, the Court issued its opinion in\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   , on the night of the crime, the defendant's statement to the police suggested he committed the killing in self-defense.\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1310213\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mo/352/66/\">\n    175 S.W.2d at 869-70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The defendant denied \"owning, having or using a knife\" on the victim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A manslaughter instruction was given, but a self-defense instruction was not.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 867.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On appeal, this Court relied on\n   <em>\n    Bidstrup\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Creighton\n   </em>\n   to hold that the circuit court erred in failing to give a self-defense instruction because there was substantial evidence - in the form of the defendant's statement on the night of the crime - to support that instruction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 871-72. This was correct. Unfortunately, the Court then proceeded needlessly to engage in a discussion concerning who authored - and offered - the inconsistent statement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 872.

But the inconsistent statement in\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   was not from the testimony of a third-party witness or a witness for the state but, rather, from the defendant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 869-70. As a result, the Court's discussion of that issue was dicta.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In this same regard, the Court also stated that - had he attempted to do so - the defendant would not have been permitted to introduce his own prior inconsistent statement at trial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 871-72. On the other hand, if the state sought to introduce the defendant's prior inconsistent statement, the Court noted the defendant would have been permitted to rely on that statement to show there was substantial evidence supporting the requested instruction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But once again, because the Court's entire discussion of whether the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     defendant\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   could have introduced his prior inconsistent statement occurred in a case in which the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     state\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   sought to do so, this discussion was dicta.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 869-70.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Later, in\n   <em>\n    State v.
