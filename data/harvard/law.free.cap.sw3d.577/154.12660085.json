Thomas Grellner sued Dr. Pacheco-Coronado and Metro Heart Group of St. Louis,\n   Inc., in the Circuit Court of St. Louis County claiming that Dr. Pacheco-Coronado negligently caused the death of his wife. A jury trial was held in the matter, and a verdict was reached in favor of the defendants. The court accepted the verdict and entered a judgment thereon. Grellner now appeals claiming the trial court erred twice with respect to the admission of evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We affirm. Because an extended opinion would have no precedential value, the parties have been furnished with a memorandum for their information only, setting forth the reasons for this order pursuant to Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
