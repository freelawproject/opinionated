Meyers's motion for en banc reconsideration is denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Luke Meyers was working on an oil and gas platform off the coast of Louisiana when a crane cable snapped and caused a 62.5-pound weight to fall about 50 feet. The weight struck Meyers and crushed his foot. He sued the owner of the platform, W &amp; T Offshore Inc. The jury charge submitted a general-negligence question rather than a premises-liability question, and the jury found W &amp; T negligent. The trial court signed a final judgment consistent with the jury's $2.8 million verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   W &amp; T moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict because Meyers failed to obtain a jury finding on an essential element of a premises-liability claim. The trial court denied the motion, and W &amp; T appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In this case, Texas courts must apply Louisiana substantive law as surrogate federal law under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201333\">\n    43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). We agree with W &amp; T that Louisiana law recognizes a distinction between negligent-activity and premises-liability theories of recovery and that Meyers failed to secure a jury finding on any element of his claim. Accordingly, the trial court's judgment must be reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On original submission, we rendered a take-nothing judgment for W &amp; T consistent with the ordinary remedy under\n   Rule 279 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. Meyers filed a motion for rehearing to seek a remand in the interest of justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Because we clarify in this appeal how a premises-liability theory should be submitted under Louisiana law, as surrogate federal law mandated by OCSLA, we remand in the interest of justice rather than render a take-nothing judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   W &amp; T is an oil and gas exploration and production company. It contracted for Sparrows Offshore, Inc., to inspect and service W &amp; T's cranes in the Gulf of Mexico. Meyers worked for Sparrows and would inspect and service W &amp; T's cranes. He worked offshore on a fourteen-day hitch. Sparrows would make recommendations to W &amp; T for service, and W &amp; T was responsible for ordering parts and authorizing service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In October 2010, Meyers performed a full-day annual inspection on one of W &amp; T's cranes located on an unmanned platform off the coast of Louisiana. Meyers informed W &amp; T of several deficiencies, including that the anti-two-block (A2B) steel cable needed to be replaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Although the A2B cable appeared to be in good working condition when Meyers inspected it, the cable had been on the crane for three years. Sparrows recommends changing this type of cable every three years as a safety precaution. These cables are exposed to corrosive elements in the Gulf of Mexico, which can deteriorate the springs. A witness testified that the purpose of replacing the cables every few years is because sometimes there is internal damage that cannot be seen from the outside when visually inspected. There was evidence, however, that W &amp; T did not order the cable, that the cable was not delivered offshore, and that the cable was not replaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In May 2011, Meyers returned to the platform with a coworker, Edward Huntsberry, and a W &amp; T representative, David Broussard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   While Meyers and Huntsberry were replacing the main block, the A2B cable snapped in two places, causing the 62.5-pound A2B weight to fall. Meyers pushed Huntsberry out of the A2B weight's path, but the weight struck Meyers's foot and \"crushed\" it. Meyers became permanently disabled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Broussard testified that he looked at the cable afterward, and it seemed structurally damaged, old, and weather-worn, like the elements played a part in its deterioration. Both parties' experts agreed the cable was defective. W &amp; T's corporate representative agreed the cable was defective: \"That's why it broke.\" The representative testified that it was W &amp; T's responsibility to address a deficiency and that W &amp; T was responsible for the failed cable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   There was also evidence that the crane was not designed safely because most cranes have a secondary restraint for the A2B weight to prevent it from falling if the A2B cable breaks. Further, the type of bushings on the A2B cable guides created a friction-related wear surface on the cable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Meyers sued W &amp; T, alleging among other things that W &amp; T failed to warn Meyers of hidden danger aboard the platform, failed to maintain a safe work environment, and failed to inspect, maintain, and repair equipment. The jury charge included a general-negligence question:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"Did the negligence, if any, of those named below proximately cause the occurrence in question?\" The jury answered \"Yes\" for W &amp; T and \"No\" for Meyers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   W &amp; T filed a motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, contending among other things that (1) Meyers waived his right to recover on a premises-defect theory by failing to secure a jury finding under either Texas or Louisiana law, and (2) W &amp; T owed no duty of care to Meyers because he was an independent contractor. The trial court denied W &amp; T's motion and signed a final judgment consistent with the jury's verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On appeal, W &amp; T contends that the trial court erred for the two reasons set forth in the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, among others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    III. PREMISES LIABILITY VS. GENERAL NEGLIGENCE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In its first issue, W &amp; T contends that Meyers failed to secure a necessary jury finding on his only viable theory of recovery, i.e., premises liability. Meyers contends that W &amp; T invited error, and regardless, that the submission of a general-negligence question was proper under Louisiana law. We agree with W &amp; T.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Texas Procedural Law and Rule 279\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The parties agree that Texas procedural law applies in this case. Rule 278 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure requires the trial court to submit to the jury questions, instructions, and definitions that are raised by the written pleadings and the evidence. Tex. R. Civ. P. 278 . Rule 279 provides, \"Upon appeal all independent grounds of recovery or of defense not conclusively established under the evidence and no element of which is submitted or requested are waived.\" Tex. R. Civ. P. 279. If, however, elements are omitted from the charge that constitute only part of a complete and independent ground, and if other elements necessarily referable to that ground are submitted and answered, then the omitted elements may be deemed found in support of the judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ramos v. Frito-Lay, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10006683\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/784/667/#p668\">\n    784 S.W.2d 667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 668 (Tex. 1990) (citing Tex. R. Civ. P. 279 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Under the rules, if the pleadings and evidence indicate that the plaintiff submitted to the jury an improper theory of recovery (e.g., general negligence) in lieu of the plaintiff's proper theory of recovery (e.g., premises liability), then the plaintiff waives the unsubmitted theory of recovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United Scaffolding, Inc. v. Levine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12410203\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/537/463/#p469\">\n    537 S.W.3d 463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 469-70, 481 (Tex. 2017). If the plaintiff has waived their theory of recovery by failing to request or secure findings on the theory, then a reviewing court ordinarily will render a take-nothing judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12410203\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/537/463/#p469\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12410203\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/537/463/#p469\">\n    at 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    B. No Invited Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As an initial matter, Meyers contends that W &amp; T invited the error and is therefore prohibited from complaining about Meyers's failure to secure a premises-liability finding. We hold that W &amp; T did not invite this error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The invited error doctrine prevents a party from complaining on appeal that the trial court took a specific action that the complaining party requested.\n   <em>\n    Tittizer v. Union Gas Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8924828\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/171/857/#p862\">\n    171 S.W.3d 857\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 862 (Tex. 2005).

App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2001, no pet.). As relevant here, a defendant may be estopped from complaining that the plaintiff failed to secure a jury finding on the proper theory of recovery (e.g., premises liability) if the defendant \"persuades a trial court to adopt a jury charge that [the\n   defendant] later alleges supports an improper theory of recovery\" (e.g., general negligence).\n   <em>\n    United Scaffolding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12410203\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/537/463/#p469\">\n    537 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   482 (citing\n   <em>\n    Del Lago Partners, Inc. v.

App.-San Antonio 2012, pet. granted, judgm't vacated w.r.m.) (holding that the defendant invited this type of error by submitting a proposed charge based on general negligence; the defendant \"received the jury charge it asked for\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Meyers contends that W &amp; T invited error by attaching a document titled \"Plaintiff's Proposed Jury Charge\" to W &amp; T's response to the trial court's Rule 166 trial preparation order. Rule 166 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes a trial court to direct the parties to appear before the court and consider any matter as may aid in the disposition of the action, including but not limited to, \"[p]roposed jury charge questions, instructions, and definitions for a jury case.\" Tex. R. Civ. P. 166. A trial court's authority \"to require the parties to 'appear before it' \" in Rule 166 includes the express power to order an appearance by filing a written report.\n   <em>\n    Koslow's v. Mackie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11292251\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/796/700/#p703\">\n    796 S.W.2d 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 703 (Tex. 1990). Rule 166 states further that the trial court \"shall make an order that recites the action taken at the pretrial conference,\" and that \"limits the issues for trial to those not disposed of by admissions, agreements of counsel, or rulings of the court.\" Tex. R. Civ. P. 166.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In this case, the trial court signed a pre-trial \"Trial Preparation Order\" that instructed the parties as follows: \"Pursuant to Rule 166 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, the items that are checked below must be FILED BEFORE OR by 02-06-2015.\" The trial court checked a box next to the following items, among others: (1) \"Draft Jury Charge (if a jury fee has been paid) or Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. Modifications may be submitted as the trial progresses.\"; (2) \"Exhibits. An exhibit list is required....\"; and (3) \"Motions in Limine.\" W &amp; T filed \"Defendant's Trial Preparation Order.\" Under the heading \"jury issues,\" W &amp; T attached \"Plaintiff's Proposed Jury Charge.\" The proposed charge included a general-negligence question and related definitions. The charge did not include a premises-liability question or related definitions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On the two days immediately before trial, the court held pretrial hearings primarily to address issues related to exhibits and motions in limine. The only time the parties or court referred to the jury charge was in the context of the exhibits and motions in limine. Nothing at the pretrial hearing indicated that the court was making a ruling concerning the jury charge. In discussing the topic of a type of damages, for example, the Court said, \"The evidence is coming in[. H]ow it's delineated on a Jury Charge we will decide at that time-at the time we discuss the Jury Charge ....\" The record does not contain a subsequent order reciting the action taken at the pretrial conference pursuant to Rule 166.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Six days into the trial, at the charge conference, the court provided the parties with a copy of the court's charge. W &amp; T objected for various reasons, contending that \"[s]ubmission of negligence as to W &amp; T is improper.\" W &amp; T stated: \"Based on the Louisiana Law and Federal Law applying the Louisiana Law in an OCSL case, our position is that there is no evidence that W &amp; T controlled the work of Mr. Meyers or presented him with an unreasonable and dangerous-unreasonably dangerous condition in which to work.\" W &amp; T did not explicitly tell the trial court that the case should have been submitted on a general-negligence theory or a premises-liability\n   theory, and W &amp; T did not have a duty to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United Scaffolding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12410203\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/537/463/#p469\">\n    537 S.W.3d at 481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On appeal, the only case Meyers cites in which an appellate court held that the defendant invited this type of error is\n   <em>\n    Saeco Electric &amp; Utility, Ltd. v.

App.-San Antonio 2012, pet. granted, judgm't vacated w.r.m.). But, the record in\n   <em>\n    Saeco\n   </em>\n   was markedly different for three reasons. First, in\n   <em>\n    Saeco\n   </em>\n   the trial court asked for proposed charges at the beginning of the second week of trial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7095501\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/392/803/#p807\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7095501\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/392/803/#p807\">\n    at 807\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the trial court asked for proposed charges through a pretrial order and told the parties that modifications could be submitted as the trial progressed. Second, in\n   <em>\n    Saeco\n   </em>\n   the defendant did not object to the submission of the general-negligence question.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7095501\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/392/803/#p807\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, W &amp; T objected to the submission of the general-negligence question. Third, in\n   <em>\n    Saeco\n   </em>\n   the trial court specifically told the parties that it was using the defendant's proposed charge.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7095501\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/392/803/#p807\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, nothing in the record indicates that the trial court based its charge on W &amp; T's pretrial submission, rather than some other source. The court did not say on the record that it was using W &amp; T's charge, nor did the court memorialize a Rule 166 ruling, as required by the rule, to recite the actions taken at the pretrial conference on the issue of the proposed jury charges (i.e., none).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Under these circumstances, the record does not show that W &amp; T \"persuade[d] a trial court to adopt a jury charge that [W &amp; T] later alleges supports an improper theory of recovery\" (e.g., general negligence).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United Scaffolding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12410203\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/537/463/#p469\">\n    537 S.W.3d at 482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

And in its reply brief, W &amp; T contends that Meyers \"waived the application of Louisiana law\" by not pleading for the application of Louisiana law and not asking the trial court to take judicial notice under Rule 202 of the Texas Rules of Evidence.

In its second issue, discussed in two pages of the brief, W &amp; T asks this court to render a judgment that Meyers take nothing \"because there is no evidence or finding of control.\" W &amp; T bases this argument on the notion that a property owner does not owe a duty of care to an independent contractor unless the property owner retains or exercises control over the contractor's work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nippa v.

Thus, Meyers brings a direct liability claim against W &amp; T and is not seeking to recover on a theory of vicarious liability for Sparrows' negligence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8414539\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/933/843/#p852\">\n    933 So.2d at 852\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The parties' experts agreed that the cable was defective. And W &amp; T acknowledges in its briefing that it \"owes a premises-liability duty to the independent contractor as an invitee.\" Indeed, under Louisiana law, a property owner owes a duty of care to independent contractors for the property owner's own negligence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8414539\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/933/843/#p852\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   A property owner like W &amp; T has a \"duty of exercising reasonable care for the safety of persons on its premises and a duty of not exposing such persons to unreasonable risks of injury or harm.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8414539\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/933/843/#p852\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"This duty extends to employees of independent contractors for whose benefit the owner must take reasonable steps to ensure a safe working environment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8414539\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/933/843/#p852\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Accordingly, underlying W &amp; T's argument is an unstated assumption that Sparrows, and not W &amp; T, created the dangerous condition in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nippa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11163760\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/774/310/#p314\">\n    774 So.2d at 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coastal Marine Serv. of Tex., Inc. v.

But on appeal, W &amp; T does not explain how Sparrows created the dangerous condition in this case or identify any evidence that Sparrows created the dangerous condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Although the evidence was disputed, there was evidence that W &amp; T failed to procure the new A2B cable through its own negligence. For example, Broussard\n   testified that sometimes W &amp; T's orders get lost in the system or overlooked. Based on one of W &amp; T's documents that was an exhibit at trial, Broussard opined that the order was not property completed either because it got lost somewhere or it was denied. Several witnesses testified that a new A2B cable was not found on the platform before the accident. Huntsberry testified that he had seen something like this happen before-where recommendations were made to W &amp; T, yet W &amp; T did not do anything to follow up. The record contains evidence that W &amp; T did not order the parts necessary to change the A2B cable until after Meyers was injured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   In sum, regardless of whether there is any evidence that W &amp; T controlled Meyers's work, W &amp; T still owed a duty to Meyers for W &amp; T's own negligence as a premises owner.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8414539\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/933/843/#p852\">\n    933 So.2d at 852\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   W &amp; T's second issue is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
