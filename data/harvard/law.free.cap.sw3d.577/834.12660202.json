Officer Sellers testified that he had been on night patrol and saw Vanlue behaving strangely. The officer stopped his marked police car, exited the vehicle in uniform, identified himself, asked Vanlue for ID, radioed dispatch from his shoulder mic, and was told there was an active warrant for Vanlue's arrest. Vanlue, within earshot, pulled a butcher knife and lunged at Officer Sellers, whose protective vest turned the knife blade away without injury. After a struggle, the officer disarmed Vanlue, who broke free and fled, but was arrested after a foot pursuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Vanlue also testified. On direct, he acknowledged that he had been on probation for three felonies, with an active warrant out for him, and high on meth when this occurred. He admitted having the knife, but denied ever pulling it out of his pocket, and described his encounter with Officer Sellers this way:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   He asked me, you know, what my name was. And, you know, he said he was doing pedestrian checks. And I gave him a fake name. And I'm thinking I'm going to jail for a concealed weapon anyway.... I was like, Man, I'm going to jail for concealed weapon. So when he asked if I had anything on me, I told him I had a butcher knife in my pocket. I told him, I have a butcher knife in my pocket. And he said, I'll tell you what we're going to do, and he went to move at all and I ran. And the knife had to fall out of my pocket.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   His cross-examination ended this way:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Q. There's no doubt that you were fully aware that he was a law enforcement officer when this incident occurred?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   A. I knew he was.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Q. And you admit having the knife?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Q. You admit knowing that Don Sellers was a law enforcement officer?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Q. You know that you had a warrant?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Q. You didn't want to go to prison?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Q. You've lied multiple times to avoid going to prison?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   A. Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Q. But your claim is that, even though you lied about who you were, you were just handing the knife to -- oh, you didn't even hand it, did you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   A. I never pulled the knife out of my pocket. I'm not sure how it come to this.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Q. And you don't know how it got recovered?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   A. I know I ran behind the vehicle, and the knife, there's no way it could have been found in front of the car. Why there's not dash cams and vest cams to these kinds of things, I'm not sure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Q. So it's somebody else's fault?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   A. This is truly false.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Q. Don Sellers is lying about everything?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   A. Absolutely false. He is inaccurate and lying, yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The jury took just 16 minutes to find Vanlue guilty of first-degree ALO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The state persuasively argues that the record we have summarized rebuts any presumed prejudice. The jury plainly believed Officer Sellers and disbelieved Vanlue as evidenced by the 16-minute verdict. It seems a stretch to think that instructing down to second-degree ALO would have changed anything.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Yet we cannot overlook two factors: (1) unlike many\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Jackson\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   complaints, this is not a plain-error claim, but one of timely preserved error; and (2) Vanlue not only requested an instruction based on physical injury (as opposed to serious physical injury), but defense counsel made a related jury argument in closing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   I'm going to talk a minute about this jury instruction. There is -- the main jury instruction that you're going to consider and the prosecutor laid out the basically three prongs that you have to find to find Mr. VanLue [sic] guilty. First, that the Defendant attempted to cause serious physical injury to Donald Sellers by attempting to stab him. And that's definitely in dispute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   And I would add that we -- I mean, it's not forgone conclusion that this is going to cause serious physical injury. If you read the definitions, and that's what we're guided by is the definition and things in the instructions, the definition of serious physical injury is physical injury that creates a substantial risk of death. There wasn't any risk of death. Or that causes serious disfigurement or protracted loss or impairment of the functions of any part of the body. Somebody can definitely be stabbed by this knife and be fine. Somebody can be cut by this knife and be fine. So I don't think it meets that prong of serious physical injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As unpersuasive as that argument may sound on this record, defense counsel had a right to make it and may have done so more effectively had the court given the \"mere\" physical-injury instruction Vanlue sought and\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Jackson\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   required. Long before\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Jackson\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , our supreme court emphasized that \"Missouri has traditionally placed great emphasis on legally correct instructions, and this Court has made it clear that criminal defendants should be freely allowed to argue their contentions arising from the facts.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     State v. Westfall\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9415930\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/75/278/#p284\">\n    75 S.W.3d 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 284 (Mo. banc 2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Failure to give a required instruction is presumed to prejudice the defendant unless the state\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     clearly establishes\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   otherwise.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Jensen\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12385047\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/524/33/\">\n    524 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   38 n.3.

Even now it is a close call because we doubt the omitted instruction would have changed the outcome, but we cannot say that is so clearly established that we must not give Vanlue the benefit of the doubt.
