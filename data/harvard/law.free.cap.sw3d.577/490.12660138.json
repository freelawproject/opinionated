Wilson, Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Lincoln Rene Aguiriano Martinez (\"Martinez\") filed a lawsuit in the circuit court of Jackson County, alleging personal injury sustained while working at an apartment complex in Overland Park, Kansas. Two of the defendants, Cedar Crest Apartments, LLC (\"Cedar Crest\"), and Peterson Properties, Inc. d/b/a The Peterson Companies (\"Peterson Properties,\" and, collectively with Cedar Crest, \"Relators\"), are Kansas business entities. Relators seek a writ of prohibition directing the circuit court to dismiss Martinez's claims against them for lack of personal jurisdiction. Because Martinez failed to show that Relators are \"at home\" in Missouri and failed to identify any conduct by Relators in this state out of which his claims arise, the preliminary writ of prohibition is now made permanent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On August 31, 2015, Martinez, a Kansas resident, alleges he was working at an apartment complex in Overland Park, Kansas. He was electrocuted and seriously injured when he touched a ladder that had become charged due to arcing from or contact with an overhead power line. On August 25, 2017, Martinez filed a lawsuit for damages in the circuit court of Jackson County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Martinez alleges Relators \"owned and/or controlled and/or maintained\" the Kansas property on which he was injured and, therefore, are liable to him under various theories including premises liability. Relators\n   are Kansas business entities,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   with Kansas employees, and their principal places of business are in Kansas. Nevertheless, Martinez claims Peterson Properties has been registered to do business in Missouri since 1979, that it has solicited business here during that period, that it has filed (unrelated) lawsuits in this state, and that it owns (unrelated) rental property here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Martinez also named as a defendant J.A. Peterson Enterprises, Inc. (\"Peterson Enterprises\"). Peterson Enterprises is a Missouri corporation, it is the managing member of Cedar Crest, and it owns (through a subsidiary) Peterson Properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Relators filed a motion to dismiss on the ground the circuit court lacked personal jurisdiction over them. Respondent overruled Relators' motion. Relators sought - and were denied - a writ of prohibition in the court of appeals and now petition this Court for the same relief. This Court has the authority to issue and determine original remedial writs, Mo. Const. art.

As a result, the traditional bases for general jurisdiction are lacking. Nevertheless, Martinez argues Relators are \"at home\" in Missouri to such an extent that they are subject to the general jurisdiction of Missouri courts, i.e., that Relators can be sued in this state by anyone on any claim no matter where or how such claims arose. In support of this argument, Martinez claims Relators have had \"systematic and continuous\" contacts in Missouri because one or both Relators is registered to do business here, has solicited business here, has filed (unrelated) lawsuits in this state, and owns rental property here. But these are typical contacts of a non-resident corporation. As such, they fall far, far short of establishing the \"exceptional case\" for general jurisdiction over a non-resident corporation that is \"at home\" in Missouri.\n   <em>\n    Daimler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12700978\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/571/117/#p121\">\n    571 U.S. at 126-27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12700978,12585500\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/746/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Norfolk\n   </em>\n   , this Court held a railway company that owned some 400 miles of track, generated approximately $232 million in yearly revenue, and employed some 590 people in Missouri was not \"essentially at home\" in Missouri.\n   <em>\n    Norfolk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12371829\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/512/41/#p45\">\n    512 S.W.3d at 47-48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Martinez claims Peterson Enterprises is the (indirect) owner of Peterson Properties and the managing member of Cedar Crest and, in those roles, \"makes business decisions\" for both Relators. In essence, Martinez argues that - because Peterson Enterprises is a Missouri corporation and Relators are, as a practical matter, mere extensions of Peterson Enterprises - Relators should be subject to general jurisdiction (as Peterson Enterprises is) and specific jurisdiction (as Martinez's claims ultimately arise out of decisions Peterson Enterprises made or should have made).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"A corporation can act only through its agents.\"\n   <em>\n    Piatt v.

As noted above, in a proper case, the Missouri contacts of an agent can be imputed to an out-of-state principal for purposes of determining whether Missouri courts have general or specific jurisdiction over that out-of-state principal. But that is not the argument Martinez is making. Instead, Martinez would have this Court impute the Missouri contacts of the principal (Peterson Enterprises) to its out-of-state agents (Relators) for purposes of determining whether Missouri courts have general or specific jurisdiction over those out-of-state agents. Martinez offers no support for this novel argument, and the Court declines to adopt it here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In sum, this Court declines to hold that Relators are subject to personal jurisdiction in Missouri courts merely because their corporate parent or managing member is domiciled here.

Accordingly, I concur in the principal opinion to make the writ permanent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Martinez argues Cedar Crest is a \"citizen of Missouri\" because it is a limited liability company (\"LLC\") and, for purposes of determining federal diversity jurisdiction, the citizenship of an LLC is determined by the citizenship of each of its members. Diversity jurisdiction is a topic peculiar to the subject matter jurisdiction of the federal courts. Martinez offers no support for his assertion that the membership of an LLC has any bearing on the question of whether a state court can assert personal jurisdiction over the LLC itself, and the Court rejects this argument.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    In seeking to establish specific jurisdiction, Martinez invokes the hoary notion of \"purposeful availment,\" i.e., that Relators (particularly Cedar Crest) utilized Missouri courts in the past by filing unrelated lawsuits and, so, should expect to be hailed into Missouri courts to defend Martinez's claims. To be sure, \"purposeful availment\" traditionally has been referred to in the context of specific jurisdiction,\n    <em>\n     see, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Goodyear\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450505,4332867\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/915/\">\n     564 U.S. at 924\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450505,4332867\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/915/\">\n     131 S.Ct. 2846\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , but there is considerable doubt as to what relevance - if any - this concept retains in light of\n    <em>\n     Bristol-Myers Squibb\n    </em>\n    . There, the majority of the Supreme Court - over Justice Sotomayor's lone dissent - conspicuously omitted any discussion of \"purposeful availment\" in its specific jurisdiction analysis.\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Bristol-Myers Squibb\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604783\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1773/#p1780\">\n     137 S.

Even if the light of \"purposeful availment\" has not yet been fully extinguished, there can be no question that every assertion of specific jurisdiction must rest upon a showing that: (1) the defendant had at least one contact with the forum state, and (2) the claim being asserted against that defendant arose out of that contact.\n    <em>\n     Bristol-Myers Squibb\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604783\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1773/#p1780\">\n     137 S.

A court evaluates personal jurisdiction by considering the allegations contained in the pleadings to determine whether, if taken as true, they establish facts adequate to invoke Missouri's long-arm statute and support a finding of minimum contacts with Missouri sufficient to satisfy due process.\n    <em>\n     Angoff v.

When the defendant contests personal jurisdiction, however, it is the plaintiff who bears the burden of establishing the defendant's contacts with the forum state are sufficient.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11119702\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/39/483/#p487\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11119702\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/39/483/#p487\">\n     at 486\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Thus, when the defendant presents evidence refuting personal jurisdiction, the plaintiff must respond with contrary evidence or otherwise refute the evidence presented by the defendant as opposed to merely relying on his or her pleadings.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Chromalloy Am. Corp.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11890197\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/955/1/#p5\">\n     955 S.W.2d at 3-4\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Here, Relators contested personal jurisdiction and presented the affidavit of James Peterson, the president of Peterson Properties and Peterson Enterprises, in support of that challenge. Because Relators set forth evidence contesting personal jurisdiction, Martinez cannot rely solely on his pleadings.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11890197\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/955/1/#p5\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    But, even if he could, Martinez's pleadings do not assist him because he fails to allege facts in support of personal jurisdiction over Relators. Martinez alleges mere boilerplate allegations and legal conclusions (e.g., \"Defendants conduct business within the State of Missouri, make contracts within the State of Missouri, make contracts with citizens of the State of Missouri, and/or solicit customers in and from Missouri, constituting the transaction of business in Missouri.\"). Notwithstanding that these statements make no allegations regarding Relators individually - but instead refer to \"Defendants\" as a whole, which include various Missouri corporations and residents as well as Relators, Kansas business entities - Martinez's pleadings fail as a matter of law to establish personal jurisdiction. Accordingly, Martinez is not entitled to jurisdiction-related discovery.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    While Martinez specifically does not refer to the concept of jurisdictional piercing the corporate veil, I believe it is clear he presented written and oral arguments in support of this concept to reach jurisdiction in Missouri.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Although this concept has not been applied in Missouri, this Court is not precluded from discussing it when the parties present the concept to this Court in their analysis and argument.
