Appellant complains of the use of propensity evidence without independent proof of the\n   <em>\n    corpus delicti\n   </em>\n   as to that offense. Finding no merit to that or Appellant's other points,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   we affirm the convictions and judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Appellant lived with Victim and her family. While Victim's mother worked, Appellant babysat Victim, her younger sister,\n   and Victim's friend A.K. When Victim disclosed that Appellant had licked her butt and vagina, Mother contacted police and A.K.'s mother. Appellant was arrested and charged with sex crimes against all three children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The state filed a pretrial motion to admit the children's forensic-interview statements. The court held a \u00a7 491.075 hearing, found the statements provided sufficient indicia of reliability, and granted the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The day before trial, the state opted to drop the charges related to A.K. and Victim's sister and proceed only on those involving Victim (child molestation, statutory rape, and four counts of statutory sodomy). The state also filed notice of intent to admit Appellant's admission to an uncharged sex act against A.K. as propensity evidence pursuant to Missouri Constitution Article 1, \u00a7 18(c) (\"\u00a7 18(c)\"). Over Appellant's objection, the court indicated that it would allow the propensity evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The evidence at trial included, but was not limited to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 A forensic interview in which Victim described a variety of sexual abuses Appellant committed against her as well as a brief disclosure that Appellant made A.K. hold Appellant's penis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 Police interviews in which Appellant admitted all sex acts Victim had disclosed except the rape, and hand-to-genital contact with A.K.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 Test results indicating Appellant's DNA inside the crotch area of Victim's underwear.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 Rebuttal testimony from a Children's Division investigator that Appellant confessed hand-to-genital contact with Victim and A.K.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Appellant contended that his confessions were coerced and that Victim lied or was induced to say what she did. In support, he called his mother, his mother's roommate, and his sister to testify.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked each of those witnesses whether she was aware that Appellant had confessed to sex acts with Victim and A.K.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Appellant's Complaints\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Appellant alleges error in admitting his confession regarding A.K. because (1) the state did not independently prove the\n   <em>\n    corpus delicti\n   </em>\n   of that offense, and (2) the prejudicial effect of such evidence allegedly outweighed its probity. Like other claims of evidentiary error, we review for abuse of discretion and will not disturb the ruling unless it clearly was against the logic of the circumstances.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     State v.

The court may exclude relevant evidence of prior criminal\n   acts if the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Appellant urges that the\n   <em>\n    corpus delicti\n   </em>\n   rule should be extended to apply to admission of \u00a7 18(c) evidence \"[g]iven the inherently highly prejudicial nature of propensity evidence.\" The\n   <em>\n    corpus delicti\n   </em>\n   rule traces back to English common law and reflects the prosecution's burden to prove \"a crime was committed by\n   <em>\n    someone,\n   </em>\n   independent from a defendant's extrajudicial statements.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     State v.

Norris had objected \"on the basis that there was no independent evidence of the\n   <em>\n    corpus delicti\n   </em>\n   of this prior act, because the only evidence of its occurrence was Norris's confession,\" but the trial court \"ruled that the\n   <em>\n    corpus delicti\n   </em>\n   rule does not apply to the admission of evidence of prior bad acts.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . at 911.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Ninth Circuit affirmed, interpreting Federal Rule of Evidence 414(a) from which \u00a7 18(c) borrows and concluding that \"the key to admissibility is relevance, and no independent evidence of the commission of the prior bad act is required.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1280372\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/428/907/\">\n    428 F.3d at 913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Rather,\n   <em>\n    corpus delicti\n   </em>\n   evidence is required only when a confession is the sole basis for a conviction.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We agree. Trial courts need not add a\n   <em>\n    corpus delicti\n   </em>\n   element to \u00a7 18(c), which addresses Appellant's concern about \"inherent\" prejudice by incorporating the balancing test for legal relevance.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Williams\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656629\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/548/275/#p287\">\n    548 S.W.3d at 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The A.K. incident passes that balancing test despite Appellant's contrary assertions. Appellant's admission regarding A.K. was probative given similarities to the charges involving Victim. The acts were similar, occurred in the same house, near in time, with children of similar age. Such correspondence tends to show Appellant's propensity to commit the charged crimes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Williams\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656629\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/548/275/#p287\">\n    548 S.W.3d at 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Williams\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   acknowledges, there was a danger of juror speculation that Appellant had escaped punishment regarding A.K. because there was no evidence that he had been convicted for that.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . at 290. Yet that is just one factor; others include the state's time spent or emphasis placed on the evidence and whether the prior bad act eclipses or is overshadowed by the charged crimes.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . at 290-91. Here, the state spent little time and placed relatively little emphasis\n   on the A.K. incident. By contrast, the charges and evidence related to Victim were numerous, graphic, and overshadowed the lone bad act involving A.K.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this evidence. Its probative value was not substantially outweighed by the minimal danger of unfair prejudice. See\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     id\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . at 292. We deny Appellant's point and affirm the judgment and convictions.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    No jurisprudential purpose would be served by addressing Appellant's other points here.
