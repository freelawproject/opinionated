On October 14, 2016, within the statute of limitations, Plaintiff filed a pro se complaint against West Tennessee Healthcare, Inc. and the Hospital (collectively \"Defendants\"). Plaintiff failed to attach a Certificate of Good Faith to his complaint.

Code Ann. \u00a7 29-26-122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, what we are considering is whether the Trial Court erred in finding and holding that Plaintiff demonstrated extraordinary cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Our Supreme Court has instructed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The proper way for a defendant to challenge a complaint's compliance with Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-121 and Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-122 is to file a Tennessee Rule of Procedure 12.02 motion to dismiss. In the motion, the defendant should state how the plaintiff has failed to comply with the statutory requirements by referencing specific omissions in the complaint and/or by submitting affidavits or other proof. Once the defendant makes a properly supported motion under this rule, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show either that it complied with the statutes or that it had extraordinary cause for failing to do so. Based on the complaint and any other relevant evidence submitted by the parties, the trial court must determine whether the plaintiff has complied with the statutes. If the trial court determines that the plaintiff has not complied with the statutes, then the trial court may consider whether the plaintiff has demonstrated extraordinary cause for its noncompliance. If the defendant prevails and the complaint is dismissed, the plaintiff is entitled to an appeal of right under Tennessee Rule of Appellate Procedure 3 using the standards of review in Tennessee Rule of Appellate Procedure 13. If the plaintiff prevails, the defendant may pursue an interlocutory appeal under either Tennessee Rule of Appellate Procedure 9 or 10 using the same standards.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Because the trial court's denial of the Defendants' motion involves a question of law, our review is de novo with no presumption of correctness.\n   <em>\n    Graham v.

The question of whether [a plaintiff] has demonstrated extraordinary cause that would excuse compliance with the statutes is a mixed question of law and fact, and our review of that determination is de novo with a presumption of correctness applying only to the trial court's findings of fact and not to the legal effect of those findings.\n   <em>\n    Starr v.

We review the trial court's decision to excuse compliance under an abuse of discretion standard. \"A court abuses its discretion when it applies an incorrect legal standard or its decision is illogical or unreasonable, is based on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence, or utilizes reasoning that results in an injustice to the complaining party.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilson v.

The statute does not define \"extraordinary cause,\" and the statute's legislative history does not indicate that the legislature intended to assign a meaning to that phrase other than its plain and ordinary meaning. \"Extraordinary\" is commonly defined as \"going far beyond the ordinary degree, measure, limit, etc.; very unusual; exceptional; remarkable.\"\n   <em>\n    Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language\n   </em>\n   , 516 (1966);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

One legal scholar, commenting on Tennessee Code Annotated sections 29-26-121 and 122, has noted that possible examples of \"extraordinary cause\" might include \"illness of the plaintiff's lawyer, a death in that lawyer's immediate family, [or] illness or death of the plaintiff's expert in the days before the filing became necessary.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7119953\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/382/300/#p307\">\n    382 S.W.3d at 310-11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Trial Court found that Plaintiff had demonstrated extraordinary cause to excuse his failure to comply with both of the statutory sections by showing that Plaintiff's prior legal counsel had terminated the representation a few weeks before the expiration of the statute of limitations.

Defendants also point out that that hiring an attorney just before the running of the statute of limitations and claimed ignorance of the law both have been held to be insufficient to constitute extraordinary cause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cude v.

Thus, Defendants are asserting that the fact that Plaintiff was pro se, had insufficient time to provide proper pre-suit notice after his prior attorney terminated representation, and was ignorant of the law are all insufficient to constitute extraordinary cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We find the case now before us on appeal to be distinguishable from the cases discussed above. This is not a situation wherein Plaintiff was proceeding pro se the entire time and simply was ignorant of the law. The record now before us on appeal reveals, as found by the Trial Court, that Plaintiff hired an attorney to handle his suit well before the expiration of the statute of limitations. The record further reveals that Plaintiff's prior counsel then terminated the representation only a few weeks before the expiration of the statute of limitations. This left Plaintiff, who until that time reasonably had expected to be represented by and to rely on counsel, in the unenviable position of either attempting to hire new counsel within a very tight timeframe, filing his suit pro se, or losing his cause of action. Plaintiff chose to file pro se in an attempt to protect his cause of action. He then was able to hire new counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We agree with the Trial Court's assertion that the \"Healthcare Liability Act did not contemplate a party, who had hired a lawyer to handle the technical aspects of an action, having to learn the Healthcare Liability Act in two (2) weeks....\" We find that the situation in the case now before us is more akin to a situation wherein a lawyer dies \"in the days before the filing became necessary,\" leaving a client suddenly unrepresented just prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7119953\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/382/300/#p307\">\n    382 S.W.3d at 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We find no abuse of discretion by the Trial Court, and we agree with the Trial Court's determination that termination of representation by Plaintiff's prior legal counsel a few weeks prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations does constitute the type of extraordinary cause contemplated by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2029-26-121\">\n    Tenn.
