Veach argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at his commitment trial because counsel failed to (1) investigate her theory of defense and (2) object to the testimony of a psychologist about the results of two tests. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, a memorandum explaining the reasons for the decision has been provided to the parties. The judgment is affirmed. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
