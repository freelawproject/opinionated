It complains on appeal that the New Jersey court should not have entered the judgment at issue because it did not have personal jurisdiction over Operational Solutions. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, a memorandum has been provided to the parties. The judgment is affirmed. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
