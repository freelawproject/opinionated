LAMBERT\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The Cabinet for Health and Family Services (hereinafter Cabinet) seeks reversal of the Court of Appeals, which held that the Campbell Family Court erred in declining to conduct a Special Immigrant Juvenile (hereinafter SIJ) hearing at the disposition phase of a dependency, neglect and abuse case regarding N.M.D.J. (hereafter N.), an unaccompanied Guatemalan child. After thorough review, we reverse the Court of Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   N. was born in Guatemala in 2001 and will turn eighteen in July 2019. She is now the mother of two infant children, having one child born in 2017 in Arizona and one child born in 2018 in Kentucky. Only N.'s case is before us. It is believed that her biological parents remain in Guatemala. They did not participate directly in the dependency case filed below but were appointed counsel. N. was also appointed counsel but neither her counsel, nor the counsel for the parents have participated in the appellate process. N.B.D. is the mother of N.'s boyfriend (M.). M. is likewise a minor and the father of N.'s two children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   N.B.D., an adult resident of Newport, Kentucky, filed a dependency petition in the Campbell County Family Court (the petition was signed June 20, 2017, but not filed until August 16, 2017) alleging the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   N. is an unaccompanied minor from Guatemala who is in removal proceedings with DHS\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   . She was released to her cousin's custody. The cousin lives out of state. N. had a child on January 24, 2017. Her cousin made her pay for\n   everything for her and the child. My son, M., is the father of the child. N. could not pay to live with her cousin and she came here to live with me and my son. She is afraid to return to Guatemala. She and M. were on vacation in Mexico when they were kidnapped. The kidnappers held them in a house. There was a lot of blood in the house. I paid $3000 for their release. When they released them, they put covers on their heads and took them to the U.S. border and told them not to return to Guatemala. They had both M. and N.'s (Petition ends abruptly at this point).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As N.B.D. requested, temporary custody of N. was placed with her at the first court appearance. The Court also ordered the Cabinet to become involved to offer services to N. After a couple of pretrial appearances, an adjudication hearing was set for December 20, 2017. At the end of the adjudication hearing, the court found that the child was dependent as there was no legal custodian present and set the disposition hearing for January 31, 2018. Meanwhile, N. gave birth to her second child on January 4, 2018. Two days prior to the disposition hearing, N.B.D.'s counsel filed a motion to continue the case, incorrectly alleging that the newborn was premature and that the child remained in the hospital. Counsel also stated that two experts had been retained to testify about the dangers to N. if she returned to Guatemala; and that additional time was needed by counsel to permit the experts to interview N. and \"form an opinion.\" The Cabinet objected to a continuance and the Court overruled the motion, conducted the dispositional hearing, and adopted the recommendations of the Cabinet to continue custody of N. with N.B.D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In addition to completing the standard form order and docket sheet, Judge Woeste entered a separate five-page order addressing his findings in more detail, including the fact that U.S. immigration authorities had detained both N. and M. in Arizona, and had temporarily placed them with a cousin in Arizona pending the immigration proceedings. He noted that N. and M. subsequently ran from that federal immigration placement to the home of N.B.D. The Court also noted that N. had testified that she had come from Guatemala with M. and while they were traveling through Mexico, they were kidnapped by a gang.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Court then addressed the motion for a continuance, the request for the SIJ special findings, and the limits of its own jurisdiction to make SIJ findings. The Court overruled the motion for a continuance because it was the Court's opinion that the testimony of experts regarding N.'s home country would not be relevant as the child was to stay in Kentucky in the custody of N.B.D., and therefore it was without the jurisdictional authority to undertake SIJ findings because such findings were not relevant to the core dependency, neglect, and abuse issues before the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Jurisdiction of Kentucky Courts in Dependency, Neglect and Abuse Cases\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Here, N. met the first of the dependency and placement requirements, but the Court found that it did not have the authority under state statutes to make the requested additional SIJ findings. The Family Court has jurisdiction via KRS\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   23A.100(2)(c) and KRS 620\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   to handle dependency, neglect and abuse actions and to make findings as to the best interest of the child. Clearly, N., as an unaccompanied minor child, whose parents are believed to be residents of Guatemala, is a dependent child and is entitled to the protection and care of the Commonwealth of Kentucky via KRS Chapter 23A.100. The ultimate question presented here is whether the Family Court must make additional findings relevant to the child's SIJ classification, upon request, in every such case. We hold that the courts of Kentucky are not required to make additional findings related to SIJ classification unless the court first determines that the evidence to be gleaned from such a supplemental hearing is relevant to the child's best interests. We agree with the family courts' assessment of the jurisdictional statutes and agree that our General Assembly has not specifically directed Kentucky's courts to make SIJ findings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Some state courts have held that their jurisdiction was sufficient without the legislature enacting more specific statutes addressing SIJ classification findings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   We agree with the findings of Judge Woeste that \"[s]uch a hearing is unnecessary where the Court has found that the child is dependent and that the present custodial arrangements are appropriate to serve the best interests of the child.\" However, we hold that under proper circumstances, where such a placement of the child back into the country where he or she was abused, neglected or abandoned is being considered by the state court, the courts of Kentucky are empowered under KRS 620.023 and other statutes which grant authority to determine custody or placement of a child, to make additional findings to determine whether it would be in the child's best interest to return to his or her native country. In this case, where N.B.D. acknowledges in her initial petition that N. was \"in removal proceedings with DHS\" and the child's testimony confirms that she and M. ran from the Arizona home where they had been placed by immigration authorities, there are also grave concerns about the use of the juvenile process by N.B.D. to circumvent federal immigration law. The Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution prohibits states from resolving immigration hearings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, the proper place for such expert evidence in this case is not in any state court, but in federal immigration court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the Court of Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   All sitting.

But I must respectfully dissent from the majority's holding that our trial courts are not required to engage in SIJS factfinding. I fear the majority signals a reluctance on the part of our state courts in Kentucky to engage fully in the collaborative process established by federal law to protect the welfare of undocumented immigrant children. And this holding, in my view, subverts the overarching duty of our courts to guard the best interests of all children who come before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The United States Supreme Court \"has long made clear that federal law is as much the law of the several States as are the laws passed by their legislatures. Federal and state law 'together form one system of jurisprudence, which constitutes the law of the land for the State; and the courts of the two jurisdictions are not foreign to each other, nor to be treated by each other as such, but as courts of the same country, having jurisdiction partly different and partly concurrent.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The jurisdictions identified by the majority that require their state courts to engage in SIJS factfinding whenever an undocumented immigrant child is before them in a dependency, neglect, and abuse (\"DNA\") action, even in the absence of a state statutory mandate to do so, recognize the collaborative responsibility of their state courts to engage in SIJS factfinding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Federal law leaves to state courts the responsibility of deciding family law matters: \"The whole subject of the domestic relations of husband and wife, parent and child, belongs to the laws of the states, and not to the laws of the United States.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Recognizing the proficiency of state courts' handling of family law issues, while at the same time recognizing the proficiency of federal authorities' handling of immigrant issues, the federal government, in furtherance of the idea of cooperative federalism, has entrusted to state courts the duty to make certain preliminary findings that bear on an undocumented immigrant child's ability to seek custody in the care of an individual or entity in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   As the majority recognizes, the federal government has charged, but not mandated, state courts with making certain findings pertaining to an undocumented immigrant child's SIJS. \"Only once a state juvenile court has issued [the requisite] factual predicate order may the child, or someone acting on his or her behalf, petition the [USCIS] for SIJS.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"The process for obtaining SIJ status is 'a unique hybrid procedure that directs the collaboration of state and federal systems.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the Court of Appeals noted in the case at hand, without the requisite SIJS findings by a Kentucky court, undocumented immigrant children in Kentucky will be unable to proceed with an application for SIJS and may possibly face deportation. It is not an exaggeration to say that that child's \"immigration status hangs in the balance.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The requisite factual predicate to obtain SIJS is contained in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(27)(J) and 8 C.F.R. 204.11.

The trial court's only real option is to place the child in the custody of an individual or entity within the United States. And, because the trial court has engaged in explicit SIJS factfinding, it has ensured that the child can petition the federal government for SIJS without which the child would be subject to deportation. Deportation is-under this scenario-the exact situation that the trial court explicitly found would\n   not be in the child's best interests. The trial court has fulfilled its duty to dispose of the child's case according to that child's best interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In the second scenario, the trial court engages in SIJS factfinding, determining that it is in the child's best interest to be returned to the custody of his or her parents or native homeland. Although the trial court has determined that deportation is in the child's best interest, only the federal government has the power to ensure that deportation occurs. In this manner, the trial court has nevertheless fulfilled its responsibility to dispose of the case according to the child's best interest because it has supplied the federal government with the information it needs to deport the child, the exact situation that the trial court has determined would be in the child's best interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   A variation of the final scenario is the one presented to this Court in the case at hand. Here, as the majority notes, the trial court \"found that the child is dependent and that the present custodial arrangements are appropriate to serve the best interests of the child,\" the \"present custodial arrangements\" being the placement of the child in the custody of the child's boyfriend's mother here in Kentucky. Because the trial court concluded in this way, the trial court found engaging in SIJS factfinding to be \"unnecessary.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   But without the requisite SIJS factfinding that the trial court refused to engage in, this child cannot petition the federal government for SIJS to prevent deportation. This result is contrary to the trial court's conclusion that \"the present custodial arrangement[ ],\" i.e. custody in the hands of an individual in the U.S., is in the child's best interest. It is impossible for the trial court to assuredly say that it fulfilled its duty to dispose of the case in furtherance of the child's best interest because the family court not only allowed but created the risk of a different outcome for this child-deportation. And that outcome is directly contrary to the trial court's finding that placement of the child in the care of an individual or entity within the U.S. is in the child's best interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   To ensure compliance with the judiciary's duty to dispose of juvenile cases according to the child's best interest and to ensure that Kentucky does not shirk its duty in cooperative federalism, I would require Kentucky's courts always to engage in SIJS factfinding when an undocumented immigrant child is before the court in an action involving a custodial arrangement. I would affirm the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the trial court with instructions to engage in SIJS factfinding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Hughes, J. joins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Attachment\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER CORRECTING\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Opinion of the Court by Justice Lambert rendered June 13, 2019 is corrected and the attached opinion is hereby substituted in lieu of the original opinion.
