We cannot see that the plaintiff suffered any legal injury from the exercise of this discretion, independently of the question, which we do not here discuss, whether proof of his actually suffering severe pain could have any legitimate bearing, except upon the question of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
