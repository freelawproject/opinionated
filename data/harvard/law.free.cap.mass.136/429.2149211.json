Cain, the woman named in the indictment, applied to the defendant, who was a physician, informing him that she was about three months advanced in pregnancy, that she had been taking various drugs without effect, and wished him to prescribe for her; that he told her he did not think drugs alone would produce the desired effect; that, after a full consultation, he recommended and used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>an electric battery, applying one of the plates to her abdomen and the other to her back, while she was lying upon a lounge, this treatment being continued for about an hour and a half; that during the treatment he made an examination with a speculum, and, while so doing, he inserted through the speculum into her womb a sharp instrument; that, in addition, he also prescribed for her certain medicines or drugs, which she took away with her; and that all these methods of treatment were for the purpose of causing a miscarriage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-4\">The defendant objected to all the evidence offered, excepting that relating to the use of the instrument; but the judge admitted it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-5\">The government then offered evidence tending to show that, on November 22 and 27, said Cain went to the defendant\u2019s office; and that, on each of those occasions, the same treatment was used as on the first occasion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-6\">The defendant objected to this evidence; but the judge admitted it, and also the evidence above objected to, for the purpose of showing intent, and also the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the condition of pregnancy of Cain.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-7\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b450-8\"><em>N~.

Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AP1\">The indictment must be construed as alleging that the defendant unlawfully used an instrument with intent to procure the miscarriage of a woman named; and it sufficiently describes the instrument, and the manner in which the defendant used it. This is a sufficient description of the statutory offence of using an instrument with intent to procure thfe miscarriage of a woman.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-11\">The evidence objected to was clearly competent for the purpose for which it was admitted. Whether it was of acts which formed part of the principal transaction, or of acts of the defendant at other times, it tended to prove attempts of the defendant to procure the identical result the intent to procure which constituted the gist of the offence charged, \u2014 that is, to prove the intent which was charged in the indictment. Being competent to prove the crime charged, it is no objection that it also tended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>to prove other crimes. 3 Russ, on Crimes (5th ed.) 377 <em>&amp; seq.
