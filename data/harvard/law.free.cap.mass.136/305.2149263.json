Trial in the Superior Court, without a jury, before <em>Staples, </em>J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-7\">The plaintiff, in opening his case, stated that he relied upon the following facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-8\">By the St. of 1872, <em>o. </em>79, the defendant city was authorized to supply itself with water. Under this statute, the defendant laid distributing pipes through its streets, and from such pipes smaller service pipes were laid by the defendant to the residences of individuals, under an ordinance of the city providing therefor. The plaintiff, shortly after the laying of the main pipe in the street where he resided, applied under the ordinance for a service pipe to be laid from the main street pipe through his premises into his house, which was located near the street line. Thereupon the servants of the defendant made excavations, and laid the service pipe under the plaintiff\u2019s stone and iron fence, which was on the line of the street, and from the fence under the foundation wall of the plaintiff\u2019s house. The injury complained of was the settling and twisting of the fence and cellar wall, caused by the negligence of the defendant\u2019s servants in undermining the same while digging for and laying the service pipe. The plaintiff paid for all the expense of laying the service pipe beyond the street line, as provided in the ordinance. The plaintiff\u2019s premises, through which the service pipe was laid, were never taken by purchase or otherwise under the provisions of the statute, nor claimed nor used in any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>manner than as above stated. After the laying of' the service pipe, the plaintiff paid the defendant the established rates for the use of the water thus conveyed to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-4\">The defendant asked the judge to rule that, upon the above facts, this action could not be maintained, because the plaintiff\u2019s remedy was under the provisions of the St. of 1872, <em>c. </em>79, and was exclusive.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-5\">The judge so ruled; and ordered judgment for the defendant. The plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b326-6\"><em>J.

If any person or corporation sustaining damage as aforesaid cannot agree with said commissioners upon the amount of said damages, he may have them assessed and paid in the same manner as is provided by law with respect to land taken for highways.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b326-8\">C. Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AeqX\">The plaintiff in his opening, as well as in his declaration, stated that the injury of which he complains was caused by the negligence of the defendant\u2019s servants, and so brought his case directly within the authority of <em>Hand </em>v. <em>Brook</em>line, 126 Mass. 324, where the town was held liable for an injury to the plaintiff\u2019s property, through neglect in the construction of water-works which the town had been authorized by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>a special statute, voluntarily accepted, to construct and to receive profits from; and the case is distinguishable from one where the work was executed in a reasonably proper and skilful manner, as in <em>Hull </em>v. Westfield, 133 Mass. 433, in which case the damage can be recovered only in the manner pointed out by the statute. The St. of 1872, <em>c. </em>79, under which the defendant acted, resembled that involved in <em>Hand </em>v. <em>Brookline </em>in all the particulars mentioned or material to be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
