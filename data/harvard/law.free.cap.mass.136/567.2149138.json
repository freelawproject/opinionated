Sts. <em>c. </em>85. The record of that court showed that the respondent, who was arrested upon a warrant duly issued, pleaded not guilty, and waived an examination, and was thereupon ordered by the court to give bond to the complainant, with sufficient sureties, in the sum of $400, for his appearance before the next term of the Superior Court holden for the transaction of civil business; and thereupon the respondent gave the bond required.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-9\">In the Superior Court, the respondent moved to dismiss the complaint, because there was no hearing of the case in the Police Court, as required by the Pub. Sts. <em>c. </em>85, \u00a7 9, before the bond was ordered to be given. <em>Barker, </em>J., overruled the motion; and, after a verdict of guilty, reported the case for the determination of this court. If the ruling was correct, the case was to stand for further hearing in the Superior Court; otherwise, the complaint to be dismissed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b587-10\"><em>J.
