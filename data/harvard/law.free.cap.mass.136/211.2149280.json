Fairbank $400, to enable him to buy a stock of canned goods, and took a promissory note, and a mortgage on the stock as security for the debt; that Fairbank took one O\u2019Hara into partnership with him, and, prior to July 5, 1881, the new firm, desiring money with which to buy materials and to pay the expenses of the business, applied to the plaintiff therefor, and he agreed that, upon satisfactory security being given, he would advance money to the firm from time to time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>to enable it to carry on its <em>business; </em>that, on said July 5, both partners assumed the balance due on the note, and the plaintiff lent them an additional sum, and it was agreed that the old note and mortgage should be delivered up, which was done, and a new agreement was drawn up, by which the plaintiff was to hold the stock of the firm as security for his advances, which agreement the plaintiff refused to accept; that Fairbank then assigned, as security, a policy of insurance on his life to the plaintiff; that thereafter, from time to time, between that day and September 2, 1881, the plaintiff advanced to the firm further sums, amounting in all to $978; and, not being satisfied with the security, caused the following agreement to be drawn up, which was executed by Fairbank and by O\u2019Hara:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-4\">\u201c Memoranda of an agreement made and entered into this second day of September, A. d. 1881, by and between Levi Wilson, of Uxbridge, county of Worcester, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, of the one part, and A.

He caused the stock at Pleasant Street to be moved to the Summer Street store, and put in there with the other stock of the same general character and description, where it remained until the service of the writ in this case, upon which the whole stock in the Summer Street store on February 27 was on that day taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-5\">Fairbank and O\u2019Hara appeared as witnesses for the defendant, and denied the foregoing evidence relating to Wilson\u2019s taking possession. There was evidence that, at the time the defendant attached the goods, he asked for the key of the Pleasant Street store, and it was given to him by the attorney of Fairbank and O\u2019Hara, the latter making no objection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-6\">The only question submitted to the jury was whether actual possession was taken by the plaintiff of the stock in the Pleasant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>Street store on February 20, and thereafter kept by him till the stock was taken by the defendant on his writ of attachment, which question the jury answered in the affirmative; and the judge thereupon directed a verdict for the plaintiff for such portion of the property taken as was manufactured from materials bought with money advanced by the plaintiff after September 2, 1881, irrespective of the store which they were in, and also such portion as was taken possession of by the plaintiff in the Pleasant Street store, not included in the foregoing category, and for the defendant as to the remainder.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-4\">The jury returned a verdict accordingly; and both parties alleged exceptions to certain rulings and refusals to rule, which appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b235-5\"><em>W.

Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3r\">The first request by the plaintiff for instructions to the jury, and the first request by the defendant, related to the same subject, namely, the rights of the plaintiff under the contract, irrespective of possession taken by him. The plaintiff asked the court to rule that, by the terms of the agreement, he was entitled to all the stock in trade, without possession thereof. The defendant, on the other hand, asked for a ruling that the plaintiff, in order to establish a title to any portion of the goods, must prove that he took possession of such goods, and retained the same. We are of opinion that the jury should have been instructed according to the request of the defendant. Prior to the agreement of September 2, the original mortgage to the plaintiff had been given up, and no new written agreement and no distinct and completed oral agreement had been entered into. The plaintiff\u2019s title therefore depended solely on the agreement of September 2, under which the stock in trade was not to be his property till the process of canning and preparing for market should be completed. It does not appear to have been understood by the parties that the plaintiff should furnish the entire capital employed. The money advanced by him was treated as a loan, for the purpose .of enabling the firm to purchase fruit, vegetables, &amp;c., and the firm with the aid of this money was to go on and prepare the articles, and, after this had been done, a change of title was to be effected by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>giving a bill of sale to the plaintiff, or by his taking possession, and until the giving of such bill of sale, or such taking of possession, the title would remain in the firm. <em>Chase </em>v. Denny, 130 Mass. 566. <em>Moody </em>v. Wright, 13 Met. 17, 32. On this point, therefore, the plaintiff\u2019s exception must be overruled, and the defendant\u2019s exception sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">The plaintiff also asked the court to rule that there was evidence which would authorize the jury to find that the possession taken by him, as shown by his bill of exceptions, applied to the stock in the Summer Street store, as well as to that in the Pleasant Street store; and this instruction we think ought to have been given. It was not necessary to take an actual manual possession of every article. Possession, like delivery, may be of a part for the whole. The written agreement applied to the whole stock of goods, wherever it might be, and the plaintiff\u2019s right to take possession of the whole stock remained the same after the removal of the principal portion of the goods into the new store. Since it was not necessary for the plaintiff to take actual possession of all the goods in detail, it could not be held, as matter of law, upon the evidence, that his act of taking possession of the bulk of them under his. agreement was not intended by him to apply to all the stock in trade which he was entitled to take possession of, or that his act was not so accepted by O\u2019Hara. If the plaintiff went to the Pleasant Street store for the purpose of taking possession, and there, in the presence of both partners, said that under the agreement he had a right to take possession and did take possession, and that Fairbank could not sell any more; and if he put O\u2019Hara in as keeper, with directions as stated in the bill of exceptions, and if by this he intended to exercise all his right of taking possession under the agreement, and to put O\u2019Hara in as keeper of all the goods covered by the agreement, wherever they might be, and if O\u2019Hara accepted the trust, \u2014 it cannot be said, as matter of law, that there was no evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s taking possession of the goods in the Summer Street store. <em>Shurtleff </em>v. <em>Willard, </em>19 Pick. 202, 210. It was a question for the jury to determine whether possession was taken of a part for the whole. <em>Phelps </em>v. Cutler, 4 Gray, 137. <em>Ingalls </em>v. Herrick, 108 Mass. 351, 354. <em>Pratt </em>v. Chase, 40 Maine, 269. The plaintiff\u2019s exception on this point is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>In reply to the plaintiff\u2019s third request for instructions, the court ruled that there was no evidence to go to the jury of a mm mingling of the goods by the defendant. The bill of exceptions discloses no facts which show that this ruling was wrong. The court further ruled that the plaintiff could only recover, so far as depended on the question of possession, what he could show was in the Pleasant Street store, and in his actual possession. This ruling would require modification, as already indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">The defendant requested a ruling, that if O\u2019Hara, having been appointed keeper by the plaintiff, voluntarily allowed the defendant to take possession of the goods under the attachment, or subsequently as messenger in insolvency, and made no claim that he was holding them for the plaintiff when the defendant took possession, it would be a failure of continuity of possession which would be fatal to the plaintiff\u2019s title. This request was properly refused. The plaintiff, by taking possession, fixed his rights, which were not defeated by the act or omission of O\u2019Hara. The defendant took the goods by virtue of his precepts. Until he did so, the plaintiff\u2019s rights continued. By his act, the plaintiff\u2019s rights were infringed.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
