The case was submitted to the Superior Court, and, after judgment for the plaintiff, to this court on appeal, upon agreed facts, in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-10\">On September 1, 1880, the plaintiff, at the defendant\u2019s request, indorsed, before delivery, a promissory note for $350, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>made by the defendant, and payable to the order of Charles Wood, on demand. This note was subsequently delivered by the defendant for value to Wood, and is now outstanding in Wood\u2019s hands, unpaid, l\u00edo demand thereon has been made upon the plaintiff or the defendant; and interest, which was payable semiannually, is overdue thereon. Contemporaneously with said indorsement, and as collateral security against loss on account thereof, and for no other consideration between the parties, the defendant executed and delivered to the plaintiff the note declared on. The defendant is resident in California, and has no attachable property other than a legacy in the hands of an executor summoned as trustee in the present action.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b238-4\"><em>B.

And in <em>Moseley </em>v. <em>Ames, </em>5 Allen, 163, it was held that a note executed and delivered as collateral security for a guaranty entered into by the payee, upon which he was still responsible, might be proved by him against the insolvent estate of the maker.
