The defendant, in support of his motion to quash, relies only upon the omission to state the place of the larceny in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">\u201c The offence of receiving stolen property is a substantive crime in itself, and not merely accessorial to the principal of-fence of larceny.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Barry, 116 Mass. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">It is well settled that, in an indictment for the substantive offence of receiving, it is not necessary to state the place of the larceny. 2 East, P. C. <em>c. </em>16, \u00a7 163. Stark. Crim. Pl 169. <em>Holford </em>v. <em>State, </em>2 Blackf. 103. The forms of indictment for this offence in common use do not state the place of the larceny. Archb. Crim. Pl. &amp; Ev. (19th ed.) 472. Heard Crim.Law (2d ed.) 616.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">The defendant urges as an argument for stating the place of the larceny in the indictment, that goods stolen in a foreign country would be stolen goods, though the thief, if he brought them here, could not be convicted here.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-13\">But an indictment for larceny, under such circumstances, would usually charge the larceny to have been committed here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>where the thief had the goods in his possession, and whether he had them under such circumstances as to render him liable to conviction would only arise on the evidence; and, on an indictment for receiving, the question whether the goods were stolen goods, within the meaning of the statute, would be raised in the same way.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b191-4\"><em>J.
