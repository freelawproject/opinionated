Writ dated January 6, 1882. Answer, the statute of limitations. Trial in the Superior Court, before Knowlton, J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-7\">The defendant\u2019s testatrix died December 13, 1880, and the defendant was appointed on January 3, 1881, administrator, with the will annexed, of her estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-8\">It appeared in evidence that the plaintiff and his son, Charles H. Parker, doing business as copartners under the name of Charles G. Parker &amp; Son, sold to the defendant\u2019s testatrix groceries, at sundry times between December 3, 1872, and June, 1874, amounting to $170.62, which were charged to her in an account, and received from her cash payments from time to time, with which she was credited upon the account, amounting to $82.39.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-9\">The plaintiff testified, and his evidence was not contradicted or objected to, that on June 19, 1874, his copartnership was dissolved, said account then remaining unsettled; that the plaintiff bought his son\u2019s interest in the business, and continued to carry it on in the same place, and became the sole owner of his son\u2019s interest in said account; that, immediately afterward, the defendant\u2019s testatrix sought continued credit of the plaintiff, who declined to sell her goods, or to give her further credit, unless she would agree to pay him said account, and let her account run along as an open mutual account, the same as it was with the copartnership; that she did so agree, and that thereupon, relying upon and in consideration of her agreement, he sold her' goods on credit from time to time up to January 8, 1875, charging them to her on account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>It was agreed that she made no payment after the dissolution of the copartnership; and there was no other evidence bearing upon the question of the statute of limitations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-4\">The plaintiff contended, upon this evidence, that the jury might find that there was a mutual and open account current between the plaintiff and the defendant\u2019s testatrix, which would take the case out of the statute of limitations; but the judge ruled that the plaintiff could only recover so much of the account as accrued within six years and thirty days prior to the death of the defendant\u2019s testatrix.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-5\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $14.23; and he alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b51-6\"><em>W. A. die, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b51-7\"><em>B.

Sts. <em>c. </em>155, \u00a7 5. The plaintiff had an account for goods sold and delivered to her, upon which she had merely made payments, which were immediately applied in reduction of the account. She had no account against him, upon which she had a right of action, or which could be filed in set-off. There was no mutuality in the account. <em>Ingram </em>v. Sherard, 17 S. &amp; R. 347. <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>85 Penn. St. 209. <em>Green </em>v. <em>Disbrow, </em>79 N. Y. 1. <em>Dyer </em>v. Walker, 51 Maine, 104. <em>Webster </em>v. Byrnes, 32 Md. 86. <em>Prenatt v. Runyon, </em>12 Ind. 174. Angell on Limitations, \u00a7\u00a7 143-145. Each payment would, of coui-se, have the effect of a payment, in taking the account upon which it was made out of the statute of limitations. We do not intend to decide that items of money may not as well be proper items of charge, in a \u201c mutual and open account current,\u201d and have the same effect as items of merchandise; but only that they do not have that effect when they are strictly payments. See <em>Dickinson </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>11 Cush. 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">The precise question raised in the case at bar does not appear to have been decided in this Commonwealth. We are aware of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>no decision in conflict with the conclusion at which we have arrived, although in <em>Penniman </em>v. <em>Rotch, </em>3 Met. 216, there are some dicta which appear to indicate a different view.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">If it can be contended, on the evidence, that the parties agreed that the account should be a \u201cmutual and open account current,\u201d it was not competent for them, by an oral agreement at least, to bring within the statutory exception an account which was not in fact within it. It would be similar to an agreement that a payment had been made, in order to take a debt out of the statute, when it had not been made in fact. <em>Blanchard </em>v. <em>Blanchard, </em>122 Mass. 558.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">It was perfectly competent for the plaintiff to show the agreement with the testatrix, in order that he might maintain an action, in his name only, on an account, part of which had been due to him and his partner ; but its admission for this, purpose, without objection, did not authorize its use, as the plaintiff proposed to use it, for a different purpose, for which it was not competent.</p>\n<p id=\"Aoe\"><em>Exceptions </em>overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
