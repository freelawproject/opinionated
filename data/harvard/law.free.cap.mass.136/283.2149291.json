On May 1,1880, and on May 1, 1881, the corporation owned land with buildings thereon. At the former date, none of the buildings were occupied. At the latter date, some of the buildings were occupied by persons to whom the corporation had given bonds for deeds. The corporation had as far as practicable improved all its land, and assigned it and caused it to be occupied, as provided in its charter, and had made no other use of any of its land <em>Held, </em>that, even if the corporation was to be considered a benevolent or charitable institution, within the Gen.

The case was submitted to the Superior Court, and, after judgment for the defendant, to this court on appeal, upon agreed facts, in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-9\">The plaintiff is a corporation, chartered by the St. of 1880, <em>c. </em>195,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and, on May 1,1880, and May 1, 1881, was the owner of certain land, with buildings thereon, situated in Lynn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>On May 1, 1880, the buildings above mentioned were vacant; and on May 1, 1881, some of them were, with the land connected therewith, occupied by persons who had received bonds for deeds, and were paying for them as provided by the charter of the corporation; but no part of said real estate had been paid for in full by any of the occupants, nor had deeds of any of it been given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-4\">Only one of said occupants, William E. Stone, was ever a member of the corporation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-5\">The cost value of all the land belonging to the plaintiff in 1880 and 1881 was $869.68. The cost value of the land and buildings occupied as above stated in 1881 was $562.47, that of the portion occupied by Stone being $300.22. The plaintiff has, as fast as practicable, improved all its land, and assigned it and caused it to be occupied as provided by its charter; and it has made no other use of any of its land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-6\">Upon all the real estate aforesaid, the defendant assessed to the plaintiff a tax for the year 1880 of $17.60; and during the months of July and August, 1881, gave due notice of the sale of said real estate for non-payment of the tax, the tax having remained unpaid for more than fourteen days after having been duly demanded from the plaintiff by the defendant\u2019s collector of taxes. On August 22,1881, the plaintiff delivered to the defendant\u2019s collector of taxes a written protest against the assessment and collection of the tax, and thereupon paid to said collector the amount of said tax, together with interest, and the costs of advertising and notice, the whole amounting to $20.34.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>The defendant also assessed to the plaintiff upon all its real estate aforesaid a tax for the year 1881 of $18.27; and on May 18, 1882, the plaintiff delivered to the defendant\u2019s collector of taxes a written protest against the assessment and collection of the tax; and thereupon paid to said collector the amount of said tax, together with interest and the cost of a summons, the whole amounting to $19.39.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-3\">These assessments were valid, if said property was in said years taxable to the plaintiff, and was not by law exempt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-4\">If, upon the above facts and the true construction of the charter of the plaintiff corporation, the plaintiff was entitled to recover in this action the whole or any part of the money so paid, by reason of the exemption of said property, or any part thereof, from taxation, judgment was to be entered for the plaintiff for the sum of forty dollars; otherwise, judgment for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b305-5\"><em>W.

Sts. <em>c. </em>11, \u00a7 5, <em>cl. </em>3, we are of opinion that, if this question should be decided in the affirmative, its real estate was not occupied by it, or its officers, for the purposes for which it was incorporated, so as to be exempt from taxation under the provisions of that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">The real estate assessed was held by the plaintiff for the purpose of sale. It is not all the real estate owned by a corporation included in the statute that is exempt, but only such as is occupied in a particular way. In the Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>7, \u00a7 5, <em>cl. </em>2, relating to this subject, the language used is \u201c shall actually be occupied by them.\u201d The word \u201c actually \u201d was omitted in the General Statutes, without any apparent intention of changing the meaning. The word \u201coccupied\u201d in the statute is not used in the general sense in which a corporation or individual may be said to occupy their real estate when it is not occupied by any one else, but in the sense in which an incorporated college, academy, hospital, or like institution, occupies its college, academy, or hospital, and the lands and buildings connected therewith. That this was the intention of the Legislature is shown by the St. of 1878, c. 214, passed probably in consequence of the decision in <em>Trinity </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number><em>Church </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>118 Mass. 164, which provides that \u201c the real estate belonging to such institutions as are mentioned in the third division of section five of chapter eleven of the General Statutes, purchased with a view of removal thereto, shall not be exempt from taxation for a longer period than two years until such removal takes place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">The plaintiff is essentially a land company, and, although it is to make no profits, and is required to sell its houses and lots on such terms as may in some sense be deemed benevolent or charitable, it did not occupy the real estate assessed so as to entitle it to exemption from taxation. <em>Chapel of the Good Shepherd </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>120 Mass. 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>*</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b306-11\"> The St. of 1884, c. 184, provides that \u201c All property both real and personal held by the Lynn Workingmen\u2019s Aid Association, for the purposes and in accordance with the provision of the charter of said association, shall be exempt from taxation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
