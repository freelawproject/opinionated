The fact that the suit is brought for the benefit of a third person does not deprive the defendant of this right. Pub. Sts. <em>c. </em>167, \u00a7 49. <em>Harding </em>v. Noyes, 125 Mass. 572.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">In the case at bar, the defendant filed interrogatories to the plaintiff, which the plaintiff wholly neglected to answer; and, at December term, 1882, the Superior Court overruled the plaintiff\u2019s motion for further time to answer the interrogatories, and ordered a nonsuit to be entered. This was exclusively within the discretion of the Superior Court, and no exception can be taken to the exercise of that discretion. Pub. Sts. <em>c. </em>167, \u00a7 59. <em>Stern </em>v. Filene, 14 Allen, 9. <em>Harding </em>v. Noyes, <em>ubi supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-12\">In the present position of the case, the plaintiff\u2019s first bill of exceptions becomes immaterial. It is entirely clear that most of the interrogatories relate to facts material to the defence, and are such as the plaintiff was required to answer. If he objected to certain specific interrogatories, his proper course was to answer such as were pertinent, and take the judgment and ruling of the court upon such as he claimed to be impertinent. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>neglected to answer any of the Interrogatories, and for this neglect it was in the power of the Superior Court, in its discretion, to order a nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"ASc\">\n<em>JExcevtions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
