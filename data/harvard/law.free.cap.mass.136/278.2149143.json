M., while passing on the sidewalk on Lafayette Street, near Lagrange Street, she fell to the sidewalk, breaking her wrist and sustaining other severe injury, the fall being consequent upon the icy and slippery condition of the said sidewalk. She therefore respectfully asks that she may be compensated by the city for such damage and injury, and the expenses occasioned thereby.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-6\">The jury were directed to return a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b299-7\"><em>C. </em>Sewall, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b299-8\"><em>J.

Clinton, 133 Mass. 526. The notice states, as the cause of the injury, a fall \u201c consequent upon the icy and slippery condition of the said sidewalk.\u201d It is true that a sidewalk may be icy and slippery, without being defective. <em>Stanton </em>v. Springfield, 12 Allen, 566. It is equally true that the ice on a sidewalk may be in such form as, combined with its slipperiness, renders the way defective. <em>Luther </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>97 Mass. 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">It was not necessary that the notice should designate the cause of the injury as a defect; <em>Savory </em>v. <em>Haverhill, </em>132 Mass. 324; and it should not be construed with technical strictness. <em>Spellman </em>v. <em>Chicopee, </em>131 Mass. 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-12\">We are of opinion that the notice in this case called the attention of the city with sufficient distinctness to the cause relied upon to answer the purpose required; and that it was not necessary that it should state with such particularity the form of the ice as to show that it was necessarily a defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>The sufficiency of the notice as a condition precedent to maintaining the action, and the sufficiency of the defect to render the city liable, are distinct questions.</p>\n<p id=\"ABx4\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
