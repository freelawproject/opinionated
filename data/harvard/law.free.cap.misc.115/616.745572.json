Y. 401, that our statute declaring usurious instruments void is not repealed expressly or by implication by the Negotiable Instruments Law, so that a note void in its inception for usury is void in the hands of an innocent holder for value, the conclusion seems inevitable that the same rule applies to instruments or <em>\u201c </em>things in action \u201d which by another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>statute are declared to be \u201c utterly void.\u201d As the court said in the case cited (223 N. Y. 404): \u201cAn instrument which a statute, expressly or through necessary implication, declares void, strictly speaking, is a <em>simulacrum </em>only. It is without legal efficacy. It cannot obligate a party or support a right.\u201d Or as the judge writing the opinion of the court in the <em>Sabine </em>case says in a subsequent case <em>(Lipedes </em>v. <em>Liverpool &amp;. L. &amp; G. Ins. Co., </em>229 N. Y. 201, 209), \u201c it is a general rule of interpretation that contracts declared in terms void by statute because interdicted by law or by public policy are, in the correct and true meaning of the word, void. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Among the cases cited by our Court of Appeals in support of its decision in the <em>Sabine </em>case, is <em>Alexander &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Hazelrigg, </em>123 Ky. 677, wherein the Court of Appeals of Kentucky held that the statute of that-state making gaming contracts void, prevented a recovery by an innocent holder against the maker of, a note given in payment of a bet or wager upon the result of a horse race. A number of other cases decided in accordance with local statutes in different states are referred to by Williston in his work on Contracts (Vol. 3, \u00a7 1676, note), although the text writer states that <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>The tendency of the modern law in regard to instruments illegal because based bn a gambling consideration is to protect the holder in due course.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">\u2022 It follows that the judgment must be reversed, with thirty dollars costs and the complaint dismissed, with costs, with leave to respondent to appeal to thcAppellate ' Division, first department. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">\"Whitaker, J., concurs..</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">Judgment reversed, with thirty dollars costs. -</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
