Mencher, of counsel), for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b455-6\">Kahn &amp; Zorn (Louis Frankel, of counsel), for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b455-7\">Whitaker, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AgP\">This proceeding was brought by the respondent, Nathan Ravitz, to secure possession of the apartment in the building at No. 17 East Ninety-seventh street, Manhattan borough, New York city, known as apartment 2a, from the appellant, who is the present occupant.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Respondent relies upon chapter 942 of the Laws of 1920, to gain possession of the apartment and claims that the entire building is now owned by a corporation under the co-operative plan authorized by chapter 942, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">It appears from the record that the alleged cooperative corporation is merely a subterfuge to avoid the provisions of the statute as the requirements of the statute for such a co-operative corporation have not been complied with. The co-operative corporation alleged to exist here is not a bona fide organization; if so, it would be the landlord in this proceeding instead of the respondent, Ravitz.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">The respondent, Ravitz, is simply a stockholder in the alleged co-operative corporation; and Ravitz claims to attorn to the alleged co-operative corporation for the rent which he collects from the tenant, appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">Further proof that the co-operative corporation is not a bona fide organization is found by an examina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>tion of the other facts set forth in the record and the requirements of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">The statute requires that the property must be 1 \u2018 <em>in good faith </em>sold to a corporation formed under a \u25a0co-operative ownership plan whereof <em>the entire stock </em>shall be held by the stockholders in proportion to the number of rooms <em>occupied or to be occupied by them </em>in such building and all apartments and flats therein <em>have been leased to stockholders of such corporation for their own personal, exclusive and permanent occupancy to begin immediately </em>* *</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">There are twenty-nine apartments in this building.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Only five apartments are occupied by persons who own stock to cover them.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">There are two vacant apartments in the building, for which no leases have yet been issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">There are several cases of plural ownership of apartments, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">An outside corporation, Lapidus, Cohen &amp; Kaplan Co., owns stock covering three apartments.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">This respondent, Ravitz, owns stock covering two apartments, and has no lease on either one. All the stock on the two apartments is in his own name.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-12\">Two other stockholders also own two apartments each.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-13\">The by-laws of the alleged co-operative corporation forbid the sale of any stock without the consent of the directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-14\">It is clear that these stockholders who own more than one apartment cannot occupy more than one apartment at a time for their own <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>personal \u2019 \u2019 use; and it is equally clear that the corporation of Lapidus, Cohen &amp; Kaplan Co., which owns three apartments cannot occupy them all at once for <em>\u201c </em>personal \u201d use and for dwelling purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-15\">\u25a0 Persons and an outside corporation owning more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>than one apartment clearly do not want them for their own use but for speculation, which is what the statute seeks to avoid.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Of the two apartments owned by this respondent, Ravitz, one is occupied by this tenant-appellant, and the other apartment is sub-let by Ravitz to a Mrs. Crystal, as a monthly tenant, and she pays him the rent each month. Mrs. Crystal formerly paid $98 a month and her rent has been increased by respondent over $300 for the year; which rent and increase the respondent now collects. This is not <em>\u201c </em>personal use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The statute further requires that the co-operative plan must cover the <em>entire building. </em>This has not been done. There are two vacant apartments, and several are held under plural ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">There is a further direct and clear violation of the statute, in that one apartment known as 1C is entirely left out of the co-operative plan; there is no stock to cover it, and it can be rented without regard to the co-operative provisions of the corporation. It was shown by the testimony of an officer of the alleged co-operative corporation that this apartment, 1C, was occupied by a Mr. Spellman, without lease or stock as required by the statute, which is a violation of the provision that the co-operative plan must cover the <em>entire </em>property.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">From all the facts disclosed in the proceeding, it is established that there is not such <em>\u201c </em>good faith\u201d shown by the petition as the statute requires, and that the petition and proof do not comply with the terms of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">The final order should, therefore, be reversed, with thirty dollars costs and the petition dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">Guy and Weeks, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">Final order reversed, with thirty dollars costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
