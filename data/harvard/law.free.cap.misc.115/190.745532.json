It required from a landlord a notice of his intention to terminate a tenancy, and protects tenants from removals without being' afforded an opportunity to secure other property. But it has no application to a case where the tenancy is terminated by the act of the tenant. In such a case there is no reason that the landlord should serve a notice, and such a requirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>would be a useless one.\u201d In that case the landlord did not seek the remedy of summary proceedings but was himself sued for damages for an alleged wrongful action and the tenant seeks to distinguish that case on that ground, claiming that since the right to bring summary proceedings is purely statutory, the petition must allege all the facts necessary to bring the case within the provisions of the statute permitting such remedy and no plea or proof of other facts is sufficient to give the court jurisdiction nor can such jurisdiction be conferred by consent of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">' The petition of the landlord alleges all the facts required by section 2231 of the Code of Civil Procedure to give the court jurisdiction. The statute upon which the tenant relies does not give the court any new jurisdiction or provide for any new form of proceeding, but, on the contrary, it merely provides a condition precedent for the benefit of the tenant before the landlord can use the remedy which the legislature bad previously created. Since that condition precedent was created solely for the benefit of the tenant, the tenant has a right to waive it and he does waive it when he himself gives notice of his intention to remove from the premises. Such waiver does not confer upon the court any new jurisdiction not granted by the legislature but merely removes the limitation upon the right of the landlord to bring such proceedings which the legislature had seen fit to enact for the benefit of the tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Final order should, therefore, be reversed and a new trial ordered, with ten dollars costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Mullan and Bunn, J J., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Final order reversed and new trial ordered, with ten dollars costs to appellant to abide event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
