In light of the broad remedial purposes of the securities laws, which mandate sufficiently flexible construction to include \u201c[n]ovel, uncommon, or irregular devices\u201d which function as investments,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we hold that the note involved here is a security.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">Originally the defendants in this action included Lawrence Feldman and his controlled corporation (The Planning Group, Inc. (TPGI)); Jaclyn and Theodore Kramer; and 475 H Street, Inc. (of which Theodore Kramer was sole shareholder at all relevant times).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Feldman\u2019s corporation, TPGI, acted as managing agent for 475 H Street, Inc.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">In the spring of 1978, Feldman began discussing with the appellant Lewis Baurer, the Kramers, and another couple, Ida and Robert Mantel, the formation of a limited partnership, to be known as \u201cCitybank Associates,\u201d which would purchase and manage property located on 8th Street, S. E., in Washington, D. C. Subsequently, Feldman prepared and distributed to the potential partners two drafts of a partnership agreement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Following a pattern established in their previous transactions, Baurer tendered to Feldman a check made out to TPGI and received in exchange the following note, typed on TPGI stationery:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-16\">June 21, 1978</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-17\">PROMISSORY NOTE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-18\">The undersigned promises to pay to the order of Lewis Baurer the sum of Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000) on demand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-19\">The loan signified by this instrument being in lieu of a capital contribution to City Bank Properties Associates, a District of Columbia limited partnership currently being organized. In the event that the parties are unable to reach agreement within thirty (30) days from date hereof on the terms of the partnership agreement, this note shall be due and payable in full. Maker reserves the privilege of making payment on principal at any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>amount at any time. It is understood that upon the execution of the Limited Partnership Agreement, the principal sum shall be deemed paid in full and the accrued interest will be due and payable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-5\">Interest shall accrue at the rate of the flat sum of NONE to June 30, 1978 and 12% per annum from July 15, 1978.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-6\">THE PLANNING GROUP, INC.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-7\">By: /s/</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-8\">LAWRENCE C. FELDMAN</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-9\">President</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-10\">For value received I hereby guarantee the payment of the principal and income of the foregoing note as they respectively come due and payable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-11\">By: /s/</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-12\">LAWRENCE C. FELDMAN <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-13\">In a previous transaction, Baurer had also advanced funds in exchange for a similar promissory note,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and later, when the partnership agreement had been approved, signed a Subscription Agreement and Agreement and Certificate of Limited Partnership in Blue Line Avenue Properties Associates.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This time, however, although Feldman succeeded in organizing a partnership \u2014 with 475 H Street, Inc. as general partner and the Mantels as limited partners,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the partnership plan was not acceptable to Baurer. Baurer therefore demanded return of his funds in August, 1978.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Feldman was unable to comply, apparently because he had used Baurer\u2019s funds to pay TPGI\u2019s outstanding debts. Feldman, instead, executed an assignment to Baurer of a portion of the proceeds of any future sale of the 8th Street property which Citybank had been organized to manage.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Baurer claims that he was subsequently assured by the Kramers, as well as by Feldman, that his funds would be returned when the property was sold. The Kramers, in turn, say that they were under the impression that TPGI had purchased an interest in City-bank and it was TPGI\u2019s interest in any sale proceeds of the property that Feldman had assigned to Baurer. According to the Kramers, they first learned that TPGI had failed to make a partnership contribution at the time of the actual sale of the property in November of 1978. Because TPGI owned no interest in the Citybank property, no distribution of the sale proceeds was made to TPGI or Baurer as its assignee. Instead the proceeds were divided between 475 H Street, Inc. and the Mantels.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-23\">On April 13, 1979, after his demands for payment were denied, Baurer filed this action in the district court, alleging violations of the Securities Acts <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and various com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>mon law claims. The Kramers and 475 H Street, Inc., filed a motion to dismiss and subsequently a motion for summary judgment, which Feldman and TPGI later joined. The defendants argued for dismissal on the grounds that Baurer lacked standing to sue under the Securities Acts because he had never purchased a security. In reply, Baurer asserted that (1) he had entered into a contract to purchase a limited partnership interest which is a security, and (2) the promissory note was itself a security. In September, 1980, Judge Pratt granted the summary judgment motion of the Kramers and 475 H Street, Inc. and denied the summary judgment motion of Feldman and TPGI.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> He later denied Baurer\u2019s motion for reconsideration. In November, 1980, Judge Pratt approved an offer of confession of judgment of $15,000 plus interest by Feldman and TPGI (the Kramers\u2019 brief notes, however, that it is probable that Feldman and TPGI are judgment proof). Baurer pursued his claims against the Kramers and 475 H Street, Inc. by timely filing a notice of appeal from the grant of summary judgment in their favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-10\">Judge Pratt\u2019s order dismissing the claims against the Kramers and 475 H Street, Inc. stated only that Baurer had never acquired a partnership interest in Citybank, a question as to which he found \u201cno genuine issue of material fact.\u201d Since, however, the order granted summary judgment to the appellees, it must also be interpreted as denying Baurer standing to sue under the Securities Acts for failure to have purchased a \u201csecurity\u201d and as dismissing Baurer\u2019s pendent common law claims on the merits.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Baurer\u2019s main argument on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>appeal is that, despite having never consummated the Citybank partnership agreement, he is nonetheless a purchaser of a \u201csecurity\u201d and therefore entitled to sue under the Securities Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">II. THE PROMISSORY NOTE</p>\n<p id=\"a5q-dedup-0\">Baurer relies on the definitional sections of the Securities Acts to support his claim that the promissory note he received from Feldman is a security. Both the Securities Act of 1933, which establishes disclosure requirements in the offer and sale of securities in interstate and foreign commerce,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and the Securities Act of 1934, which regulates securities exchanges and over-the-counter markets operating in interstate and foreign commerce,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> include \u201cany note\u201d within their definitions of a \u201csecurity.\u201d But there are some differences in language between the two definitional sections. While the 1933 Act defines \u201csecurity\u201d to include any \u201cevidence of indebtedness,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77b(1), the 1934 Act\u2019s definition omits this phrase, <em>see </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78c(a)(10). The 1933 Act exempts certain short-term notes from the Act\u2019s registration requirements, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77c(a)(3), although all notes, without exception, are subject to the Act\u2019s 'antifraud provisions. In contrast, the 1934 Act\u2019s definition of security, which controls the scope of its antifraud provisions, specifically excepts those notes with a maturity of nine months or less. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78c(a)(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-10\">A superficial reading of the two Acts would thus seem to bring this note clearly within at least the antifraud provisions of the 1933 Act but possibly, because of its short duration, beyond the scope of the 1934 Act. Since the bases of liability under the two Acts differ in scope and kind,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and Baurer\u2019s complaint relied upon both Acts for jurisdictional purposes, we must decide whether this note is a security under both Acts. Other courts that have addressed the status of notes under either Act have concluded that Congress did not intend coverage of the Acts to depend solely upon the maturity of a note. Rather, despite different rationales, those courts have concluded that whether or not a note is a \u201csecurity\u201d under either Act depends on whether the instrument is an investment, as opposed to a commercial note. <em>E.g., Great Western Bank &amp; Trust </em>v. <em>Kotz, </em>532 F.2d 1252, 1257 (9th Cir. 1976); <em>Zabriskie </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>507 F.2d 546, 550 (10th Cir. 1974); <em>SEC v. Continen</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number><em>tal Commodities Corp., </em>497 F.2d 516, 523-27 (5th Cir. 1974); <em>Lino v. City Investing Co., </em>487 F.2d 689, 694-95 (3d Cir. 1973); <em>Sanders v. John Nuveen &amp; Co., </em>463 F.2d 1075, 1079-80 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 1009, 93 S.Ct. 443, 34 L.Ed.2d 302 (1972); <em>SEC v. Diversified Industries, Inc., </em>465 F.Supp. 104, 107 (D.D.C.1979); <em>Oliver v. Bostetter, </em>426 F.Supp. 1082, 1085 (D.Md.1977); <em>Anderson v. Francis I. duPont &amp; Co., </em>291 F.Supp. 705, 708 (D.Minn.1968). <em>Cf. </em>1 ALI, Federal Securities Code \u00a7 202(150)(B)(iii) comment (6)(a) (\u201cThis codifies the mercantile-investment dichotomy that is emerging as the least imperfect solution to a troublesome problem.\u201d) Even the Second Circuit, which has adhered to the \u201cliteral approach\u201d (presuming that \u201cany note\u201d with a maturity date exceeding nine months is a security), inquires into the context of the transaction to determine whether that presumption has been rebutted. And, conversely, that same Circuit has expressed the view that \u201cthe mere fact that a note has a maturity of less than nine months does not take the case out of [the 1934 Act], unless the note fits the general notion of \u2018commercial paper.\u2019\u201d <em>Zeller v. Bogue Electric Mf\u2019g Corp., </em>476 F.2d 795, 800 (2d Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 908, 94 S.Ct. 217, 38 L.Ed.2d 146 (1973). (Friendly, J.) (dicta). <em>But see Exchange Nat\u2019l Bank of Chicago v. Touche Ross Co., </em>544 F.2d 1126, 1138 n.19 (2d Cir. 1976) (Friendly, J.) (\u201cWe leave for another day the status under the 1934 Act of a note with a maturity of nine months or less. . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">We, too, find persuasive the reasoning that Congress intended to include investment notes of whatever duration within coverage of both Securities Acts and to exclude only commercial notes. Although the Supreme Court has not yet decided the question, we think our conclusion consistent with the Court\u2019s previously expressed approach toward construing a \u201csecurity.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-5\">The primary purpose of the Acts of 1933 and 1934 was to eliminate serious abuses in a largely unregulated securities market. The focus of the Acts is on the capital market of the enterprise system: the sale of securities to raise capital for profit-making purposes, the exchanges on which securities are traded, and the need for regulation to prevent fraud and to protect the interest of investors . . . Thus, in construing these Acts against the background of their purpose, we are guided by a traditional canon of statutory construction:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-7\">\u2018[A] thing may be within the letter of the statute and yet not within the statute, because not within its spirit, nor within the intention of its makers.\u2019 <em>Church of the Holy Trinity </em>v. <em>United States, </em>143 U.S. 457, 459 [12 S.Ct. 511, 512, 36 L.Ed. 226] (1892).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-8\"><em>United Housing Foundation, Inc. v. Forman, </em>421 U.S. 837, 849, 95 S.Ct. 2051, 2059, 44 L.Ed.2d 621 (1975).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">In short, the Court appears to be rejecting a \u201cliteral\u201d approach toward defining a security in favor of one that looks to the statutory goal of protecting investors.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">To exclude short-term notes that represent genuine investments from the coverage of the 1934 Act would serve no discernible statutory purpose. As both Acts are aimed at the protection of investors, \u201c[cjourts have shrunk from a literal reading that .. . would produce a seemingly irrational difference in the scope of their anti-fraud provisions.\u201d <em>Exchange Nat\u2019l Bank of Chicago v. Touche Ross &amp; Co., </em>544 F.2d 1126, 1133 (2d Cir. 1976). Similarly, the Supreme Court has held that the definition of security under both Acts is \u201cvirtually identical,\u201d and the omission of \u201cevidence of indebtedness\u201d from the 1934 Act is without controlling significance. <em>Tcherepnin v. Knight, </em>389 U.S. 332, 342, 344, 88 S.Ct. 548, 556, 557, 19 L.Ed.2d 564. The Court relied in part on the Senate Report accompanying the 1934 Act which stated that \u201cthe definition of security was intended to be \u2018substantially the same\u2019 \u201d under both Acts. 389 U.S. at 342 <em>(quoting </em>S.Rep.No.792, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. 14 (1934)). Further support for the view that it would be inappropriate to exclude all short-term notes, regardless of their nature or purpose, from the definition of a security in the 1934 Act, comes from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>the fact that the exclusionary language in the 1934 Act\u2019s definition closely tracks language of the 1933 Act exempting from the <em>registration </em>requirements \u201c[a]ny note . . . which arises out of a current transaction or the proceeds of which have been or are to be used for current transactions, and which has a maturity at the time of issuance of not exceeding nine months, exclusive of days of grace, or any renewal thereof the maturity of which is likewise limited.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77c(a)(3). The only difference in the two sections is the 1934 Act\u2019s omission of the phrase \u201cwhich arises out of a current transaction or the proceeds of which have been or are to be used for current transaction.\u201d Given the absence of any explanation in the legislative history for that omission,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> other courts have reasonably construed the 1934 Act\u2019s exclusion of short term notes as coextensive with the narrow class of commercial instruments that Congress exempted from the 1933 Act registration requirements: \u201cshort term paper of the type available for discount at a Federal Reserve bank and of a type which rarely is bought by private investors.\u201d H.R.Rep. No.85, 73rd Cong., 1st Sess., 15 (1933).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Zabriskie v. Lewis, </em>507 F.2d 546, 550 (10th Cir. 1974); <em>Zeller v. Bogue Electric Mfg. Corp., </em>476 F.2d 795, 799-800 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 908, 94 S.Ct. 217, 38 L.Ed.2d 146 (1973).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-10\">We thus direct our inquiry to whether the promissory note Baurer received from Feldman, although of less than nine months duration, represents essentially an \u201cinvestment\u201d rather than a commercial transaction. Although Courts of Appeals \u201chave devised somewhat different tests to determine whether a note constitutes a \u2018security,\u2019 \u201d <em>SEC v. Diversified Industries, Inc., </em>465 F.Supp. 104, 108 (D.D.C.1979), we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>previously relied on the Supreme Courts\u2019 formulation of \u201csecurity\u201d to draw the distinction between \u201ca genuine investment and other transactions.\u201d <em>Association of American R. R. v. U. S., </em>603 F.2d 953, 971 (D.C.Cir.1979) (defining \u201csecurity\u201d under Interstate Commerce Act with reference to Supreme Court decisions under the Securities Act); <em>United California Bank v. THC Financial Corp., </em>557 F.2d 1351, 1357 (9th Cir. 1977); <em>Bellah v. First Nat\u2019l Bank of Hereford, </em>495 F.2d 1109, 1115 (5th Cir. 1974). The test which \u201cembodies the essential attributes that run through all of the Court\u2019s decisions defining a security,\u201d <em>United Housing Foundation v. Forman, </em>421 U.S. 837, 852, 95 S.Ct. 2051, 2060, 44 L.Ed.2d 621 (1975), is drawn from <em>SEC v. W. J. Howey Co., </em>328 U.S. 293, 66 S.Ct. 1100, 90 L.Ed. 1244 (1946). It turns on \u201cwhether the scheme involves an investment of money in a common enterprise with profits to come solely from the efforts of others.\u201d 328 U.S. at 301, 66 S.Ct. at 1104.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The <em>Howey </em>Court endorsed the long-standing definition of \u201cinvestment\u201d as \u201cthe placing of capital or laying out of money in a way intended to secure income or profit from its employment.\u201d 328 U.S. at 298, 66 S.Ct. at 1102. The <em>Forman </em>court further explicated the meaning of a security: \u201cThe touchstone is the presence of an investment in a common venture premised on a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.\u201d 421 U.S. at 852, 95 S.Ct. at 2060. <em>See International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. Daniel, </em>439 U.S. 551, 561, 99 S.Ct. 790, 797, 58 L.Ed.2d 808 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">Although in our journey through the cases and treatises, we have not encountered a transaction precisely like this one, <em>but cf. SEC v. Addison, </em>194 F.Supp. 709 (N.D.Tex.1961) (in gratitude for loan of money to mining operation, borrower would at his discretion allow lenders to participate in \u201cmillions of profits\u201d; held that notes exchanged were \u201csecurities\u201d), we conclude that this note bears the hallmarks of a security for the following reasons.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> First, the terms of the agreement, described in the promissory note itself, establish its investment character. It is apparent on the face of the note that Baurer was induced to advance money by the promise of an investment opportunity with Feldman and others. Furthermore, Baurer advanced his funds in reliance on Feldman\u2019s representation of \u201centrepreneurial\u201d and \u201cmanagerial\u201d skills in putting together a profitmaking organization, <em>see </em>Citybank Associates Offering Memorandum, Exhibit D, filed with the district court January 8, 1980, at 9-15; the advance was an effort to facilitate the formation of the partnership. The arrangement was not dissimilar from a pooling agreement, \u201cwhere the buyer furnishes the funds and the seller the skill for speculating in the stock or commodity markets under an arrangement to split any profits.\u201d 1 L. Loss, Securities Regulation 489 (2d ed. 1961). The investor in a pooling arrangement has a security even before contributed funds are actually used to purchase stocks. <em>See Anderson v. Francis I. duPont &amp; Co., </em>291 F.Supp. 705 (D.Minn.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">One possible objection to the analogy is that Bauer did not expect profits to come <em>solely </em>from the efforts of others. The Supreme Court has so far declined to express its view on whether, to establish the existence of a security, profits need come <em>solely </em>from the efforts of others. <em>United Housing Foundation, Inc. v. Forman, </em>421 U.S. 837, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>852 n.16, 95 S.Ct. 2051, 2060 n.16, 44 L.Ed.2d 621 (1975). However, other Courts of Appeals have expressed support for the standard enunciated in <em>SEC v. Glenn W. Turner Enterprises, Inc., </em>474 F.2d 476, 482 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 821, 94 S.Ct. 117, 38 L.Ed.2d 53 (1973): \u201cwhether the efforts made by those other than the investor are the undeniably significant ones, those essential managerial efforts which affect the failure or success of the enterprise.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Martin </em>v. <em>T. V. Tempo, Inc., </em>628 F.2d 887, 889 (5th Cir. 1980); <em>Aldrich v. McCulloch Properties, Inc., </em>627 F.2d 1036, 1039-40 (10th Cir. 1980); <em>Miller v. Central Chinchilla Group, Inc., </em>494 F.2d 414, 416-17 (8th Cir. 1974). By this measure, the promissory note in this case represents an investment. While Baurer expected profits to flow in part from his own participation in the formation of the partnership, the \u201cfailure or success of the enterprise\u201d depended largely on Feldman\u2019s drafting an acceptable partnership agreement, bringing together the investors in it, as he had done in the past, and taking over the task of purchasing and managing, through his controlled corporation TGPI, the investment property itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">We believe our holding compelled by the concept of a security that Congress incorporated into the Securities Acts. That concept \u201cembodies a flexible rather than a static principle, one that is capable of adaptation to meet the countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits.\u201d <em>SEC v. Howey Co., </em>328 U.S. 293, 299, 66 S.Ct. 1100, 1103, 90 L.Ed. 1244 (1946). To fail to recognize this note as a security would create a new and possibly replicable loophole in protecting investors through the Securities Acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Finally, defendants challenge Baurer\u2019s standing on the grounds that he is not a \u201cpurchaser\u201d of a security because he never joined the limited partnership agreement. They rely on <em>Blue Chip Stamps v.

Judge Pratt also ruled in a separate order responding to defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss that there is no implied cause of action under section 17 of the 1933 Act. Baurer has not argued this issue on appeal, and we therefore do not decide this question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b830-5\">. Judge Pratt\u2019s order was vaguely phrased, and the parties at first disagreed as to whether the order dismissed the pendent common law complaints at all, or if it did so, whether the dismissal was with or without prejudice.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-6\">Upon consideration of the Motion for Summary Judgment of defendants Kramer and 475 H Street, Inc., the memorandum in support thereof and plaintiff\u2019s memorandum in opposition thereto and it appearing to the court that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that plaintiff was never a limited partner and never acquired a limited partnership interest in Citybank and that defendants Kramer and 475 H Street, Inc. are entitled to judgment as a matter of law, it is this 25th day of September, 1980</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-7\">ORDERED that the Motion for Summary Judgment of defendants Kramer and 475 H Street, Inc. be and the same hereby is granted and judgment is entered in favor of said defendants; and it is</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-8\">FURTHER ORDERED that this action be and hereby is dismissed as to defendants Kramer and 475 H Street, Inc. with prejudice. We conclude that this order did dismiss the</blockquote>\n<p id=\"axe-dedup-0\">common law claims with prejudice but that it did so improperly. We base that judgment on three grounds. First, Judge Pratt\u2019s order makes no reference at all to any undisputed material facts or affidavits on which he must base findings of fact determinative of the common law claims. Neither does it cite any legal basis for dismissing such claims. Second, the record reveals that issues of material fact did exist so that summary judgment on these claims would have been inappropriate, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. For example, Baurer asserts in his reply to the summary judgment motion that Feldman was acting as agent for the Kramers and 475 H Street, Inc. when he assigned the proceeds of any sale of the 8th Street property to Baurer. Plaintiff\u2019s Reply and Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Opposition to Defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment, at 10. This contention is not addressed at all by \u201cDefendants\u2019 Statement of Material Facts Not in Dispute.\u201d Finally, the defendants\u2019 arguments in favor of summary judgment to which the order responded, dealt only in a cursory manner with the merits of the common law claims, and were primarily focused on obtaining dismissal of the federal claims. The defendants summarized their arguments as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-12\">The complaint seeks to invoke the jurisdiction of the Court for the adjudication of claims arising under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Plaintiff also seeks to persuade the Court to accept pendent jurisdiction over certain claims purportedly arising by virtue of common law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-13\">The complaint alleges that Plaintiff purchased within the District of Columbia certain securities. The Court needs to ascertain from the record the exact nature and extent of Plaintiff\u2019s \u201cinterest,\u201d if any, in the securities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-14\">Therefore, before proceeding with the instant litigation, the Court must determine first whether Plaintiff has the requisite stand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>ing to sue. Defendants submit that Plaintiff lacks standing under the securities laws and that this action must be dismissed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqx\">Defendants\u2019 Statement of Points and Authorities, at 2 (filed Jan. 8, 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">Once the federal claims were dismissed by summary judgment, the district should have exercised its discretion not to hear pendent claims when \u201csubstantial time and energy have [not] been expended looking toward the resolution of a dispute that plaintiffs were entitled to bring in a federal court.\u201d <em>Rosado v. Wyman, </em>397 U.S. 397, 404, 90 S.Ct. 1207, 1213, 25 L.Ed.2d 442 (1970). <em>See United Mine Workers of America v.

Reference to the legislative history of the 1934 Act sheds no light on the importance or meaning of the difference between the two sections. The original draft of the 1934 Act, introduced in the Senate on February 9, 1934 and in the House on February 10, 1934, provided no exclusion for short-term notes. H.R. 8720, introduced in the House on March 19, 1934, contained a definition of a \u201csecurity\u201d that by its terms excluded only those short-term obligations arising \u201cout of a current transaction or the proceeds of which have been or are to be used for current transactions,\u201d language identical to that used in section 3(a)(3) of the 1933 Act. After the \u201ccurrent transactions\u201d phrasing was omitted and then restored in subsequent bills in the House and Senate, the reference to \u201ccurrent transactions\u201d was deleted from the exclusionary language of the definition of a \u201csecurity\u201d in the final version of the 1934 Act. Since there is no legislative comment with respect to this deletion, it cannot be gainfully surmised whether the omission of the \u201ccurrent transactions\u201d phrasing was an inadvertent mistake, an assumption on the part of the legislature that the clause was unnecessary,' or a conscious attempt to distinguish section 3(a)(10) of the 1934 Act from section 3(a)(3) of the 1933 Act.</p>\n<p id=\"A6a\">Comment, 39 U.Chi.L.Rev. 362, 398 (1972) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b833-7\">.

The Investment Company Act of 1940 defines \u201cshort-term paper\u201d as paper with a maturity not exceeding nine months \u201cand such other classes of <em>securities, of a commercial rather than investment character, </em>as the Commission may designate by rules and regulations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-15\">In other words, when Congress spoke of notes with a maturity not exceeding nine months, it meant commercial paper, not investment securities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-16\"><em>Sanders v.
