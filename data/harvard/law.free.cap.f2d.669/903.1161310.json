In this case, a company that the Environmental Protection Agency charged with exceeding air pollution standards contends it should be excused from the exhaustion requirement. Since a statutory penalty accrues each day the alleged violation continues, the company fears that its potential financial liability may force it to accede to EPA rather than risk an unfavorable outcome after prolonged, good faith litigation. We do not consider this to be undue hardship because the sanction created by Congress was intended to take the profit out of pollution by recouping the economic benefit a firm obtains by violating Clean Air standards. Since the company has not yet completed proceedings before EPA, the petition for review will be dismissed as premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-20\">On February 2, 1981, EPA served Bethlehem Steel Company with a notice of noncompliance issued pursuant to \u00a7 120 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7420 (Supp.III <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>1979). The notice cited Bethlehem for violating a mass emission rate limitation and an opacity limitation at Precipitator No. 2, which is an air pollution control facility regulating the discharge of particulate from the company\u2019s sinter plant in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The emission standards, codified at 25 Pa. Code \u00a7 123.13(b) and \u00a7 123.41(l), were enacted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as part of its federally approved State Implementation Plan in order to achieve compliance with national ambient air quality standards. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7409-7410.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">EPA alleged that Bethlehem\u2019s sinter plant had violated the regulations on May 28 and September 10,1980. In addition, the notice stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-6\">\u201cIt is the Agency\u2019s finding that sufficient action has not been taken by the Company at the subject facility to remedy the performance of the existing control devices as represented by the above referenced data. As a result of this inaction it is further concluded that such performance in violation of the stated Pennsylvania rules and regulations is continuing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ae3\">The notice informed the company that it must either submit a penalty calculation or file a petition for reconsideration within 45 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">Bethlehem responded to EPA on February 27,1981, with a letter captioned \u201cApplication For Agency Relief From The Issuance Of A Notice Of Noncompliance.\u201d Bethlehem asked for withdrawal of the notice because its issuance exceeded EPA\u2019s powers under \u00a7 120 of the Clean Air Act and its own regulations in five ways:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-8\">1. The notice is based on events which occurred before the effective date of the regulations implementing \u00a7 120 and therefore is an impermissible attempt to give them retroactive effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-9\">2. The statute\u2019s enforcement plan does not permit notices to be issued until 18 months after promulgation of the implementing regulations. Since the regulations were not published until July 28, 1980, compliance would not be required until January 28, 1982 at the earliest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-10\">3. The notice was not issued within 30 days after discovery of noncompliance, as mandated by the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-11\">4. The findings of noncompliance are not supported by the record to which the notice refers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-12\">5. The notice conflicts with EPA\u2019s announcement that it would proceed first against sources that had never complied with the Clean Air Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b955-13\">EPA elected to treat Bethlehem\u2019s letter as a petition for reconsideration, and suggested that the company supplement its request with data about the compliance status of the sinter plant or its eligibility for an exemption. Bethlehem did so on April 7, 1981, and on July 17, 1981, the Regional Administrator of EPA denied Bethlehem\u2019s request to withdraw the notice of noncompliance. He did order a hearing, however, to decide whether the company\u2019s facility is violating applicable legal requirements and whether it is entitled to a <em>de minimis exemption. We </em>have not been informed of the progress of that hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-14\">Without waiting for a response to its first letter, Bethlehem filed this petition for review on March 30,1981. The company raises before us the same objections that it presented to EPA. The agency\u2019s threshold argument is that the petition should be dismissed since Bethlehem failed to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-15\">EPA emphasizes that issuance of a noncompliance notice is only the first step of a process determining whether \u00a7 120 penalties will be assessed. As the agency sees it, judicial review is not available until \u2014 and unless \u2014 the administrative proceedings conclude with the assessment of a penalty. Therefore, says EPA, the court should not intervene until after the agency completes its hearing on whether Bethlehem has complied with the requirements of the Act or qualifies for a <em>de minimis </em>exemption, and then only if a penalty is fixed.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-16\">Bethlehem responds that the exhaustion doctrine does not apply here because the five issues raised by its petition for review are not related to compliance or exemption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>and therefore will not be considered during the administrative hearing. Accordingly, it is argued, the agency has already taken its \u201cfinal action\u201d with respect to the specific challenges raised here. Bethlehem also contends that the controversy .is ripe for review because these issues are purely legal in nature, and the company is threatened by the penalties that began accruing upon receipt of the notice in February 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">We look first at the relevant part of the Act, since \u201cthe doctrine of administrative exhaustion should be applied with a regard for the particular administrative scheme at issue.\u201d <em>Weinberger v. Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 765, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 2466, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975). Section 120 was enacted in 1977 as an amendment to the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7401-7642 (Supp. I 1977) (amending 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1857-1858a. (1976)). It assesses an administrative penalty against air polluters equal to the economic value the violator derives from continuing noncompliance after the date of notification by EPA. The statute directs that not later than six months after August 7, 1977, the Administrator shall promulgate regulations governing the procedures for assessment and collection of the noncompliance penalty. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 7420(a)(1)(A), \u00a7 7420(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">The Administrator must send a notice to violators not later than 30 days after the agency discovers the noncompliance. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 7420(b)(3). Upon receipt of the notice, the offender must either calculate the penalty and payment schedule in accordance with a specified formula, or else submit a petition within 45 days challenging the notice of noncompliance or alleging entitlement to an exemption. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 7420(b)(4). The Administrator may exempt a source if he finds that a particular instance of noncompliance is <em>de minimis </em>in nature and duration. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 7420(a)(2)(C). The petitioner is entitled to a hearing on the record and a decision within 90 days. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 7420(b)(5). In addition, the Administrator is authorized to adjust the penalty or payment schedule if he finds after notice and a hearing that the proposal submitted by the violator does not satisfy the requirements of the statute. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 7420(b)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">Judicial review is provided by \u00a7 7420(e): \u201cAny action pursuant to this section ... shall be considered a final action for purposes of judicial review of any penalty under section 7607 of this title.\u201d A petition for review of \u201cany rule issued under section . . . 7420 of this title, or any other nationally applicable regulations promulgated, or final action taken, by the Administrator under this chapter may be filed only in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 7607(b)(1). However, attacks on \u201cany order . . . under section 7420 of this title ... or any other final action of the Administrator under this chapter . . . which is locally or regionally applicable may be filed only in the United State Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In either event, the court is barred from granting \u201cany stay, injunctive, or similar relief before final judgment by such court in such action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 7607(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">The Administrator adopted the regulations mandated by \u00a7 7420(b) nearly two and one-half years after the six month period specified in \u00a7 7420(a)(1)(A)\u2014on July 28, 1980, and with an effective date of October 27, 1980. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 66.1-66.95. The regulations provide that alleged violators must be notified of their right to petition for a hearing at which they may challenge the finding of noncompliance or claim an exemption. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 66.12(a)(4). A source owner or operator whose penalty calculation has not been accepted by the Administrator may also petition for a hearing to challenge the agency\u2019s recomputation. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 66.52.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-9\">The regulations further provide that agency action shall be considered final for purposes of judicial review \u201conly if all administrative remedies have been exhausted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 66.81(b). This requirement is set out in detail:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-10\">\u201cTo exhaust administrative remedies a source owner or operator must first petition for reconsideration of the decision in question for reconsideration of the decision in question and, if unsuccessful after hearing or after denial of hearing, appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>the decision in question to the Administrator. The action becomes final upon the completion of review by the Administrator and notice thereof to the owner or operator of the source.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">In the leading case of <em>Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., </em>303 U.S. 41, 50-51, 58 S.Ct. 459, 463-464, 82 L.Ed. 638 (1938), the Supreme Court referred to the \u201clong settled rule of judicial administration that no one is entitled to judicial relief for a supposed or threatened injury until the prescribed administrative remedy has been exhausted.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As the Court explained in <em>McKart v. United States, </em>395 U.S. 185, 194-195, 89 S.Ct. 1657, 1662-1663, 23 L.Ed.2d 194 (1969), it is more desirable to let the administrative process go forward without interruption than to permit the parties to petition the courts at various intermediate stages. In that way, the agency can develop the necessary factual background, apply any special expertise it might possess, and correct its own errors. This judicial forebearance demonstrates a proper respect for administrative autonomy and allows the agency to function more efficiently and responsibly. <em>See also Weinberger v. Salfi, </em>422 U.S. at 765, 95 S.Ct. at 2466.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">Considerations of judicial economy are present as well. Should a party succeed in vindicating his rights in the administrative process, the courts may never have to intervene. <em>See, e.g., Christian v. New York State Department of Labor, </em>414 U.S. 614, 622, 94 S.Ct. 747, 751, 39 L.Ed.2d 38 (1974). The same reasons that support the prohibition against appeals from interlocutory orders in a trial court are pertinent to the administrative context as well. <em>McKart v. United States, </em>395 U.S. at 194, 89 S.Ct. at 1663. The policy against \u201cpiecemeal review\u201d of agency action, <em>FTC v. Standard Oil Co. of California, </em>449 U.S. 232, 242, 101 S.Ct. 488, 494, 66 L.Ed.2d 416 (1980), is therefore the counterpart of the rule limiting appeals from trial court rulings. <em>See, Sun Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co. v. Benefits Review Board, </em>535 F.2d 758 (3d Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-10\">Despite the frequently reiterated benefits of exhaustion, courts have declined to require it when no purpose would be served by deferring review. For example, where a dispute centers on legal questions such as constitutional or statutory interpretation, and the facts are uncontested, then the interest in \u201cfull administrative fact gathering and utilization of agency expertise\u201d is not harmed by earlier judicial scrutiny. <em>McGee v. United States, </em>402 U.S. 479, 486, 91 S.Ct. 1565, 1569, 29 L.Ed.2d 47 (1971). In those circumstances, a rigid exhaustion requirement would entail \u201ca commitment of administrative resources unsupported by any administrative or judicial interest.\" <em>Weinberger v. Salfi, </em>422 U.S. at 766,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 95 S.Ct. at 2467.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-11\">Another exception to the exhaustion requirement applies when irreparable injury will result unless the court promptly intervenes in the administrative process. <em>See Renegotiation Board v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., </em>415 U.S. 1, 24, 94 S.Ct. 1028, 1040, 39 L.Ed.2d 123 (1974). Thus, in <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976), the Court permitted judicial review of a decision to terminate disability benefits, even though the claimant had not exhausted the Social Security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>Administration\u2019s internal review procedures. The Court reasoned that a quick resolution of the claimant\u2019s dispute with the agency was essential, since he was so dependent upon the benefits for his survival that \u201can erroneous termination would damage him .in a way not recompensable through retroactive payments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 330-331, 96 S.Ct. at 1900-901. Finally, exhaustion has been excused in some cases when agency action clearly violates statutory or constitutional rights. <em>See Babcock and Wilcox Co. v. Marshall, </em>610 F.2d 1128, 1138 (3d Cir. 1979).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">It may be observed that the concepts of \u201cfinal decision\u201d and \u201cexhaustion\u201d are often closely intertwined and sometimes confused. In <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>the Court noted that the Social Security Act itself requires exhaustion of administrative remedies, in the form of a \u201cfinal decision of the Secretary made after a hearing,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), as a jurisdictional prerequisite for judicial review. 424 U.S. at 327-328, 96 S.Ct. at 899. The question before the Court was whether the initial \u201cdenial of Eldridge\u2019s claim to continued benefits was a sufficiently \u2018final\u2019 decision with respect to his constitutional claim to satisfy the statutory exhaustion requirement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 330, 96 S.Ct. at 900. In deciding that it was sufficient, the Court invoked \u201cthe core principle that statutorily created finality requirements should, if possible, be construed so as not to cause crucial collateral claims to be lost and potentially irreparable injuries to be suffered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 331, n.11, 96 S.Ct. at 901. <em>See also Weinberger v. Salfi, </em>422 U.S. at 764-767, 95 S.Ct. at 2466-2467.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">Finality and exhaustion are not identical, however, no matter how often they converge. In <em>FTC </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co. of California, </em>449 U.S. at 246, 101 S.Ct. at 496, the Court held that the issuance of a complaint by the FTC against an oil company was not \u201cfinal agency action\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 10(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704, and therefore not subject to judicial review before the conclusion of administrative adjudication. The company contended that it had exhausted its administrative remedies because the agency had refused its request to withdraw the complaint. The Court conceded this might be true, but said that the company had \u201cmistaken exhaustion for finality.\u201d 449 U.S. at 243, 101 S.Ct. at 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-9\">In general, exhaustion refers to the steps which the litigant must take, whereas finality refers to the conclusion of activity by the agency. As in the <em>Standard Oil </em>case, a party may take all the measures available to it in the administrative process to obtain relief, and yet not obtain a final reviewable order. It is also possible that an agency order may be final for purposes of appeal, even though the party has not pursued his administrative remedies to the end. For example, an agency order may be appeala-ble under \u00a7 10(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act even though the aggrieved party still has a right to internal reconsideration or review.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b958-10\">In any event, finality and exhaustion serve the same interests. As the Court observed in <em>Standard Oil, </em>449 U.S. at 244, n.11, 101 S.Ct. at 495, n.11, \u201cone of the principal reasons to await the termination of agency proceedings\u201d is the possibility that a dispute may be mooted if the party ultimately prevails before the agency, thereby obviating all occasion for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>Bethlehem argues that the purposes of the exhaustion doctrine would not be served here by deferring judicial review until after completion of the agency hearing. First, the company claims that its objections to the issuance of EPA\u2019s notice are purely legal in nature, so there is no need for the agency to develop a factual record or apply its technical expertise. Second, Bethlehem insists that further prosecution of its cause through administrative channels would be futile, since the company\u2019s challenges are not related to compliance or exemption and therefore cannot be raised at the hearing. Finally, Bethlehem asserts that it will suffer irreparable injury if judicial review is not available immediately, because the noncompliance penalty is continuing to accrue.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">Bethlehem\u2019s argument fails to acknowledge that the determinations of compliance and exemption are clearly matters of fact that require a hearing. Indeed, the company\u2019s entire dispute with EPA will come to an end if it prevails on either one of these dispositive issues at the agency hearing. As we noted above, the possibility that an administrative proceeding may moot the necessity for judicial action is one of the principal objections to review of interlocutory agency rulings. On the other hand, if Bethlehem should lose before the agency and then appeal, the court\u2019s overall review will be better informed because it will have the benefit of findings reached after an evidentiary hearing on technical matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">A different consideration applies to Bethlehem\u2019s contention that the notice of noncompliance is void because it was not issued within the 30-day time period mandated by \u00a7 7420(b)(3). This objection is actually an attack on the validity of 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 66.11(c), which authorizes EPA to issue a notice at any time after discovery of noncompliance and calculates the penalty from date of receipt.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-8\">If Bethlehem\u2019s argument that the regulation is contrary to the plain meaning of the statute were sustained, both the regulation and the notice would be invalidated. As noted earlier, however, an attack of that nature may be filed only in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). Bethlehem has already joined in a suit pending before that court which questions whether the agency\u2019s regulations conform to the requirements of the statute. A challenge to the validity of a regulation thus presents no special reason for us to intervene at this stage, and in fact points the other way.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-10\">The primary focus of our inquiry, therefore, must be on Bethlehem\u2019s assertion that only immediate judicial review can protect it from undue hardship. Bethlehem contends that issuance of the notice has placed the company in a position where it must either (1) spend money modifying its pollution control equipment to the agency\u2019s satisfaction; (2) shut down its facility until the dispute is resolved; or (3) continue operations without change in the hope that ultimately it will be vindicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-11\">The company finds the first two choices unacceptable because it believes that its present equipment is adequate. Its difficulty with the third option is that the penalty is increasing daily, so that the amount assessed would be substantial indeed if Bethlehem errs in its expectation of a favorable outcome to the controversy. The company litigates the issue of noncompliance at its peril by risking a formidable penalty if it should lose in the end, and for that reason argues that the court should address the dispositive legal defenses now.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-12\">Bethlehem\u2019s argument for early judicial review relies heavily upon <em>Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, </em>387 U.S. 136, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967), in which the Supreme Court held that the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act does not forbid pre-enforcement review of a regulation promulgated by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs. In reaching its conclusion, the Court observed that the litigants were confronted with the choice between expending large sums to comply with the regulation or risking criminal prosecution. The Court found that this dilemma constituted sufficient hardship to justify pre-enforcement review of the validity of the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>There are several distinctions between <em>Abbott </em>and the case at hand. First, <em>Abbott </em>was a pre-enforcement case, while here administrative proceedings are already in progress. Unlike <em>Abbott, </em>it cannot be said that this challenge to the regulation \u201cis calculated to speed enforcement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 154, 87 S.Ct. at 1518. On the contrary, the very purpose of Bethlehem\u2019s suit is to interrupt the enforcement action pending against it. We therefore distinguish <em>Abbott, </em>as did the Court in <em>Standard Oil Co. of California, </em>on the grounds that judicial review now \u201cwould delay resolution of the ultimate question whether the Act was violated.\u201d 449 U.S. at 242, 101 S.Ct. at 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">Secondly, and more importantly, the sole question raised by the litigants in <em>Abbott </em>was the \u201cpurely legal one [of] whether the statute was properly construed by the Commissioner\u201d in his regulation. 387 U.S. at 149, 87 S.Ct. at 1515. Here, by contrast, there are several dispositive issues, including two \u2014 -compliance and exemption \u2014 that require a factual determination. Moreover, as we noted earlier, challenges to the legality of the regulations may only be brought in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Unlike the assault on the regulation in <em>Abbott, </em>then, Bethlehem\u2019s attack on the EPA rules do not even provide us with jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">Moreover, the regulation challenged in <em>Abbott </em>was final agency action. Taking a flexible view of finality, the Court noted that the regulation was clearly definitive and no further administrative proceedings were contemplated. 387 U.S. at 149-151, 87 S.Ct. at 1515-1517. That is not the situation here. Much like the complaint issued by the FTC in the <em>Standard Oil </em>case, the notice of noncompliance issued by EPA only represents a \u201cthreshold determination\u201d triggering further proceedings. 449 U.S. at 241, 101 S.Ct. at 494. By seeking review at this early stage of the administrative process, Bethlehem hopes to forestall a final decision on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">In sum, <em>Abbott </em>does not support Bethlehem\u2019s contention that the company will suffer irreparable injury unless it obtains prompt judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-7\">A basic defect in Bethlehem\u2019s argument is that it proves too much. Undue hardship is a -narrow exception to the exhaustion requirement. <em>American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1904 v. Resor, </em>442 F.2d 993, 995 (3d Cir. 1971). Allowing interlocutory review by the court every time EPA issues a notice of noncompliance would permit the exception to swallow the rule. Bethlehem\u2019s choice between risking mounting fines or yielding to coerced compliance is the same alternative presented to every alleged violator, because that plan of enforcement is built into the Act. As this court said in another administrative context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-8\">\u201cFinally, and most importantly, if [the hardship] exception were to be applied in this case, it would likewise apply in every case where the [agency] contemplated disciplinary proceedings. Any company threatened by an [agency] hearing could run into district court claiming that the imposition of sanctions would result in irreparable injury. To allow such interruption would frustrate the [regulatory] scheme envisioned by Congress in passing the . . . Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b960-9\"><em>First Jersey Securities, Inc. v. Bergen, </em>605 F.2d 690, 696-697 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1074, 100 S.Ct. 1020, 62 L.Ed.2d 756 (1980). Adoption of Bethlehem\u2019s position would nullify the statutory enforcement plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-10\">Section 120(e) of the Act speaks of \u201cjudicial review of any penalty.\u201d But no penalty is payable until after the conclusion of administrative proceedings to determine whether the company has violated the Act. Moreover, \u00a7 307(g), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(g), prohibits a court from granting \u201cany stay, injunctive, or similar relief before final judgment\u201d in a \u00a7 120 controversy. On the whole, then, the statute supports EPA\u2019s position that judicial review should be deferred until \u201cafter all administrative remedies have been exhausted,\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 66.-81, and then only if a penalty is imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-11\">Section 120 was enacted by Congress in 1977 to combat what it perceived as recalci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>trance by industry in coming into compliance with Clean Air Act standards. Before then, \u00a7 113 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c-8 (current version at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7413), allowed a court to impose civil fines and even criminal penalties on violators. Despite \u00a7 113\u2019s sanctions, the uncertainty and delay of litigation made it profitable for violators to continue their noncompliance. Section 120 eliminates this incentive by assessing a mandatory administrative penalty equal to the economic value gained from continuing noncompliance. The sanction is designed to end the competitive advantage realized by firms that do not install or operate necessary pollution control equipment. The offender gains nothing by fostering administrative and judicial delays, because the penalty begins to accrue on the date of notification by EPA. This unique, economic sanction is independent of, and in addition to, whatever judicial penalties might be imposed under \u00a7 113.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">Perhaps it is true, as Bethlehem contends, that a company cited for noncompliance may feel coerced into spending money for more efficient pollution controls than it sincerely believes it needs, rather than risk an unfavorable outcome after extended litigation. We are not persuaded that this constitutes undue hardship. It may well be that the company\u2019s evaluation of its compliance status is unduly optimistic.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">At any rate, a company cited for noncompliance always has the option to contest its liability before EPA and, if necessary, appeal to the courts. If the company wins, no penalty is due. The only cost sustained by the company in that event would be for litigation expenses, and it is well-settled that they do not constitute irreparable injury. <em>See, e.g., Renegotiation Board v. Ban-nercraft Clothing Co, </em>415 U.S. at 24, 94 S.Ct. at 1040.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">On the other hand, if the agency prevails, the company would be charged with the amount of the noncompliance penalty. That is not to say that the \u00a7 120 assessment is punitive or confiscatory, however, for in theory it only recovers whatever financial advantage the company gained by continuing to violate the law. In short, we find no hardship warranting an exception to the exhaustion requirement here.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-12\">We conclude, therefore, that the court should not entertain Bethlehem\u2019s petition for review at this time because the company has failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. We intimate no view on the substantive issues raised here. The petition for review will be dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b957-8\">. Nevertheless, application of the exhaustion doctrine has been described as one of the most unsettled areas in the law. As Professor Davis expresses it, \u201cAccording to the holdings, exhaustion of administrative remedies is sometimes required for getting judicial review and sometimes not. The common judicial statement that one must exhaust administrative remedies before going to court is false almost as often as it is true.\u201d K. Davis, Administrative Law of the Seventies \u00a7 20.01 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b957-12\">. Whether the exhaustion requirement is one going to the jurisdiction of the court or to its powers of discretion has led to interesting discussion. Much depends upon the circumstances of each case. Certainly, if exhaustion were always jurisdictional, it would not be possible for a government official to waive it and confer power on the court to hear the appeal. See <em>Mathews v. Diaz, </em>426 U.S. 67, 96 S.Ct. 1883, 48 L.Ed.2d 478 (1976). See <em>also, </em>K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7\u00a7 20.00-20.00-1 (Supp. 1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b958-6\">. To some extent, the factors discussed in the text are also important in assessing whether a controversy is \u201cripe\u201d for judicial review. <em>See e.g., e.g., Hooker Chemical Co. v. EPA, </em>642 F.2d 48 (3d Cir. 1981); <em>Wearley v. FTC, </em>616 F.2d 662 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 822, 101 S.Ct. 81, 66 L.Ed.2d 25 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b958-7\">.
