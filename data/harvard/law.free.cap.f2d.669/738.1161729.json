Courtesy Associates, Inc. (Courtesy), pursuant to a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract with the Department of Commerce, provided management and logistic services for the conference. Courtesy paid the amount billed by the Sheraton Park for space and food, including D.C. sales tax, after the hotel\u2019s charges had been approved by the Commerce Department\u2019s contracting officer. In this action, the United States seeks restitution from the District of Columbia for the amount of the sales tax paid by Courtesy and reimbursed, pursuant to the cost-plus-fixed-fee contract, by the United States. Precedent securely indicates that any municipality other than the District of Columbia could tax sales of this sort. <em>Alabama </em>v. <em>King &amp; Boozer, </em>314 U.S. 1, 62 S.Ct. 43, 86 L.Ed. 482 (1941); <em>United States v. Forst, </em>442 F.Supp. 920 (W.D.Va.1977), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>569 F.2d 811 (4th Cir. 1978). We conclude that Congress did not intend to place the District of Columbia on a footing different from other cities in this regard, and therefore hold that the United States is not entitled to the restitution it seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-19\">In the summer of 1977, the Department of Commerce began preparations for a five-day White House Conference on Balanced National Growth and Economic Development, to be held in Washington, D.C., January 29-F\u00e9bruary 2, 1978. Jerry Manolatos, Assistant Director for Conference Operations, selected the Sheraton Park Hotel as the Conference site after conferring with representatives of several hotels in the area. On August 2, 1977, on informal advice that the Sheraton Park had been selected, the hotel\u2019s representative wrote Manolatos:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-F\">Jerry, I understand that you will be working on a contract which will be ready within the next two months, however, for our records, if you would please sign and return the copy of my letter of agreement to you, we will be able to consider this a definite committment [sic].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ayr-dedup-0\">Appendix (A)74. The record does not indicate that Manolatos ever signed the agreement proffered by the Sheraton Park. It does show that in a reply letter dated Au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>gust 11, 1977, Manolatos confirmed his \u201cunderstanding of the agreement reached to date,\u201d and stated that he was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhWj\">currently working with our Procurement Division to develop a contract for Conference management and logistics, which will incorporate the items specified in your correspondence to us, the accommodations and meal costs, services to be provided by the hotel, and other items to be clarified within the next few weeks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4W\">A75. Manolatos and Sheraton Park personnel had further conversations during the summer concerning accommodations and meals the hotel would provide for the Conference. It bears emphasis, however, that the United States has never asserted Mano-latos had authority to bind the Government to an agreement of any kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">On September 30, 1977, the Department of Commerce entered into a contract with Courtesy Associates. In return for reimbursement of its costs plus a fixed fee, Courtesy would provide management and logistic services for the Conference. The contract, which specifically named the Sheraton Park Hotel as the Conference site, \u00b6 1V.A.3, A81, made Courtesy responsible for \u201call negotiations and coordination re: meals; purchasing procedures for observers; sleeping accommodations, [and] coordination of function rooms and workshops.\u201d \u00b6 1V.D.l.e, A85. After the Conference, upon approval of the Commerce Department, Courtesy was to pay the hotel bill; the Department would then reimburse Courtesy. \u00b6 IV.D.3.a., A91.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Upon entering into the contract, Courtesy assumed all responsibility for Conference goods, services, and facilities arrangements, \u201cincluding the negotiating and firming up of prices and quantities of space and food\u201d at the Sheraton Park. Tyler aff. \u00b6 5, A69. On January 3,1978, Courtesy sent the Sheraton Park a proposed agreement outlining arrangements for the procurement of space and food; an agent of the hotel signed a copy of the agreement and returned it to Courtesy. Stampfli aff. \u00b6 6, A58. The Conference proceeded as planned; the Sheraton Park billed Courtesy for the space and food, including in the bill the D.C. sales tax; Courtesy and the Department of Commerce approved the bill; and Courtesy paid it, with no protest about the sales tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">The United States thereafter commenced this action seeking to recover the amount of $8,199.95, the total sales tax billed by the Sheraton Park, paid by Courtesy without protest, and reimbursed by the United States. The complaint asserted three bases for the claim that the procurement at issue is not subject to taxation by the District of Columbia: first, the space and food supplied by the Sheraton Park were sales to the United States, exempt from tax under D.C.Code \u00a7 47-2605; second, the procurement at issue is \u201cconstitutionally immune\u201d from D.C. taxation because the \u201clegal incidence\u201d of the tax is upon the United States;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> third, Courtesy\u2019s procurement of hotel space and food was a sale for resale to the United States.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">The District of Columbia unsuccessfully moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the D.C.Superior Court has exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate D.C. tax controversies. The United States then sought and was granted summary judgment on the merits of its claim. In a brief order, the district court ruled that, in deal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>ing with the Sheraton Park, Courtesy served as an agent of the United States, and that the hotel space and food procurement was essentially a \u201cdirect purchase\u201d by the United States. Citing federal tax immunity decisions,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the district court declared the sales tax erroneously assessed against Courtesy and entered judgment for the United States in the amount demanded in the complaint. The District of Columbia appeals, urging that the district court (1) lacked subject matter jurisdiction, and (2) erred in determining that the procurement was not subject to the D.C. sales tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">The United States invoked jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1345, which provides generally for access to a federal forum in cases in which the United States is plaintiff:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-7\">Except as otherwise provided by Act of Congress, the district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions, suits or proceedings commenced by the United States ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">The District of Columbia, relying on D.C. Code \u00a7 11-1202, contends that Congress has vested exclusive authority to entertain challenges to D.C. taxation in the D.C. Superior Court, and has abolished all common-law remedies with respect to such taxation. D.C.Code \u00a7 11-1202 reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoIu\">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the jurisdiction of the Tax Division of the Superior Court to review the validity and amount of all assessments of tax made by the District of Columbia is exclusive. Effective on and after the effective date of the District of Columbia Court Reorganization Act of 1970, any common-law remedy with respect to assessment of tax in the District of Columbia and any equitable action to enjoin such assessments available in a court other than the former District of Columbia Tax Court is abolished.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-13\">It is undisputed that if the tax in question had been collected by any state or municipality in the nation other than the District of Columbia, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1345 would secure original jurisdiction in a federal district court. <em>E.g., United States v. Tax Commission, </em>421 U.S. 599, 95 S.Ct. 1872, 44 L.Ed.2d 404 (1975). The argument that Congress intended to establish a different rule for the District of Columbia is implausible.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While Congress may displace section 1345 in particular categories of cases if it so desires, courts will not infer such displacement unless Congress has made its intention plain. <em>See United States v. Kloman, </em>176 F.2d 27, 28 (D.C.Cir.1949) (quoting <em>United States v. UMW, </em>330 U.S. 258, 272, 67 S.Ct. 677, 685, 91 L.Ed. 884 (1947)); <em>United States v. Livingston, </em>179 F.Supp. 9, 12 (E.D.S.C.1959) (three-judge court), <em>aff\u2019d per curiam, </em>364 U.S. 281, 80 S.Ct. 1611, 4 L.Ed.2d 1719 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-14\">No clear indication of a congressional design to exclude this case from the district court\u2019s adjudicatory authority is discernible.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Indeed, as the United States points <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>out and the District of Columbia does not counter, there may be no provision in the D.C.Code embracing the claim asserted here. <em>See </em>D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 47-2617, -2618 (identifying persons who may seek tax refunds and appeal adverse administrative determinations).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The District of Columbia, acknowledging that the United States might have no recourse to any forum unless it can bring an action under section 1345, suggests that the Government could protect its rights \u201cby means of appropriate contract provisions,\u201d or by \u201cgetting its contractors to challenge [the tax].\u201d Reply Brief at 4. It is not probable that Congress would deliberately place such hurdles in the way of the challenge the Government seeks to present. <em>Cf. City of New Orleans </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 F.2d 21, 28 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>387 U.S. 944, 87 S.Ct. 2076, 18 L.Ed.2d 1330 (1967).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">In short, the threshold question raised by the District of Columbia has only one answer compatible with this court\u2019s precedent and sensible analysis: this is a civil action commenced by the United States for which Congress did not \u201cotherwise provide\u201d; it is therefore an action within the subject matter jurisdiction of the district court as conferred by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1345.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">In entering judgment for the United States, the district court ruled that Courtesy was an \u201cagent\u201d of the United States and that the procurement of accommodations and meals \u201cwas essentially a direct purchase by the United States.\u201d Apparently analogizing exemption for sales to the United States under the D.C.Code to the Federal Government\u2019s immunity from state and local taxation under the Constitution, the district court cited two decisions dealing with federal tax immunity as it bears on transactions involving federal contractors: <em>Alabama v. King &amp; Boozer, </em>314 U.S. 1, 62 S.Ct. 43, 86 L.Ed. 482 (1941), and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Livingston, </em>179 F.Supp. 9 (E.D.S. C. 1959) (three-judge court), <em>aff\u2019d per cu-riam, </em>364 U.S. 281, 80 S.Ct. 1611, 4 L.Ed.2d 1719 (1960). Before turning directly to the D. C. sales tax, therefore, we treat the question whether the Federal Government\u2019s constitutionally based tax immunity would shield the procurement at issue were the taxing jurisdiction a state or a municipality other than the federal city.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-12\">The Federal Government\u2019s constitutionally based immunity, derived from the supremacy clause, <em>see McCulloch v. Maryland, </em>17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316, 4 L.Ed. 579 (1819), once generated \u201ca bewilderingly complex array of judicial decisions.\u201d L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 394 (1978). Current doctrine, however, establishes a rule of \u201clegal incidence.\u201d Absent congressional consent, a state is barred by the supremacy clause from imposing a tax if the legal incidence of the levy is on the United States, but the Constitution presents no barrier if the legal incidence falls elsewhere:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-13\">The Constitution immunizes the United States and its property from taxation by the States, <em>M\u2019Culloch v. Maryland, </em>4 Wheat. 316 [4 L.Ed. 579] but it does not forbid a tax whose legal incidence is upon a contractor doing business with the United States, <em>even though the economic burden of the tax, by contract or otherwise, is ultimately borne by the United States.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number><em>United States v. Boyd, </em>378 U.S. 39, 44, 84 S.Ct. 1518, 1521, 12 L.Ed.2d 713 (1964) (emphasis added). <em>See generally </em>L. Tribe, <em>supra, </em>at 394-404; Tribe, <em>Intergovernmental Immunities in Litigation, Taxation, and Regulation: Separation of Powers Issues in Controversies About Federalism, </em>89 Harv.L. Rev. 682, 704-13 (1976) (although the Court\u2019s doctrine may appear wooden, it appropriately safeguards Congress\u2019 mediating role in deciding, free from state or federal executive intrusion, when to confer and when to deny immunity).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Resort to an \u201ceconomic burden\u201d test, barring a tax levy if the charge is ultimately passed through to the United States, was firmly rejected in <em>Alabama v. King &amp; Boozer, </em>314 U.S. 1, 62 S.Ct. 43, 86 L.Ed. 482 (1941). That pathmarking decision sustained state taxation of federal contractors\u2019 purchases of lumber to be used in construction of an army camp. The terms of the federal contract required the cost of the tax to be passed on to the United States. Despite the conceded immediate economic burden to the Government, the Court ruled that the only factor of constitutional significance is the legal incidence of the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Alabama law, like District of Columbia law, made the seller collector of the tax, but the obligation to pay fell on the purchaser. \u201cThe precise question\u201d in <em>King &amp; Boozer, </em>therefore, was \u201cwhether the Government <em>became obligated to pay for the lumber </em>and so was the purchaser whom the [Alabama] statute taxes, but for the claimed immunity.\u201d 314 U.S. at 10, 62 S.Ct. at 46 (emphasis added). Notwithstanding the substantial control the Federal Government exercised over the contractors in <em>King &amp; Boozer, </em>the Court determined that the United States was not the \u201cpurchaser\u201d of the lumber within the meaning of the Alabama tax statute. The Government\u2019s control of the contractors did not arm the contractors with any authority to pledge the credit of the United States. The contractors, not the Federal Government, were bound to pay the purchase price to the vendor. <em>Id. </em>at 12, 62 S.Ct. at 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">Language in <em>King &amp; Boozer </em>suggested that a different result might obtain in cases where the contractor is authorized to pledge the credit of the United States. <em>Kern-Limerick, Inc. v. Scurlock, </em>347 U.S. 110, 74 S.Ct. 403, 98 L.Ed. 546 (1954), presented just such a situation. The Court held impermissible an Arkansas sales tax levied on purchases by a federal contractor where the Government\u2019s contract (1) specifically identified the contractor as the \u201cpurchasing agent\u201d of the United States <em>and </em>(2) made the Government directly liable to the seller. The \u201csignificant difference\u201d between <em>Kern-Limerick </em>and <em>King &amp; Boozer, </em>according to the Court, was not any distinction in the economic impact of the Alabama and Arkansas taxes, nor in the degree of discretion the contractors had in selecting suppliers. Rather, it was the express stipulation absent in the <em>King &amp; Boozer </em>federal contract and present in the <em>Kern-Limerick </em>contract: \u201cThis purchase is made by the Government. The Government shall be obligated to the Vendor for the purchase price .. .. \u201d 347 U.S. at 119, 74 S.Ct. at 409. The contract\u2019s explicit identification of \u201cthe Government\u201d as the purchaser, the Court concluded, could not be avoided by Arkansas\u2019 attempt to designate the contractor as the purchaser. Under the contract, the United States was the disclosed sole purchaser. <em>Id. </em>at 121, 74 S.Ct. at 410. Hence, the legal incidence of the tax fell on the Government, not on the contractor, and federal tax immunity sheltered the transaction from any state levy. <em>See id. </em>at 120-21, 74 S.Ct. at 409-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\"><em>United States v. Forst, </em>442 F.Supp. 920, 924 (W.D.Va.1977), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>569 F.2d 811 (4th Cir. 1978), cogently synthesizes the dispositions in <em>King &amp; Boozer </em>and <em>Kern-Limerick:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-10\">These two cases make it clear that it is not critical who holds title to the purchased items as between the United States and its contractor. Nor is the degree of control over the contractor that the United States exercises with respect to the purchases critical. <em>The key factor is whose credit, between the United States and the contractor, is bound by the purchasing agreement with the seller.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>(Emphasis added.) In sum, absent a federal contract specifically designating the contractor as an agent authorized to pledge the Government\u2019s credit or explicitly rendering the Government directly liable to the seller, state sales taxes, exacted from federal government contractors, encounter no Court-directed federal immunity shoal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Congress, of course, may confer such immunity. <em>See United States v. New Mexico, </em>624 F.2d 111, 116, 121 (10th Cir. 1980), <em>cert. granted, </em>450 U.S. 909, 101 S.Ct. 1346, 67 L.Ed.2d 332 (1981). But in view of the potential impact on the revenue bases of the states, the judgment should be made by the national legislature, the branch best equipped by its structure and constituency to accommodate the respective interests of the states and the nation. The determination, \u201cintrinsically political\u201d as it is, should not be left to judicial resolution based on shades of differences in particular federal contracts, and even less to government contracting officers dominantly concerned with federal expenditures and not with preservation of state tax revenues against shrinkage. <em>See </em>Tribe, <em>supra, </em>89 Harv.L.Rev. at 711 &amp; nn.135-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">As the foregoing description of current precedent demonstrates, federal, con-stitulionally based tax immunity would not bar the levy of a sales tax on procurements of the sort at issue here were the tax imposed by a state. The legal incidence of the District of Columbia sales tax is on the purchaser.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Under <em>King &amp; Boozer </em>and <em>Kern-Limerick, </em>a cost-plus-fixed-fee contractor, <em>unless explicitly designated by the fedcrai contract as an agent with authority to pledge the credit of the United States,</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>qualifies as a purchaser subject to sales tax exactions. That bright line test constrains the judiciary from drawing fine distinctions in an area best left to congressional control. Courtesy, the federal contractor in this case, pledged only its own credit to the vendor, Sheraton Park. Nor does the United States argue otherwise. It has never asserted, nor could it on the basis of the Government contract in the record, that Courtesy had authority to pledge the credit of the United States. Lacking such authority, Courtesy cannot rank as a \u201cpurchasing agent\u201d for the United States. Courtesy purchased on its own account and, as is generally the case with cost-plus-fixed-fee contractors, thereafter passed the cost onto the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">In addition to <em>King &amp; Boozer, </em>the district court considered as relevant authority <em>Unit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number><em>ed States v. Livingston, </em>179 F.Supp. 9 (E.D. S.C.1959) (three-judge court), <em>aff\u2019d per curiam, </em>364 U.S. 281, 80 S.Ct. 1611, 4 L.Ed.2d 1719 (1960). The court apparently believed that <em>Livingston </em>justified characterization of the procurement here as a \u201cdirect purchase\u201d by the United States. <em>Livingston </em>held immune from South Carolina sales and use tax the purchases of a contractor performing management services for the Atomic Energy Commission who undertook the work not for profit, but as a contribution to the defense effort. The district court, although it attempted to draw support from <em>Kern-Limerick, </em>relied heavily on the fact that the contractor accepted only a one-dollar fee for its services. 179 F.Supp. at 16-22. The Supreme Court later treated <em>Livingston </em>as confined to its specific facts, noting the \u201c \u2018extraordinary\u2019 contractual relationship between [the contractor] and AEC.\u201d <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>378 U.S. 39, 45 n.6, 84 S.Ct. 1518, 1522 n.6, 12 L.Ed.2d 713 (1964). The Court held in <em>Boyd </em>that purchases of another AEC management services contractor were subject to state contractor\u2019s use tax: \u201cBecause the services involved herein are performed for a substantial fee in the course of the contractor\u2019s commercial operation the <em>Livingston </em>decision is not controlling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, <em>Livingston </em>is not controlling in this case. Courtesy undertook the work, not as a patriotic gesture, but for a substantial fixed fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Had the conference Courtesy was engaged to facilitate taken place in Annapolis or Williamsburg, we would be obliged to hold that federal law does not bar Maryland or Virginia from imposing a tax on the space and food sold by the hotel. To rule otherwise would ignore, as the dissenting opinion consistently does, the emphasis the Supreme Court has placed on a pledge of the Government\u2019s credit as the key indicator of immunity. Because the conference took place in the District of Columbia, however, we must determine whether, as the United States argues, the D.C. sales tax exempts transactions outside the scope of federal tax immunity. Only two of the several D.C. sales tax exemptions are relevant to this controversy. One is D.C.Code \u00a7 47-2605(m), which exempts \u201c[s]ales which a State would be without power to tax under the limitations of the Constitution of the United States.\u201d As explained above, the Constitution would not prevent a state from taxing the procurement at issue here, so this exemption provides no support for the restitution claim the United States asserts.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">The other exemption is section 47-2605(a), which exempts sales to the United States.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The United States contends that \u201cthis exemption is broader than the scope of the constitutional immunity of certain sales from state taxation.\u201d Brief for the Appellee at 7. The District of Columbia, on the other hand, maintains that the exemption is coextensive with constitutionality based federal tax immunity. Without calling our attention to any precedent specifically in point, the United States advances three arguments in support of its position.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">First, the United States urges, section 47-2605 exempts certain sales \u201cwithout regard to . .. whether [they] would be constitutionally immune from state sales taxation.\u201d Brief for the Appellee at 21. As an example, the United States cites D.C.Code \u00a7 47-2605(q), which exempts sales of materials to be incorporated permanently in any war memorial authorized by Congress to be erected on public grounds of the United States. The drift of this argument is not readily apparent. Congress exempted a variety of sales from the tax, but the policies behind other exemptions shed no bright light on the intended scope of exemption (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-12\">Second, the United States argues that because another provision, section 47-2605(m), already exempts sales that could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>not be taxed were the District of Columbia a state, exemption (a) must go further. But nothing indicates that the exemptions were drawn with meticulous care to avoid any overlap. Moreover, it appears that Congress, when it adopted exemption (m), did not focus specifically on federal tax immunity. The only reference to exemption (m) in the legislative history suggests that Congress had in mind the limits imposed by the interstate commerce clause. <em>See </em>95 Cong.Rec. 6083 (1949) (statement of Sen. Hunt, sponsor of the legislation). The exemption (m) administrative regulations also suggest only commerce clause considerations. <em>See </em>16 D.C.R.R. \u00a7 203.1(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">The United States further relies on an administrative regulation interpreting exemption (a), 16 D.C.R.R. \u00a7 203.1(a), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-5\">Sales to the United States or the District or any instrumentality thereof. For the purposes of this exemption, vendors may treat as nontaxable the receipts from, and shall be relieved from the duty of collecting their reimbursement for tax on, sales to the United States and to the District of Columbia on any purchase order made by an authorized purchasing officer or by contract in which either the United States or the District of Columbia or any instrumentality of either Government is a party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">It is hardly evident that this regulation indicates a broadened scope for the United States\u2019 tax immunity; the regulation can as readily be read as an attempt to codify federal tax immunity precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">Since the text of the exemption for sales to the United States does not supply an altogether crisp response to the parties\u2019 contentions, the legislative history of the D.C. sales tax bears consideration. The District of Columbia Sales Tax Act was enacted in 1949 as Title I of the District of Columbia Revenue Act of 1949, Pub.L.No.81-76, 63 Stat. 112. The notion of a sales tax, however, had been ripening for some time. Ten years earlier, the House of Representatives commissioned Dr. Chester B. Pond to conduct a study of the tax structure of the District of Columbia. Although Dr. Pond recommended the enactment of a sales tax as part of a comprehensive revision of the D.C. tax laws, <em>see </em>H.R.Doc.No.108, 76th Cong., 1st Sess. 105 (1939), the idea proved controversial. For a decade, sales tax proposals, introduced in a number of revenue bills, were consistently defeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">When the sales tax finally passed in 1949, congressional attention still centered on the wisdom of such a tax as a method to raise revenue. Exemptions from the tax did not receive the focused scrutiny of Congress, either in committee reports or floor debate. One clear theme is sounded throughout the legislative history, however: Congress intended to place the District on an equal footing with the states. The Senate Report stated, \u201cThe provisions of title I of this bill impose a sales tax for the District of Columbia, which is predicated upon the same theory as are the sales-tax laws of many states.\u201d S.Rep.No.260, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 7, reprinted in 1949 U.S.Code Cong.Serv. 1297, 1304. The House Report contained identical language. H.R.Rep.No.315, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 2 (1949). The Senate Report also quoted from Dr. Pond\u2019s 1939 study:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ani-dedup-0\">For practical purposes, it is necessary to view the District as a State. Regarded in this light, it follows that the limitations placed upon State taxing power should apply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">S.Rep.No.260, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 4 reprinted in 1949 U.S.Code Cong.Serv. 1300 (quoting H.R.Doc.No.108, 76th Cong., 1st Sess. 102 (1939)).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">Thus, although the legislative history does not specifically address exemption (a), it does display a clear purpose to pattern the D.C. sales tax on state sales tax laws and to limit the District\u2019s taxing power in the manner that state taxation authority is limited. The 1949 act was directed toward restoring the fiscal integrity of the District. No reason has been suggested why Congress would be less sensitive to the impact of an expansive federal immunity on the District\u2019s treasury than Congress has been with regard to the fiscal interests of the states. <em>See United States v. New Mexico, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number><em>supra, </em>624 F.2d at 116: \u201cCongress, openly sensitive to the impact on state treasuries, has not extended tax immunity to any class of contractors.\u201d We therefore conclude that exemption (a) is, as the District maintains, coextensive with constitutionally based federal tax immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">That should be the end of the inquiry. The United States, however, has tendered a further argument premised on 16 D.C.R.R. \u00a7 203.1(a), which exempts sales by contract to which the United States or any instrumentality thereof is a party. As the United States reads the regulation, and now construes the facts, there is a dispositive contract bar to the tax at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">In this court, the United States featured beyond other arguments the contention that the Sheraton Park\u2019s sale of space and food was pursuant to a contract the United States had concluded with the hotel, before Courtesy entered the picture.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The United States never asserted the existence of such a contract to the district court; the argument appears for the first time on appeal. After examining the record, we conclude that no such contract existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">The sole support in the record for the existence of a contract between the United States and the Sheraton Park is a vague reference, in the contract between Courtesy and the United States, A91, to the \u201csatisfactory completion of [the hotel\u2019s] contract with the White House Conference.\u201d Although the White House Conference was sometimes referred to as an entity, it was in fact an event. Thus, there is slim reason to assume that the words \u201cWhite House Conference\u201d were intended as a synonym for \u201cUnited States.\u201d The reference could as readily be understood to mean the hotel\u2019s contract with Courtesy.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">In contrast, the contracts between the United States and Courtesy and between Courtesy and the Sheraton Park are not in doubt. The United States-Courtesy contract is specific in its provisions: Courtesy was responsible for paying the vendor for the rooms and meals, \u00b6 IV.D.3, A91; Courtesy could seek reimbursement only for expenses actually incurred, \u00b6 VIII.6, A98, that is, only after it paid the hotel. In accordance with these provisions, the hotel billed Courtesy for the accommodations and meals; Courtesy paid the bill, after Department of Commerce approval; and the Department reimbursed Courtesy.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-12\">An official of the Department of Commerce, Jerry Manolatos, engaged in discussions with the hotel before selection of Courtesy as the contractor. The United States attempts to argue that these discussions formed the basis for a contract. But as far as the record indicates, Manolatos did not sign the hotel\u2019s proffered \u201cletter of agreement.\u201d A74. Instead, he merely restated the intended conference dates and preliminary plans for the event, noting that he was \u201cworking with the Procurement Division to develop a contract for Conference management and logistics.\u201d A75. The reason for Manolatos\u2019 circumspection seems evident: as the Contracting Officer\u2019s Technical Representative, Tyler aff., A68, he had no authority \u201cto make any commitments or otherwise obligate the Government or authorize any changes which affect the contract price, terms or conditions.\u201d A97. In dealings with the Federal Government, the rule is familiar: only those specifically delegated contracting authority may bind the United States. <em>See </em>41 C.F.R. \u00a7 13-1.450-1(c): \u201cPersonnel not delegated contracting authority may not commit the Department, formally or informally, to any type of contractual obligation either before or after contract award.\u201d The Government does not assert, even now, that Manolatos, <em>the only Commerce Department official alleged to have negotiated with the Sheraton Park, </em>had any authority to enter into a contract on behalf of the United States.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>Even under principles of contract law generally applicable to private parties, the Manolatos-Sheraton Park communications would not appear to amount to a contract. Although Mandatos had specified dates and discussed room availability with the hotel, he never worked out the details of the undertaking. The record is clear that Courtesy had full responsibility for determining the exact prices and quantities of space and food procured: \u201cAfter consummation of the [U.S.-Courtesy] contract, Courtesy assumed all responsibility for firming up and arranging for all Conference goods, services and facilities, <em>including the negotiating </em>and firming up <em>of prices and quantities </em>of space and food being procured from the Sheraton Park.\u201d Tyler aff. \u00b6 5, A69 (emphasis added). <em>See also </em>Stampfli aff. \u00b6 11, A59. Mandatos, the record suggests, merely opened the negotiations and set part of the foundation upon which Courtesy subsequently executed a contract with the hotel.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">We conclude that the space and food were not sold \u201cby contract in which . . . the United States . . . [was] a party.\u201d Thus, even under the D.C. regulation (16 D.C.R.R. \u00a7 203.1(a)) as read by the United States, the sale in question would not be exempt from taxation. Courtesy was not designated by contract as a \u201cpurchasing agent\u201d for the United States and, most importantly, Courtesy had no authority to pledge the Government\u2019s credit. We therefore reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case with instructions to enter judgment for the District of Columbia.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AS-\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b796-6\">. Even if the \u201clegal incidence\u201d of the tax fell on the United States, constitutionally grounded federal tax immunity from state taxation would not bar the tax in question. The D.C. sales tax was enacted by Congress, not by a state. The United States abandoned this argument at an early stage of the litigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b796-7\">. In the district court, the United States pressed this argument vigorously and cited D.C.Code \u00a7 47-2601.14(a) in support of its contention. A126-29. The United States has not renewed the \u201csale for resale\u201d argument on appeal, perhaps in recognition of D.C.Code \u00a7 47-2607, which provides that in the absence of a valid certificate of resale, receipts from a sale shall be deemed taxable. The record reflects no resale certificate. Moreover, as the District of Columbia pointed out in the district court, Courtesy \u201cwas not a middleman in the wholesale-retail chain,\u201d A136, thus a \u201csale for resale\u201d exemption does not appear to accommodate the procurement at issue. <em>See United States v.

The Government contract in this case, however, plainly does not fall within the <em>Kern-Limerick </em>fold. It contains nothing resembling the language held to immunize purchases in that case.

These accommodations, consisting of meeting rooms, sleeping rooms, and meals, were furnished directly to the government and to the participants who were invited by the United States to attend the White House Conference on Balanced National Growth and Economic Development at the expense of the United States. In my judgment the majority fails to recognize the fundamental fact that the transaction here was one involving the government, directly and through the acts of its agents, as a party to a sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-12\">When the concrete facts of this case are considered, it becomes clear that the District of Columbia has levied a tax the legal incidence of which is upon the United States government. The record shows, and no amount of logic can deny, that Courtesy was here acting purely as the government\u2019s agent. The Conference, and implicitly the purchase of hotel accommodations with which we are here concerned, was first au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>thorized by a specific Act of Congress. Then, in direct dealings between the United States (i.e., the Department of Commerce) and the Sheraton-Park Hotel (Hotel), the principal details of the Hotel accommodations were agreed upon. Only after this initial agreement did the Department of Commerce (Commerce) and Courtesy, Inc., (Courtesy) enter into a \u201cmanagement and logistics\u201d contract to follow up on the arrangements already made between Commerce and the Hotel and to furnish certain additional services as needed by the Conference. Courtesy, negotiating openly on behalf of the United States operating as the \u201cWhite House Conference\u201d (Conference), then made the final arrangements for the necessary hotel accommodations. <em>See United States v. Livingston, </em>179 F.Supp. 9, 22 (E.D.S.C.1959) (three judge court), <em>aff\u2019d per curiam, </em>364 U.S. 281, 80 S.Ct. 1611, 4 L.Ed.2d 1719 (1960). Thus, insofar as the hotel accommodations were concerned, the contract with Courtesy merely adopted the principal arrangements for the Conference previously agreed upon between the Hotel and the \u201cWhite House Conference\u201d acting through an official of the Department of Commerce who was charged with getting the Conference under way. I would hold that the hotel accommodations were exempt from the D.C. sales tax as a \u201csale[ ] to the United States\u201d under D.C.Code \u00a7 47-2605(a) (1973), <em>recodified as </em>\u00a7 47-2005(1) (1981) and affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">The District of Columbia Code provides that gross receipts from \u201c[sjales to the United States\u201d are exempt from the sales (gross receipts) tax. D.C.Code \u00a7 47-2605(a). The regulations under this statutory exemption for sales to the United States state more specifically:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-5\">Part 203 <em>Exempt and Nontaxable Sales. </em>Sec. 203.1 \u2014 -Exempt and Nontaxable Sales \u2014 Gross receipts from the following sales shall be exempt from the tax imposed by the Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-6\">(a) Sales to the United States or the District or any instrumentality thereof. For the purposes of this exemption, vendors may treat as nontaxable the receipts from, and shall be relieved from the duty of collecting their reimbursement for tax on, <em>sales to the United States ... on any purchase order made by any authorized purchasing officer or by contract in which </em>... <em>the United States . . . or any instrumentality [thereof] ... is a party.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">16 D.C.R.R. \u00a7 203.1 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">The majority holds that these provisions state an exemption from the D.C. sales tax no broader in scope than the immunity afforded by the Constitution itself. The very structure of the majority\u2019s analysis \u2014 reaching the constitutional issue <em>before </em>deciding the question of statutory interpretation\u2014 anticipates the problems it soon encounters. For by imposing its novel constitutional analysis upon the case before treating the statutory exemption, the court poses the statutory question in a way that assumes its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-11\">The entire statutory analysis is cast solely in terms of whether the D.C. Code provision is \u201ccoextensive\u201d with the <em>majority\u2019s reading </em>of the constitutional scope of tax immunity. The majority first holds that the constitutional immunity extends only to contractors \u201cspecifically designated\u201d as purchasing agents; second, it holds that the D.C. Code must be read as simply codifying the constitutional rule. It then deduces that the Code must therefore exempt only sales to \u201cspecifically designated\u201d agents. This tidy syllogism simply begs the question of how the D.C. Code could have enacted a gloss on the Constitution that no court has ever\u2014 until today \u2014 accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-12\">I would follow the wise custom of deciding the statutory question before reaching out to consider an issue of constitutional magnitude, and hold that the statute here exempts this transaction from the D.C. gross receipts tax. The record shows that the transaction in question here was a \u201csale to the United States\u201d under the statute. The facts demonstrating that Courtesy was a \u201cpurchasing agent\u201d within the regulation interpreting the statutory exemption are discussed in some detail below. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>because the court chooses to cast its statutory analysis in terms of the \u201ccoextensiveness\u201d of the constitutional and statutory provisions, it is first necessary to show that the Constitution does <em>not </em>compel the restrictive reading of the statutory exemption adopted by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">The majority\u2019s theory of constitutional tax immunity rests upon the premise that \u201cin view of the potential impact on the revenue bases of the states, the judgment [to confer tax immunity] should be made by the national legislature,\u201d not by the executive branch. At 744. Congress, it stresses, must be left \u201cfree from . . . executive intrusion\u201d in determining whether a state\u2019s (here, the District\u2019s) power to tax is to be subordinated to particular federal interests. <em>Id. </em>at 743. This theory, whatever its merits in the abstract, is plainly an inaccurate (or, if accurate, then an incomplete) description of the law, as an examination of the relevant Supreme Court precedents makes evident. In its attempt to remedy the flaws in its analysis, the majority produces a rule of decision that is at odds with the law and logic of controlling Supreme Court doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">The court begins by positing, without offering any support in law,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a theory of exclusive congressional authority in the area of tax immunity. Unless and until Congress has itself positively conferred tax immunity, runs the theory, the courts are powerless to conclude that a state tax levied against a government contractor is one upon the government. The majority\u2019s initial premise, then, takes the form of a constitutionally mandated \u201cbright line\u201d drawn to protect the exclusive authority of Congress to decide which federal activities are to be afforded immunity from state taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">The majority then declares that this \u201cbright line\u201d is a function of the legal incidence of the state tax involved, legal incidence being the established constitutional litmus for immunity. At 744. While this <em>conclusion </em>may appear to state the law of tax immunity as declared by the Supreme Court, the inadequacy of the majority\u2019s explanatory <em>theory </em>is readily apparent from its efforts to reconcile those decisions with the analytical framework it has created from whole cloth. The court, in attempting to reconcile the case of <em>Kern-Limerick, Inc. v. Scurlock, </em>347 U.S. 110, 74 S.Ct. 403, 98 L.Ed. 546 (1954), is forced to depart significantly from the foundation of its analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-9\">In <em>Kern-Limerick, </em>the government contractor was given contractual responsibility to \u201chandle all payments\u201d to suppliers. 347 U.S. at 119, 74 S.Ct. at 409. Consequently, it appeared to be, under the applicable state law, the party upon whom the legal incidence of the gross receipts tax there involved fell. 347 U.S. at 111, 74 S.Ct. at 405. The Court, however, held that the Constitution prohibited the tax from being levied upon the contractor. Its reasoning was that since the federal contract explicitly provided that the United States was to be \u201cobligated\u201d to perform its contractor\u2019s duties, the contractor was acting merely as the government\u2019s purchasing agent; the incidence of the tax, therefore, actually fell upon the United States as principal. Attempting to reconcile this result with its own general theory of immunity, the majority lays down the narrowest possible rule that will cover the case. It is that in instances in which the contractor is <em>\u201cexplicitly designated by the federal contract as an agent with authority to pledge the credit of the United States,\u201d </em>the incidence of the tax paid by the contractor shall be deemed to fall on the United States. At 744. Since the contract between the government and Courtesy in the present case contains no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>such \u201cexplicit designation\u201d of Courtesy as an agent, the majority concludes, the tax\u2019s incidence here was not upon the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The majority asserts that its new \u201cexplicit designation\u201d rule is compelled by the Constitution. But to the contrary, the cases show without question that <em>the Constitution compels no such \u201cexplicit designation\u201d rule at all. </em>The proof of this is found most readily in <em>Kern-Limerick </em>itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">There, it was <em>the language of a contract drafted by the executive branch </em>which determined the applicability of the constitutional immunity from state taxation. While this holding is certainly consistent with the majority\u2019s announced rule that \u201cexplicit\u201d contractual designation can confer immunity upon a government contractor, at the same time it makes plain that the power to confer that immunity is not one that must be <em>exercised </em>by Congress itself. Rather, it is one that may be exercised by the executive branch in the course of carrying out <em>congressionally authorized </em>government objectives. The question is not simply what the contract says; it is what Congress has said it <em>may </em>say.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">To hold that Congress\u2019 power with respect to tax immunity may be exercised by the executive is not to say that immunity may be conferred \u201cby the stroke of the draftsman\u2019s pen.\u201d <em>United States v. Township of Muskegon, </em>355 U.S. 484, 487, 78 S.Ct. 483, 485, 2 L.Ed.2d 436 (1958). On the contrary, it is the majority\u2019s approach that would seem to me to \u201cpermit any government functionary to draw the constitutional line by changing a few words in a contract.\u201d <em>Kern-Limerick, </em>347 U.S. at 126, 74 S.Ct. at 412 (Douglas, J., dissenting), <em>quoted in </em>At 744 n.8. It is rather only to state the rule, apparent from numerous Supreme Court decisions, that it is the legal <em>substance </em>of the relationship between the government and its contractor, rather than its contractual <em>form, </em>that defines the constitutional \u201cline\u201d between immunity from and liability for state taxes. \u201c[T]he duty rests on this Court to decide for itself facts or constructions upon which federal constitutional issues rest.\u201d 347 U.S. at 121, 74 S.Ct. at 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-11\">Just as \u201c[c]onstitutional immunity from state taxation does not rest on such insubstantial formalities as whether the [contractor] using government property is formally designated a \u2018lessee,\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Township of Muskegon, </em>355 U.S. at 486, 78 S.Ct. at 485,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the <em>formal designation </em>(or lack thereof) of Courtesy as a \u201cpurchasing agent\u201d cannot simply dispose of the question of whether the tax\u2019s incidence falls upon the government. Such designation may perhaps be a <em>sufficient </em>condition for so finding,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but it is not, in my opinion, a <em>necessary </em>one. The Constitution not only permits but requires us to determine on the basis of <em>all </em>the facts in the record whether a government contractor is indeed an agent of the government to the extent that a tax levied upon it is one falling upon the government itself. \u201cIn determining whether these taxes violate the government\u2019s constitutional immunity, we must look through the form and behind labels to substance.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number><em>City of Detroit v. Murray Corp., </em>355 U.S. 489, 492, 78 S.Ct. 458, 460, 2 L.Ed.2d 441 (1958).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">The majority is of course aware that the principle of exclusive congressional authority must be tempered in order to permit the executive sufficient room to carry out Congress\u2019 directives. It offers \u201cexplicit designation\u201d as a rule by which the courts are to gauge whether the executive has exceeded the bounds of its authority, apparently in accordance with the view that \u201cjwjhile Congress may confer immunity with a word, an executive agency must clearly manifest the principal-agent relationship with all its ramifications\u201d if immunity is to be found. <em>United States v. New Mexico, supra, </em>624 F.2d at 121. I have little quarrel with the principle thus stated. But the majority would make \u201cexplicit designation\u201d the <em>sole </em>test for evaluating the executive\u2019s use of its authority. For me, a \u201cclear manifestation\u201d can emerge, as it does here, equally well from the acts of the parties to a contract as from the language they employ.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Where there is serious doubt as to whether the government\u2019s immunity is sought to be improperly conferred on the private activities of a government contractor, the majority\u2019s \u201cbright line\u201d can serve to ensure that private interests do not enjoy a privilege which only the government may enjoy. However, just as the mere presence of such language cannot conclusively resolve such doubts in favor of immunity where it is clear that a contractor does not act as the government\u2019s agent, its absence should not lead mechanically to the conclusion that immunity is inapplicable. In short, where all the factual circumstances of a case make it plain that the incidence of a tax is upon the government, <em>the relevant \u201cbright line\u201d has already been drawn by those facts. </em>Affirmative contractual language may tend to buttress a conclusion that immunity is applicable, as it did in <em>Kern-Limerick, </em>just as negative language may support the opposite inference.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But I simply cannot see any justification for permitting the <em>absence </em>of plain contractual language to reverse a conclusion otherwise compelled by the plain facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in this area at once deny that form governs over substance in determining the legal incidence of a tax and establish that the executive may be empowered to carry out the business of government by electing or declining, as it sees fit, to appoint contractors as agents of the government. <em>See Kern-Limerick, </em>347 U.S. at 114, 74 S.Ct. at 406 (under act of Congress so providing, Navy could \u201cuse agents other than its own official personnel, to handle the <em>detail of purchase\u201d </em>(emphasis added)). Such decisions, when they are made within the contours of applicable congressional directives, pose no threat to the constitutional \u201cmediating role\u201d of Congress in reconciling state and federal interests. They are properly viewed as falling within the scope of the executive\u2019s authority to implement the laws. \u201cWhen there is no prohibition of a particular type of contract and no direction to use a particular type, the contracting officers are free to follow business practices.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 116, 74 S.Ct. at 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">In the instant case, far from there being a specific congressional \u201cprohibition\u201d or \u201cdirection\u201d regarding the contracts to be let in arranging the Conference, we have a specific congressional command to the President to call the Conference and to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"afn-dedup-0\">use appropriated funds <em>and act as may be necessary and appropriate </em>without regard to the provisions of section 551 of Title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>31, U.S. Code, section 34 of Title 40, U.S. Code and section 5, Title 41 U.S. Code.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2e9\">Pub.L. 95-31 \u00a7 202(d), 91 Stat. 170 (1977) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Congress\u2019 request to the President to call the Conference, and its grant of authority to use appropriated funds <em>and act as may be necessary or appropriate </em>without regard to statutory provisions that normally restrict the executive in the means it may employ to carry out acts of Congress in awarding government contracts,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> leave no doubt about the <em>authority </em>of the Department of Commerce to enter into all \u201cnecessary and appropriate\u201d contracts for the Conference, including the one with Courtesy.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Under the legislation authorizing the Conference, Commerce was \u201cfree to follow business practices,\u201d <em>Kern-Limerick, </em>347 U.S. at 116, 74 S.Ct. at 407, including the retention of Courtesy as its agent. The majority\u2019s claim that a finding of immunity would somehow threaten Congress\u2019 power in the immunity field is entirely undermined by this evidence showing that Congress specifically chose to delegate its power to the capable discretion of the President. One need not argue with the majority\u2019s view that tax immunity is \u201can area best left to congressional control,\u201d At 744, to conclude that here, Congress has in the interest of expediency explicitly <em>relinquished </em>its control over the Conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">In short, there is no reason to suppose that Congress\u2019 authority must be preserved against Congress\u2019 <em>own decision </em>to delegate that authority. The majority\u2019s \u201cbright line\u201d ultimately serves only to create a dilemma: either it would, in the name of exclusive congressional authority, place unreasonable limits upon Congress\u2019 ability to pursue its policies by granting the executive the power independently to make contracts naming agents; or it would permit the executive unfettered discretion to create tax immunity simply through a \u201cstroke of the draftsman\u2019s pen\u201d expressly naming a contractor as an agent. The \u201cexplicit designation\u201d rule would compel the adoption of one or the other of these alternatives, neither of which is the law of the land. The proper middle course is steered by an analysis which focuses upon the degree of discretion vested in the executive by Congress, and, finding such discretion, upon the relationship between the government and its contractor established by the factual circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-10\">Having concluded that Congress here intended the President to have broad authority over the conduct of the Conference, I proceed to consider whether Courtesy acted as the agent of the government under its contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">The nature of the immunity question does require the initial application of principles beyond those traditionally governing the question of agency. <em>United States </em>v. <em>New Mexico, supra, </em>624 F.2d at 116. What the majority fails to recognize is that once the constitutional question of the executive\u2019s <em>authority </em>to invoke immunity from state taxation is established \u2014 as it is here by the Act\u2019s authorizing the President to organize the Conference free from normal constraints on the letting of government contracts \u2014 the question of whether the executive <em>has in fact created </em>an agency relationship can be decided by reference to the traditional principles of the law of agency. The majority conflates these two inquiries by imposing a constitutional litmus \u2014 does the executive have <em>authority </em>from Congress \u2014 upon the nonconstitutional question of whether that authority has been <em>exorcised.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Nothing in the majority\u2019s basic premise of congressional control over the invocation of immunity requires a rule that the immunity can be conferred only by explicit contractual language creating an agency relationship.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> I am compelled to suggest that it is the <em>ultimate fact </em>of the contractor\u2019s agency, and not the mere <em>form </em>of its contract with the government, that is determinative. The record in this action presents a compelling case for the conclusion that Courtesy did act as the government\u2019s purchasing agent, and consequently that the transaction was exempt as a \u201csale to the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">The organization of the Conference was delegated to the Department of Commerce, and <em>its officials </em>promptly proceeded to negotiate for a Conference site. <em>Prior to September 1, 1977, </em>the active officials of Commerce selected the Sheraton-Park Hotel as the site of the Conference. Stampfli Aff. \u00b6 3 (App. 57-58). These early negotiations between representatives of Commerce and the Hotel settled upon the dates of the Conference, the number and nature of meeting and sleeping rooms and meals that would be necessary, and the cost of most of the items \u2014 in short, upon most of the essential terms that any contract for the Conference would contain. The Hotel then requested Manolatos, who was in charge of the Conference at Commerce, to sign a copy of the Hotel\u2019s August 2, 1977 \u201cletter of agreement.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The record does not disclose whether Manolatos signed and returned a copy of this letter. It does show equivalent acceptance by his answering letter of August 11,1977, in which Manolatos responded to the Hotel, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-9\">We are pleased to <em>confirm </em>our understanding of <em>the agreement reached to date between the White House Conference on Balanced National Growth and Economic Development and the Sheraton Park Hotel. </em>[This characterizes an agreement as having been reached between the Hotel and the \u201cWhite House Conference.\u201d]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-10\">It is our intent that the Conference will be held at the Sheraton Park Hotel from January 28 through February 2, 1978. Meeting rooms and accommodations <em>are reserved </em>and available for the Conference as specified in correspondence from the Sheraton Park Hotel, dated June 15, July 7, July 22, and August 2, 1977, with the addition of the availability of the Sheraton Park ballroom until 5:00 p.m. on February 2, 1978. [This indicates substantial agreement].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-11\">We are currently working with our Procurement Division to develop a contract for Conference management and logis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>tics, <em>which will incorporate the items specified in your correspondence to us, </em>the accommodations and meal costs, services to be provided by the hotel, and other items to be clarified within the next few weeks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">(App. 75) (emphasis added). The agreement as to dates also implicitly blocked out the number of bedrooms necessary to serve the intended number of invitees.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">As contemplated by Commerce and the Hotel (App. 74), a contract was subsequently entered into on September 30, 1977 between Commerce and Courtesy. That contract had the purpose of simply <em>\u201cfirming up </em>and arranging for all Conference goods, services and facilities, including the negotiating and <em>firming up </em>of prices and quantities of space and food being procured from the Sheraton Park.\u201d Tyler Aff. \u00b6 5 (App. 69) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Thus, as stated above, the broad outline of the hotel services for the Conference and its participants were worked out between the Hotel and the representative of the Department of Commerce <em>before </em>the government entered into its contract with Courtesy. That contract, entered into on September 30, 1977, was backdated to an effective date of September 16, 1977. It also incorporated the earlier arrangements between Commerce and the Hotel and indicated, insofar as the arrangements with the Hotel for rooms and meals were concerned, that the parties intended to <em>ratify the earlier contractual arrangements between the Hotel and the \u201cWhite House Conference:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"aqt-dedup-0\">\u201c3. <em>Post-Conference</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"akv-dedup-0\">Post-Conference activities of the Contractor will include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjXF\">a. <em>Hotel</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-7\">Complete all arrangements for payment to hotel having determined the satisfactory completion of <em>their contract with the White House Conference.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">(App. 91) (emphasis added). The word \u201ctheir\u201d refers to the Hotel since \u201chotel\u201d is the last (indeed, the only) antecedent. <em>Azure v. Morton, </em>514 F.2d 897, 900 (9th Cir. 1975); <em>Quindlen </em>v. <em>Prudential Insurance Company of America, </em>482 F.2d 876, 878 (5th Cir. 1973); <em>Mandina v. United States, </em>472 F.2d 1110, 1112 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>412 U.S. 907, 93 S.Ct. 2299, 36 L.Ed.2d 972 (1973); <em>United States v. Pritchett, </em>470 F.2d 455, 459 (D.C.Cir.1972). This reference in the contract between Courtesy and the Hotel therefore adopts the provisions of the prior agreement reached by the Hotel and Commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-11\">On January 3, 1978, Courtesy <em>\u201cconfirmed </em>the arrangements for the procurement for the space and food\u201d that had been reached, prior to Courtesy\u2019s contract, between the officials of Commerce and the Sheraton-Park. (App. 58, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 4, 6). If there were any doubt about the terms of the contract between the Hotel and Commerce, acting for the United States as the \u201cWhite House Conference,\u201d the contract between Commerce and Courtesy ratifies that arrangement. But more important, that ratification indicates that Courtesy was acting as an agent for Commerce. The majority seek to avoid this interpretation and the clear implications of the reference to the Courtesy contract as the \u201ccontract with the White House Conference,\u201d but, in addition to the reference in the contract, to the extent that there is any additional record evidence it also indicates that goods and services were billed to the \u201cWhite House Conference\u201d\u2014 <em>not to Courtesy. </em>(App. 61-62). The contract with Courtesy also expressly incorporated the dates and much of the agenda for the Conference that had been previously negotiated by Commerce personnel (App. 71-72, 82-83) and implicitly adopted the agreements on rooms for meeting and housing and feeding guests (App. 69, 82-84).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-12\">An important fact distinguishing this case from the typical case in which immunity is found lacking in the absence of an explicitly created agency relationship is the subject matter of the contract involved. The contract here was essentially one for the provision of <em>services </em>rather than for the transfer of materials or other tangible prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>erty.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The hotel offered accommodations and accompanying support staff, on terms which had already been worked out between the hotel and the government. The contract is thus distinguished from those at issue in <em>King &amp; Boozer </em>(contract for sale of building materials), <em>United States v. New Mexico </em>(contract for \u201clong term\u201d management of AEC facility vested \u201csubstantial autonomy\u201d in contractor, and <em>Harvey F. Gamage, Shipbuilder, Inc. v. Halperin, </em>359 A.2d 72 (Me.1976) (contract for construction of private fishing vessel), in which the courts found that immunity was unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">As the court pointed out in <em>United States v. Livingston, supra, </em>the principal concern in such cases involving tangible property is that the contractor may make use of the property for purposes other than the government\u2019s benefit. \u201cThe vital thing\u201d in cases denying immunity has been that the contractors used government property for the pursuit of private commercial purposes <em>unrelated to the government contract. United States </em>v. <em>Township of Muskegon, </em>355 U.S. 484, 486, 78 S.Ct. 483, 485, 2 L.Ed.2d 436 (1958). <em>See, e.g., Harvey F. Gamage, Shipbuilder, Inc. v. Halperin, supra </em>(even though contract <em>directly obligated </em>United States to pay costs of constructing ship, immunity did not attach because ship was used in private commercial enterprise). A private party may not enjoy the immunity lawfully available only to the government. Hence, the presence of contractual terms ensuring that the government is the exclusive beneficiary of the immunity \u2014 as where the contractor is a mere agent of the government \u2014 has been strongly persuasive of the existence of immunity. But where, as here, the <em>subject </em>matter of the contract makes it certain that the government is the only party who <em>can </em>receive the benefit of what it purchases, there is likewise little need to worry that the contractor has appropriated the government\u2019s immunity. The substance of the contract, in short, can be just as persuasive as its explicit terms. \u201cAn agent . . . need not be called by that name to be one.\u201d <em>United States v. Livingston, supra, </em>179 F.Supp. at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">The majority opinion attempts to place this case in the context of the construction contracts entered into by the United States that were involved in <em>Alabama v. King &amp; Boozer, </em>314 U.S. 1, 62 S.Ct. 43, 86 L.Ed. 482 (1941) and <em>Kern-Limerick, Inc. v. Scurlock, supra. </em>These eases turned respectively on whether the government was \u201cobligated to pay\u201d for lumber and whether a contractor was \u201cauthorized to pledge the credit of the United States.\u201d But both of those cases involved <em>construction contractors </em>and items of <em>tangible personal property </em>which were purchased in connection with the projects, and hence present the agency question in a significantly different form. The contract here is essentially a <em>service </em>contract and <em>none </em>of the items that are alleged to be subject to the D.C. sales tax, rooms and meals, were delivered to the contractor (Courtesy).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">A particularly useful comparison is furnished by <em>United States v. Township of Muskegon, supra, </em>355 U.S. 484, 78 S.Ct. 483, 2 L.Ed.2d 436 (1958). There, a contractor using the government\u2019s property for its own commercial purposes as well as for performing a government contract was held unable to invoke the federal government\u2019s immunity. The Court noted that \u201c[t]he case might well be different if the Government had reserved such control over the activities and financial gain\u201d of the contractor that the contractor could have been deemed a \u201cservant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486, 78 S.Ct. at 485. In the context of a contract for the provision of <em>services </em>to the government contractor like the one involved in this case, the government without question retains \u201ccontrol\u201d of its \u201cproperty\u201d to an extent that makes it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>clear where the incidence of the tax falls. <em>See United States v. Livingston, supra, </em>179 F.Supp. at 23. The nature of the contract as one for services, then, more readily supports the inference that the contractor here was acting merely as the government\u2019s agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">According to the majority, deviation from its \u201cexplicit designation rule\u201d is permitted only in instances where a government contractor performs its services <em>gratuitously. </em>At 745 (discussing <em>United States v. Livingston, supra). </em>This is another instance of cutting the rule closely to fit the case law without regard for the broader principles those decisions sought to serve. Simple citation of the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>obiter dictum </em>in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>378 U.S. 39, 84 S.Ct. 1518, 12 L.Ed.2d 713 (1964), for the view that the analysis in the <em>Livingston </em>case is confined to \u201cextraordinary\u201d factual situations does not suffice to explain the majority\u2019s apparent adoption of the view that the amount of a contractor\u2019s profit, or the patriotic nature of its motives, is dispositive of the constitutional question it poses.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">In point of fact, <em>Boyd </em>was limited to the question of wheth\u00e9r a government contractor could be held to be a purchasing agent in the context of a state tax directly on <em>contractors, </em>not upon sales. The Court explicitly stated that question of immunity from that levy, which taxed the business of contracting, was <em>unconnected </em>with the question of whether the contractor was an agent of the government. The Court therefore did not consider the Tennessee Supreme Court\u2019s holding, 211 Tenn. 139, 363 S.W.2d 193 (1962), that the contractor was immune as a purchasing agent. The majority\u2019s reliance on and quotation of <em>Boyd </em>is therefore misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">The terms of the contract between Courtesy and the Hotel were negotiated <em>in advance </em>by Commerce leaving virtually <em>no room </em>for Courtesy to exercise any independent discretion over how the services would be provided.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Under the terms of its agreement with Commerce, Courtesy was acting only to \u201cfirm up\u201d arrangements already made. For the purposes of those arrangements, then, it was, under traditional agency principles, the government\u2019s agent. Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 14N (1958).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">In addition to not receiving any of the services that are here sought to be taxed in its name, Courtesy had \u201cno role whatsoever\u201d in determining who was to occupy the rooms or consume the food furnished by the Hotel. These decisions were at <em>all times </em>reserved to the officials and employees of the United States, and withheld from Courtesy. Tyler Aff. (App. 70). Its sole relationship to those logistical items (rooms and meals) was limited to overseeing the furnishing of same to the Conference and its <em>participants </em>\u2014 within the $40 and $30 contract limitations on rooms and meals (App. 93) \u2014 checking the final Hotel bill, and, <em>after the United States had checked the bill and approved it, </em>paying the approved amount to the Hotel. (App. 70). It was then reimbursed by the United States. Courtesy thus ran no practical risk in paying the Hotel bill. Throughout it was practically a servant of the United States, whose task it was to handle the \u201cdetail[s] of purchase.\u201d <em>Kern-Limerick, </em>347 U.S. at 114, 74 S.Ct. at 406.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The principal decisions and arrangements with respect to the hotel accommodations were made by Commerce before it entered into the contract with Courtesy and the contract strictly limited Courtesy\u2019s au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>thority with respect to the items upon which Commerce and the Hotel had previously agreed (App. 91).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">In other words, the contract made Courtesy the chore boy for the Conference. Its authority was specifically and strictly limited by the contract; with respect to rooms and meals it was nothing more than an agent of the Commerce Department. It acted only as a supervisor or purchasing agent for the government to see that rooms and meals which had been preliminarily agreed upon between Commerce and the Hotel were furnished to the guests who had been invited by the government.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The number of rooms and meals had been agreed upon; Courtesy selected the menu within the contract\u2019s price restriction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">In my view the above facts with respect to the rooms and meals constitute, under the contract, a sale to the United States \u2014 if not a direct sale, then a sale to the United States on a purchase order made by an authorized purchasing officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">In view of the foregoing it is not necessary to determine whether the negotiations between the Sheraton Park and the Commerce Department resulted in a contract for hotel services or whether such a contract was consummated only after Courtesy became a participant in the transaction. In either event, Courtesy had no discretion in determining the dates and place of the Conference and who would provide the meeting rooms, food, and lodging for the Department\u2019s Conference and who would be the recipients thereof. This is in distinct contrast to the situation in which a contractor agrees to provide some service or product for the government, such as a building, and in the course of performing his obligations purchases lumber and machinery for his own use. Indeed, Courtesy\u2019s payment for the Hotel services is distinguishable from a purchase it may have made of, for example, name identification tags for the Conference participants. Courtesy would probably not be a purchasing agent for the United States with respect to such a purchase. But where it is contractually obligated to make payment for hotel services <em>already substantially arranged and confirmed </em>by officers of the United States, the situation is distinguishable in a material respect. Where a federal contractor merely oversees the provision of goods and services to the United States, he acts as an agent for the United States and there is no basis for taxing what are, essentially, direct sales to the United States. In such case, the United States is the purchaser.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>The United States was clearly disclosed at all times as the real party in interest. Under the D.C. Code and the applicable Regulation, set forth above, the hotel accommodations were a \u201csale[ ] to the United States\u201d through its agent. Such was the intent of the parties in referring to the \u201c[Hotel\u2019s] contract with the White House Conference.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> All the rooms and meals that were furnished to Conference participants as guests of the United States and the larger rooms in which the Conference meetings were conducted constituted essentially a sale to and use by the United States. There is absolutely no question whatsoever that the <em>meeting rooms </em>and services relating thereto were a direct sale to the government (App. 65).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">In reaching the above conclusion, I cannot escape the plain words of the statute and assert, as the majority does, that D.C. Code \u00a7 47-2605(a) and its accompanying regulation should not be given their plain meaning because Congress in enacting the legislation did not \u201cfocus specifically\u201d on federal tax immunity and that the exemption allegedly did not receive the \u201cfocused scrutiny of Congress.\u201d At 745-746. That would be a novel doctrine of statutory interpretation. The Supreme Court has cautioned that it is treacherous to find in congressional silence alone the adoption of a controlling rule of law. <em>Boys Markets, Inc. v. Retail Clerks Union, Local 770, </em>398 U.S. 235, 241, 90 S.Ct. 1583, 1587, 26 L.Ed.2d 199 (1970); <em>Girouard </em>v. <em>United States, </em>328 U.S. 61, 69, 66 S.Ct. 826, 829, 90 L.Ed. 1084 (1946). The exemption provisions are so plain that no discussion or elaboration was necessary. If statutory provisions setting forth a perfectly obvious legislative intent were to suffer because they were not debated in committee or on the floor the clearest and most basic provisions of every statute would fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">To the extent above indicated I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b806-7\">. In this regard it is interesting to note that Professor Tribe, upon whom the majority places principal reliance, willingly concedes that existing authority flatly contradicts the theory of immunity put forth by the majority. <em>See </em>L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law, \u00a7 6-30 at 398 (1978) <em>(Kern-Limerick </em>decision, discussed <em>infra, </em>must be overruled under majority\u2019s theory). It bears repeating that sitting judges do not enjoy the fiat over Supreme Court precedent so readily exercised by their academic brethren.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b807-8\">. In <em>Muskegon, </em>the Court found that the government contractor there was in fact free to use government property for its own commercial purposes. It thus looked beyond the formal terms of contract to inquire into the <em>actual </em>relationship between the government and the contractor. In contrast to that case, the facts here show that Courtesy was clearly acting in an agency capacity. <em>See </em>Part II <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b807-9\">. Were a case to arise in which the federal contract \u201cspecifically designated\u201d the contractor an agent when the acts of the contractor plainly revealed it to be acting in pursuit of its own commercial interest, <em>see </em>note 2, <em>supra, </em>it would be necessary to decide whether the language of the contract could be held to define the constitutional dimensions of immunity. Justice Frankfurter expressed the view that in such a case, \u201cit is <em>immaterial </em>that contracts by the Government have been purposefully drawn so as to [confer tax immunity].\u201d <em>City of Detroit v. Murray Corp., </em>355 U.S. 489, 499, 78 S.Ct. 458, 488, 2 L.Ed.2d 441 (1958) (Frankfurter, J., concurring) (emphasis added). Since that situation is not presented here, it is not necessary to reach the question of whether the terms of a contract may by themselves confer an immunity that would otherwise be lacking.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b808-6\">. \u201cIn this domain,\u201d wrote Justice Frankfurter, \u201cit is asking too much for rules of certainty and simplicity in application that are hardly to be found in any live branch of law.\u201d <em>City of Detroit v. Murray Corp., </em>355 U.S. at 496, 78 S.Ct. at 486 (Frankfurter, J., concurring). That is precisely the request the majority makes in propounding its \u201cexplicit designation\u201d rule, a rule the rigidity of which does not, in my opinion, serve the true constitutional purposes of federal immunity from state taxation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b808-11\">. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Forst, </em>442 F.Supp. 920, 924 (W.D.W.Va. 1977), <em>aff'd, </em>569 F.2d 811 (4th Cir. 1978) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b809-5\">. The three statutory exemptions referred to removed, respectively, the prohibition upon the use of federal money for lodging, feedings, conveying or furnishing transportation to conventions; a restriction upon the rental of buildings within the District of Columbia; and a requirement that government purchases of or contracts for supplies be publicly advertised.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b809-6\">. The breadth of the authority Congress sought to confer on the President is made still more evident when the history of this measure is considered. Originally, Congress requested the President to call the Conference within one year of the authorizing legislation, and granted him various powers in order to carry out that request. Pub.L. No. 94-487, 90 Stat. 2331, 2339-40 (1976). Subsequently, however, Congress found it necessary to extend the preparation period, and to broaden the President\u2019s authority by inserting the \u201cact as may be necessary and appropriate\u201d language into the legislation. The conclusion to be drawn is that Congress consciously chose to grant the President <em>exceptionally broad discretion </em>in calling and conducting the Conference as expeditiously as possible. That vested discretion must be read to include the power to appoint agents such as Courtesy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b809-12\">. The statute is in this respect closely similar to the one involved in <em>Kern-Limerick. </em>See 347 U.S. at 113 n.3, 74 S.Ct. at 406 n.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b809-13\">. Besides the removal of restrictions in the <em>second </em>Act quoted in text, the <em>original </em>enabling Act also suspended the application of a statutory restriction on government contract awards, relating to the employment of personnel in the competitive civil service. Pub.L. No. 94-487 \u00a7 202(5), 90 Stat. at 2340 (1976). A suspension of the otherwise applicable requirement that the President rely on civil service personnel is strongly indicative of Congress\u2019 intent to grant him a free hand in employing private parties as agents of the government for the purposes of organizing the Conference.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b810-7\">. Indeed, the majority\u2019s theory would be better served by requiring simply that government contracts carry the legend \u201cimmune from taxation.\u201d If such a rule would equally well realize the majority\u2019s goal of preserving congressional authority in this area, then I fail to see why facts otherwise clearly establishing the existence of an agency relationship must be disregarded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b810-12\">. <em>Id., </em>Tyler aff. and exhibits. <em>See </em>Letter of August 2, 1977 from Hotel to Assistant Director for Conference Operations Mr. Jerry Ma-natolos: \u201cThis letter of agreement between us commits the dates, the room blockage, and complimentary policy.\u201d App. at 74.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b812-5\">. The hotel accommodations were only one part of the Courtesy contract constituting about one-third of the total cost.

The record here evidences the mutual assent necessary to the formation of a contract between the United States acting through Commerce as the \u201cWhite House Conference.\u201d In conducting the Conference the agency was specifically authorized by statute to \u201cact as may be necessary and appropriate without regard to the provisions\u201d of the statute requiring the advertising for bids. Whether the special Act, under which this Conference and the attendant contracts came into being, was sufficient to constitute a completely valid contract, as to the matters agreed upon by the Hotel and Commerce, under all other government contract restrictions and regulations, is not clear. <em>See </em>J. McBride &amp; T. Touhey, Government Contracts \u00a7 4.40 (1978). However, it is not necessary to decide this issue, because whatever deficiencies may have existed were cured by the provisions in the formal contract between Commerce and Courtesy. These negotiations and their result are important because they shed light on the nature of the authority that was being conferred upon Courtesy. The recognition of the prior \u201ccontract\u201d between the Hotel and Commerce, even if only a <em>de facto </em>contract, the very limited authority given Courtesy with respect to the rooms and meals, and the approval by Commerce of the amounts prior to payment by Courtesy, all indicate that with respect to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>hotel accommodations Courtesy was a mere agent of the United States.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b815-26\">.
