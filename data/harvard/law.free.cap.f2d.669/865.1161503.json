More specifically, the defendants were charged with failure to evaluate and place handicapped children in appropriate programs in a timely fashion. The complaint filed by United Cerebral Palsy of New York City, Inc. (UCP), also claimed that the delays could be remedied only through appropriate structural reforms in the educational system. Plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201, 2202, and alleged jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1343.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-20\">By order dated May 16, 1979, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Eugene H. Nickerson, Judge, certified the class in <em>Jose P., </em>held that by the defendants\u2019 own concession they had \u201cfailed to comply with the statutory requirements,\u201d and appointed former Judge Marvin Frankel special master under Fed.R.Civ.P. 53 to work out a remedy. Disposition of the <em>UCP </em>and <em>Dyrcia S. </em>cases was deferred pending the master\u2019s final report in <em>Jose P., </em>and counsel for all three plaintiff classes then participated in the <em>Jose P. </em>proceedings. On December 14, 1979, Judge Nickerson, following the recommendation of Master Frankel, entered a judgment finding that the defendants had \u201cviolat[ed] the requirements of federal and New York law and regulations,\u201d requiring defendants to \u201ctake all actions reasonably necessary to accomplish timely evaluation and placement in appropriate programs of all children with handicapping conditions,\u201d and establishing a detailed remedial plan. Judgments identical to the one in <em>Jose P. </em>were entered in <em>UCP </em>and <em>Dyrcia S. </em>in January 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-21\">Judge Nickerson also found, in orders of January 31 and May 29, 1980, that both the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>city and the state defendants were liable for attorneys\u2019 fees to the <em>Jose P. </em>and the <em>UCP </em>plaintiffs. On December 5, 1980, the parties filed stipulations that $140,000 in <em>Jose P. </em>and $71,681.93 in <em>UCP </em>were fair and reasonable amounts for attorneys\u2019 fees, and on December 18, 1980, Judge Nickerson ordered these amounts allocated 80% against New York City and 20% against New York State, \u201cin accordance with their relative culpability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">On the appeal brought by the New York State Commissioner of Education, the issues are whether the district court properly held that the class actions could be maintained against the Commissioner, notwithstanding plaintiffs\u2019 failure to exhaust state administrative remedies, on the ground that these remedies were inefficacious; whether the district court correctly held the Commissioner liable for failure to assure that the city school district provide appropriate education to the plaintiffs; and whether the district court\u2019s 80-20 allocation of responsibility for the attorneys\u2019 fee awards had a rational basis. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">On the cross-appeal by the New York City Chancellor, the issue is whether it was a proper exercise of the district court\u2019s discretion to allocate the responsibility for attorneys\u2019 fees between the city and the state defendants on an 80-20 basis rather than a 50-50 basis. We also affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">\n<em>Exhaustion of State Administrative Remedies</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">In the order certifying the <em>Jose P. </em>class, Judge Nickerson held that the action against the state defendants would not be barred by the named plaintiffs\u2019 failure to exhaust the administrative hearing and appeal procedure provided by the New York Education Law, stating that \u201cthe inefficacy of the available administrative remedies has been demonstrated.\u201d In his order denying without prejudice class certification to the <em>UCP </em>plaintiffs pending proceedings in <em>Jose P., </em>he said again that \u201cin light of the absence of a \u2018meaningful administrative enforcement mechanism.\u2019 . . . this suit may be maintained without prior resort to administrative proceedings.\u201d The Commissioner argues on appeal that available administrative remedies are not inefficacious, and thus that absent their exhaustion by plaintiffs, the district court lacked jurisdiction over the state defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">The only administrative remedies at issue here are those provided in sections 4401 to 4404 of the New York Education Law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under the New York statutes and regulations, the parents of handicapped children may, first, refer the child to a school district\u2019s committee on the handicapped for evaluation and recommendation for placement, N.Y.Educ.Law \u00a7 4402; second, request a hearing at the school district level if dissatisfied with the committee\u2019s recommendation or with its failure to act within thirty days of referral, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 4404(1); 8 N.Y.C.R.R. \u00a7 200.5(c); and third, appeal to the Commissioner, subject to review in state court, N.Y.Educ.Law \u00a7 4404(2)\u2014(3). Plaintiffs argued successfully below that such procedures are totally inadequate to handle the thousands of individuals in the classes awaiting suitable placement, and that the individual appeal mechanism is inappropriate to resolve the systemic compliance issues raised in the class actions. The Commissioner argues on appeal that the inadequacy of these procedures was not proved, as the court below ignored the availability of hearings before hearing officers appointed by the school district, whose numbers are in theory unlimited.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>The Second Circuit has long held that exhaustion of state administrative remedies prior to adjudication of a section 1983 claim in federal court is not required if adequate and speedy state remedies are not available, see, <em>e.g., Gonzalez </em>v. <em>Shanker, </em>533 F.2d 832, 834, 837-38 (2d Cir. 1976); <em>Morgan </em>v. La <em>Vallee, </em>526 F.2d 221, 223 (2d Cir. 1975); <em>Blanton </em>v. <em>State University of New York, </em>489 F.2d 377, 383-84 (2d Cir. 1973); <em>Eisen v. Eastman, </em>421 F.2d 560, 569 (2d Cir. 1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 841, 91 S.Ct. 82, 27 L.Ed.2d 75 (1970), or if the inadequacy of the state administrative remedy is \u201ccoextensive with the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional claim,\u201d <em>Fuentes v. Roher, </em>519 F.2d 379, 387 (2d Cir. 1975); <em>see Barry v. Barchi, </em>443 U.S. 55, 63 n.10, 99 S.Ct. 2642, 2648 n.10, 61 L.Ed.2d 365 (1979); <em>Gibson v. Berryhill, </em>411 U.S. 564, 575, 93 S.Ct. 1689, 1696, 36 L.Ed.2d 488 (1973). <em>See generally Swan v. Stoneman, </em>635 F.2d 97, 103-04 (2d Cir. 1980). The Fifth Circuit recently adopted a similar qualified exhaustion rule, Patsy v. <em>Florida International University, </em>634 F.2d 900, 912 (5th Cir. 1981) (en banc) (\u201cadequate and appropriate state administrative remedies must be exhausted before a section 1983 action is permitted to proceed in federal court, absent any of the traditional exceptions to the general exhaustion rule\u201d), <em>cert. granted sub nom. Patsy </em>v. <em>Board of </em>Regents, - U.S. -, 102 S.Ct. 88, 70 L.Ed.2d 81 (1981), and the Supreme Court may soon address the split between courts applying such an exhaustion rule and those applying an absolute nonexhaustion rule, <em>see Patsy, </em>634 F.2d at 908-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">Under the Second Circuit rule, Judge Nickerson\u2019s decision to take jurisdiction over these actions notwithstanding lack of exhaustion was correct. He noted that administrative action from 1974 to 1979 by the Commissioner pursuant to the 1971 complaint in <em>Matter of Reid, </em>13 Ed. Dep\u2019t Rep. 117, had been ineffective in achieving appropriate education for the handicapped in New York City. He also noted that counsel for the Commissioner had conceded at a hearing in <em>Jose P. </em>that \u201che would be unable to expeditiously process the appeals of all the members of the plaintiff class were they to pursue administrative proceedings.\u201d And especially in light of the Commissioner\u2019s acknowledgment that the City Board\u2019s compliance with his orders in <em>Reid </em>\u201cwas not as much as [he had] wished,\u201d there is no reason to expect that the City is about to hire the hearing officers that literally thousands of individual cases would require. This was enough to conclude that New York\u2019s administrative remedies were not adequate or speedy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, the state administrative remedies, which involve only the placement of individuals, could well be found inappropriate to a problem Judge Nickerson described as \u201ccomplex\u201d and \u201cpo-lycentric,\u201d as due in part to \u201cthe bureaucratic infrastructure involved in the evaluation and placement process,\u201d and as appropriate for resolution by a master, taking a structural approach, rather than by more traditional adjudication. <em>See New York State Association for Retarded Children v. Carey, </em>596 F.2d 27, 31-34 (2d Cir. 1979); O. Fiss, <em>The Civil Rights Injunction </em>(1978) (passim); Chayes, <em>The Role of the Judge in Public Law Litigation, </em>89 Harv.L.Rev. 1281 (1976); Oakes, <em>The Proper Role of the Federal Courts in Enforcing the Bill of Rights, </em>54 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 911, 944-46 &amp; n.218 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-15\">Under these circumstances, the court could not be sure that resort to state administrative remedies would not be \u201cfutile\u201d for purposes of obtaining class relief. <em>See Riley v. Ambach, </em>668 F.2d 635, 641 (2d Cir. 1981) (acknowledging that exhaustion is not required where it would be futile or remedies inadequate) (citing <em>Armstrong v. Kline, </em>476 F.Supp. 583, 601-02 (E.D.Pa.1979) (holding failure to exhaust state remedies excused by futility) <em>remanded on other </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number><em>grounds, Battle v. Pennsylvania, </em>629 F.2d 269 (3d Cir. 1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>452 U.S. 968, 101 S.Ct. 3123, 69 L.Ed.2d 981 (1981)). Nor should the plaintiffs have been relegated to state procedures the inefficacy of which in part prompted their section 1983 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">\u25a0 The Commissioner argues strenuously that this case is controlled by <em>Riley v. Am-bach, </em>which addressed the \u201cfederal scheme regarding the education of handicapped children,\u201d 668 F.2d at 636, and reversed for failure to exhaust state administrative remedies a decision in favor of eighteen children questioning the New York State Commissioner\u2019s definition of learning discrepancy. The plaintiffs in <em>Riley </em>claimed this definition was inconsistent with the federal definitions set forth in the EHA and accompanying regulations. In applying the exhaustion rule in <em>Riley, </em>the court explicitly noted the need for utilizing administrative expertise where the questions were difficult and technical, and the desirability of avoiding a lengthy and costly federal trial. <em>Id. </em>at 640. Neither of these policies apply here, however. The questions at issue are not technical, but concern the numbers of children on waiting lists, the availability of programs, and the adequacy of physical facilities. And \u25a0 administrative procedures have proved inexpeditious in the related <em>Matter of Reid. </em>Despite appellant Commissioner\u2019s order in <em>Reid </em>and his retention of jurisdiction for five years, at the time the instant complaints were filed there was concededly \u201can increase in the numbers of children awaiting evaluation or placement.\u201d Thus handicapped children similarly situated to the plaintiffs in the instant cases have resorted to the state administrative process; as found by Judge Nickerson below, however, there was a demonstrated lack of a \u201cmeaningful administrative enforcement mechanism.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b920-9\">\n<em>Liability of the State Commissioner of Education</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b920-10\">The Commissioner appeals from the judgment against him, arguing that in light of his limited supervisory obligations under the EHA, he committed no act or omission depriving plaintiffs of their rights. Plaintiffs counter first, that this appeal is es-topped by the Commissioner\u2019s consent to the judgments entered, and second, that the Commissioner did fail to meet a statutory obligation to enforce compliance with the EHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-11\">The Commissioner arguably conceded failure to meet his statutory duties by his letter of December 10, 1979, reprinted in the margin, finding the judgment satisfactory and offering no objection other than one to the wording of paragraph seven, which dealt not with liability but with means of enforcing compliance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Paragraph one of the judgment, to which the Commissioner made no objection, declared without distinguishing between city and state defendants that \u201cDefendants have not made available to the plaintiff class a free appropriate public education in a timely manner, thus violating the requirements of federal and New York law and regulations.\u201d Thus his appeal is inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-12\">But even if not precluded by consent, the state defendants could properly be found to have failed to meet the requirement of 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412(6) that \u201c[t]he State educational agency shall be responsi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>ble for assuring\u201d that the local agencies comply with the policies of the EHA. <em>See also </em>34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.601. The State likewise could properly be found to have failed to meet its obligation under the Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 504, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to ensure that programs in the state do not discriminate on the basis of handicap. <em>See </em>34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.4(b)(1)(v). Thus Judge Nickerson correctly concluded that while the \u201cprimary responsibility\u201d was the City\u2019s, the \u201cCommissioner ... also bears a share of the responsibility [because of] [h]is failure to enforce federal and state laws and to provide adequate general supervision over the New York City School system ... [and to] ensure compliance with [his] orders\u201d with respect to education of the handicapped.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">The only basis on which the liability of the state defendants might be dubious, if the Commissioner had not consented to the judgment, is the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as the State\u2019s failure to fulfill its supervisory responsibility might, <em>see Panitch v. Wisconsin, </em>444 F.Supp. 320, 322 (E.D.Wis.1977) (handicapped student placement), or might not, see <em>Arthur v. Nyquist, </em>573 F.2d 134, 145-46 (2d Cir. 1978) (school racial segregation), be enough to constitute intentional discrimination. We need not reach this issue, nor does it affect the Commissioner\u2019s appeal. Jurisdiction was properly predicated on allegations of the State\u2019s failure to meet statutory and constitutional obligations, and attorneys\u2019 fees may be awarded in cases where the prevailing claims are based only on violations of federal statutes, <em>see Maher </em>v. <em>Gagne, </em>448 U.S. 122, 100 S.Ct. 2570, 65 L.Ed.2d 653 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">\n<em>Award of Attorneys\u2019 Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">Appellant Commissioner argues that plaintiffs failed to \u201cprevail\u201d against him within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. This borders on the frivolous in light of the judgment finding the state as well as the city defendants in violation of statutory obligations and ordering them to comply. <em>See, e.g., Holley </em>v. <em>Lavine, </em>605 F.2d 638, 646 (2d Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-10\">The only issue remaining on the appeal, then, is whether Judge Nickerson\u2019s failure to conduct an evidentiary hearing on the allocation of responsibility for attorneys\u2019 fees was an abuse of discretion. <em>City of Detroit </em>v. <em>Grinnell Corp., </em>495 F.2d 448, 473-74 (2d Cir. 1974), is inapposite, as no factfinding was required here to determine the fair and reasonable <em>amount </em>of attorneys\u2019 fees, to which the parties stipulated. The fact that the plaintiff classes were without appropriate educational placement was not in dispute. Determination of the <em>degree </em>of the State\u2019s culpability required inquiry only into the State\u2019s legal obligations, which Judge Nickerson adequately undertook without need for a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-11\">On the City\u2019s cross-appeal, we think that Judge Nickerson\u2019s decision to apportion fees according to relative culpability was within his discretion, <em>see Rogers v. International Paper Co., </em>510 F.2d 1340, 1357 (8th Cir.), <em>vacated and remanded on other grounds, </em>423 U.S. 809, 96 S.Ct. 19, 46 L.Ed.2d 29 (1975), notwithstanding that there was no trial assessing relative culpability. As stated above, culpability turned on an estimate not of factual but of legal responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-12\">The only issue remaining on the cross-appeal is whether the court\u2019s estimate of legal responsibility (80% City, 20% State) was incorrect. Given that it is the State\u2019s obligation under the EHA, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1412, 1414, and under N.Y.Educ.Law \u00a7\u00a7 4402, 4403, only to supervise educational opportunities provided directly by the school districts, this allocation in our view is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b918-8\">. The EHA, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415, requires states receiving assistance under the EHA to set up procedures including \u201can opportunity to present complaints\u201d regarding the evaluation and placement of a handicapped child, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1415(b)(1)(E), and an opportunity for an \u201cimpartial due process hearing\u201d on that complaint before a state or local agency, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1415(b)(2). Decisions made in such hearings are subject to review in state courts or federal district courts. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1415(e)(2). The EHA itself provides no federal administrative remedies. And because plaintiffs never asserted jurisdiction under section 1415(e)(2), the extent to which the EHA imposes an exhaustion requirement is irrelevant. Nor has appellant Commissioner raised any failure to exhaust remedies under the Rehabilitation Act \u00a7 504, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b919-8\">. This serves also to distinguish the two district court cases relied on by the Commissioner, <em>Newton v. Board of Educ., Niagara Falls, </em>No. 80 Civ. 271 (W.D.N.Y.1981), and <em>Davis v. Maine Endwell Central School Dist., </em>646 F.2d 560 (N.D.N.Y.1980), each of which involved due process procedural rights of an individual student. See <em>also New York State Ass\u2019n for Retarded Children, Inc. v. Carey, </em>466 F.Supp. 487 (E.D.N.Y.), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>612 F.2d 644 (2d Cir. 1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b920-5\">. Dear Judge Nickerson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-6\">The proposed judgment in the above entitled case, as submitted to you with the Special Master\u2019s Report, is satisfactory to this Office, with one reservation. Paragraph 7 concludes with the following sentence:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-7\">\u201cAny disputes concerning State defendant\u2019s responsibility under 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 121a.360 shall be resolved by the Special Master or the Court upon the application of any party.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAY\">The use of the term \u201cresolved\u201d raises a question as to whether some form of binding arbitration could be inferred. Since our problem with \u00a7 121a.360, as set forth in paragraph 2 of the Special Master\u2019s Report, involved a question of the statutory power of the Commissioner of Education we could not agree to a determination on a paragraph 7 issue which would not be appealable. Possibly instead of \u201cresolved by\u201d the phrase \u201creferred to\u201d might be used.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-14\">Other than our concern over paragraph 7, this Department has no objection to the proposed judgment.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b921-8\">. Because plaintiffs here stated a cause of action under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, the decision in <em>Anderson v. Thompson, </em>658 F.2d 1205 (7th Cir. 1981), urged upon us by the Commissioner for the proposition that attorneys\u2019 fees are unavailable in an action brought under the EHA, is inappo-site. It is not disputed that section 504 provides for a private right of action, <em>see Davis v. United Air Lines, Inc., </em>662 F.2d 120, 123 &amp; n.7 (2d Cir. 1981), in which attorneys\u2019 fees may be obtained.
