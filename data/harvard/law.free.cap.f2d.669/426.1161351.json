Donald Rim-gale, the Chapter 13 debtor, filed a plan that proposed to pay $120 a month for 42 months to various unsecured creditors. The largest of the claims represented a tort judgment owed to Mary Ravenot. Although the judgment debt would not have been dischargeable in a straight Chapter 7 bankruptcy under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(4) or (6), it could be discharged under the more generous provisions that obtain once a Chapter 13 plan is successfully completed. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1328(a). The bankruptcy judge confirmed Rimgale\u2019s proposed plan over the objections of Mary Ravenot\u2019s representative. On appeal, the district judge reversed. Because we cannot endorse either the district judge\u2019s construction of the statute or the bankruptcy judge\u2019s cursory inquiry into the debtor\u2019s good faith in proposing the plan, we remand for additional proceedings in the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-18\">I. The Statutory Background</p>\n<p id=\"b483-19\">One of Congress\u2019 purposes in enacting the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 was to make the old Chapter XIII provisions more accessible and attractive to individual debtors. Liberalized provisions, Congress reasoned, would benefit both debtors and creditors. Debtors would be given more latitude to work out debt composition plans, thus avoiding the stigma of straight bankruptcy. Creditors would receive total or substantial repayment under a Chapter 13 plan, but little or nothing in a Chapter 7 liquidation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-20\">To make Chapter 13 work, Congress altered the old Chapter XIII in three important ways. First, it expanded the class of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>debtors who could take advantage of Chapter 13. Formerly restricted to wage-earner debtors, Chapter 13 was made available to any individual with regular income, whether from wages or other sources.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Second, Congress eliminated the requirement that a plan be approved by a majority of unsecured creditors.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Concerned that in the past short-sighted and stubborn creditors had blocked feasible plans, Congress provided for creditors to be heard, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324, but gave the bankruptcy judge the sole authority to confirm or reject a plan. It also set out the criteria he was to use, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-4\">(a) The court shall confirm a plan if\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-5\">(1) the plan complies with the provisions of this chapter and with other applicable provisions of this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">(2) any fee, charge, or amount required under chapter 123 of title 28, or by the plan, to be paid before confirmation, has been paid;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-7\">(3) the plan has been proposed in good faith and not by any means forbidden by law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-8\">(4) the value, as of the effective date of the plan, of property to be distributed under the plan on account of each allowed unsecured claim is not less than the amount that would be paid on such claim if the estate of the debtor were liquidated under chapter 7 of this title on such date;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-9\">(5) with respect to each allowed secured claim provided for by the plan\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-10\">(A) the holder of such claim has accepted the plan;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-15\">(B) (i) the plan provides that the holder of such claim retain the lien securing such claim; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-16\">(ii) the value, as of the effective date of the plan, of property to be distributed under the plan on account of such claim is not less than the allowed amount of such claim; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-17\">(C) the debtor surrenders the property securing such claim to such holder; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-18\">(6) the debtor will be able to make all payments under the plan and to comply with the plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-19\">Finally, Congress added an incentive for debtors to complete performance under the confirmed plan. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1328 provides that a debtor who has carried out his plan is entitled to a discharge of virtually all debts provided for in the plan or disallowed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus a Chapter 13 debtor may be discharged from a variety of debts that a Chapter 7 bankrupt remains obligated to pay at the conclusion of a liquidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-20\">The statutory modification of Chapter 13 has had both intended and unintended effects. The number of Chapter 13 cases has increased sharply.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Many of them correspond closely to the idealized case Congress had in mind when it wrote the legislation: the debtor, given time and relief from harassment, is able to pay all or most of his debts. Increasingly, however, bankruptcy courts are seeing cases like the one before us, in which debtors propose less substantial, or even nominal, payments under a Chapter 13 plan, in order eventually to take advantage of Chapter 13\u2019s generous dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>charge provisions. Our task is to determine whether such a plan is permissible under the legislation Congress has drafted. In so doing, we are not free to rewrite the legislation as we think best, but neither are we able to ignore the broad equitable principles that have characteristically animated American bankruptcy law.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">II. Rimgale\u2019s Chapter 13 Plans</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Donald Rimgale filed an original and two amended Chapter 13 plans in the bankruptcy court. Each involved about $6200 of unsecured consumer debt owed to half a dozen creditors, none with enough at stake apparently to file objections to the plan. Each also involved, and offered differing treatments of, a much larger debt owed to Mary Ravenot, the only creditor on whose behalf objections were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">On May 24, 1979, the Circuit Court of Cook County, Chancery Division, entered a tort judgment against Rimgale and his wife Alice. Alice Rimgale had been employed as a psychiatric nurse at St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital in Joliet, Illinois, and had eared for Mary Ravenot, a twenty-six-year-old widow then undergoing psychiatric treatment and since adjudged incompetent. The Rimgales first won Mrs. Ravenot\u2019s confidence, then induced her to turn over to them all the proceeds of her husband\u2019s life insurance. The judgment against the Rimgales had the following components: (1) compensatory damages of $29,743 and $3,988.39 in prejudgment interest, for which the Rimgales were jointly and severally liable; (2) punitive damages of $5,000 against Donald Rim-gale alone; and (3) attorney\u2019s fees and costs amounting to $8,857.75, again assessed against Donald Rimgale alone, based on his false pleading and bad faith in the tort litigation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The judge also imposed a constructive trust in Mary Ravenot\u2019s favor on real and personal property acquired with the insurance money, including the Rim-gales\u2019 house in Coal City, Illinois. What part of the judgment debt is secured by the constructive trust is a matter of dispute.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Until the filing of the bankruptcy, Mrs. Ravenot had garnished Rimgale\u2019s wages in the amount of $264 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-13\">Rimgale\u2019s first plan, offered on December 18, 1979, listed Mary Ravenot\u2019s debt as entirely unsecured, treated both the compensatory damages and the attorney\u2019s fees as joint obligations of Donald and Alice Rim-gale, and omitted the $5,000 in punitive damages altogether. The plan characterized that portion of the tort debt it listed as \u201cdisputed,\u201d although the judgment had become final.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The plan proposed to make no payments whatsoever to Mary Ravenot. Payments of $110 a month over thirty-six months would, according to the petition, pay 45% of the other unsecured claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-14\">The first amended plan, filed on April 3, 1980, has been lost and can be only partially reconstructed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It represented that $55 semi-monthly payments over thirty-six months would pay one-third of the unsecured claims, but did not change the amount or proposed nonpayment of Mary Ravenot\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>The second amended plan, filed on July 10, 1980, attempted to meet the objections of Mrs. Ravenot. It treated her debt as partly secured and partly unsecured. It estimated that she would receive $25,000 from the sale of the Rimgale house,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> making the unsecured part of her claim $24,-799.54. It increased payments under the plan to $120 a month and extended the term of the plan from thirty-six to forty-two months. An estimated 11% of unsecured claims would be paid. Mrs. Ravenot would receive about $2,700. This version of the plan was confirmed by bankruptcy judge Robert Eisen over the objections of Mrs. Ravenot\u2019s representative. Judge Ei-sen also lifted the automatic stay to permit Mrs. Ravenot\u2019s lawyers to set in motion the sale of the Coal City house.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">III. The Appeal to Judge Decker</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Mrs. Ravenot thereupon appealed the confirmation order to the district court. There were three bases for the appeal. First, Mrs. Ravenot argued that she was not receiving at least as much as she would receive in a Chapter 7 liquidation, because her debt could not be discharged under Chapter 7 but would be discharged at the completion of a Chapter 13 plan. The plan therefore did not meet the \u201cbest interests\u201d test of Section 1325(a)(4), <em>infra. </em>Second, Mrs. Ravenot contended that the plan had not been proposed in good faith and therefore violated Section 1325(a)(3). Third, Mrs. Ravenot argued that the bankruptcy judge had unduly restricted her arguments against the plan, contrary to the spirit of Section 1324. Judge Decker based his decision for Mrs. Ravenot on the first ground. <em>In re Rimgale, </em>No. 80 C 4862 (N.D.Ill., February 21, 1981). He found that the value of a nondischargeable claim for the whole of the unsecured debt could not easily be quantified. Nonetheless, he assumed that Mrs. Ravenot\u2019s objections were a sufficient indication that the claim under Chapter 7 was worth more than the $2,700 she would receive over a forty-two month period under the Chapter 13 plan. Because he found the failure to meet the \u201cbest interests\u201d test dispositive, Judge Decker did not reach the good-faith or due process issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">IV. The Appeal to this Court</p>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">Donald Rimgale has challenged Judge Decker\u2019s interpretation of the statute in this Court. We agree that Judge Decker\u2019s analysis cannot stand. The language of the \u201cbest interests\u201d test in Section 1325(a)(4) precludes it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-11\">[T]he value, as of the effective date of the plan, of property to be distributed under the plan on account of each unsecured claim [must] not [be] less than the amount that would be paid on such claim if the estate of the debtor were liquidated under chapter 7 of this title on such date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ac7\">What is to be compared is the total of the payments to the creditor, discounted to present value, and the amount the creditor would receive in a straight liquidation. \u201c[T]he amount that would be paid <em>on such claim </em>if the estate of the debtor were liquidated\u201d (emphasis added) does not include additional amounts that a creditor may be able to collect <em>after </em>a liquidation, if he can keep the judgment alive. <em>Accord, In re Syrus, </em>12 B.R. 605, 608 (Bkrtcy., D.Kans. 1981). If Judge Decker\u2019s interpretation were right, any creditor with a nondis-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>chargeable debt could block a Chapter 13 plan by insisting that his claim might some day be satisfiable in full. Such a creditor would have a virtual veto over a Chapter 13 plan, while ordinary unsecured creditors have not even a vote. The generous discharge provisions of Chapter 13 would be illusory, subject to abrogation whenever a creditor with the sort of claim they cover objected to the plan. As a <em>quid pro quo </em>for not objecting, such a creditor might be able to insist on specific levels of repayment, although the statute itself has no explicit minimum payment requirement. In short, this reading of the \u201cbest interests\u201d test undercuts the limiting of creditors\u2019 power and the inducement of broad discharges, both integral parts of Congress\u2019 revision of Chapter 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">We cannot accept Rimgale\u2019s further argument, however, that Congress intended the confirmation of Chapter 13 plans to be routine if the \u201cbest interests\u201d test is met. In eliminating the requirement that a majority of creditors approve a plan, Congress did not also eliminate all scrutiny of plans. Instead it transferred the decision to the bankruptcy judge, aided by the Chapter 13 trustee.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It is the bankruptcy court\u2019s duty to evaluate the good faith of the plan under Section 1325(a)(3). As the Eighth Circuit has noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-9\">\u201c[a] comprehensive definition of good faith is not practical. Broadly speaking, the basic inquiry should be whether or not under the circumstances of the case there has been abuse of the provisions, purpose, or spirit of [the Chapter] in the proposal * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-10\"><em>In re Terry, </em>630 F.2d 634, 635 (8th Cir. 1980), (quoting 9 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy, </em>19.20 at 319 (14th ed. 1978)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-13\">This inquiry imposes a considerable responsibility on bankruptcy judges. And the conduct comprehended under the rubric \u201cgood faith\u201d will have to be defined on a case-by-case basis as the courts encounter various problems in the administration of Chapter 13\u2019s provisions.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-14\">We would emphasize only a few points. The legislative history suggests that Congress intended Chapter 13 for the benefit of debtors who could, given time, satisfy their creditors in full or in substantial measure.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Nonetheless, Congress eschewed setting any minimum levels of repayment that a debtor must propose to qualify for Chapter 13 relief. Thus good faith cannot be treated as a license to read into the statute requirements Congress did not enact, <em>e.g., </em>a requirement that a plan pay 70% of unsecured claims to qualify for the discharge benefits.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Nor can good faith be defined as the absence of any con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>duct that would traditionally have barred discharge, without rendering Chapter 13\u2019s discharge provisions nugatory.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> But the opposite extreme, that the good-faith requirement adds nothing to the other criteria for confirmation, is equally unsupportable.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">We therefore agree with the analysis of District Judge Ingram in <em>In re Burrell, </em>6 B.R. 360 (N.D.Cal.1980). He held that a flat 70% repayment requirement was erroneous and remanded to the bankruptcy judge for proceedings on the good-faith issue.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-5\">The correct approach * * * is to treat the issues of substantiality and best effort as elements of good faith. Unless the courts have discretion to consider such factors, the danger exists that Chapter 13 plans could become shams that would emasculate the safeguards that Congress has included in Chapter 7 to prevent debtor abuse of the bankruptcy laws. The courts retain discretion to prevent such abuse, and that discretion can be exercised effectively through a meaningful interpretation of the good faith requirement of \u00a7 1325(a)(3). In each case, the bankruptcy court must consider the debt- or\u2019s entire circumstances to determine whether his plan proposes to make meaningful payments to unsecured creditors. In making that determination, the courts should be mindful of the fact that the unsecured creditors must rely on the court to give meaning to the congressional intent that they receive substantial payments. Within these guidelines, the courts should proceed on a case-by-case basis. 6 B.R. 360, 366.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">The following list, by no means exhaustive, is intended to guide the bankruptcy judge\u2019s inquiry on remand:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-13\">(1) Does the proposed plan state Rimgale\u2019s secured and unsecured debts accurately? <footnotemark>18</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-14\">(2) Does it state Rimgale\u2019s expenses accurately? <footnotemark>19</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-15\">(3) Is the percentage of repayment of unsecured claims correct?<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-16\">(4) If there are or have been deficiencies in the plan, do the inaccuracies amount to an attempt to mislead the bankruptcy court? <footnotemark>21</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-17\">(5) Do the proposed payments indicate \u201ca fundamental fairness in dealing with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>one\u2019s creditors,\u201d <em>In re Beaver, </em>2 B.R. 337, 340 (Bkrtcy.S.D.Cal.1980)? <footnotemark>22</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">If the court does undertake to ascertain the good faith of this petition in a more than perfunctory way, Mrs. Ravenot\u2019s due process objections will of necessity be overcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The judgment of the district court is vacated and the case remanded to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

In <em>In re </em>Terry, 630 F.2d 634 (8th Cir. 1980), the court held that a debtor whose expenses exceeded his income and whose plan therefore proposed no payments could not use Chapter 13. It offered alternative rationales: the definitional Sections 109(e) and 101(24) assume that a Chapter 13 debtor can make payments; and a zero-payment plan cannot be filed in good faith because it amounts to an abuse of Chapter 13\u2019s discharge provisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b483-15\">.

The bankruptcy judge properly gave short shrift to this argument, because Mrs. Ravenot was entitled to look to either of the obligors for full satisfaction of the joint and several debt.

Rimgale\u2019s erroneous theory about joint and several liability is, of course, not applicable at all to the attorney\u2019s fees and costs assessed against him alone, though that amount too is listed as \u201cdisputed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b485-16\">.

The creditor\u2019s objections, filed on April 24, 1980, indicate that Mary Ravenot\u2019s claim was treated identically in the original and amended petitions.

In his original petition Rimgale had said his house was worth $48,000 and was mortgaged for $57,384. He did not list the mortgagee, Heritage First National Bank of Lockport, as a partially unsecured creditor. In objecting to the plan, Mrs. Ravenot\u2019s attorneys submitted an appraisal of the house showing a market value of $75,000. That figure is evidently the one relied upon in the final version of the plan, although $25,000 overstates the amount Mrs. Ravenot could realize after the mortgages were satisfied. At oral argument this Court was advised that while the appeal was pending the bankruptcy court had allowed the mortgagee to foreclose on the property and that there were no proceeds, after the foreclosure sale, to transmit to Mrs. Ravenot. It is clear from the foregoing that Mrs. Ravenot\u2019s whole claim must be treated henceforth as unsecured, and that the percentage of unsecured claims that the plan would pay must accordingly be revised downward.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b487-6\">.

Confirmation of a Chapter 13 plan requires the exercise of judicial discretion and assessment of evidence by a bankruptcy judge.

Cyr, <em>The Chapter 13 \u201cGood Faith\u201d Tempest: Analysis and Proposal for Change, </em>55 Amer.Bankruptcy L.J. 271 (1981), discusses several proposed but unenacted amendments to Section 1325(a)(3), including one offered by the National Bankruptcy Conference. They either add a \u201cbest efforts\u201d requirement or focus on future as well as current earnings. They do not limit in any significant way the scope of the good-faith inquiry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b487-17\">.

See, <em>e.g., In re Burrell, </em>6 B.R. 360 (N.D.Cal. 1980), reversing the bankruptcy court\u2019s imposition of such a requirement, 2 B.R. 650 (Bkrtcy., N.D.Cal.1980). Cf. C.

For example, it appears that the first and perhaps subsequent petitions should have listed Rimgale\u2019s mortgagee as both a secured and unsecured creditor. There is still dispute about the size of Mary Ravenot\u2019s claim (she filed a claim for $51,079.01, but the petition in its final form lists a claim for $49,799.54). Probably no part of that claim can now be treated as secured, note 12 <em>supra. </em>And no effort has been made to describe what happened to the assets subject to the constructive trust, other than the house.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b488-8\">. For example, the petitions listed $600 in child support payments. At the time of the original petition, no divorce decree had been entered. At the time of the first amended petition, Rimgale was under order to pay $735 per month, but if he had listed that figure his estimated surplus of $210 per month would have dwindled to $75 and confirmation would have been denied under Section 1325(a)(6) (\u201cthe debtor will be able to make all payments under the plan and to comply with the plan\u201d). By the time of the second amended petition, one of the Rimgale children had died, and the court had accordingly reduced the payments to $617. That figure is subject to revision as the needs of the Rimgale children change.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b488-19\">. For $3,960 to pay 45% of unsecured claims, the total of such claims should be $8,800. The original petition listed claims totaling $6,165.61. For $3,960 to pay 33% of unsecured claims, as the first amended petition advertised, such claims should total $12,000. Estimates of percentage repayment under the final plan range from a high of 17% (Rimgale) and 11% (Ravenot) if the Ravenot debt is partially secured, to a low of 9% (Rimgale) and 5% (Ravenot) if it is entirely unsecured. In simple arithmetical terms, the petitions are so defective that they do not permit an informed decision about confirmation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b488-20\">. Donald Rimgale was represented in the state tort action and in these bankruptcy proceedings by the same attorney. Under the circumstances one might expect a more careful and knowledgeable preparation of the petition. Furthermore Rimgale, with this attorney acting for him, has a history of making false statements in judicial proceedings, as the Circuit Court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs attests.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b489-16\">. In this connection, the bankruptcy court may wish to examine the timing of the bankruptcy filings, the proportion of the total unsecured debt that is represented by the Ravenot judgment, and the equities of classifying together ordinary consumer debt and a judgment debt arising out of intentionally tortious conduct. See <em>In re Sanders, </em>13 B.R. 320, 322-323 (Bkrtcy.D.Kans.1981) (classification of claims governed by Section 1122, which provides that \u201ca plan may place a claim or an interest in a particular class only if such claim or interest is substantially similar to the other claims or interests of such class\u201d; claims subject to discharge only under Chapter 13 are not \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to fully dischargeable claims).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
