Because we agree with the patent holder that a genuine issue of material fact existed concerning the \u201con sale\u201d status of the patented invention, we reverse the district court and remand for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-26\">I. The Case Below</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-27\">Appellants invented and manufactured a sample measuring syringe for use in the laboratory testing of minute quantities of chemicals. Approximately one year later, on February 19, 1976, they applied for and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1097\">*1097</page-number>received a patent on this device. In 1979, they learned that Beckman Instruments was manufacturing a substantially similar syringe, so they filed suit in district court alleging direct patent infringement. The district court, however, granted summary judgment for Beckman Instruments and invalidated appellants\u2019 patent because of the statutory \u201con sale\u201d bar, which requires the patentee not to sell or offer commercially an invention for more than one year before seeking a patent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, the district court found, as appellants conceded, that appellants had sold one of the devices before the critical date of February 19, 1975; the court rejected the appellants\u2019 defense that the device sold was exempted from the \u201con sale\u201d bar because the device was only a faulty prototype that did not reduce the invention to practice. The court agreed that the \u201con sale\u201d bar did not apply to inventions not reduced to practice, but decided that appellants had failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact concerning the \u201cnot reduced to practice\u201d defense. <em>See </em>505 F.Supp. 1035 (1981). With this latter conclusion we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-4\">II. The Invention</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-5\">During a telephone conversation on or about October 29, 1974, appellants conceived the idea behind their invention. They wanted to create a syringe capable of measuring chemical test samples without having to compensate for the amount of chemical left in the internal passages of the test equipment. The syringe would accomplish this by virtue of an offset in its measurement calibrations, so that it automatically held an amount equal to the volume of the test equipment\u2019s passages in addition to the amount shown by the calibrations. Because the offset would depend on the volume of the test equipment\u2019s passages, the syringe was intended for use with a test valve and adapter built by appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-10\">Appellants immediately began to construct the first prototype, but after two weeks they decided to make a radical change in the design of the syringe and adapter. On November 16,1974, appellants sketched the new design and ordered the construction of the second prototype. Several of these second prototype syringes and adapters were manufactured, and on February 4, 1975, two of them were ordered by Dr. Silvestre Tejada of the Environmental Protection Agency for use in the Research Triangle Park laboratories. This order was received by one of appellants\u2019 authorized sales representatives, thus consummating a sale before the critical date of February 19, 1975.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1147-11\">However, on February 11, 1975, appellants noticed that the second prototype syringes would not make accurate measurements because the large bore needle allowed air bubbles to enter with the sample. They therefore changed the syringe\u2019s specifications by reducing the inside diameter of the needle from .020 inches to .006 inches. Several of these third prototype syringes were manufactured, but they were not completed until after the critical date. Subsequently, the third prototype design became appellants\u2019 commercial product.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-12\">Appellants did not send any syringes to EPA until February 21, 1975, after they had completed the third prototype syringes. They thus could have filled EPA\u2019s order with the finally completed invention, but they sent the second prototype syringes as ordered. Dr. Tejada used the second prototype syringes and observed that these syringes made inaccurate measurements because of the air bubble problem caused by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1098\">*1098</page-number>the large bore needle. However, Dr. Teja-da did not consider the problem to be serious, since he was using the syringes for qualitative analysis, which does not require accurate measurement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1148-4\">III. Reduction to Practice</p>\n<p id=\"aaq-dedup-0\">At trial, the district court examined all of these facts and decided that the invention had been reduced to practice in both the second and third prototypes. First, the court held that the appellants\u2019 patent did not refer to any particular needle bore size and was not limited to quantitative analysis. Thus, the second prototype\u2019s air bubble problem did not defeat the patented invention\u2019s purpose and prevent its reduction to practice. In addition, the court found that the perfection of the invention in the third prototype reduced it to practice, because it involved only the correction of an obvious defect and because the correction was begun prior to the critical date. The court therefore granted summary judgment on the \u201con sale\u201d claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-5\">But as this Court views the same facts, there is a genuine issue of material fact concerning the invention\u2019s reduction to practice in both the second and third prototypes, so that summary judgment on the \u201con sale\u201d issue was not proper.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We reach this conclusion not because we disagree with the district court\u2019s findings of fact, but rather because we disagree with that court\u2019s interpretation of those facts under the law of \u201creduction to practice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-6\">\n<em>A. The Second Prototype</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AjV\">First, we think that an issue of fact existed as to whether the second prototype reduced the invention to practice. The district court erroneously found the second prototype to be functional because the patent was not limited to quantitative analysis \u2014 in other words, because the patent also described a syringe useable for transferring unmeasured amounts of chemicals for qualitative analysis. Thus, according to the district court\u2019s reasoning, the second prototype\u2019s air bubble problem did not prevent it from reducing the invention to practice. This reasoning, however, reads the patent and the law of \u201creduction to practice\u201d too narrowly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-9\">\u201c[A] patent is to be construed as a contract, with the intent of the parties as the lodestar. It is the real invention claimed and granted protection which we seek to determine.\u201d <em>Laitram Corp. v. Deepsouth Packing Co., </em>443 F.2d 928, 933 (5th Cir. 1971). Using this reasoning, we think that appellants\u2019 patent should be read more realistically as a claim for a quantitative measuring device alone, not for a quantitative and qualitative device. Of course, any syringe, including appellants\u2019 patented one, <em>can </em>be used to transfer variable, approximately measured amounts of chemicals to the testing equipment, thus making it useful for qualitative analysis. But the very reason for the existence of appellants\u2019 patent is its unique method for making accurate measurements: the calibrations on the syringe have been offset to compensate for the quantity of chemical sample that remains in the internal passages of the test equipment after injection. Indeed, the district court admits as much when it notes that \u201c[t]he critical element of the patent was the \u2018offset\u2019 of the syringe calibration scale to compensate for the volume of sample which is not transferred into the column, but remains in the valve after it has been actuated.\u201d The \u201cBackground of the Invention\u201d statement contained in the patent also explains this quantitative purpose. Although the claims of the patent do not specifically limit the patent to any purpose, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1099\">*1099</page-number>they do reveal the quantitative purpose when construed in light of the common knowledge of a person skilled in the art of chemical analysis. Thus, appellants\u2019 patent should not be read to include a claim for a qualitative analytical device.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-5\">When the patent is read in this way, the law of \u201creduction to practice\u201d seems to dictate a conclusion different from that reached by the district court. In other words, a device intended for quantitative analysis does not seem reduced to practice when it cannot make accurate measurements. As this Court held in <em>In Re Yarn Processing Patent Validity Litigation, </em>498 F.2d 271, 280 (5th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Sauquoit Fibers Co. </em>v. <em>Leesona Corp., </em>419 U.S. 1057, 95 S.Ct. 640, 42 L.Ed.2d 654 (1974), \u201c \u2018reduction to practice\u2019 includes not only [the] reduction [of an idea] to reality but also sufficient testing or experimentation to demonstrate that the device as it exists possesses sufficient utility to justify a patent, i.e., <em>that\u2022 the invention is suitable for its intended purpose.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellants\u2019 syringe in the second prototype did not seem to possess sufficient utility to justify a patent or to be suitable for its intended purpose; it may not have been a \u201cfunctioning reality\u201d or a reality that could \u201cperform the general function for which it was developed,\u201d as defined in <em>In Re Yarn Processing. See </em>498 F.2d at 283. In short, the syringe\u2019s measuring problem may have defeated the idea behind the invention. Appellants\u2019 testimony on this issue cannot be entirely disregarded, because \u201c[assessment of the probative value of evidence is properly the function of the jury or the judge sitting as a trier of facts,\u201d not of the court for summary judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 287.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> And when combined with Dr. Tejada\u2019s problematic deposition testimony, it certainly raises an issue of material fact sufficient to preclude summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-10\">\n<em>B. The Third Prototype</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ax6-dedup-0\">In addition, we do not think that the third prototype reduced the invention to practice. Although the third prototype later proved to be a successful device, it was not completed before the critical date. The parties cite no cases from this Circuit allowing exceptions to the general rule that uncompleted articles are not reduced to practice, and the evidence does not seem to support the application of such an exception here even if we accept the cases from other Circuits. <em>See generally </em>the cases discussed in Annot., 25 A.L.R.Fed. 486, at \u00a7 11 (1975). Appellants\u2019 finalized design had not been unequivocally offered for sale as a satisfactory product: they had ordered the construction of only six third-prototype syringes and intended to display these later at a trade show, but they had not begun any sales.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This evidence simply does not seem strong enough to impose the \u201creduced to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1100\">*1100</page-number>practice\u201d label on the uncompleted third prototype, at least not in summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-4\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-5\">Because this Court reads the patent to be different from the district court\u2019s reading and because we find evidence of factual disputes concerning the reduction to practice of both the second and third prototypes, we must reverse the district court\u2019s summary judgment. We do not, however, reach any conclusion regarding the merits of this case; instead, we leave such a decision to the wisdom of the district court after it has fully heard the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-6\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1147-6\">. The statutory \u201con sale\u201d bar reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgM\">\u00a7 102. Conditions for patentability: novelty and loss of right to patent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A32\">A person shall be entitled to a patent unless\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1147-7\">(b) the invention was ... on sale in this country, more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent in the United States ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1147-13\">35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b) (1954).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1147-14\">. The sale was clearly for commercial purposes: appellants did not condition the sale with any requirements for EPA to perform any tests with the syringes or to report any test results back to them. Thus, appellants cannot and do not claim the \u201cexperimental use\u201d exception to the \u201con sale\u201d bar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1148-7\">. Indeed, qualitative analysis, which tests a chemical sample only to determine what chemical elements and compounds it contains, requires no more than a device that can transfer approximate and even unmeasured amounts of the sample to the test equipment. Quantitative analysis, on the other hand, tests a chemical sample for the amounts of its constituent elements and therefore requires a device that can deliver exact amounts of the sample to the test equipment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1148-11\">. Of course, in reviewing a motion for summary judgment, this Court looks at the record in a light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. <em>Walters v. City of Ocean Springs, </em>626 F.2d 1317, 1322 (5th Cir. 1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1149-6\">. In <em>In Re Yarn Processing </em>this Court also observed that \u201c[i]n rare instances, the invention might be so simple that its practical utility would be obvious even without any testing.\u201d 498 F.2d at 279 n.5. Appellants\u2019 device limited to its quantitative purpose may not fall within this \u201csmall class\u201d of such \u201csimple\u201d inventions \u2014 after all, the reduction to practice rule is meant to allow the inventor to prove that his idea can be made to work well enough to justify a patent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1149-7\">. Summary judgment is even less appropriate in actions involving the intent of the parties. Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil \u00a7 2730 (1973). In this case, intent is clearly relevant in construing the patent. It may also be relevant in determining whether the invention was reduced to practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-8\">Concerning this latter point, the district court found that no issue of fact existed as to appellants\u2019 intent because they introduced evidence only of appellant Stearns\u2019 intent, not of appellant Ramin\u2019s (and because Ramin\u2019s company actually sold the second prototype to EPA). But we think that the intent of coinventors may be imputed to each other, at least to the extent of raising a fact issue as to their intent regarding reduction to practice. Thus, summary judgment should not have been used.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1149-12\">. Of course, the third prototype resulted from a rather simple modification of the second prototype, and thus it may be viewed as a completion of the idea offered for sale in the second prototype model. But the evidence of a \u201cfreeze\u201d in the design before the critical date does not seem sufficient to allow summary judgment on the reduction to practice of an untested invention intended for quantitative analysis alone, as this Court reads appellant\u2019s patent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
