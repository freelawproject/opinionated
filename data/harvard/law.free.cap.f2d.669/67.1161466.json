David Axelrod, individually and as New York State Commissioner of Health, cross-appeals (1) from Judge Motley\u2019s order denying his motion to dismiss with a request for disclosure of the identities of the plaintiffs, (2) from the trial court\u2019s order granting Moe\u2019s motion to certify plaintiff classes, and (3) from the order and judgment granting leave to Cristina Coe and Pedro Doe to intervene and proceed without disclosing their identities.. We affirm in all respects, substantially for the reasons stated in Judge Motley\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned opinion. In view of the novel and significant questions raised by Moe\u2019s claim that the New York parental consent requirements for the marriage of minors are unconstitutional, we add the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Moe asserts a deprivation of liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution as a result of the operation of New York Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 15 (14 McKinney, 1977). New York law requires that all male applicants for a marriage license between ages 16 and 18 and all female applicants between ages 14 and 18 must obtain the consent of their parents, and that a female between ages 14 and 16 must obtain judicial approval as well as parental consent. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 15.2, 15.3. Intimate activities concerning marriage and family relations have long been accorded stringent judicial protection on the ground that such activities implicate rights of privacy protected by the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. <em>See, e.g., Zablocki v. Redhail, </em>434 U.S. 374, 98 S.Ct. 673, 54 L.Ed.2d 618 (1978); <em>Moore v. City of East Cleveland, </em>431 U.S. 494, 97 S.Ct. 1932, 52 L.Ed.2d 531 (1977); <em>Skinner v. Oklahoma, </em>316 U.S. 535, 62 S.Ct. 1110, 86 L.Ed. 1655 (1942). While courts have subjected certain restrictions on the right to marry to heightened scrutiny, <em>see, e.g., Zablocki v. Redhail, supra </em>(statute provided that failure to comply with child support orders precluded a parent from marrying without court permission); <em>Loving v. Virginia, </em>388 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1817, 18 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1967) (antimiscegenation statute unconstitutionally infringed right to marry), the right of minors to marry has not been viewed as a fundamental right deserving strict scrutiny. Accordingly, Judge Motley was correct in testing the constitutionality of New York Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 15 by determining whether there exists a rational relation between the means chosen by the New York legislature and legitimate state interests in adopting and enforcing the restriction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In light of New York\u2019s important interest in promoting the welfare of children by preventing unstable marriages among those lacking the capacity to act in their own best interests, <em>see Addington v. Texas, </em>441 U.S. 418, 426, 99 S.Ct. 1804, 1810, 60 L.Ed.2d 323 (1979), we agree with Judge Motley that the New York statutory scheme passes constitutional muster.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Accordingly, we affirm in all respects.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b124-5\">. In a case involving minors who desire to marry as a means of granting legitimacy to their child, the New York statutory scheme provides relief. New York Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 24(1) states that the subsequent marriage of the parents confers legitimacy upon a child born prior to the marriage. Furthermore, the effect of out-of-wedlock birth may be erased by adoption of the child pursuant to New York Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 117(1). Accordingly, the New York statute provides at least two avenues by which minor parents of a child born prior to the time at which they can enter a valid legal marriage can ensure that the child will not suffer from acts or omissions of the parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">It should also be noted that Section 15\u2019s requirement of parental consent applies to all minors within the statutory age categories, not just those with illegitimate children. As a result, the New York statutory scheme cannot be viewed as an attempt to punish minors with illegitimate children.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
