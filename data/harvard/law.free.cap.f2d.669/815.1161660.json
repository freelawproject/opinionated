On the complaint of individual employees and unions representing federal workers, the district court, 510 F.Supp. 596, in March 1981, ordered a permanent stop to the parking charges.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The government asserted, and the district court assumed <em>arguendo, </em>that the President, and executive branch agencies acting at his direction, had authority to institute the parking charges under the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act (FPASA).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nonetheless, the district court concluded that the energy conservation purpose the President sought to advance through the charges placed the plan under governance of newer legislation, the 1975 Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Concededly, the President had not proceeded as speci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>fied in that Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, the district court held the executive action unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\">We conclude that the parking charges were authorized by and validly imposed under the FPASA and that the EPCA does not subtract from authority the FPASA grants to the President. Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s judgment and remand with instructions to enter judgment in favor of the Administrator. In this opinion, we set out first the chronology of relevant events; next, the bases for our determination that the FPASA authorizes the executive directives at issue here; and, finally, our reasons for concluding that the EPCA, which augments initiatives available to the President to promote energy conservation, does not truncate or displace pre-ex-isting FPASA authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">I. The President\u2019s Decision and Its Implementation</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">A. <em>The parking issue paper: a multi-pur-pose proposal contained in an energy packet</em></p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">On March 22, 1979, President Carter received from two of his Domestic Policy Staff aides a packet of materials under a cover sheet captioned \u201cEnergy Issues.\u201d One of the items in the packet was a four-page issue paper headed \u201cPhase-out of Federal Parking Subsidies.\u201d The paper presented the following question for the President\u2019s decision: \u201cShould parking subsidies lor Federal employees be phased-out at locations where nongovernment workers typically pay commercial parking rates?\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Air quality, transportation policy, and energy conservation concerns were cited in support of eliminating the subsidies. The paper further stated that the estimated annual cost recovery to the government would be in the $31 to $47 million range. In addition, the paper pointed out that for those who drive alone, the annual before-tax subsidy could amount to $1,100 or more; employees in carpools reaped a much lower individual benefit; persons using mass transit or working for agencies that lacked parking facilities received no subsidy at all for the cost of the trip to work. As the principal reason against ending parking subsidies, the paper cited adverse effects on the morale of federal workers. A \u201cconclusions and recommendations\u201d section stated that the head of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) considered the phase out \u201cthe right way to go\u201d; it indicated the course on which OMB would proceed, commencing with distribution of a draft circular to federal agencies, if the President had no objection. The paper\u2019s final page set out Decision lines. The line facing \u201cAgree. Issue draft circular.\u201d bears a checkmark and the President\u2019s initial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b873-16\">B. <em>The President\u2019s energy address and accompanying fact sheet: a single-issue speech and a more detailed White House release</em></p>\n<p id=\"b873-17\">In an April 5, 1979 address to the nation on the country\u2019s serious and worsening energy problem, President Carter announced numerous actions, plans, and proposals to \u201cmove us away from imported oil and toward a future of real energy security.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>One sentence in the list of measures the President announced concerned the parking subsidy phase out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-4\">Steps will be taken to eliminate free parking for Government employees in order to reduce the waste of energy, particularly gasoline, in commuting to and from work.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">A fact sheet released simultaneously with the President\u2019s speech by the White House Press Secretary provided further detail on items mentioned in the address. \u201cPhase out of Free Parking for Federal Employees\u201d appears in the fact sheet under the main heading \u201cLonger Term Conservation Activities.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The fact sheet stated that \u201c[t]he President has directed the Office of Management and Budget to begin phasing out subsidized parking for federal employees.\u201d It further stated that fees for parking \u201care intended to encourage greater carpooling and use of mass transit for commuting, and to recover the $35-40 million in costs which are borne by the general taxpayer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">C. <em>OMB\u2019s Circular and GSA\u2019s Regulation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">The day following the President\u2019s address, OMB distributed to federal agencies and federal employee unions a draft of Circular No. A-118, establishing policy on federal employee parking charges. Published in final version on August 17, 1979,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the circular cited, in addition to an energy conservation purpose, concerns about air quality, traffic congestion, and equity among federal employees. The Federal Register preamble referred to the President\u2019s April 5, 1979 energy address and also identified the expected $35 to $40 million saving in public funds. As authority for the parking charges, the circular cited the FPASA, as amended (40 U.S.C. \u00a7 490),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and referred to a 1976 Comptroller General review of the matter (55 Comp.Gen. 897);<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> it next described the responsibilities of the General Services Administration (GSA), <em>inter alia, </em>to determine rates and issue implementing regulations.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b874-13\">On September 6, 1979, GSA issued Temporary Regulation D-65, prescribing policies and procedures for the assignment of federal employee parking spaces and the assessment of charges for the use of such spaces.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> That regulation became effective November 1, 1979. Federal agencies, pursuant to OMB Circular No. A-118 and GSA Temporary Regulation D-65, started phasing in parking charges on or shortly after that date.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Some sixteen months later, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>free parking was restored by the district court order now before us on appeal.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\">II. The District Court\u2019s Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Energy conservation was the paid parking plan\u2019s <em>\u201craison d\u2019etre,\u201d </em>the district court declared, other reasons offered were \u201cmerely incidental.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The EPCA had granted the President standby authority, subject to congressional review, \u201cto reduce demand for energy through the implementation of energy conservation [contingency] plans.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> An \u201cenergy conservation contingency plan\u201d is defined in the Act as \u201ca plan which imposes reasonable restrictions on the public or private use of energy which are necessary to reduce energy consumption.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The paid parking plan \u201cimposes restrictions on the use of energy and its purpose is to reduce energy consumption,\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> the district court stressed. Therefore, that court concluded, the plans falls squarely within EPCA territory. On this analysis, the district court reasoned, it was unnecessary to decide whether the parking plan \u201ccould have validly been implemented in reliance on the [FPASA] under any circumstances.\u201d <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In the district court\u2019s view, the case turned on the \u201cspecific congressional command\u201d in the EPCA \u201cthat energy conservation [contingency] plans could be implemented only after congressional review and with congressional concurrence.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> That command, the district court believed, precluded the President from relying on more general authority: The President had ignored the EPCA and that meant the parking charge could not stand.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b875-15\">We do not perceive as clearly as did the district court that energy conservation eclipsed all other reasons for instituting parking charges. But even if we agreed that packaging the plan in an energy kit rendered air quality, cost recoupment, and other stated concerns \u201cmerely incidental,\u201d we would not conclude that the EPCA governed. The parking charge was not presented as a standby conservation plan for the short term, the kind of measure appropriate for the EPCA\u2019s \u201ccontingency plan\u201d regime. Rather, it was put forward as a permanent fixture authorized by a law, the FPASA, that Congress had neither repealed nor revised. Because we do not read the EPCA as a statute encompassing the universe of energy-minded actions,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> we must start with the inquiry the district court did not fully pursue: Was the parking charge authorized by and validly imposed under the FPASA?</p>\n<p id=\"b875-16\">III. Fees for Employee Parking in Federal Facilities Were Validly Imposed Under Executive Authority Stipulated in the FPASA</p>\n<p id=\"b875-17\">The central question, as we view this case, is \u201cwhether or to what extent\u201d the FPASA authorized the executive initiation of charges to individual federal employees for the use of federally owned parking spaces. <em>See NAACP v. FPC, </em>425 U.S. 662, 665, 96 S.Ct. 1806, 1809, 48 L.Ed.2d 284 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>(1976).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Section 486(a) of this Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-4\">The President may prescribe such policies and directives, not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act, as he shall deem necessary to effectuate the provisions of said Act, which policies and directives shall govern the [General Services] Administrator and executive agencies in carrying out their respective functions hereunder.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">The legitimacy under section 486(a) of President Carter\u2019s prescription of the free parking phase out,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> implemented by OMB Circular No. A-118 and, in turn, GSA Temporary Regulation D-65, thus depends on whether the President acted \u201cto effectuate the provisions\u201d of the FPASA and, if he did, whether his action was \u201cnot inconsistent with\u201d any specific provision of the Act. <em>See AFL-CIO v. Kahn, supra, </em>618 F.2d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>The provisions of the FPASA are effectuated if the executive action in question assists \u201cthe Government [in obtaining] an economical and efficient system for . . . the utilization of available property.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> We believe it evident that the free parking phase out fits this description. The phase out would allow the government to recover annually an amount estimated to exceed $30 million. This cost recovery consideration was cited in the parking issue paper that elicited the President\u2019s action. In short, we find it inescapably obvious that the institution of parking charges would, indeed, assist the government in utilizing its property efficiently and economically.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-3\">Appellees do not suggest that cost recovery or elimination of a benefit spread unevenly among federal employees falls beyond the pale of section 486(a). They emphasize, however, the energy conservation concern announced in support of the parking charge. The parking issue paper mentioned in addition other national goals not directly linked to economy and efficiency in government property management \u2014 cleaner air and reduced traffic congestion. We cannot agree that an exercise of section 486(a) authority becomes illegitimate if, in design and operation, the President\u2019s prescription, in addition to promoting economy and efficiency, serves other, not impermissible, ends as well. Our position in this regard is informed by notable precedent. <em>See, e.g., AFL-CIO v. Kahn, supra, </em>618 F.2d at 792-93 (additional goal of slowing inflation in the economy as a whole); <em>Contractors Association v. Secretary of Labor, </em>442 F.2d 159, 171 (3d Cir.) (additional goal of promoting enhanced employment opportunities for minorities), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 854, 92 S.Ct. 98, 30 L.Ed.2d 95 (1971); <em>Farmer v. Philadelphia Electric Co., </em>329 F.2d 3, 8 (3d Cir. 1964) (additional goal of checking racial discrimination).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">Appellees further urge that even if the parking charge was intended to and would in fact effectuate the general provisions of the FPASA relating to economical and efficient utilization of government property, the action at issue is nonetheless invalid because it is inconsistent with specific provisions of the Act. For this argument, ap-pellees rely on sections 490(j) and (k) of the FPASA.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> These sections, they contend, confer authority to impose space occupancy charges directly upon the Administrator of GSA and executive agencies. According to appellees, any command emanating from the President imposing space-occupancy charges, directing the Administrator to do so, or delegating authority in the premises to OMB would be inconsistent with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>statutory provisions explicitly authorizing action by \u201cthe Administrator\u201d and by an \u201cexecutive agency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">We find this argument unpersuasive. The plain language of section 486(a) states that policies and directives the President prescribes \u201cshall govern the Administrator and executive agencies in carrying out their respective functions hereunder.\u201d The legislative history of the FPASA, moreover, confirms that Congress intended section 486(a) to clarify that \u201cPresidential policies and directives shall govern \u2014 not merely guide \u2014 not only the Administrator but all executive agencies in carrying out these property-management functions.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Sections 490(j) and (k), it is true, state what the Administrator and an executive agency are authorized to do. But section 486(a) assigns to the President the lead role. Pursuant to that provision, the President has clear authority to direct the Administrator and executive agencies \u201cin carrying out their respective functions\u201d under specific FPASA provisions, including sections 490(j) and (k). Thus we find nothing \u201cinconsistent with the provisions of [the FPASA]\u201d in a directive by the President that requires the Administrator and agency heads to install <footnotemark>31</footnotemark> a system for collection of parking fees from individuals.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>Finally, even in the absence of a clear statutory provision establishing a governing role for the President, we would not conclude that Congress, simply by assigning a function to an executive agency, thereby intended to exclude initiating action by the President. As this court has had recent occasion to observe, \u201cWithin the range of choice allowed by statute, the President may direct his subordinates\u2019 choices.\u201d <em>National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1622 v. Brown, </em>645 F.2d 1017, 1022 (D.C.Cir.1981). <em>See also National Treasury Employees Union v. Reagan, </em>663 F.2d 239, 248 (D.C.Cir.1981); <em>Sierra Club v. Costle, </em>657 F.2d 298, 406 &amp; n.524 (D.C.Cir.1981).<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">In sum, President Carter directed executive action \u2014 the phase out of free parking for federal employees \u2014 mindful of and fully compatible with the design of the FPASA to promote economy and efficiency in the utilization of government property. His authority to direct the phase out is securely established by section 486(a)<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> and no other provision of the Act is inconsistent with the action he commanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">IV. The President\u2019s Authority to Direct the Phase Out of Free Parking for Federal Employees Is Not Eliminated or Diminished by the EPCA</p>\n<p id=\"b879-10\">In the FPASA, Congress established a governing role for the President in setting policy and directing federal agencies regarding the procurement and management of government property. We have concluded that the phase out of free parking for federal employees, as determined by the President and implemented by OMB and GSA, falls comfortably within the property management executive authority conferred by section 486(a) of the FPASA. We now turn to the question whether Congress, when it enacted the EPCA, <em>sub silentio </em>withdrew or qualified the authority granted to the President under the FPASA.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-11\">As appellees acknowledge, the EPCA empowers the President \u201cto respond quickly to energy supply interruptions or other energy crises.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> It arms the President with new authority to initiate \u201ccontingency plans\u201d for energy conservation in urgent circumstances.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> But this novel au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>thority is subject to controls. First, and perhaps principally indicative of the crises character of the executive initiatives Congress envisioned, contingency plans may not run beyond nine months.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Second, while Congress must respond to the President\u2019s initiatives expeditiously (within 60 days of transmittal),<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> approval resolutions of both Houses are prerequisite to implementation of a contingency plan.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Third, certain measures may not be taken under the extraordinary EPCA contingency plan initiation and approval procedure. The President may not prescribe in a contingency plan \u201crationing or any tax, tariff, or user fee.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Nor may he propose in this manner \u201cany provision respecting the price of petroleum products,\u201d or \u201cprovide for a credit or deduction in computing any tax.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> New law in these areas, even for a short term, must be made through the regular legislative process. The EPCA\u2019s contingency plan provisions thus guardedly augment the President\u2019s power. We cannot read into the Act\u2019s qualified, crisis-focused grant of extraordinary power <footnotemark>42</footnotemark> any intention to terminate or modify authority Congress earlier had accorded the President.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>Our view that the EPCA does not subtract from authority that other legislation, including the FPASA, confers is buttressed by references in the text of the Act. Sig-nalling that the EPCA does not repeal other laws by sweeping within its governance all federal attempts to curtail prodigal use of energy, the Act calls upon the President to exercise his authority \u201cunder other law\u201d to develop standards with respect to energy efficiency in Government procurement policies and decisions.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> It further instructs the President, \u201cto the extent of his authority under other law,\u201d to implement a long-range (10-year) plan for energy conservation in buildings owned or leased by federal agencies.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">Appellees call to our attention the President\u2019s resort to the EPCA to gain approval from Congress for two of the energy programs listed in the White House fact sheet released at the time of the President\u2019s April 5, 1979 energy address.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Formal EPCA contingency plans were presented to Congress for building temperature restrictions<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> and mandatory weekend closing of gasoline stations.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> If these programs were subject to the EPCA, appellees reason, then the parking program listed in the very same fact sheet was equally subject to that Act\u2019s regime.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> The flaw in this reasoning is apparent. No \u201cother law\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> authorized the President to impose thermostat controls in nonpublic buildings.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Nor did any \u201cother law\u201d provide for the closing of privately owned gasoline stations by federal command.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-13\">To summarize, we reject the notion that all \u201cPresidential actions attempting to conserve energy must be taken pursuant to the EPCA.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Rather, we believe the EPCA contingency plan provisions on which appellees rely must be invoked only in situations not provided for in other laws. The executive action taken here is covered by another law, the FPASA. Consistent with the lead role the FPASA reserves for the Chief Executive in government property management, the President directed executive agencies subject to his supervision to impose fees for parking spaces furnished to federal employees. One of the stated purposes for that direction was cost recovery, and there is no doubt that the measure in fact serves a genuine interest in thrifty management of government facilities. The program is not rendered unlawful because it was billed as an energy-minded measure and in fact may work to conserve energy. We decline to convert a law designed to enhance the President\u2019s power to act in energy crises into an instrument to shear the Chief Executive\u2019s authority under other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>legislation. Since the district court judgment has that effect, we reverse that judgment <footnotemark>53</footnotemark> and remand with instructions to enter judgment in favor of the Administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b872-12\">. On March 6, 1981, the district court denied the Administrator\u2019s motion for a stay of the injunction pending appeal. One week later, this court denied an emergency motion for a stay pending appeal.

The time limitation would be divorced from its function, the government urges, if it were read to apply to the pass on of charges by the agencies. Despite the language of the statutory note, which refers expressly to section 490(k) as well as section 490(j), the government\u2019s position comports with the probable intent of Congress in stipulating a time limitation. The legislative history suggests that the time directive was included solely to speed the process of rendering agencies accountable for the space they use:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-12\">While Section [11], the last section, makes the legislation effective upon enactment, it recognizes the necessity for postponing the effective date of the user charges for a reasonable period after enactment to accommodate the budgetary process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b878-13\">Letter from Harry S.

This statement indicates that Congress recognized some delay was unavoidable, but sought to insure that accommodation to the budgeting process would not take more than three years.

Appellee NTEU argues that \u201cnothing on the face of Sections 490(j) and (k), or in the legislative history, indicates that Congress intended that GSA or Federal agencies would charge individual employees who park on government-owned parking lots. The statutory language and its history speak only in terms of charging the agencies.\u201d NTEU Brief at 36. <em>See also </em>510 F.Supp. at 600 n.12. In light of our holding, NTEU\u2019s argument amounts to an assertion that Presidential action under section 486(a), directing that individual employees be charged, is inconsistent with section 490, and is therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>invalid. Even if we agreed with NTEU\u2019s premise concerning what appears \u201con the face\u201d of the legislation, we would question the strained reading NTEU gives to the \u201cnot inconsistent with\u201d proviso of section 486(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">But we cannot accept NTEU\u2019s premise. The statute provides that \u201canyone,\u201d see note 29 <em>supra, </em>a term which ordinarily would include individuals, is subject to a charge for space use. Additionally, the legislative history does not bear out NTEU\u2019s position. The Senate version of section 490(k) would have allowed agencies, which provide space to other agencies, to charge only those other \u201cagencies\u201d for such space. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 412, 92d Cong., 1st Sess. 10 (1971). The House version, on the other hand, which was adopted at conference, allowed an agency to charge \u201canyone\u201d provided space by the agency. H.R.Rep. No. 1097, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. 12 (1972). In view of this language change, we are unable to read section 490(k) as disallowing a charge to individual employees for the parking spaces they use. <em>See also </em>55 Comp.Gen. 897, 899-900 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b879-8\">.
