(\u201cGathering\u201d), and Citmoco Services, Inc. (\u201cCitmoco\u201d), to the Grand Bahamas Petroleum Company (\u201cPETCO\u201d) in the commonwealth of the Bahamas, pursuant to four export licenses issued by the Department of Commerce. These shipments were made pursuant to agreements between Bart Chamberlain, principal officer and principal stockholder of Gathering and Citmoco, and Edward M. Carey, principal officer and/or director of Carey Energy Corporation which owned New England Petroleum Corporation (\u201cNEPCO\u201d). It affirmatively appears that PETCO, to which company the petroleum was originally shipped from the United States, is a wholly owned subsidiary of NEPCO, the final recipient of the oil in question. The oil was refined by Bahamas Oil Refiners Co. (\u201cBARCO\u201d) which is partially owned by PETCO. The first three contracts involved a sale of approximately 765,000 barrels at $14.00 per barrel; a fourth sale was of approximately 200,000 barrels at $13.00 per barrel. In order to effectuate the sale to PETCO, appellants were required to obtain export licenses from the Department of Commerce, and did so upon the showing that the proposed exportation of crude oil would not \u201caffect the total quantity or quality of petroleum available to domestic users____\u201d 15 C.F.R. \u00a7 377.6(b)(1); 38 Fed.Reg. 34442, 34443 (Dec. 13, 1973). The Federal Energy Office participated in the review and approval of the application for the export licenses, and officials of the Federal Energy Office were fully informed as to the details of the transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-18\">Spawned by newspaper articles appearing in the summer of 1975, an initial investigation was had into the possible involvement of the Governor of New York resulting in a grand jury determination, with ultimate ac-knowledgement by the Department of Justice, that there was no credible evidence to support any allegations against that individual. A Congressional investigation also concluded that there was no substance to the allegations against the Governor of New York. In January, 1976, the Federal Energy Agency (\u201cFEA\u201d) instituted another investigation involving, primarily, the enforcement of certain subpoenas, and during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>that litigation, in November of 1978, defendant filed a second allowed counterclaim under the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, as amended, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1904 n. \u00a7 209 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (\u201cESA\u201d) on behalf of the alleged overcharge of the domestic customers of NEPCO.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">On cross motions for summary judgment, the district court granted partial judgment for the United States. <em>Citronelle-Mobile Gathering, Inc. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Leary, </em>499 F.Supp. 871 (S.D.Ala.1980). From this judgment appellants pursue an interlocutory appeal presenting four issues for decision at this level.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">The case and all incidental issues revolve around the central question of whether the export exemption applies. If the sales are to be treated as exports, and/or domestic sales for export crude petroleum subject to the export licenses regulations of the Department of Commerce (\u201cDOC\u201d), then such are expressly excluded from FEA\u2019s petroleum allocation regulations; 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 211.-1. Prices charged for export sales, including sales to a domestic purchaser which certifies the product is for export, are also exempt from FEA\u2019s petroleum pricing regulations; 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.53. The question of whether the export exemption applies suggests the conclusion that if appellants are allowed to take advantage of what appeared to be a loophole in the law, then the whole concept of consumer protection, as found in the Department of Energy\u2019s (\u201cDOE\u201d) regulations, may be frustrated. We consider in this light.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">THE SALES OF AMERICAN CRUDE OIL BY AN AMERICAN FIRM TO THE WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF ANOTHER AMERICAN FIRM WERE NOT \u201cEXPORT SALES\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">Appellants have urged this Court to consider the \u201cplain\u201d or \u201ccommonly accepted\u201d meaning of the term \u201cexport sale\u201d. This Court cannot concentrate on individual words and ignore a consideration of the context in which the term appears. In order to determine the precise meaning of the term \u201cexport sale\u201d it is imperative that strong consideration be given to the entire transaction giving rise to the \u201cexport sale\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, coupled with a consideration of the purpose for which this regulation was intended.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-13\">As stated earlier, appellant firms, both American corporations, sold crude oil produced in the United States to PETCO, a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary of another American corporation (NEPCO). Once refined, the same quantity of refined products was returned, not only to the United States, but to the <em>refiner\u2019s parent corporation </em>in the United States. This transaction, admittedly clever, is not original. In 1883, the Attorney General issued an opinion evolving from circumstances in which whiskey was to be shipped from the United States to Bermuda with the intent that it be returned to the United States after it had been aged. That opinion, holding there was no exportation, was later quoted with approval by the Supreme Court. <em>See Swan &amp; Finch v. United States, </em>190 U.S. 143, 145, 23 S.Ct. 702, 703, 47 L.Ed. 984 <em>quoting </em>17 Op.A.G. 579, 583 (1883). The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-14\">[T]he legal notion ... of exportation is a severance of goods from the mass of things belonging to this country with the intention of uniting them to the mass of things belonging to some foreign country.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 145, 23 S.Ct. at 703. <em>See also United States v. 200 Watches, </em>66 F.Supp. 228, 230, (S.D.N.Y.1946). In the case at bar, appellant\u2019s intention was that the refined products attributable to the Chamberlain firm\u2019s crude oil be returned to the United States. There was never any intention that the crude oil be joined with the mass of things in the Bahamas.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>The apparent plan of appellant\u2019s transactions becomes much clearer when considered along with the purpose and actual requirements of the pertinent regulations. Exports, and domestic sales for export, of crude petroleum subject to export license regulations of the Department of Commerce were, and are, excluded from FEA\u2019s petroleum allocation regulations. Prices charged for these \u201cexport sales\u201d, are exempt from the FEA\u2019s petroleum pricing regulations. (10 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.53 provides: The prices charged for export sales including sales to a domestic purchaser which certifies the product is for export, are exempt.) In order to take advantage of this exemption one must follow the simple, rudimentary procedure of obtaining an export license. This involves a showing that the \u201ctotal quantity or quality of petroleum available to the United States\u201d would not be diminished. 15 C.F.R. \u00a7 377.6(b)(1). Once licensed, an exporter is free to charge whatever price the foreign market can bear. Thus, the regulations were promulgated in such a way as to, among other things, increase foreign revenue, stabilize the economy, and assure sufficient quantities of petroleum. However, when the economic reality of the transactions is examined, it is quite obvious, as the able trial judge perceived, that these transactions had precisely the effect which Congress sought to avoid in enacting the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973 (EPAA), to wit; higher oil prices to American buyers. <em>Citronelle, supra </em>at 883.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">Finally, the case of <em>United States v. Concentrated Phosphate Export Assn., </em>393 U.S. 199; 89 S.Ct. 361, 21 L.Ed.2d 344 (1968), is instructive and somewhat analogous. <em>Concentrated Phosphate </em>involved foreign aid paid for by the United States, specifically sales of phosphate to the Republic of Korea financed by the Agency for International Development. The Court faced the question of whether the associations made the sales \u201cin the course of export trade\u201d within the meaning of the Webb-Pomerene exemption, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 61 <em>et seq., </em>to the Sherman Act. The exemption allows the formation of joint associations in order to compete with foreign cartels in export trade. In making its decision the Supreme Court examined the purpose of the act in light of transactions occurring in attempts to take advantage of the Act. It is important to note that there is great similarity in the purpose of the DOE\u2019s \u201cexport sales\u201d exemption and that of the Webb-Pomerene Act. In the DOE exemption, price controls were implemented to, \u201cbenefit United States consumers and the domestic economy.\u201d FEA Ruling 1975-7, 40 Fed.Reg. 30037 (July 17, 1975). Likewise, in dealing with the Webb-Pomerene Act, the Court, in <em>Concentrated Phosphate, </em>noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-6\">It is clear what Congress was doing; it thought it could increase American exports by depriving foreigners of the benefits of competition among American firms, without in any significant way injuring American consumers. Cf. <em>United States Alkali Export Assn. v. United States, </em>325 U.S. 196, 211, 65 S.Ct. 1120, 1128, 89 L.Ed. 1554 (1945). The validity of this economic judgment is not for us to question, but it is quite relevant in interpreting the language Congress chose. The question before us is whether Congress meant its exemption to insulate transactions initiated, controlled, and financed by the American Government, just because a foreign government is the nominal \u201cpurchaser.\u201d We think it did not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-7\"><em>Id </em>at 208, 65 S.Ct. at 1127. As a result of this analysis the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-8\">[T]he framers of the Webb-Pomerene Act did not intend that Americans should be deprived of the main benefits of competition among American firms. Since in all relevant aspects the transactions involved here were American, not Korean, we hold that they are not \u201cexport trade\u201d within the meaning of the Webb-Pomerene Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ai2\"><em>Id </em>at 209-10, 65 S.Ct. at 1127-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">We conclude and so hold, that the trial judge was correct in his conclusion that these transactions were not \u201cexport sales\u201d within the meaning of the EPAA. Appellant\u2019s transactions involved a mere hint of foreign participation, were designed so as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>take advantage of the established regulations and were completely repugnant to Congress\u2019 intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">APPLICATION OF ALABAMA\u2019S ONE-YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS WOULD FRUSTRATE EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT OF THE ESA, EPAA AND RELATED STATUTES</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">This Court is faced with the question of whether Alabama\u2019s one-year statute of limitations<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> should be applied. If this statute were applied, the Government\u2019s claim for restitution would be altogether barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">We find there is no specific federal statute of limitations applicable to \u00a7 209 actions; there are various guidelines available which enable this Court to determine whether the Alabama statute applies. Specifically, the Supreme Court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-8\">has not mechanically applied a state statute of limitations simply because a limitations period is absent from the federal statute. State legislatures do not devise their limitations periods with national interests in mind, and it is the duty of the federal courts to assure that the importation of state laws will not frustrate or interfere with the implementation of national policies. \u201cAlthough state law is our primary guide in this area, it is not, to be sure, our exclusive guide.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, </em>421 U.S. 454, 456, 95 S.Ct. 1716, 1718, 44 L.Ed.2d 295 (1974). State limitations periods will not be borrowed if their application would be inconsistent with the underlying policies of the federal statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-9\"><em>Occidental Life Ins. Co. v. EEOC, </em>432 U.S. 355, 367, 97 S.Ct. 2447, 2454, 53 L.Ed.2d 402 (1977). It is also clear that state statutes of limitations must not be applied if such application would \u201cfrustrate or interfere with the implementation of national policies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 370-71, 97 S.Ct. at 2456-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">The primary underlying policy of the ESA is to insure effective enforcement of the pricing regulations, on a national scale. <em>See Bulzan v. Atlantic Richfield Co., </em>620 F.2d 278 (TECA 1980). As an aide to such enforcement the DOE has the right to seek restitution in ESA enforcement actions. In fact, restitution is \u201cappropriate and necessary to enforce compliance.\u201d <em>Univ. of Southern California v. Cost of Living Council, </em>472 F.2d 1065, 1070 (TECA 1972). The right to enforce compliance to such restitution of price overcharges is equitable, <em>Porter v. Warner Holding Co., </em>328 U.S. 395, 66 S.Ct. 1086, 90 L.Ed. 1332 (1946), and suits to enforce equitable rights created by federal law are not subject to state statutes of limitations, even if brought by a private party. <em>Holmberg v. Armbrecht, </em>327 U.S. 392, 66 S.Ct. 582, 90 L.Ed. 743 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-14\">Additionally, we must consider the overall effect of borrowing state statutes of limitations in cases such as the one at bar. Effective nationwide enforcement of the ESA must not be hampered by the various periods of limitations throughout the fifty states. Certainty as to the length of the limitation period will only facilitate the implementation of this national policy. Thus, we affirm the trial judge\u2019s decision to refuse the application of Alabama\u2019s one-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-15\">RESTITUTION IS APPROPRIATE RELIEF</p>\n<p id=\"b777-16\">Having agreed with the district court\u2019s determination that appellants have violated the provisions of the ESA, EPAA and the regulations promulgated thereunder which establish the ceiling price for the four sales of domestic crude oil, and the maximum lawful selling price for the resale of domestic crude oil, 6 C.F.R. part 150 and 10 C.F.R. part 212, this Court reviews the relief fashioned by the district court judge. The counterclaim seeks judgment requiring plaintiffs to pay into an escrow account, \u201cfor subsequent distribution to NEPCO customers\u201d, the excess charges. Allegations place the sum between $6,000,000.00 and $9,000,000.00, exclusive of interest and civil penalties. No accurate calculations are before the Court at this time. This Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>concurs in the district court\u2019s conclusion [499 F.Supp. at 885] that good faith, as opposed to willfulness, characterized plaintiff\u2019s dealings with the Department of Commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">An immediate confrontation with the method/process of enforcement emerges. Neither appellants, nor various <em>amici </em>attack restitution as being outside the scope of relief authorized, rather, they insist the decision ordering restitution to the United States Treasury is beyond the district court\u2019s authority. The Court finds on this issue no justification for allowing plaintiffs to retain their illegal gains.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">The district court, sitting as a Court of Equity, unless otherwise provided by statutes here in contemplation, had \u201call the inherent equitable powers of the District Court . . . available for the proper and complete exercise of that jurisdiction\u201d; <em>Porter, supra </em>328 U.S. at 398, 66 S.Ct. at 1089, and has power, \u201cto do equity and mould each decree to the necessities of the particular case\u201d; further, \u201cIt may act so as to adjust and reconcile competing claims ... so as to accord full justice to all the real parties in interest . . . . \u201d The authority inherent in the equity powers guarantees complete rather than truncated justice. <em>Camp v. Boyd, </em>229 U.S. 530, 551, 33 S.Ct. 785, 793, 57 L.Ed. 1317 (1913). The power of a district court to require restitution, as was pronounced in <em>United States v. Lieb, </em>333 F.Supp. 424 (W.D.Tex.1971), was specifically endorsed and ratified by Public Law 92-210 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Sec. 209), but nothing has been pronounced as to payment to the United States Treasury. Federal district courts unquestionably possess broad discretion in fashioning equitable remedies, <em>Franks v. Bowman Transportation, Co., </em>424 U.S. 747, 764, 96 S.Ct. 1251, 1264, 47 L.Ed.2d 444 (1975) but, as contemplated in the exercise of these powers to remedy civil wrongs and restore civil rights, the authority is vested to make the victims whole, \u201cso far as possible, and restored to a position where they would have been had it not been for\u201d the unlawful violation, such as was practiced here. It follows that payment to the United States Treasury is not restitution, in the true sense of the word, or in the objectives of the statutes here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">We face the brilliant rationale of the trial court in its envision of millions of customers along the east coast having been overcharged. Clear, however, is the fact that the sale of the over-priced oil was made to determinable utilities and other institutions along the Atlantic seaboard. Faced with a statute that specifically authorizes restitution, but makes no provision for direct payment to the treasury, we turn to <em>University of Southern California, supra, </em>which ordered refunds of excess charges for football tickets.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-9\">While this Court recognizes the considerable burden that such a refund demand places ... we recognize also the right of the agencies to require it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 1070.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-11\">We believe such a process to be a reasonable application of the power of the district court. This is obviously in the contemplation of defendant as evidenced by its request for relief. Actions by the United States under ESA \u00a7 209 are taken to enforce public, not private, rights. Thus, compensation is \u201ca by-product of the agency\u2019s effort to re-establish compliance with its regulatory scheme.\u201d <em>Bulzan, supra </em>at 282. The central purpose of restitution is to determine the amount by which the wrongdoer has been unjustly enriched, and then to make him disgorge that amount. No proof is required that the plaintiff was damaged, much less the amount of any damage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-12\">Restitution is generally awarded only in order to deprive the defendant of enrichment obtained at the plaintiff\u2019s expense . . . the general requirement does not mean that the gain to the defendant need be equated to the loss of the plaintiff, nor indeed that there need be any loss to the plaintiff except in the sense that a legally protected interest has been invaded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number><em>Restatement of Restitution, </em>Sec. 1, Comment e (1937), cited in <em>Sauder v. Doe, </em>648 F.2d 1341 (TECA 1981). The district court properly held that because NEPCO and PETCO aided and abetted the Chamberlain firms in their violation of the price regulations, for their material benefit, they are barred by \u201cunclean hands\u201d from seeking or recovering any of the illegal profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Apparently, however, restitution payments may be made to the Treasury under special order of the court. The Treasury holds the payments in a \u201cDeposit Fund Account\u201d to be paid out at the direction of DOE. <em>See </em>General Accounting Office Procedures Manual, Title 7, Sec. 4.10(6). <em>Cf. Hodgson v. Wheaton Glass Co., </em>446 F.2d 527, 535 (3d Cir. 1971).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Receipts contained in those accounts are subject to a \u201cconstructive trust,\u201d <em>Emery v. United States, </em>186 F.2d 900, 902 (9th Cir. 1951); are treated as liabilities of the United States, <em>see e.g., </em>Treasury Combined Statement of Receipts, Expenditures, and Balances of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 1978 at 3,12; and for their disbursement, an appropriation is not required. This affords an opportunity for DOE to pursue those proposals suggested by its request that the Court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-7\">Enter a judgment requiring Gathering, Services and Chamberlain to pay into an escrow account for subsequent distribution to NEPCO customers, a sum of . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZH\">As determined by the district court the Government has demonstrated injury to a class of persons. Whether the defendant will ask to amend under Rule 15, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, institute inter-pleader under Rule 22 and related statutes, or proceed otherwise is not revealed in the record before this Court. Suffice it to note that the Government has a <em>duty </em>to try to ascertain those overcharged, and refund them, with interest, from the restitution funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">The Order of the district court is modified and the case remanded to that forum for an Order directing the application to the General Accounting Office Procedures, and/or the furnishing of a plan for the \u201cDeposit Fund Account\u201d, and/or other appropriate procedures, to be approved by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-14\">Meanwhile, within such time as the district court may direct, the parties will enter a stipulation, failing which, file appropriate motions in that forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-15\">THERE IS NO FACTUAL BASIS FOR RECUSAL BY THE DISTRICT JUDGE</p>\n<p id=\"b779-16\">The grounds for recusal in this case were based entirely upon the unsupported assertion, of a United States\u2019 Attorney\u2019s unverified opinion, made at a social gathering. Regardless of whether it was a statement of the Attorney\u2019s opinion,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the motion failed to meet the requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455 and of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144. The motion was entirely without integrity, in addition to being untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-17\">The issue was not urged by appellants. We find no justification for lengthy discussion. The findings of the district court are adopted as the findings of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-18\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed except as modified by the opinion of this Court, and this ease is remanded to the district court for further proceedings in keeping with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-19\">AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b775-9\">.

I do not, however, find fault in the timing of the motion. Rather, I believe the motion \u2014 premised upon gratuitous speculation by opposing counsel as to possible bias of the judge, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>comments which the attorney later acknowledged to have been \u201ctotally baseless and unfair\u201d \u2014 lacks a sufficiently colorable factual basis for any reasonable question to have been raised concerning the judge\u2019s impartiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">B. <em>Limitations Period.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">I also concur in the conclusion that the government\u2019s claim for restitution was not barred by Alabama\u2019s one-year statute of limitation. As was true with the back pay claims presented by the government in <em>Occidental Life Ins. Co. v. EEOC, </em>432 U.S. 355, 97 S.Ct. 2447, 58 L.Ed.2d 402 (1977), such a limitations period would frustrate the implementation of national policies involved in the pricing regulations here in issue. The Supreme Court recognized in <em>Occidental </em>that in some circumstances a defense of laches might be appropriate; but the appellants have not here even argued that the trial judge was in error in finding that the defense of laches had not been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">C. <em>Applicability of Price Controls.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">I must respectfully dissent, however, from the affirmance of the ruling that the sales to PETCO in 1974 were not \u201cexport sales\u201d exempt from domestic price controls. While the imposition of price controls on these transactions might now appear to have been appropriate as a matter of policy, the regulations in place at the time the sales were contemplated and consummated did not limit the prices that PETCO might be charged, a conclusion which government officials had consistently, if begrudgingly, acknowledged prior to filing of the amended counterclaim in the present litigation in 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">The essential facts of the proposed transactions, including the price to be charged PETCO and the importation of a like quality of refined products into the United States, were shown in the applications for export licenses reviewed by the Petroleum Products Exception Committee, which included representatives from the FEO. As the prices exceeded permissible domestic levels, the Department of Commerce contacted FEO\u2019s General Counsel, who offered no objection to the proposed transactions and advised that there appeared to be no legal basis for denying the applications. The export licenses were granted, and there has been no suggestion in this litigation that those licenses were other than valid and proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-10\">The transactions were later scrutinized by attorneys from a United States Attorney\u2019s office, from the Department of Justice, and from the FEA. In terminating that investigation, it was the opinion of each attorney that \u201cif petroleum was exported pursuant to a valid export license, . . . the FEA price regulations did not apply to that sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b780-11\">Similarly, in an attachment to a letter to a Congressional committee investigating the transactions, the Administrator of the FEA wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-12\">Crude oil can be exported only pursuant to a valid export license. The FEA regulations have always provided that crude oil (or any refined product) sold for export is exempt from both FEA allocation and pricing regulations. 10 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 211.1(b)(1), 212.53(a). Therefore, assuming there is no other factor bearing on the issue, the sale of crude oil by a U.S. producer to a foreign refiner for export pursuant to a validly issued export license is exempt from U.S. price controls and can occur at whatever price the parties agree upon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-13\">The interpretation of a regulatory system by those charged with its enforcement should be given great deference by the judiciary, <em>e.g., Udall v. Tallman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 16-17, 85 S.Ct. 792, 801, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965), particularly with respect to a contemporaneous construction by those charged with setting the machinery of a new program in motion, <em>Chemehuevi Tribe of Indians v. Federal Power Comm\u2019n, </em>420 U.S. 395, 409-10, 95 S.Ct. 1066, 1075, 43 L.Ed.2d 279 (1975). See also <em>Andrus v. Shell Oil Co., </em>446 U.S. 657, 667-68, 100 S.Ct. 1932, 1938-39, 64 L.Ed.2d 593 (1980). This principle is not vitiated by the fact that the government agency may have at some later time in new interpretations or in the course of litigation attempted to advocate a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>change of its views. See <em>General Electric Co. v. Gilbert, </em>429 U.S. 125, 141-45, 97 S.Ct. 401, 410-12, 50 L.Ed.2d 343 (1976); <em>Norwegian Nitrogen Produces Co. v. United States, </em>288 U.S. 294, 53 S.Ct. 350, 77 L.Ed. 796 (1933). Nor, inasmuch as these particular transactions were scrutinized by the affected agencies and found to constitute exempt \u201cexport sales\u201d, do I find persuasive the appellees\u2019 efforts to cite as if applicable the interpretation of the regulations given in factually distinguishable situations. <em>Cf. Tesoro Petroleum Corp. </em>Interpretation No. 78-10, Enforcement Manual (CCH) \u00b6 56,400 (March 24, 1978) (equal volume exchange); FEA Interpretation 1977-16, 42 Fed.Reg. 31151 (June 20, 1977) (sale to instrumentality of United States for its consumption abroad).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">The construction of the regulatory system by the administrative agency prior to the current litigation was, moreover, consonant with \u2014 if not mandated by \u2014 the language of the regulations, however adequately or inadequately those regulations may have considered the effect of a tri-partite arrangement such as here involved. It can hardly be doubted that the sales by the appellants to PETCO \u2014 sales of crude oil produced by a domestic company in the United States to an unrelated foreign company located in the Bahamas, for refining at Bahamian facilities \u2014 would in ordinary usage be considered an \u201cexport sale,\u201d the words of 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.53(a). This would be so even though a like quantity of refined products was destined by prearrangement for shipment into the United States \u2014 as an \u201cimport\u201d free from price controls, to use the words of 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.53(b)\u2014to a third company which the trial court found, under rulings not challenged in this interlocutory appeal, to be independent from and not an alter ego of the Bahamian company.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">To be sure, words like \u201cexport sale\u201d or \u201cexport trade\u201d are not immune from consideration in the light of recognized principles of statutory and regulatory construction. See, <em>e.g., United States v. Concentrated Phosphate Export Assn., </em>393 U.S. 199, 89 S.Ct. 361, 21 L.Ed.2d 344 (1968).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I find unpersuasive, however, appellees\u2019 attempt to disavow its earlier interpretation that these sales to PETCO were \u201cexport sales\u201d exempted from price controls, while continuing to acknowledge that they were \u201cexports\u201d exempted from the allocation regulations by 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 211.1(b)(1). It is unnecessary to consider the extent to which total congruency between the allocation and price regulations should be required; it is sufficient to note that an inconsistent interpretation such as appellees suggest should hardly be favored. As this Court has said, \u201cCongress was conferring authority ... to regulate only the price of that which it was mandating the President to allocate.\u201d <em>Shell Oil Co. v. FEA, </em>527 F.2d 1243, 1246 (TECA 1975). One can hardly reconcile the present ruling, treating the transactions for purposes of price controls as if PETCO were a domestic refiner, with the earlier decision of the agency that for purposes of the allocation regulations \u201cit is .. . not appropriate that [PETCO\u2019s refinery] which is located in a foreign country be treated as if it were located in the United States.\u201d See <em>New England Petroleum Corp., </em>2 FEA \u00b6 83,136 at 83,429 (May 2, 1975), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>2 FEA \u00b6 80,468 (August 7, 1975), <em>modified, New England Petroleum Corp. v. FEA, </em>455 F.Supp. 1280 (S.D.N.Y.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">Nor is there merit in the argument that a distinction in treatment of the same trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>action under the allocation and price regulations can be justified on the basis that the exemption in the former is for \u201cexports\u201d while that in the latter is for \u201cexport sales.\u201d The difference is merely stylistic, as demonstrated by the fact that the same subsection of the pricing regulations also exempts sales to a domestic producer certified to be \u201cfor export\u201d, 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.53(a), and the next subsection of the regulations provides an exemption for \u201cimports\u201d, 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.53(b). Indeed, as appellants note, the purported distinction based upon joinder of the words \u201cexport\u201d and \u201csales\u201d in \u00a7 212.-53(a) would presumably mean that appellants\u2019 sales to PETCO were subject to price controls while PETCO\u2019s sales to NEPCO were not \u2014 with the bizarre result that, while NEPCO and its domestic customers would have remained subject to the higher prices, the so-called improper profits could have been made by a foreign company such as PETCO but not by domestic companies such as the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">Those writing the regulations have, moreover, shown that they know how to provide special treatment, if that is desired, where there are interrelated transactions. See, <em>e.g., </em>10 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.82 (definition of \u201cExchange\u201d in price regulations for refiners), \u00a7 212.92 (definition of \u201cMatching purchase and sale\u201d in price regulations for resellers and retailers). Indeed, after the transactions now in question had occurred, the regulations concerning export licenses were amended to provide, <em>inter alia, </em>for the consideration of the potential effect upon domestic prices prior to issuance of the license. See 15 C.F.R. \u00a7 377.6(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">D. <em>Propriety of Restitution.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">While the sales to PETCO were not, in my view, subject to price controls under the regulations as promulgated and construed by the enforcement agency, the majority\u2019s treatment of the issues concerning a remedy is more disturbing.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">The trial court held that the amounts charged PETCO in excess of domestic price levels, estimated at $6,000,000 to $9,000,000, should be paid by the appellant sellers to the United States. The payment is not to be made as a civil penalty or fine; indeed, the trial court absolved the appellants from liability for the relatively modest civil sanctions imposed under 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1904 n. \u00a7 208 for violation of the regulations. Rather, the award was described as one of \u201crestitution\u201d under \u00a7 209 of the Act, and was ordered paid into the treasury of the United States \u201cbecause it cannot flow to the wronged individuals and because permitting the retention of the illegal overcharges would utterly frustrate the purposes of the EPAA.\u201d The court reached this conclusion after having decided that (1) restitution should not be made to PETCO, the company charged the excessive price by appellants, because of \u201cunclean hands\u201d; (2) restitution should not be made to NEPCO, which purchased from PETCO the refined products, for a like reason; (3) restitution should not be made to most of NEPCO\u2019s customers because they passed on the overcharges to their customers; and (4) restitution could not, as a practical matter, be fairly apportioned among the vast number of consumers who ultimately bore the damage of higher prices. In a succinct statement of the rationale, the trial judge noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"At_\">\u201cRealistically this holding very simply means that, since the people are sovereign, and where large numbers, here millions, have been injured, the peoples\u2019 institution, the United States government, will recover the disgorged wrongful profits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">The majority of the opinion of this court concludes, quite correctly in my view, that payment to the treasury of the United States \u201cis not restitution in the true sense of the word or in the objectives of the statutes here involved.\u201d Restitution is a remedy in which restoration of the parties to their prior positions is sought to be effected by measuring relief on the basis of the improper benefits to the wrongdoer rather than on the basis of the damages to the injured party; it does not change traditional concepts as to the identity of the persons committing the wrong or sustaining the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>Nonetheless, the opinion apparently still leaves standing, under some vaguely defined notion of general equitable principles, the proposition that restitution should be paid to the government, to be held as if a constructive trust subject to directions of DOE. According to the instructions on remand, the government would have a \u201cduty to try to ascertain those overcharged, and refund them, with interest, from the restitution funds;\u201d it is left open for the district court to determine the extent, if any, to which the court would be involved in the implementation of a plan for distributing the amounts paid to the treasury. Any amounts not allocated and distributed to those found to have been overcharged \u2014 a task which the trial court has already found to be impracticable \u2014 would presumably es-cheat for all practical purposes to the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">The approach of the majority, while lacking the simplicity and directness of that adopted in the district court, suffers in my opinion from the same fatal flaw \u2014 prescribing a judicial remedy for violation of the regulations which is beyond that authorized in the Congressional enactment or the administrative regulations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In place of the remedy constructed by the district court, which in essence intermingles the provisions of the Act relating to civil penalties with those relating to restitution, the panel has substituted a remedy which in essence melds the concept of a parens patriae action with that of a fluid recovery. In my opinion neither approach is warranted by applicable law and precedents<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and each would have a far-reaching, untoward jurisprudential consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-12\">If, as the district court held, restitution should not or can not be paid to those who purchased the products at an illegally high price \u2014 and if it is appropriate that this issue be considered by this court on this appeal \u2014 \u2022 then I would hold that restitution should not be ordered, even if the result would be the retention of illegal gains.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-13\">I do not believe, however, that the question of restitution should be addressed on this interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). There has been no cross-appeal by the government under \u00a7 1292(b), and there is no final judgment in the district court from which appeals might be taken on all issues which bear upon the proper relief, if any, to be granted on proof of statutory violations. Whether, for example, the appellants should have been absolved from liability for any civil penalty is not presently before this court. Nor are the many rulings of the district court \u2014 such as the impracticability of determining those who were wronged by the alleged overcharge, the barring of PETCO and NEPCO from any award on the basis of \u201cunclean hands\u201d, and the barring from any award those which passed overcharges through to their customers<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014 which may well affect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>propriety of an award of restitution. I would therefore hold that the question of restitution should not be considered on this appeal and would vacate the permission previously given for interlocutory appeal of this issue as having been improvidently granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b781-5\">. In <em>Concentrated Phosphate, </em>sales of phosphate to the Republic of Korea in which an agency of the United States government \u201cselected the commodity, determined the amount to be purchased, controlled the contracting process, and paid the bill,\u201d 393 U.S. at 208, 89 S.Ct. at 366, were held not to be exempt from the anti-trust laws under the Webb-Pomerene Act. The Supreme Court, viewing the transactions as ones in which \u201cthe United States was, in essence, furnishing fertilizer to Korea,\u201d concluded that \u201cit stretches neither the language nor the purpose of the Act\u201d to hold that the imputed sales to the United States were subject to the anti-trust laws. <em>Id. </em>Unlike the case <em>sub judice, </em>the court was not in that decision adopting a construction which would be at variance with interpretations adopted by the agency charged with enforcement of the law or in conflict with the other portions of the regulatory system.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b783-6\">. While not mentioned in the opinion of the district court or that of the majority, it may be noted that in 1979 the regulations were amended to provide special procedures for refunds <em>administratively </em>found due to injured persons where either the identity of the persons or the amount of the refunds could not readily be ascertained. 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 205.280 <em>et seq., </em>44 Fed.Reg. 8566. These regulations permit the rejection of claims too small to warrant individual consideration, \u00a7 205.286(b), and the payment of undistributed funds to the treasury or in any other manner approved by the OHA, \u00a7 205.287(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b783-8\">.

United States, </em>186 F.2d 900 (9th Cir. 1951)\u2014 these have been situations where the identity of the payees and the amounts to be paid them had been resolved in the judicial proceedings brought by the government.
