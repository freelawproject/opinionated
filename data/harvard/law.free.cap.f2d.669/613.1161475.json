We note jurisdiction pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703 and deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-26\">Weaver was involved in an altercation with his supervisor in which the supervisor sustained a lacerated lip and two fractured teeth. Weaver insisted that he had merely raised his arms to fend off his supervisor and his supervisor\u2019s mouth came in contact with Weaver\u2019s forearm. The supervisor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>stated that Weaver punched him in the mouth. The supervisor also stated that Weaver had sworn at and assaulted him two years earlier. The department director believed the supervisor\u2019s story and issued a Notice of Proposed Removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">The MSPB did not err in admitting evidence of acts which occurred more than one year prior to the Notice of Proposed Removal. Decisions adversely affecting a government employee which are based upon poor job performance may not be based on incidents occurring more than one year pri- or to the Notice of Proposed Removal. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 4303(c)(2)(A). Weaver admits that his removal was not for poor job performance, but was to promote the efficiency of the service. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7512, 7513. The requirements of section 4303 do not apply to adverse actions undertaken to promote the efficiency of the service. <em>Premachandra v. Mitts, </em>509 F.Supp. 424, 428 (E.D.Mo.1981); <em>King v. Hampton, </em>412 F.Supp. 827, 829 (E.D.Va.1976), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>562 F.2d 46 (4th Cir. 1977); <em>Schaefer v. United States, </em>633 F.2d 945, 948 (Ct.Cl.1980). There is no time limit on the acts which may be considered in actions taken to promote the efficiency of the service. Therefore, neither Weaver\u2019s superiors, nor the MSPB erred in considering evidence of incidents occurring more than one year prior to the Notice of Proposed Removal. Similarly, the MSPB did not err in refusing to call witnesses to testify as to whether such evidence was relied upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">The Notice of Proposed Removal adequately stated the reason for Weaver\u2019s removal, as required by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513(b)(1). The reason was an altercation with Weaver\u2019s supervisor. The reasons that the supervisor\u2019s version of the altercation was believed rather than Weaver\u2019s version did not have to be specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Weaver did not argue before the MSPB that he was denied adequate representation, as he might have pursuant to 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.115 (1981). We therefore do not consider this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
