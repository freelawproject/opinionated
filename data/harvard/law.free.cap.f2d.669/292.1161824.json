In granting the motion to suppress, the district court first held that the defendants possessed standing to assert a fourth amendment violation in the search of the vessel and the seizure of the marijuana; it then found that the search and seizure was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>unconstitutional. <em>United States v. Acosta, </em>489 F.Supp. 61 (S.D.Fla.1980). On June 3, 1981, while retaining jurisdiction of this appeal, we remanded this case to the district court for reconsideration of the motion to suppress in light of <em>United States v. Salvucci, </em>448 U.S. 83, 100 S.Ct. 2547, 65 L.Ed.2d 619 (1980). We advised the district court that \u201cthe evidentiary hearing on the suppression motion [could] be reopened for submission of further evidence . . . and a redetermination of the motion.\u201d The district court did hold an evidentiary hearing at which both defendants testified and were cross-examined.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court subsequently issued its Order on Remand holding that the defendants lacked standing to assert a fourth amendment claim and, alternatively, that the search of the fishing vessel was reasonable; it therefore denied defendants\u2019 motion to suppress. The district court then certified its order to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Since, on remand, the district court has now <em>denied </em>defendants\u2019 suppression motion, we no longer have a role to play. A denial of a pre-trial motion to suppress is a non-final interlocutory order which is not appealable. <em>DiBella v. United States, </em>369 U.S. 121, 82 S.Ct. 654, 7 L.Ed.2d 614 (1962); <em>Simons v. United States, </em>592 F.2d 251 (5th Cir. 1979); <em>see United States v. Mock, </em>604 F.2d 336, 338 (5th Cir. 1979). We therefore must remand this case for trial. If defendants are convicted, they may appeal their convictions and at that time claim error in the district court\u2019s denial of their suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">While conceding that this case should be remanded for trial, defendants nevertheless assert that the district court went beyond the scope of our remand order by redetermining not only the standing issue, but also the reasonableness of the search. They also contend that since the government did not appeal the district court\u2019s original holding that the search violated the fourth amendment, it is forever barred from claiming that the search was valid. We reject these arguments as merit-less. Our remand order did not limit the district court\u2019s power to reconsider all issues relating to the motion to suppress; in fact, our order authorized a \u201credetermination of the motion.\u201d Moreover, the district court has broad power to reconsider the correctness of its interlocutory rulings. <em>See Lord v. Kelley, </em>334 F.2d 742, 746 (1st Cir. 1964), <em>cert. denied, </em>379 U.S. 961, 85 S.Ct. 650, 13 L.Ed.2d 556 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">We reiterate that we express no view as to the merits of the district court\u2019s order denying the motion to suppress. We remand this case to the district court for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b349-7\">. Neither party provided us with a transcript of the evidentiary hearing following remand; thus we must take the parties\u2019 word for what transpired there.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
