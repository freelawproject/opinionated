The answer further alleged that the corporation was forced out of business by the seizure of its assets for nonpayment of income taxes by the Internal Revenue Service during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>September and October 1974. Defendant further alleged that the plaintiffs-appellees were hired by Furniture and Appliances, Inc. d/b/a Leader Manufacturing Co., an Ohio corporation in April, 1974 and the last day of their employment was April 23,1974. Defendant denied the allegations of the complaint with respect to the alleged discriminatory discharges and prayed for judgment including an allowance for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-4\">The docket entries disclose the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFE\">3/4/80 ORDER OF REFERENCE: Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) and 1.2(21) of General Order of this Court, Robert A. Steinberg, U.S. Magistrate, is hereby appointed as Special Master in this action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1176-5\">6/18/80 TRIAL TO COURT: Recommended decision: that judgment be entered in favor of Plaintiffs and that damages be assessed at four months of lost wages at minimum wage. Recommended decision will be filed in approximately two weeks in the form of a transcript of the Court\u2019s remarks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1176-6\">NOTICE and REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF U.S. MAGISTRATE and COURT\u2019S DECISION; Recommended that: Judgment be rendered against defdt and that damages in the amount of One Thousand Six Hundred Sixty-Four Dollars ($1,664.00) representing four months wages at $2.00 per hour, be awarded to Plaintiffs, Bernice Hayes and Rose DeBoe, respectively.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1176-7\">8/21/80 HEARING ON MAGISTRATE\u2019S REPORT held before Judge Rubin in open court. ORDER: R &amp; R (14) is hereby adopted in full. Judgment is rendered against Defendant and damages in the amount of One Thousand Six Hundred Sixty-four Dollars ($1,664.00) representing four months wages at $2.60 per hour is hereby awarded to Plaintiffs Bernice Hayes and Rose DeBoe, respectively.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1176-8\">It will be noted that glaring inconsistencies and errors appear in the docket entries, namely, the alleged \u201cTrial To Court\u201d which was not the court, but the Special Master in which he recommended judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and that damages be assessed at four months of loss wages at minimum wage, the rate which was $2.00 an hour or for $1,280.00 to each plaintiff. In the Notice and Report and Recommendation of U.S. Magistrate and Court\u2019s Decision of 7-3-80, it was \u201cRecommended that: Judgment be rendered against defdt. and that damages in the amount of One Thousand Six Hundred Sixty-Four Dollars ($1,664.00) representing four months wages at $2.00 per hour be awarded to Plaintiffs, Bernice Haynes and Rose DeBoe, respectively.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-9\">As previously pointed out, this was incorrect since applying the minimum wage of $2.00 an hour, which was the rate applied by the employer to all of his starting employees, the judgment should have been for $1,280.00 for each employee, instead of for $1,664.00. Also, the Special Master\u2019s Report made on 7-3-80 should not have been labeled \u201cCourt\u2019s Decision\u201d since the court had made no decision until 8-21-80, which was made on the same day that the parties argued the case before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-10\">Defendant has appealed to this court contending that (1) the award of damages was purely speculative and unauthorized (2) that plaintiffs were employed by the corporation and not by him individually and (3) that the master erred in placing the burden of proof on defendant; that <em>prima facie </em>evidence of racial discrimination did not exist; that there was not a scintilla of evidence that the discharge of plaintiffs-appellees was racially motivated or that the defendant intended to discriminate against plaintiffs on account of race.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-11\">As well stated by the Supreme Court in <em>Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 253, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 1093, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1176-12\">The ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant <em>intentionally </em>discriminated against the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1127\">*1127</page-number>remains at all times with the plaintiff. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1177-6\">We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-8\">The Damage Award</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-9\">In addition to the glaring defects and errors appearing in the docket entries above specified, the Special Master\u2019s Report, which is labeled \u201cCourt\u2019s Decision\u201d and is dated June 18,1980, and did not become the Court\u2019s Decision until August 21, 1980, contains the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-10\">Insofar as damages are concerned, I will say at the outset that I do not credit the testimony of either of the plaintiffs that they were unable to find employment in the time period mentioned. I just don\u2019t find any credibility in that testimony and I feel that the amount of damages requested is far in excess of what plaintiffs are entitled to after having worked three weeks at the minimum wage for Mr. Miller.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-11\">It\u2019s certainly somewhat speculative as to what damages should be because no one knows how long they would have continued there, but the facts do indicate that the business was closed down as a result of the tax sale in September of 1974. And I find that the reasonable amount of damages in this case would be the wages due for a period of four months employment after the time of termination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1177-12\">Since the Special Master found that the damages claimed involved speculation, it was error for him to make any speculative award. One of the plaintiffs testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-13\">Q What were you making at the furniture \u2014 what was your hourly rate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2A\">A Like I said, somewhere around two sixty, I think.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-14\">Q Do you know if that was minimum or what was said to you about the hourly rate when you hired? Do you recall?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-15\">A I don\u2019t remember that anyone told me unless it was probably Rose and Caroline told me how much I\u2019d be making, but I don\u2019t recall Mr. Miller or his secretary telling me exactly how much I\u2019d be making.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1177-16\">The record showed clearly that the employer started out all of his employees, white and black, at the minimum wage which was $2.00 an hour. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206. The plaintiffs including Walker had only worked a couple of weeks. It was error for the Special Master to award the black employees, who were beginning employees, a larger amount than was being paid to beginning white employees as this constituted reverse discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-17\">Furthermore, there was no logical basis for making the award extend for a period of four months to employees who had worked no more than two or three weeks. The Special Master took this period out of thin air, as there was no evidence to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-18\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-19\">The Alleged Discharges</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-20\">The alleged discharges grew out of an altercation which took place between the defendant and Caroline Walker. The two plaintiffs were sisters and sisters-in-law of Mrs. Walker. They all lived in Springfield, Ohio, and rode together to work at Enon from Springfield. The defendant testified as to the altercation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-21\">Q Do you recall the discussion about the five cents that\u2019s been testified to previously?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-22\">A I don\u2019t recall the discussion but I\u2019m sure that is something that I would have done. As I said, the machine itself is tougher to run and it\u2019s harder work and I\u2019m sure that I had made the statement that if she\u2019d learn to run the machine and was doing a good job, could turn out so many pieces, I would give her a raise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-23\">Q Did you subsequently have a discussion with her about that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-24\">A Well, if you\u2019re returning to the argument now\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-25\">Q Yes, or whatever it was, please describe what happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1128\">*1128</page-number>A Okay. I think she had been on the job two or three days and I might state there\u2019s no way\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-4\">Q This is on the machine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-5\">A Sewing machine, yes. There is no possible way anybody\u2019s going to learn how to run this machine real well in two or three days. But aside from that, she was back running the machine. I came through the factory and she yelled across the room I can do 18 or whatever number of pieces are now, when do I get my raise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-6\">So that\u2019s the kind of thing that I don\u2019t approve of, and I more than likely said I don\u2019t want to discuss it now which has been testified to. And anyway that led into more of an argument, and I probably \u2014 I don\u2019t recall exactly, but I\u2019m sure I said either shut up or go get your paycheck.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-7\">Q This was out on the floor now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-8\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-9\">Q Okay. Then what happened or what was said then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-10\">A She didn\u2019t shut up and I don\u2019t recall whether she had conversation there as to whether she was going to take her sisters and relatives with her or whether we had that up towards the office, but it was \u2014 she stated to me that everybody\u2019s quitting, you know. Figure the rest goes and when she had left, she did take the one person with her. And I assume now \u2014 I\u2019m assuming. I don\u2019t recall what I told the girl in the office which I\u2019m not real sure which one. It had to be one of two girls which I can clear up. But she seemed \u2014 she was a leader. She run the show. So I just assumed that when she said her sisters or sister-in-laws are going to leave or quit, that they had quit, and I more than likely told the girl to pull the cards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1178-11\">From this it appears that Walker was quitting and taking her relatives, the plaintiffs, with her. At least that is what the defendant believed. There is nothing about the occurrence to show any racial discrimination on the part of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-12\">The Special Master stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-13\">Mr. Miller has advanced as his reason for discharging the two individuals only one fact, and that is the alleged statement of Miss or Mrs. Walker that if she left, she would take plaintiffs with her and, therefore, Mr. Miller assumed they were not returning to work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-14\">The evidence shows and I\u2019m satisfied that there does not appear to be a general pattern of discrimination against blacks in the Miller Furniture business. It appears to me that Mr. Miller at all times relevant to the testimony in this case is willing to hire individuals of any race so long as they will work for the minimum wage. And the fact is that he did hire two plaintiffs and their sister-in-law, who he knew were black, and, as Mr. Heron pointed out, he did promote, if that\u2019s the correct word, Miss Walker to a position held by a white employee which offered the possibility of better wages. And both he and Miss Haynes have testified that he offered her Miss Walker\u2019s job. So I do not find a general pattern of discrimination against blacks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1178-15\">The Special Master continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-16\">Now, I must follow the law in this circuit, which provides that if a defendant fails to articulate a legitimate reason for his actions after plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, then plaintiff has fulfilled his or her burden.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-17\">In this case, I find that Mr. Miller\u2019s testimony is inconsistent with the other facts in the case and with other portions of his own testimony. I find in particular that I\u2019m not able to credit his testimony that he believed Miss Haynes had left employment when he acknowledges the conversation he had with her telling her she could appear the following day and take Miss Walker\u2019s job. I find the two statements entirely inconsistent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-18\">To support that inconsistency or lack of credibility in the defendant\u2019s case, there are three matters that I\u2019m relying on. One, the utilization of the defense in this case that the defendant was a corporation and, therefore, should avoid liability to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1129\">*1129</page-number>me reflects a lack of credibility in the case; secondly, employment records which are missing and were last in the sole control of Mr. Miller; and, thirdly, the ability to call a witness who has relevant testimony to the case and the failure to call that witness, and that is the secretary, Connie, I can\u2019t recall her last name, who was the one that was present the morning plaintiffs returned to work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AoN\">Now, none of those three facts are dispos-itive of the case, but, taken together with the inconsistent testimony, I find that defendant has failed to articulate a legitimate reason. I don\u2019t mind saying, that had Mr. Miller taken the stand and stated that he pulled the cards because he was furious at Miss Walker and wanted to get even or some other reason, the Court might not have difficulty in not finding discrimination in this case. But because of the defense presented and following the law in this circuit, the Court is required to draw the inference that the actions were discriminatory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1179-5\">This is an erroneous statement as to the law and conflicts with the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine, supra, </em>and also the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-6\">Plaintiff did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence or by any evidence a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. There was not an iota of evidence of discrimination. Plaintiffs had worked only a few weeks. They were employed at will and could be discharged at any time with or without cause. Even if a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination had been shown, it was rebutted by the evidence as to the altercation of the defendant with Walker and his belief that Walker was taking the two plaintiffs with her. Also, it is important that there was absolutely no evidence offered as to any intent on the part of the defendant to discriminate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-7\">The Special Master relied on three matters to attack the credibility of defendant. He stated: \u201cOne, the utilization of the defense in this case that the defendant was a corporation and, therefore, should avoid liability to me reflects a lack of credibility in the case.\u201d This is a non sequitur. If the plaintiffs' were employed by the corporation, there is no basis for them to sue the defendant who was the majority stockholder. If the plaintiffs had been injured in the course of their employment, they could have recovered the benefits of Workmen\u2019s Compensation carried by the corporation, which was duly organized and existing and carried the plaintiffs on its payroll. There was no proof that the corporation was organized for any fraudulent purposes. The corporate employees were also carried on the federal and city income tax records. The plaintiffs along with Walker filed charges of discrimination against the corporation with the Ohio Civil Rights Commission, which resulted in the Commission issuing a Complaint against the corporation which was later dismissed. App. 87. Second, employment records are missing. This arose because Internal Revenue Service levied upon and closed the defendant\u2019s place of business and sold most of its assets. Third, defendant did not call a witness, Connie, who was secretary, prior to the shut down of the corporate business by the Internal Revenue Service. She was not so employed at the time of the trial. If plaintiffs really believed that Connie had relevant testimony and was available, they could have called her. In any event, the failure to call a witness does not prove discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-9\">The Special Master then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1179-10\">I find that defendant has failed to articulate a legitimate reason. I don\u2019t mind saying that had Mr. Miller taken the stand and stated that he pulled the cards because he was furious at Miss Walker and wanted to get even or some other reason, the Court might not have difficulty in not finding discrimination in this case. But because of the defense presented and following the law in this circuit, the Court is required to draw the inference that the actions were discriminatory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1180-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1130\">*1130</page-number>In other words, the Special Master admits that he had difficulty in finding discrimination, which is obvious from reading his report that he confesses that \u201cbecause of the defense presented and following the law of this circuit, the court is required to draw the inference that the actions were discriminatory.\u201d In other words, we have a novel theory of discrimination by inference without support of any facts upon which an inference could be drawn. From this, it is clear that plaintiffs did not meet their burden of proof. Furthermore, the Special Master is not the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-4\">In our opinion, the findings of fact adopted by the Special Master are not supported by substantial evidence and are clearly erroneous. His conclusions of law are inaccurate. The district court erred in adopting the factual findings of the Special Master and his conclusions of law set forth in his report styled \u201cCourt\u2019s Decision\u201d. Other issues raised by appellant do not need discussion in view of our holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-5\">The judgment of the district court is reversed and the cause is remanded with instructions to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b1180-6\">CORNELIA G. KENNEDY, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"aha-dedup-0\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-7\">I concur in the majority\u2019s conclusion that an award of $2.60 per hour is not supported by the evidence. The evidence clearly demonstrates that the defendant paid all his starting employees the minimum wage which, at all relevant times herein, was $2.00 per hour. However, I am unable to agree that there was \u201cno logical basis for making the award extend for a period of four months . . . .\u201d maj. op. at 1127. The four-month period chosen by the Magistrate began when the plaintiffs were summarily discharged and ended when the enterprise was closed by the actions of the Internal Revenue Service. Thus, this period was not taken \u201cout of thin air\u201d as the majority opinion asserts, but rather reflected the Magistrate\u2019s judgment that this period comprised the plaintiffs\u2019 likely employment span had they not been wrongfully discharged. Such a finding was not, in my opinion, clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-9\">I am also unable to agree with the majority\u2019s implicit holding that the successorship doctrine is inapplicable to the facts of this case. <em>See EEOC v. MacMillan Bloedel Containers, Inc., </em>503 F.2d 1086 (6th Cir. 1974). Utilizing the test developed there, <em>id. </em>at 1094, I conclude that the corporation formed after the tax sale was a successor corporation to the one forced out of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-10\">Finally, I am unable to agree that plaintiffs failed to establish a prima facie case of race discrimination. The <em>Burdine </em>case, <em>Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981), of which the Magistrate did not have notice, does not mandate a different conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1180-11\">The burden of establishing a prima fa-cie case of disparate treatment is not onerous. . . . [It] \u2018raises an inference of discrimination only because we presume these acts, if otherwise unexplained, are more likely than not based on the consideration of impermissible factors.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1180-12\"><em>Burdine, supra, </em>at 253-54, 101 S.Ct. at 1093-94, <em>quoting Furnco Construction Corp. v. Waters, </em>438 U.S. 567, 577, 98 S.Ct. 2943, 2949, 57 L.Ed.2d 957 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-13\">In the instant case, plaintiffs demonstrated that although their work had been satisfactory, without explanation they were summarily discharged when other similarly situated white employees were not. In fact, plaintiffs were the only two full-time black employees working for the defendant at the time of their discharge. This is sufficient, in my opinion, to raise an \u201cinference of discrimination.\u201d And, contrary to the majority opinion, it is not \u201cnovel\u201d to prove discrimination by inference. Indeed, since proving an intent to discriminate is often difficult, proof by inference is often the only method available to a plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-14\">However, the Magistrate did err in requiring the defendant to bear the burden of proving that his proffered non-discriminatory reason for the firing was in fact the actual reason. As <em>Burdine </em>now makes clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1181-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1131\">*1131</page-number>The defendant need not persuade the court that it was actually motivated by the proffered reasons, [citations omitted], It is sufficient if the defendant\u2019s evidence raises a genuine issue of fact as to whether it discriminated against the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1181-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 254-55, 101 S.Ct. at 1094-95. The defendant need only set forth a legally sufficient explanation. The explanation, however, must be actually admitted into evidence, not argued by counsel or surmised by the court. <em>Id. </em>at 255 n.9, 101 S.Ct. at 1094 n.9. Here, the explanation which was actually offered by the defendant \u2014 that he thought plaintiffs had quit \u2014 was rejected by the Magistrate although it was legally sufficient to rebut the prima facie case. This was improper. Once an explanation is offered, plaintiff must demonstrate that it \u201cwas not the true reason for the employment decision. .. . [Plaintiff] may succeed in this either directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Burdine, supra, </em>at 256, 101 S.Ct. at 1095.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-5\">For these reasons, I would remand the case to the District Court for further proceedings in light of <em>Burdine.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
