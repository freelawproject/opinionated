Specifically, plaintiff charged that he was frozen out of the market for new Ford vehicles after Ford formulated a policy prohibiting their dealers from selling to \u201cbootleggers\u201d like himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Plaintiff was engaged in the inter-dealership transfer of new Ford vehicles, commonly known as bootlegging, in the years 1976 through 1978. He conducted this venture under a variety of names: Executive Motors Unlimited, Payless Car Rental Systems, Southwest Car Rentals, Executive Leasing, Wayne Motor Sales, BJP Enterprises, and W. Bar J, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">It is undisputed that, during these years, strong consumer demand existed for certain Ford models, such as pickups and Thunder-birds. In Texas, the state in which Parsons conducted the majority of his business, the demand for pickup trucks and vans was especially high. Many persons purchased them as recreational vehicles. Demand outstripped supply of these vehicles in many areas. Plaintiff alleviated this situation in the short run by inserting himself into the Ford allocation system. He purchased vehicles from one dealer and then resold them to another who was experiencing very high demand for the particular vehicle. Parsons contends that he simply increased interdealer competition by enabling dealers to obtain vehicles that they otherwise would have been unable to purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-17\">Ford characterizes plaintiff\u2019s activities differently and charges him with obtaining vehicles from Ford dealers by fraudulently portraying himself as a legitimate fleet purchaser of vehicles.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He was only able to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>engage in this business because of the lower prices charged to fleet customers and the fact that dealers did not have to take fleet purchases off their show room floors. Ford maintains that once it ascertained the fraudulent nature of plaintiff\u2019s business, it took reasonable steps to ensure that vehicles ordered from district fleet allocations were actually purchased by legitimate fleet end-users.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The Ford allocation system at issue in this case is comprised of two components. In a given geographical area or \u201cdistrict,\u201d a dealer may obtain vehicles through both the \u201cbasic allocation\u201d system and the \u201cfleet allocation\u201d system. A dealer\u2019s basic allocation is computed from the number of vehicle sales and the inventory of unsold vehicles. More sales and fewer models on the dealer\u2019s lot will result in an increased allocation; conversely, fewer sales and more unsold models decrease the allocation. The computations which provide the basis for this allocation are made on a monthly basis and separately for each Ford model.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The fleet allocation is calculated on a district, rather than dealer, basis. Generally, a fleet customer is one with ten or more vehicles, commonly for rental or corporate use. The separate fleet allocation system was established because, while it is relatively easy to determine the number of large fleet customers in a district, it is very difficult to predict from which dealer a large fleet purchaser will seek to fill his requirements. Without the availability of a separate fleet allocation, a dealer might be unable to fill a major order by a large fleet user or could be left temporarily without vehicles to sell to other customers. Fleet customers are obviously very important to Ford sales; it is, therefore, critical that an adequate stock of vehicles be maintained for this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-20\">Ford\u2019s allocation system does not always work perfectly; obviously, it is difficult to prognosticate trends in vehicle sales. Plaintiff asserts that the failure of the allocation system led him into this \u201cbootlegging\u201d business. A Ford dealer offered to purchase vehicles bought from other dealers. Parsons also credits dealer suggestions with leading him to do business under many different names. Allegedly, this venture was very successful until Ford conspired with its dealers to force him out of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-21\">Ford paints a very different picture of plaintiff\u2019s operation. The company categorically denies any policy to prohibit sales to Parsons. Plaintiff was only required to demonstrate that he was a legitimate fleet buyer in order to take advantage of the fleet allocation system and price. Any fraudulent fleet purchase could have been filled from a dealer\u2019s basic allocation. This policy did adversely affect plaintiff, since he was not a legitimate fleet purchaser.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>However, Ford contends that it was well within its rights to implement such a policy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">After plaintiff filed his original complaint, defendants moved for dismissal of all claims. The trial court granted this motion as to the section two Sherman Act claim. That claim, which was directed solely against Ford Motor Company, charged defendant with attempting to monopolize the sale of new Fords. The court pointed out that every manufacturer has a natural monopoly in the sale of his own products; such natural monopolies do not contravene anti-trust laws. <em>United States v. E. I. de Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>351 U.S. 377, 393, 76 S.Ct. 994, 1006, 100 L.Ed. 1264 (1956); <em>Spectrofuge Corp. v. Beckman Instruments, Inc., </em>575 F.2d 256 (5th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 939, 99 S.Ct. 1289, 59 L.Ed.2d 499 (1979). Upon completion of discovery, defendants moved for summary judgment on the remaining claims. At that time, the court granted summary judgment on the Sherman Act claim and dismissed plaintiff\u2019s state law claims without prejudice. The plaintiff brings this appeal to challenge the court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. After examining the record, we conclude that this was a proper case for summary disposition and, therefore, we affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">Before beginning a discussion of this case, we pause to acknowledge that summary judgment is extreme relief which should be approached very cautiously. The Supreme Court has long recognized that this procedure should be considered especially carefully in anti-trust actions. <em>Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., </em>368 U.S. 464, 82 S.Ct. 486, 7 L.Ed.2d 458 (1962). This is certainly not to say, however, that the procedure is inapplicable to anti-trust cases. <em>See Solomon v. Houston Corrugated Box Co., </em>526 F.2d 389 (5th Cir. 1976); <em>Blackburn v. Crum &amp; Forster, </em>611 F.2d 102 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>447 U.S. 906, 100 S.Ct. 2989, 64 L.Ed.2d 856 (1980). The appropriateness of summary judgment depends on the facts of the case considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure mandates that prior to a grant of summary judgment a trial court must determine that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The evidence must be viewed in a light most favorable to the opposing party. Our review of the district court\u2019s judgment proceeds upon the same standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-12\">Parsons charged Ford Motor Company and certain named dealers with conspiring to force him out of the business in which he was theretofore engaged. This allegation was answered by defendants in the form of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>sworn denials. This Court recognizes that once defendants have made such sworn denials, summary judgment is appropriate unless plaintiff can produce significant probative evidence demonstrating the existence of a genuine fact issue. <em>Solomon v. Houston Corrugated Box Co., supra, </em>at 396. The trial judge found that plaintiff had failed in this task, despite the extensive discovery permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Indeed, the plaintiff offered very meager evidence of conspiracy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, when this evidence is closely examined, we find that the allegations merely reiterate that which Ford has admitted. Neither Ford nor many of its dealers like bootlegging, and they therefore took proper steps to ensure against future manipulation of the fleet allocation system. Enforcement of the company\u2019s fleet allocation system policy is not equivalent to conspiracy.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Given the dearth of conspiracy evidence, the plaintiff was properly prohibited from proceeding to trial on the hope of developing evidence to support allegations made in the complaint. <em>First National Bank v. Cities Service Co., </em>391 U.S. 253, 88 S.Ct. 1575, 20 L.Ed.2d 569 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">Plaintiff\u2019s failure to present significant probative evidence of conspiracy in response to defendants\u2019 sworn denials of all allegations rendered this case proper for summary disposition.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>granted a summary judgment for the defendants; we leave that decision undisturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b365-10\">.

In an effort to demonstrate the reasonableness of its action, Ford sets out a detailed rationale for its admitted dislike of bootleggers like Parsons, who harm Ford, its dealers and customers. When a new vehicle is sold, the dealer submits a Retail Delivery Card (RDC) to Ford. The warranty period for the vehicle begins when this RDC is received by Ford. This takes place even though, in the case of bootlegged vehicles, the ultimate purchase by a consumer may not occur for several months. When the consumer does purchase the vehicle, he will be left with a nine or ten month warranty, instead of the twelve month warranty expected. The problems with these \u201cstale\u201d or \u201cdirty\u201d warranties did present great problems for consumers as well as the manufacturer and dealers. The magnitude of this problem led the Office of the Attorney General of Texas to conduct an investigation. Subsequently, a staff opinion was issued which indicated that the undisclosed sale of cars with stale warranties constituted a deceptive trade practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-14\">Record, vol. 2, at 377-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-15\">The RDC permits Ford to contact the owner of a vehicle in the event a recall is necessary. When a bootlegger purchases a vehicle and then resells to another dealer, this is impossible. Additionally, when a dealer receives a car directly from Ford, the corporation is responsible for pre-delivery damage. Bootlegged vehicles can incur wear and tear without the ultimate dealer\u2019s knowledge. Many times, they are driven with disconnected odometers.</p>\n<p id=\"AWD\">Finally, bootlegging disrupts the allocation system by creating an apparent demand in the location where the purchase is made when in fact the demand is in the location where the bootlegger resells the vehicle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b369-6\">. The basis of his conspiracy charge against Charlie Hillard Ford was his testimony that the fleet sales manager, Charles Faulkner, told him that \u201che couldn\u2019t sell me any more cars because Ford Motor Company was jumping up and down, but they was [sic] going to put a stop to their cars being redistributed.\u201d Deposition of Thomas Wayne Parsons, vol. 1, at 231-32. However, Faulkner testified that he never told Parsons that no more sales could be made. He simply told him that he would be required to meet the qualifications required of all legitimate fleet purchasers.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">Plaintiffs evidence of a conspiracy between Ford and A. C. Collins Ford is similarly unsubstantial. In response to charges of conspiracy, both A. C. Collins and his fleet manager, Leonard Hodges, testified that they became aware of Ford\u2019s concern about bootlegging and simply instituted a policy to ensure the legitimacy of fleet purchases. A. C. Collins required plaintiff to register each purchased vehicle unless he certified that the vehicle was going to an out-of-state fleet.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b369-8\">. Plaintiff did not wage an effective direct attack on Ford\u2019s fleet allocation system. He did attack the manner in which the system was directed by Ford. He contended that Ford, without standardized criteria, determined his purchases were not legitimate and subsequently harassed their dealers into refusing to deal with him. However, such a policy was repeatedly denied by all others involved. The fleet allocation system was clearly designed to facilitate sales to legitimate fleet end-users. Plaintiff admittedly did not fit in that category. In order to prevail in an attack on the allocation system, plaintiff would be required to demonstrate that the system was unreasonable in view of \u201cthe facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and after the restraint was imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable.\u201d <em>Chicago Board of Trade v. United States, </em>246 U.S. 231, 238, 38 S.Ct. 242, 244, 62 L.Ed. 683 (1918). <em>See National Auto Brokers v. General Motors Corp., </em>572 F.2d 953, 960 (2d Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 1072, 99 S.Ct. 844, 59 L.Ed.2d 38 (1979). Parsons merely characterized the system as an impermissible \u201ccustomer restriction.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b369-13\">. In the face of failure to produce evidence of a conspiracy to prohibit vehicle sales to him, plaintiff attempts to characterize Ford\u2019s actions as price-fixing. Ford did admit that its dislike of bottlegging was based, in part, on the fact that the practice decreases the competitiveness of its vehicles because of the added cost of the bootlegger\u2019s profit. This admission falls far short of price-fixing. In <em>United States v. Soco-ny-Vacuum Oil Co., </em>310 U.S. 150, 60 S.Ct. 811, 84 L.Ed. 1129 (1940), the Supreme Court defined price-fixing as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-14\">Under the Sherman Act a combination formed for the purpose and with the effect of raising, depressing, fixing, pegging or stabilizing the price of a commodity in interstate or foreign commerce is illegal per se ... Price-fixing agreements may have utility to members of the group though the power possessed or exerted falls far short of combination and control. Monopoly power <em>(United States v. Patten, </em>226 U.S. 525, 33 S.Ct. 141, 57 L.Ed. 333, 44 LRA(NS) 325) is not the only power which the Act strikes down, as we have said. Proof that a combination was formed for .the purpose of fixing prices and that it caused them to be fixed or contributed to that result is proof of the completion of a price-fixing conspiracy under Section 1 of the Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 223-24, 60 S.Ct. at 844.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-16\">The record is barren of any evidence that Ford even attempted to control the price of its vehicles. This contention is completely meritless.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
