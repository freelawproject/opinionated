This section of the statute requires the Commission whenever it issues an order under \u00a7 147(a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to submit a report to Congress:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9G\">(d) Upon prescribing or issuing any regulation or order under subsection (a) of this section, the Commission shall submit to Congress a report that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-5\">(1) specifically identifies the type of information the Commission intends to protect from disclosure under the regulation or order;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-6\">(2) specifically states the Commission\u2019s justification for determining that unauthorized disclosure of the information to be protected from disclosure under the regulation or order could reasonably be expected to have a significant adverse effect on the health and safety of the public or the common defense and security by significantly increasing the likelihood of theft, diversion, or sabotage of such material or such facility, as specified under subsection (a) of this section; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-13\">(3) provides justification, including proposed alternative regulations or orders, that the regulation or order applies only the minimum restrictions needed to protect the health and safety of the public or the common defense and security.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-14\">Pub.L.No. 96-295, 94 Stat. 788 (June 30, 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-15\">The Commission concedes that such a report was not filed with respect to the \u201corders\u201d denying plaintiffs\u2019 FOIA requests that are the subject of this action. However, those orders were issued between March and June, 1980, before the above statute requiring reports to Congress was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>enacted on June 30, 1980.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is therefore not necessary for this court to determine whether the particular orders here refusing to disclose certain safeguards information were required to be the subject of a formal report to Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">We assume that the Commission, in future cases, will consider the provisions of the statute and make a report to Congress on such regulations and orders as it determines are subject to the Act. Under the circumstances of this case \u2014 the first instance in which information has been withheld under section 147 \u2014 we do not believe that the Commission\u2019s failure to file a report compels disclosure of the documents otherwise properly withheld here. We express no opinion on appellants\u2019 standing to raise objections under section 147(d), nor upon the proper remedy for noncompliance therewith, in future cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b845-7\">.
