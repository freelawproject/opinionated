Bryant, and Big Wally\u2019s, Inc. and its employee Richard A. Westbrook, as intervening plaintiffs, brought this suit in the district court for the Western District of Virginia challenging the constitutionality of \u00a7 46.1\u2014198.1 of the Virginia Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which prohibits the use and sale of radar detectors within the Commonwealth. They claim that the statute creates an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce by denying them the right to sell and use radar detection devices and that more reliable and less burdensome methods of speed control are available that would not rely on the use of radar. They further claim that the statute contravenes the Supremacy Clause, U.S.Const.Art. VI, cl. 2, by regulating the reception of radio communication, an area they claim was preempted by the scheme of communication regulation enacted by Congress and administered by the Federal Communications Commission. Finally, they claim that the Virginia statute is void for vagueness in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U. S. Constitution. They sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>mitted no affidavits to the district court in support of their various positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">The defendant moved for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or, alternately, summary judgment under Rule 56.
