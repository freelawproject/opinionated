Two principal issues are raised: (1) did the district court err in holding that the EPA Administrator and the EPA\u2019s agents were not \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d in approving the City sewer charge system? and (2) did the district court err in holding that the City charge system did not violate equal protection or due process guarantees under the federal and California constitutions? We find no error and therefore affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AbX\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-7\">The City and County of San Francisco (\u201cthe City\u201d) operates a combined sewer system, meaning that both sanitary sewage and surface runoff flow into the same water collection and treatment network. The treatment system\u2019s capacity is sometimes overwhelmed when it rains, resulting in discharges of raw sewage and surface runoff into the bay and ocean between 80 and 100 times per year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-8\">Under an order from the California State Water Resources Control Board (\u201cthe State Board\u201d) to abate the discharges, the City is constructing a $1.5 billion water treatment project to reduce the number of direct discharges into the bay and ocean. Seventy-five percent of the project\u2019s construction cost is financed through a federal matching grant approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d); the balance of the cost is funded by State grants and City sewer revenue bonds. The City pays for bond debt service and o])eration and maintenance expenses from revenue generated by sewer service charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-11\">As a condition of the federal construction grant, the City obtained the EPA\u2019s and the State Board\u2019s approval of its sewer charge scheme. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1284(b)(1) (1977 Supp. I). The City\u2019s sewer service charge is levied according to the amount of incoming tap water delivered to each user. The charge is calculated on the assumption that ninety percent of all incoming tap water is returned to the sewer system; the fee is adjusted according to the strength of the discharge normally associated with different categories of users. The charge system does not allocate operation and maintenance expenses between wet weather flow and dry weather flow, nor does it make a separate assessment of costs based on surface run-off.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-12\">In December, 1978, the Hotel Employers Association of San Francisco (\u201cHEA\u201d), an association of 41 member hotels, brought this action in federal district court challenging the EPA\u2019s approval (through its delegated agent, the State Board) of the City\u2019s system of sewer service charges. HEA argued first that the sewer charge system failed to allocate treatment costs of surface runoff according to the acreage occupied by each user and therefore violated the proportionality requirement of section 204(b) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (\u201cFWPCA\u201d), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1284(b). HEA also challenged the adoption and approval of the charge system on federal and state due process and equal protection grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-13\">On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court granted summary judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1307\">*1307</page-number>ment for EPA and the other defendants. The court ruled that the approval by EPA and its designated agent, the State Board, was not \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d and that a \u201crational basis\u201d existed for their conclusion that City sewer charge system satisfied the proportionality requirements of section 204(b). The trial court also rejected HEA\u2019s constitutional claims, reasoning that if the EPA approval of the sewer charge system was not \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d, the system also passed muster under the less exacting \u201crational relationship\u201d standard associated with the constitutional claims. HEA appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-6\">1. <em>Review of EPA Approval</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1357-7\">Under section 204(b)(1)(A) of the FWPCA, the EPA may approve a federal construction grant only upon a showing that \u201cthe applicant .. . has adopted or will adopt a system of charges to assure that each recipient of waste treatment services . . . will pay its <em>proportionate share </em>of the costs of operation and maintenance (including replacement) of any waste treatment services provided by the applicant.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1284(b)(1)(A) (1977 Supp. I) (emphasis added). Section 204(b)(2)(B) requires the EPA to issue guidelines for such user charges, including \u201ccriteria against which to determine the adequacy of charges imposed on classes and categories of users <em>reflecting all factors that influence the cost of water treatment </em>including strength, volume, and delivery flow rate characteristics of waste . . . . \u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1284(b)(2)(B) (1977 Supp. I) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1357-9\">HEA interprets these two subsections to require grant applicants to apportion operation and maintenance costs in proportion to the burden each user places on the treatment system. While HEA concedes that the City charge system meets this requirement with respect to sanitary sewage, it contends that the charge system fails to apportion the cost of treating surface runoff on a proportionate basis. HEA estimates, and for summary judgment purposes the district court agreed, that surface runoff treatment costs account for thirty-five percent of the total operating and maintenance costs of the City\u2019s treatment system. The charge system allocates surface run-off treatment costs on a pro-rata user basis; each user\u2019s percentage share of total <em>runoff </em>treatment cost is the same as the percentage share each user contributes to the total cost of treating <em>only sanitary sewage. </em>According to HEA, however, this is erroneous; the amount of surface run-off attributable to a user\u2019s property depends upon the property\u2019s land area and not upon .how much sewage the user loads into the treatment system. To meet the proportionality requirement of section 204(b), HEA contends that the charge system must apportion the costs of treating surface run-off according to the acreage occupied by each user.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-12\">As section 204(b) approval does not require a hearing or formal findings on a record, EPA\u2019s decision to approve the City\u2019s charge system is reviewed under the \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d standard of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (1976). <em>See Camp v. Pitts, </em>411 U.S. 138, 142, 93 S.Ct. 1241, 1244, 36 L.Ed.2d 106 (1973) (per curiam). Under this narrow standard, a reviewing court must determine whether the agency decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment. <em>Bowman Transportation, Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., </em>419 U.S. 281, 285, 95 S.Ct. 438, 441, 42 L.Ed.2d 447 (1974); <em>Washington State Farm Bureau v. Marshall, 625 </em>F.2d 296, 302 (9th Cir. 1980). We must affirm the agency action if a reasonable basis existed for its decision. <em>Id. </em>at 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-13\">The district court sustained the EPA\u2019s approval under this standard because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1308\">*1308</page-number>EPA could rationally conclude that: (1) the City\u2019s charge system satisfied the proportionality requirement of section 204(b), and (2) the City\u2019s charge system was consistent with regulations promulgated by EPA to implement section 204(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-4\">A. <em>Consistency with the Statute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1358-5\">Section 204(b)\u2019s reference to \u201cproportionate share\u201d is nowhere defined in the FWPCA. The district court, however, found that the section\u2019s legislative history suggests that Congress did not intend to impose an \u201cabsolute proportionality\u201d requirement and meant to require \u201conly proportionality which is generally equitable\u201d. The court argued that proportionality, while a general requirement, was not a primary motivation for the enactment of the user fee requirement. According to the court, Congress instead was primarily concerned with ensuring that treatment systems would be self-financing and was tolerant of local variations in user charge schemes so long as this basic requirement was met. Thus, while the City charge system apportioned costs on a proportionate basis only with respect to sanitary sewage, the court concluded that the system was sufficiently sensitive to each user\u2019s burden on the total treatment system to satisfy the proportionality requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-6\">HEA concedes that Congress desired to give localities flexibility in devising financ-mg schemes, but argues that this broad concern should not obscure the command of the statute\u2019s text requiring proportionality. To bolster its point, HEA emphasizes that in 1974 Congress failed to adopt an EPA-proposed bill that would have specifically authorized localities to apportion surface run-off treatment costs on a pro-rata basis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> HEA reasons that had Congress intended to permit pro-rata allocation of these costs, it would have adopted this amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-13\">We believe HEA is reading too much into this instance of Congressional inaction. The proposed bill\u2019s main focus was to permit localities to finance treatment costs through ad valorem taxes. This portion of the bill was ultimately enacted three years later without the language cited by HEA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although Congress may have refused to act on this part of the 1974 bill because it opposed the bill\u2019s intent, inaction might also have been due to the belief that the point was already covered by existing law. <em>See e.g., Diamond Crystal Salt Co. v. P. J. Rit-ter Co., </em>419 F.2d 147, 148 (1st Cir. 1969). The scant legislative history that exists concerning the 1974 bill supports this latter possibility. As noted by the district court, the letter submitted by then-EPA Administrator Russell Train in support of the 1974 bill reveals that EPA considered surface run-off treatment costs as not attributable to a user and thus not subject to the proportionality requirement under then-existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1309\">*1309</page-number>law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Given that the bill\u2019s focus was elsewhere, it is likely that Congressional attention was never specifically drawn to the portion of the 1974 bill HEA cites.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-5\">HEA is correct, however, to the extent that nothing in section 204(b)\u2019s legislative history supports the conclusion that Congress <em>specifically </em>authorized the method the City has employed to apportion surface runoff treatment costs. The legislative history underlying section 204(b) supports the district court\u2019s conclusions concerning the purpose of user\u2019s fees and the importance Congress placed upon giving localities flexibility in designing user fee systems.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Unfortunately, nothing in the various committee reports or floor debates speaks directly to how Congress wished surface run-off treatment costs to be apportioned. Congress appears to have enacted the proportionality requirement with <em>sewage </em>treatment squarely in mind, but it appears that it never directly confronted how it desired localities to finance the treatment of <em>surface run-off.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1359-11\">The legislative history\u2019s emphasis upon local flexibility, however, persuades us against narrowly interpreting section 204(b)(1) to require localities to apportion treatment costs with exacting mathematical precision. Although HEA is correct in arguing that no logical connection exists between a landowner\u2019s sewage loading and how much rainfall runs off his or her property, basing the City charge system solely upon sewage loading achieves at least rough proportionality because the preponderance of operating costs are attributable to sewage loading. The Congressional emphasis upon local flexibility suggests that section 204(b) requires no more.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-12\">Moreover, in contrast to a user loading sewage into a treatment system, surface run-off cannot be fairly ascribed to individual land-owners\u2019 \u201cuse\u201d of the treatment system. Nature\u2019s whims and not land-owners\u2019 actions determine where and how much rainfall descends upon the City. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1310\">*1310</page-number>It therefore would not be irrational for the EPA Administrator to conclude that surface run-off is not attributable to any individual property owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-4\">In sum, we conclude that the district court was correct in concluding that the EPA Administrator had a \u201crational basis\u201d for concluding that the City\u2019s charge system conformed with section 204(b)\u2019s proportionality requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-5\">B. <em>Consistency with EPA Regulations.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1360-6\">In 1978, the EPA promulgated a regulation describing how user charge systems should apportion treatment costs of surface run-off. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1360-7\">(d) <em>Charges for operation and maintenance for extraneous flows. </em>The user charge system shall provide that the costs of operation and maintenance for all flow not directly attributable to users (i.e., infiltration/inflow) be distributed among all users of the grantee\u2019s treatment works system based upon either of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1360-8\">(1) In the same manner that it distributes the costs of operation and maintenance among users (or user classes) for their actual use, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1360-9\">(2) Under a system which uses one of any combination of the following factors on a reasonable basis:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1360-10\">(i) Flow volume of the users;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1360-11\">(ii) Land area of the users;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1360-12\">(iii) Number of hookups or discharges to the users;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1360-13\">(iv) Property valuation of the users, if the grantee has a user charge system based on ad valorem taxes approved under \u00a7 35.929-1(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1360-14\">40 C.F.R. \u00a7 929-2(d) (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-15\">The district court ruled that the City\u2019s charge system was consistent with subsection 2(d)(1) because surface run-off treatment costs are allocated using the same formula used to apportion sewage treatment costs. HEA argues that subsection 2(d)(1) does not apply because the City\u2019s charge system apportions sewage treatment costs according to the added treatment burden attributable to each user and does not follow this general approach in apportioning the costs of treating surface run-off. This argument, however, ignores the regulation\u2019s first clause, which indicates that EPA does not consider \u201cinflow\u201d such as surface run-off <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to be \u201cdirectly attributable to users.\u201d A literal reading of subsection 2(d)(1) instead appears to endorse the City\u2019s method of allocating surface run-off costs according to the same formula used to apportion sewage costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-18\">HEA also argues that if the City\u2019s charge system is consistent with the regulation, the regulation is invalid because it violates FWPCA section 204(b)(l)\u2019s proportionality requirement. We reject this argument because HEA has failed to demonstrate that the City\u2019s method of allocating surface runoff costs is inconsistent with the statutory proportionality requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-19\">In sum, we conclude that the district court was correct in concluding that the EPA Administrator had a \u201crational basis\u201d for concluding that the City\u2019s charge system conformed with 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 929-2(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-20\">II. <em>Constitutional Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1360-21\">HEA argues that the equal protection and due process guarantees of the United States and California constitutions require governmental user charges to bear some rational relationship to the burden that individual users impose upon the public treatment system. It contends that the City\u2019s charge system violates this standard because it allocates the cost of treating surface run-off as a pro-rated share of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1311\">*1311</page-number>user\u2019s sewage fee rather than allocating the costs by the acreage occupied by each user.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1361-5\">We find no merit in this contention. HEA concedes that the alleged constitutional infirmity in the City charge system must be evaluated under the highly deferential \u201crational relationship\u201d test. Thus, even if a proportionality requirement can be read into the federal and state constitutions, the charge system and the classifications it employs must be upheld unless shown to be \u201cwholly arbitrary\u201d. <em>See, e.g., City of New Orleans v. Duke, </em>427 U.S. 297, 303, 96 S.Ct. 2513, 2516, 49 L.Ed.2d 511 (1976). This standard is less demanding than the statutory proportionality standard required under FWPCA section 204(b)(1). As we have determined that the City\u2019s charge system satisfies the statutory proportionality requirement, it follows that it also satisfies any due process or equal protection requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1356-9\">. The Hotel Employers Association also appeals the district court\u2019s denial of its motion for class certification of the members of the Association. As the Association\u2019s membership is identical to the membership of the class the Association sought to certify, and as we decide that summary judgment was appropriate against the Association\u2019s claims, the issue whether class certification was improperly denied is moot. We therefore do not consider the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1357-10\">.
