NLRB, </em>462 F.2d 666 (6th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-21\">The detailed facts of the case before us are found at 250 N.L.R.B. No. 47 (July 1, 1980). Although there are minor differences, e.g., a slightly different employee transfer rate, the essential considerations of geographical proximity and minimal authority-vested in the branch managers are almost identical to those discussed in <em>Wayne Oakland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-23\">Accordingly, the Court finds that the bargaining units found by the Board are inappropriate and enforcement of the Board order is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b442-24\">MERRITT, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ASD\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-25\">Although I agree with Judge Edwards\u2019 dissenting opinion in <em>Wayne Oakland, </em>this Court follows the general policy of adhering to the principles established by its prior decisions until overruled by the decisions of the Supreme Court or by this Court <em>en banc. </em>Like Judge Edwards, I believe that this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Wayne Oakland </em>and our decisions here to follow it in a similar case are inconsistent with the broad discretion vested in the Board in bargaining unit determinations.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
