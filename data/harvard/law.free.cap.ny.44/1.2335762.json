At this point, the prosecutor asked the juror whether he remembered the defendant from another case on which he sat as a juror. The juror responded: \"No, I didn\u2019t sit on it. I was working in a place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>that was broken into.\u201d The court then reminded the prosecutor that the juror had already been sworn and directed resumption of the selection of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">After the entire jury had been impaneled and sworn, the court recessed, at which point the court called the first juror, the prosecutor and defense counsel to the bench. Immediately after this off-the-record discussion, the court conducted a hearing in chambers to consider whether the juror was qualified to remain a member of the jury. Although the prosecutor and defense counsel were present at the hearing, the defendant was not. In response to the court\u2019s inquiry as to whether the juror\u2019s knowledge of defendant would influence his decision in the case, the juror informed the court that it would not affect his verdict in any way \u2014 that he just wanted to be fair. Defense counsel chose not to question the juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the Trial Justice stated that he did not believe the situation required statutory disqualification. In response to the Trial Justice\u2019s inquiry as to counsels\u2019 opinion on this question, both the prosecutor and defense counsel stated that they agreed with the court\u2019s conclusion. At no time did either defendant or his counsel seek to challenge the juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Following defendant\u2019s trial, the jury returned a verdict finding defendant guilty of criminal possession of dangerous drugs in the third degree and criminally using drug paraphernalia. The Appellate Division unanimously affirmed the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">CPL 260.20 provides that \"[a] defendant must be personally present during the trial of an indictment\u201d. Of critical importance to the interpretation of this provision is the meaning of the term \"trial\u201d. Certainly such important proceedings as the impaneling of the jury, the introduction of evidence, the summations of counsel, and the court\u2019s charge to the jury must be deemed a part of the trial. <em>(Maurer v People, </em>43 NY 1, 3.) Similarly, any further instructions given to the jury after they have retired to deliberate constitute the court\u2019s charge and are, therefore, viewed as a part of the trial. <em>(People ex rel. Bartlam v Murphy, </em>9 NY2d 550, 553.) All of these proceedings are deemed part of the trial because the presence of the defendant is considered \"essential to the attainment of justice and the protection of the innocent.\u201d <em>(Maurer v People, </em>43 NY, at p 3, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\"> Apart from our statutory provision, due process re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>quires the presence of a defendant at his trial \"to the extent that a fair and just hearing would be thwarted by his absence, and to that extent only.\u201d <em>(Snyder v Massachusetts; </em>291 US 97, 108.) His presence is required only where his absence would have a substantial effect on his ability to defend. <em>(Snyder v Massachusetts, </em>291 US, at pp 105-106, <em>supra; People ex rel. Lupo v Fay, </em>13 NY2d 253, 256-257, cert den 376 US 958; see, generally, 4 Zett, New York Criminal Practice, \u00a7 29.2, subd [2]; Impanelling Jury \u2014 Accused\u2019s Absence, Ann., 26 ALR2d 762.)</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Thus, whether the mandate requiring the presence of a defendant at the trial of his indictment stems from due process or statute, literal application of its directive is not demanded. Common sense dictates that substantial performance of its terms is sufficient. <em>(People v Bragle, </em>88 NY 585, 590; <em>People ex rel. Lupo v Fay, </em>13 NY2d, at p 256, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Applying this guide to our statutory provision, we held in <em>People ex rel. Lupo v Fay (supra) </em>that a defendant\u2019s absence from the courtroom during his counsel\u2019s argument for discharge of the jury did not affect a substantial right of the defendant requiring invalidation of his conviction. (13 NY2d, at p 257, <em>supra.) </em>In the same vein, and particularly pertinent to the present case is <em>People ex rel. Fein v Follette </em>(61 Misc 2d 826, affd 34 AD2d 835, mot for lv to app den 27 NY2d 486, cert den 401 US 954), in which the appearance in a morning newspaper of an article concerning the defendant\u2019s trial was brought to the court\u2019s attention. To inquire as to the effect this article might have upon the jury, the court ordered the jury to retire to the jury room. There, in the presence of the prosecutor and defense counsel, but in the absence of the defendant, the court proceeded to question the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">In discussing the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court\u2019s actions denied defendant the right to be present at his trial, the court stated that the defendant\u2019s absence from the jury room during the questioning of the jury did not affect any substantial right of the defendant. The court concluded that the questioning of the jury did not constitute a material part of the trial. (61 Misc 2d, at pp 831-833, <em>supra; People v O\u2019Keefe, </em>281 App Div 409, 416, affd 306 NY 619, cert den 347 US 989 [defendant\u2019s right not violated where neither defendant nor his counsel were present at court\u2019s questioning of juror].)</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">Turning to an analysis of the present case, we conclude that the Trial Justice\u2019s questioning of the juror in chambers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>under the circumstances present here did not constitute a material part of the trial. <em>(People ex rel. Fein v Follette, </em>61 Mise 2d, at pp 831-833, <em>supra.) </em>The court\u2019s inquiry was informal; it occurred after the entire jury had been selected and sworn \u2014 a procedure throughout which the defendant was present. Since jury selection had already been completed, the inquiry cannot be said to have been a part of the formal impaneling of the jury. Most important, the defendant\u2019s absence during this questioning did not have a substantial effect upon his opportunity to defend. Certainly, the presence of counsel at a hearing having nothing to do with guilt or innocence was sufficient to afford the defendant a \"fair and just hearing\u201d. Nothing more is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Chief Judge Breitel and Judges Gabrielli, Jones, Wachtler, Fuchsberg and Cooke concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
