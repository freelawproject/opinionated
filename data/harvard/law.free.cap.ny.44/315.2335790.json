Starkey dated August 21, 1974, did purge himself of the contempt set forth in the within indictment. <em>(Matter of Amado, </em>204 Misc 454; <em>Typothetae of City of N.

The trial court erred in refusing to allow appellant to assert as a defense: (1) that there was a valid court order allowing appellant to purge himself of the contempt; (2) to show that the prosecution was guilty of laches in failing to comply with said order; (3) that appellant in fact did appear before the Grand Jury and testified fully. <em>(Matter of Storm, </em>28 AD2d 290; <em>Baker v Eisenstadt, </em>456 F2d 382; <em>People v Colgan, </em>50 AD2d 932; <em>Matter of Rodriguez v Feinberg, </em>40 NY2d 994.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b354-11\"><em>Eugene Gold, District Attorney (Michael Gore </em>of counsel), for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJa\">I.

The contempt arose out of his refusal, in violation of a court order, to answer questions before a Grand Jury. Defendant contends that his contempt has been purged and the indictment should be dismissed. He relies on an order made by a Supreme Court Justice, more than a year after defendant\u2019s indictment and nearly two years after the contempt, allowing defendant to purge the contempt by testifying before the Grand Jury. At trial no reference to the purge order or defendant\u2019s subsequent testimony was permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\"> At issue is the power of a Judge to allow a defendant who has been indicted for criminal contempt under the Penal Law to purge himself of the indictment by complying, belatedly, with a court order earlier disobeyed. Since it is concluded that the purge order could have no effect on the indictment for the crime of contempt, there should be an affirmance. The problem and its resolution are simple and elaboration would be superfluous. Not to be confused with the crime of contempt, as defined in the Penal Law, is summary contempt, either civil or criminal. When the crime of contempt, prosecuted by indictment, is involved, a court may not permit the contempt to be purged.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Indictment for the crime of contempt, as defined in the Penal Law, like any other crime entitles defendant to a plenary trial. The crime is not intended solely to vindicate the authority of the court, but to further the ends of public justice as well. Thus, the crime of contempt must be distinguished from a summary criminal contempt adjudication, or a civil contempt which may undoubtedly be purged (Judiciary Law, \u00a7\u00a7 750, 753). As had been said, nearly a century ago: \"The two proceedings are wholly independent of each other. One who disobeys the lawful order of a court not only offends against the dignity of the particular tribunal, but also against the public law. The particular court may pass over the contempt and suffer its order to be spurned, but the offense against the people remains. Their authority has been contemned, the administration of public justice assailed, and its power despised\u201d <em>(People ex rel. Sherwin v Mead, </em>92 NY 415, 420 [Finch, J.]; see, also, <em>People v Colombo, </em>29 NY2d 1, 4, vacated and remanded on other grounds <em>sub nom. Colombo v New York, </em>405 US 9). Thus, once a contempt goes to indictment and prosecution, forgiveness by an individual Judge or court may not be permitted to frustrate the power to punish for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>affront to public justice. Purging of the contempt, therefore, is not permissible, at least in the absence of statutory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Unnecessary to reach, and probably incorrect, is the conclusion that under no circumstances may a \"criminal\u201d summary contempt be purged. In fact, this court has concluded, in some circumstances at least, that one summarily adjudged in criminal contempt pursuant to section 750 of the Judiciary Law \" 'holds the key to his freedom\u2019 \u201d <em>(Colombo v New York, </em>29 NY2d 1, 4, <em>supra; People ex rel. Valenti v McCloskey, </em>6 NY2d 390, 399, app dsmd 361 US 534; see, also, <em>Typothetae of City of N. Y. v Typographical Union No. 6, </em>138 App Div 293). Arguably, implicit in such a conclusion is the ability to purge some criminal contempts as distinguished from crimes of contempt. As noted already, however, that issue need not be reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">This is how the law of New York has developed. It should not be confused with a somewhat different categorization of summary criminal contempts in cases before the Supreme Court of the United States involving the application of principles of double jeopardy or jury trial (e.g., <em>Colombo v New York, </em>405 US 9, 10-11, <em>supra; Shillitani v United States, </em>384 US 364, 368-372; <em>Cheff v Schnackenberg, </em>384 US 373, 377-380).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b356-8\">Fuchsberg, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqk\">(concurring). This case presents claims (1) that the District Attorney, in bringing appellant before the Grand Jury, acquiesced in the acceptance of a judicial offer of redemption and thus waived any objection to its enforcement and (2) that the unappealed decision of the Judge who granted the defendant\u2019s motion to purge himself became the \"law of the case\u201d binding on District Attorney and trial court alike. Beyond that, the analytical divergence of the opinions below points up the recurrent confusion in the law of contempt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I therefore believe more extensive discussion is merited.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Though the power to punish for criminal contempt in New York is now to be found entirely in our statutes, its roots are ancient. In Anglo-Saxon tradition alone this power is traceable at least as far back as the twelfth century (Fox, History of Contempt of Court [1927], p 1). Blackstone later described it as \"an inseparable attendant upon every superior tribunal\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>\"as ancient as the laws themselves\u201d (4 Blackstone, Commentaries, p 282). And American courts, following those leads, have consistently regarded it as inherent and indispensable to their judicial functions (see, e.g., <em>United States v Hudson, 7 Cranch, </em>[11 US] 32, 34; Thomas, Problems of Contempt of Court, pp 49-53).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Appellant, by his refusal to answer questions posed by the Grand Jury, flouted this power. The dignity of our courts having thus been affronted, its vindication could follow one of two statutory avenues,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> either that prescribed by sections 750 and 751 of the Judiciary Law or the one to be found in sections 215.50 and 215.51 of the Penal Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Under the Judiciary Law sections, a court has the power summarily to punish for specified acts, among which is \"contumacious and unlawful refusal to be sworn as a witness; or, after being sworn, to answer any legal and proper interrogatory.\u201d While the sanctions which may be imposed under these sections may be expeditious, they are comparatively light, being limited to a $250 fine and 30 days in jail. (This relative leniency has not been without criticism; see the comments of Professor Siegel in McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 7B, Practice Commentary to CPLR 2308, subd [a].)</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">In this case, as no summary action was instituted against appellant under the Judiciary Law, the concomitant discretion that a court acting summarily retains to allow a contemnor to purge himself did not come into play (cf. <em>People ex rel. Valenti v McCloskey, </em>6 NY2d 390, 399, app dsmd 361 US 534).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">Under the Penal Law sections, while the State may attempt to exact a more severe penalty, it may not proceed summarily. Thus, having chosen to indict the appellant here for criminal contempt in the first degree under section 215.51 of the Penal Law, a class E felony, the People were required to accord him all the safeguards of a plenary trial. Another result of the pursuit of proceedings under the Penal Law rather than the Judiciary Law was that the appellant could not absolve himself of his contemptuous conduct by his subsequent compliance with the commands of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">For section 215.51 of the Penal Law made appellant\u2019s crime complete when, \"after having been sworn * * * before a grand jury, [he] refuse[d] to answer\u201d. His belated change of heart <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>could no more excuse him from responsibility for his crime than would an indicted embezzler\u2019s disgorgement of the avails of his larceny (cf. <em>People v Colombo, </em>29 NY2d 1, 3, vacated and remanded on other grounds 405 US 9). Nor could Leone\u2019s subsequent testimony before the Grand Jury eradicate the intent with which he defiantly undertook to obstruct justice two and a'half years earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">That his ameliorative conduct might be appropriately considered by the sentencing Judge on the limited issue of punishment is besides the point. For that purpose, eventual compliance very well could be a mitigating factor. But it was not a defense. <em>(Yates v United States, </em>355 US 66, 72.) Consequently, on the issue of guilt or innocence, proof of the fact that he eventually did testify and of the issuance of the order which preceded that event were properly excluded at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">True it is that the outstanding \"purge\u201d order may have led Leone to believe that retroactive immunity could be his. But, in testifying, he did no more than what he was obligated to do. The prosecutor\u2019s right to recall him was not dependent on the order. Had the appellant then continued in his refusal to answer questions \u2014 even if conviction and punishment for the earlier offense had already been a thing of the past \u2014 the State would have had the right to persist in its efforts to obtain his testimony and, if necessary, to have prosecuted him anew for a later and therefore separate contempt <em>(Matter of Ushkowitz v Helfand, </em>15 NY2d 713; <em>Matter of Second Grand Jury v Cirillo, </em>12 NY2d 206 [Desmond, Ch. J.]; <em>People v Matra, </em>42 AD2d 865, 866; <em>Matter of Vario v County Ct., </em>32 AD2d 1038, 1039, mot for lv to app den 25 NY2d 741; <em>United States ex rel. Ushkowitz v McCloskey, </em>359 F2d 788).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">The appellant also cannot take refuge behind a \"law of the case\u201d contention that the Trial Judge and the prosecutor were bound by the terms of the \"purge\u201d order. The law of the case doctrine is not an inflexible rule <em>(Dictograph Prods. Co. v Sonotone Corp., </em>230 F2d 131, 134-135 [Learned Hand, J.], reh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>den 231 F2d 867, cert dsmd 352 US 883; cf. <em>Martin v City of Cohoes, </em>37 NY2d 162, 165). Absent a claim of double jeopardy, of which there is none here, a criminal defendant has no vested right in an error of law <em>(United States v Wilson, </em>420 US 332, 345).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">Nor was the earlier Judge\u2019s postindictment grant of leave for defendant to purge himself a bar to the prosecution. In criminal no less than in civil cases, where circumstances require it, one Judge has the power to deviate from a decision made by another <em>(State v Richards, </em>229 NW2d 229, 232-233 [Iowa]; <em>People v Milo, </em>35 AD2d 848 [semble]; but see <em>People v Lenti, </em>46 Misc 2d 682, 685). All the more was this so here, where the People could not appeal unless and until the indictment was dismissed (see CPL 450.20; cf. <em>Matter of Alphonso C., </em>38 NY2d 923, 925). It was most doubtful too that prohibition would have been a viable remedy <em>(Matter of State of New York v King, </em>36 NY2d 59).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">In short, affirmance in this case is dictated not only by the resolution of the stellar issue but of its satellites as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Chief Judge Breitel and Judges Jasen, Gabrielli, Jones and Cooke concur in <em>Per Curiam </em>opinion: Judge Fuchsberg concurs in result in a separate opinion in which Judge Wachtler concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b356-10\">. (See Moskowitz, Contempt of Injunctions, Civil and Criminal, 43 Col L Rev 780; Civil and Criminal Contempt in Federal Courts, 17 FRD 167.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b357-10\">. The double jeopardy clause precludes resort to both statutory schemes for prosecution of the same offense (see <em>People v Colombo, </em>31 NY2d 947).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b358-8\">. I am aware of the fact that the American Bar' Association has recently expressed a contrary view (American Bar Association, Policy on the Grand Jury [1977], comment 24, p 16). But I see no reason to depart from Chief Judge Desmond\u2019s analysis in <em>Cirillo. </em>As he put it, \"Every citizen is subject to be recalled as a witness before the same Grand Jury or investigating body. There is no reason why one should get immunity as to subsequent contempts by serving a term of imprisonment and paying a fine. The State has a right to his truthful testimony and has a right to try again to get it after he has once been found guilty of contempt and punished\u201d (p 210).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
