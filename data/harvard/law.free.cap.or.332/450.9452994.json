Myers, </em>332 Or 352, 29 P3d 1108 (2001). Under Oregon Laws 2001, chapter 802, section 2 (now codified as ORS 250.085(8)), the court referred the ballot title to the Attorney General for modification. The Attorney General has filed a modified ballot title for the proposed initiative measure, and no party to the ballot title review proceeding has objected. <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(9) (setting out period within which party may object to modified ballot title and requiring court to certify modified ballot title if no objection filed).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">The modified ballot title for Initiative Petition 19 (2002) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-5\">\u201cAMENDS CONSTITUTION: PROHIBITS USING PAYROLL DEDUCTION PROCESS, OTHER PUBLIC RESOURCES TO COLLECT \u2018POLITICAL\u2019 MONEY FROM PUBLIC EMPLOYEES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-7\">\u201cRESULT OF YES\u2019 VOTE: Yes\u2019 vote prohibits using any public resource, including payroll deduction process, in collecting money used for \u2018political purposes\u2019 (as defined), even if collection costs reimbursed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-8\">\u201cRESULT OF \u2018NO\u2019 VOTE: \u2018No\u2019 vote retains current law, rejects prohibition on using any public resource, including payroll deduction process, in collecting money used for \u2018political purposes\u2019 (as defined).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-9\">\u201cSUMMARY: Amends constitution. Current law permits voluntary payroll deductions from public employees for political purposes, prohibits compelled contributions; prohibits soliciting political contributions on government time. Measure would prohibit using payroll deduction process, taking any other actions using \u2018public funds\u2019 \u2014 even if funds reimbursed \u2014 to collect money for union or any other entity that uses any portion of collected money for any \u2018political purpose.\u2019 Use for \u2018political purpose\u2019 includes direct, indirect contribution to candidate, committee, party; expenditure supporting or opposing candidate or ballot measure, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>encouraging or discouraging petition signatures; commingling with other money used for political purpose. \u2018Public funds\u2019 include public employee work time, public buildings, equipment, supplies.
