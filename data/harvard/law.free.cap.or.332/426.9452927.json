Myers, </em>332 Or 318, 30 P3d 408 (2001). Under Oregon Laws 2001, chapter 802, section 2 (now codified as ORS 250.085(8)), the court referred the ballot titles to the Attorney General for modification. The Attorney General has filed modified ballot titles for the proposed initiative measures, and no party to the ballot title review proceedings has objected. <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(9) (setting out period within which party may object to modified ballot title and requiring court to certify modified ballot title if no objection filed).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">The modified ballot title for Initiative Petition 7 (2002) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">\u201cAMENDS CONSTITUTION: REQUIRES OWNERS OF PRIVATE PROPERTY OPEN TO PUBLIC TO PERMIT FREE SPEECH ON ALL SUBJECTS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">\u201cRESULT OF \u2018YES\u2019 VOTE: \u201cYes\u2019 vote requires owners of private property open to public to permit free speech on all subjects, including petitioning, political campaigning, commercial advertising, religion, obscenity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">\u201cRESULT OF \u2018NO\u2019 VOTE: \u2018No\u2019 vote rejects requiring owners of private property open to public to permit speech on all subjects, including petitioning, political campaigning, commercial advertising, religion, obscenity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">\u201cSUMMARY: This measure would amend the Oregon Constitution. The Constitution now entitles persons to collect initiative signatures on public property, but does not entitle persons, over an owner\u2019s objection, to collect initiative signatures or engage in other types of speech or expressive activity on private property. The measure would extend the right of free speech \u2018on any subject whatever\u2019 to interior and exterior areas of all private property open to the general public, without exception. Measure thus would require owners of such property to permit all expressive activities, including circulation of petitions and solicitation of signatures for initiative petitions; political campaigning; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>commercial advertising; religious speech; and obscenity.
