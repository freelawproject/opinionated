Under Oregon Laws 2001, chapter 802, section 2 (now codified as ORS 250.085(8)), the court referred the ballot title to the Attorney General for modification. The Attorney General has filed a modified ballot title for the proposed initiative measure, and no party to the ballot title review proceeding has objected. <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(9) (setting out period within which party may object to modified ballot title and requiring court to certify modified ballot title if no objection filed).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">The modified ballot title for Initiative Petition 28 (2002) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-5\">\u201cAMENDS CONSTITUTION: ELIMINATES BY 2007 MOST RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY TAXES SENIORS PAY; REQUIRES GOVERNMENT PAYMENT TO SENIOR RENTERS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\">\u201cRESULT OF YES\u2019 VOTE: <em>\u2018Yes\u2019 </em>vote first incrementally reduces, then within five years eliminates, most residential property taxes seniors pay; also requires counties to make payments to senior renters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\">\u201cRESULT OF \u2018NO\u2019 VOTE: \u2018No\u2019 vote retains current property tax laws; rejects proposal to eliminate within five years most property taxes seniors pay, and to require payments to renters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-8\">\u201cSUMMARY: Amends Oregon Constitution. Current laws tax residential property owners equally, but allow low income seniors to defer property taxes. Measure would eliminate within five years most property taxes on seniors\u2019 primary residence. Measure does not affect temporary voter-approved property taxes. Maximum tax reduction is 150 percent of property tax due on average home in same county as taxpayer\u2019s primary residence. In first year, seniors 80 and older receive maximum reduction; seniors 65-79 receive 25 percent reduction. By fifth year, seniors 65 and older receive maximum reduction. Measure also would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>require counties to pay senior renters amount equal to tax reduction they would have received as owners. Measure would reduce revenues available for schools and other government services funded by property taxes.
