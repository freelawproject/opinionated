Petitioner is an elector who timely submitted written comments to the Secretary of State concerning the content of the Attorney General\u2019s draft ballot title for each initiative measure and who therefore is entitled to seek review in this court. <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(2) (stating that requirement). We review the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot titles to determine whether they are in \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with the requirements of ORS 250.035(2)(a) to (d). ORS 250.085(5).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Petitioner challenges all parts of each of the three ballot titles that the Attorney General certified. We have considered each of petitioner\u2019s arguments and determine that none is well taken. Accordingly, we certify the following ballot titles to the Secretary of State:</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">\n<em>For Initiative Petition 61:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">CREATES PROGRAM TO NEGOTIATE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES FOR PARTICIPATING OREGONIANS; CAPS RETAIL PRICES FOR PARTICIPANTS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-9\">RESULT OF \u201cYES\u201d VOTE: \u201cYes\u201d vote creates Oregon Prescription Drug Cost Reduction Program to negotiate prescription drug prices; program caps retail prices that participating pharmacies can charge program participants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-10\">RESULT OF \u201cNO\u201d VOTE: \u201cNo\u201d vote rejects creation of Oregon Prescription Drug Cost Reduction program to negotiate prescription drug prices; rejects capping prices that participating pharmacies charge program participants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-11\">SUMMARY: Creates Oregon Prescription Drug Cost Reduction Program for Oregon residents who choose to participate.
