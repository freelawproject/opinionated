Hartman and Elizabeth Ann McKanna (collectively, \u201cthe accused\u201d), did not violate Code of Professional Responsibility Disciplinary Rule (DR) 1-102(A)(3) (prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation); DR 2-110(B)(2) (requiring withdrawal from employment if lawyer knows, or it is obvious, that employment will result in violation of disciplinary rule); DR 7-102(A)(7) (prohibiting lawyer from counseling or assisting client\u2019s illegal or fraudulent conduct); DR 7-102(B)(l) (requiring lawyer to call on client to rectify fraud); and DR 1-102(A)(4) (prohibiting conduct prejudicial to administration of justice). The Oregon State Bar (Bar) alleged that the accused violated those ethical rules while representing a client in an employment dispute. The Bar seeks review of that trial panel decision. We review the record <em>de novo. </em>Bar Rules of Procedure (BR) 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Upon <em>de novo </em>review, although the question is a close one, we ultimately agree with the majority of the trial panel that the Bar failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the accused committed any of the charged disciplinary violations. Because the facts of this matter are so specific to this case', a discussion of those facts and the reasons for our conclusion would not benefit the public, bench, or bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Complaints dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
