MISCELLANEOUS CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES</p>\n<p id=\"b640-3\">Several petitions make broad-based constitutional challenges to the Secretary of State\u2019s reapportionment plan. We discuss each separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">A. <em>Application of \u201cSeparate-Vote\u201d and \u201cRevision\u201d Standards to Article IV, Section 6</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Moore Petitioners and Gray Petitioners challenge the present version of Article IV, section 6, on the ground that the 1986 and 1952 amendments to that provision violated the \u201cseparate-vote\u201d requirement of Article XVII, section l.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, petitioners contend, Article IV, section 6, retains its original wording, which contained no provision for the Secretary of State to prepare a plan of reapportionment or for this court to review it.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Petitioners assert that their \u201cseparate-vote\u201d challenge, as well as their \u201cfull-text\u201d and \u201crevision\u201d challenges, discussed <em>post, </em>fall within this court\u2019s original jurisdiction to review the Secretary of State\u2019s plan of reapportionment. Or Const, Art IV, \u00a7 6(2)(a), (3)(b). The Secretary of State disputes that those challenges fall within the scope of the court\u2019s original jurisdiction and has moved to strike those arguments. We choose to address petitioners\u2019 contentions \u2014 which we do not find to be well taken \u2014 on the merits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We therefore deny the Secretary of State\u2019s motion as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>In <em>Baum v. Newbry, </em>200 Or 576, 581, 267 P2d 220 (1954), this court concluded that the 1952 version of Article IV, section 6, did not contravene the \u201cseparate-vote\u201d requirement of Article XVII, section 1. A1986 amendment to Article VI, section 6, repealed the 1952 version of that section and replaced it with a new version. However, by contrast to the 1952 amendment to the original version, the 1986 amendment made relatively modest changes. <em>Compare </em>Or Const, Art IV, \u00a7 6 (1986) <em>with </em>Or Const, Art IV, \u00a7 6 (1952).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In light of this court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Baum </em>that the more extensive 1952 amendment passed muster under Article XVII, section 1, we conclude that the more limited 1986 amendment necessarily withstands petitioners\u2019 constitutional challenge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">Gray Petitioners also contend that the 1986 amendment to Article IV, section 6, revised, rather than amended, the Oregon Constitution, in violation of Article XVII, section 2(1).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Petitioners have failed to demonstrate that the 1986 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>amendment to Article IV, section 6 \u2014 which, as noted, pertained only to reapportionment under that section\u2014 amounted to a constitutional \u201crevision.\u201d <em>Compare Holmes v. Appling, </em>237 Or 546, 552, 392 P2d 636 (1964) (56-page document entitled \u201cProposed Constitutional Amendment\u201d was \u201crevision\u201d because it provided for \u201cthorough overhauling of the present constitution\u201d). We therefore reject petitioners\u2019 challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">B. <em>Governor\u2019s Authority to Veto Legislature\u2019s Reapportionment Plan</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">A number of petitioners contend that the legislature passed a plan of reapportionment, that the Governor lacked authority to veto that plan, and that, accordingly, the legislature\u2019s plan remains in effect. Therefore, according to that argument, the Secretary of State lacked authority to draft a plan of reapportionment under Article IV, section 6.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, we reject that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">The foregoing argument is based on the wording of the present version of Article IV, section 6, which was adopted by legislative referral in 1986. Under <em>Ecumenical Ministries v. Oregon State Lottery Comm., </em>318 Or 551, 871 P2d 106 (1994), the court begins its analysis of the meaning of the amendment with the text and context of the provision. <em>Id. </em>at 559.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Article TV, section 6, contains several subsections that are relevant to our analysis. Subsection (2) \u201cgoverns judicial review and correction of a reapportionment <em>enacted </em>by the Legislative Assembly.\u201d Or Const, Art IV, \u00a7 6(2) (emphasis added). Subsection (3) \u201cgoverns enactment, judicial review and correction of a reapportionment if the Legislative Assembly <em>fails to enact </em>any reapportionment by July 1 * * *.\u201d Qr Const, Art IV, \u00a7 6(3) (emphasis added). It is in the latter circumstance that the Secretary of State has a duty to make a reapportionment plan in the first instance. Or Const, Art IV, \u00a7 6(3)(a).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>The question is whether the Governor may veto a reapportionment plan passed by the Legislative Assembly. The constitution grants the Governor general power to prevent bills from becoming law by vetoing them, subject to the Legislative Assembly\u2019s ability to override the veto. Or Const, Art V, \u00a7 15b.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> There is nothing in the text, context, or history of Article IV, section 6, that suggests that a legislative reapportionment is different from other bills or otherwise somehow is <em>not </em>subject to the veto power. Petitioners\u2019 arguments rely only on the absence of certain wording <em>(i.e., </em>the text and history of Article IV, section 6, do not state expressly that a legislative reapportionment is subject to gubernatorial veto). In light of the well-understood, traditional constitutional process that includes presentment to the Governor after a matter has been approved by both houses of the Legislative Assembly, that argument claims too much from silence. Neither are we persuaded by petitioners\u2019 other arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">The Governor vetoed House Bill 2001, the Legislature\u2019s plan of reapportionment. The legislature did not override that veto. Therefore, the legislature did not \u201cenact\u201d a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>reapportionment plan by July 1, and the duty to do so passed to the Secretary of State under Article IV, section 6(3)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">C. <em>Application of Article IV, Section 7, to a Reapportionment Plan</em></p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Welsh Petitioners and others contend that the Secretary of State\u2019s plan violates Article IV, section 7, which provides, in part: \u201cA senatorial district, when more than one county shall constitute the same, shall be composed of contiguous counties, and no county shall be divided in creating such senatorial districts.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Welsh Petitioners concede that Article IV, section 7, cannot be given full effect because of the \u201cone person, one vote\u201d principle that the United States Supreme Court recognized as embedded in the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>See, e.g., Brown v. Thompson, </em>462 US 835, 842, 103 S Ct 2690, 77 L Ed 2d 214 (1983) (discussing requirements). Welsh Petitioners nevertheless contend that the Secretary of State must respect county boundaries to the extent that that duty may be reconciled with Article IV, section 6, and the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">In <em>Hovet v. Myers, </em>260 Or 152, 158-59, 489 P2d 684 (1971), this court discussed the relevant federal cases under the Fourteenth Amendment and concluded that \u201cthe existing districts formed along county lines must be changed <em>without regard to county lines </em>in order to comply with the Federal Constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 163 (emphasis added). As a consequence, Article IV, section 7, today imposes no greater duty on the Secretary of State to follow county lines than the duty found in ORS 188.010(l)(c) (\u201c(1) Each district, as nearly as practicable, shall: * * * (c) Utilize existing * * * political boundaries.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">We therefore reject the various constitutional challenges under Article IV, section 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">D. <em>Other Constitutional Challenges</em></p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">Welsh Petitioners contend that the reapportionment plan violates the Fourteenth Amendment to the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>States Constitution. Presently, each House district should have a population of 57,023, and each Senate district should have a population of 114,047. <em>See </em>Or Const, Art IV, \u00a7 6(1) (\u201cThe ratio of Senators and Representatives, respectively, to population shall be determined by dividing the total population of the state by the number of Senators and by the number of Representatives.\u201d). The Secretary of State\u2019s guidelines allow the population of both House and Senate districts to vaiy plus or minus one percent from the ideal district population. Welsh Petitioners contend that existing technology allows the Secretary of State to have districts with zero percent variation from the ideal and that the Secretary of State\u2019s plan therefore violates the Fourteenth Amendment. Assuming that technological capacity, it is not constitutionally necessary to use it. This court rejected a similar argument in <em>McCall v. Legislative Assembly, </em>291 Or 663, 673-74, 634 P2d 223 (1981), and we do so here.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">Welsh Petitioners also argue that the Oregon Constitution requires zero percent population deviation because Article IV, section 6(1), requires that representatives be \u201capportioned among legislative districts according to population.\u201d In fact, the Secretary of State\u2019s plan does apportion representation \u201caccording to\u201d population.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Petitioners have not cited, and we have not been able to locate, any text, context, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>or history that would suggest that \u201caccording to\u201d should be read to mean apportioned in strict numerical equivalency.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Kane Petitioners and Lehan Petitioners present numerous other constitutional arguments. Both sets of petitioners contend that the Secretary of State violated the Fourteenth Amendment in some manner. Lehan Petitioners also contend that the plan violates the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, and Article II, section 1, of the Oregon Constitution.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Kane Petitioners contend that the Secretary of State\u2019s plan violates Article I, section 20, of the Oregon Constitution.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We find no merit to those arguments and need not discuss them further here.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">II. OTHER LEGAL CHALLENGES</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Petitioner Goan contends that the Secretary of State should have deferred to the Legislative Assembly\u2019s plan of reapportionment, even though the Governor vetoed that plan. He relies on the following statement in McCall: \u2018When the Legislative Assembly is able to achieve agreement in this difficult decennial assignment, that achievement is entitled to be respected if possible.\u201d 291 Or at 685. Petitioner Goan misunderstands the significance of the statement in McCall, which referred only to this court\u2019s standard of review. The statement was not an interpretation of the constitution in the sense that it would need to be for Petitioner Goan\u2019s challenge to have merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Welsh Petitioners contend that this court should void the Secretary of State\u2019s reapportionment plan because the Secretary of State did not use what those petitioners describe as the \u201csettled reapportionment process.\u201d Article IV, section 6, grants to this court original jurisdiction to consider whether the plan \u201ccomplies with subsection (1) of this section and all law applicable thereto\u201d or \u201cdoes not comply with subsection (1) of this section and all law applicable thereto.\u201d Or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>Const, Art IV, \u00a7 6(3)(c), (d). Even assuming that past reapportionment plans have followed a \u201csettled\u201d process, in this context that process does not have the force of law and, thus, does not provide a basis for voiding the Secretary of State\u2019s plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">III. LEGAL STANDARDS GOVERNING SECRETARY OF STATE\u2019S REAPPORTIONMENT AND THIS COURT\u2019S STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Before turning to petitioners\u2019 particular challenges, we set out the legal standards governing a plan of reapportionment and this court\u2019s standard of review as it applies to those challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">As noted, this court\u2019s original jurisdiction is to determine whether a plan of reapportionment \u201ccomplies with subsection (1) of this section and all law applicable thereto.\u201d Or Const, Art IV, \u00a7 6(3)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Article IV, section 6(1), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-8\">\u201cAt the regular session of the Legislative Assembly next following an enumeration of the inhabitants by the United States Government, the number of Senators and Representatives shall be fixed by law and apportioned among legislative districts according to population. A senatorial district shall consist of two representative districts. Any Senator whose term continues through the next regular legislative session after the effective date of the reapportionment shall be specifically assigned to a senatorial district. The ratio of Senators and Representatives, respectively, to population shall be determined by dividing the total population of the state by the number of Senators and by the number of Representatives. A reapportionment by the Legislative Assembly shall become operative no sooner than September 1 of the year of reapportionment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">The legislature has enacted laws respecting Article IV, section 6(1). Specifically, ORS 188.010 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-10\">\u201cThe Legislative Assembly or the Secretary of State, whichever is applicable, <em>shall consider </em>the following criteria when apportioning the state into congressional and legislative districts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-11\">\u201c(1) Each district, as nearly as practicable, shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>\u201c(a) Be contiguous;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-4\">\u201c(b) Be of equal population;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-5\">\u201c(c) Utilize existing geographic or political boundaries;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">\u201c(d) Not divide communities of common interest; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-7\">\u201c(e) Be connected by transportation links.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-8\">\u201c(2) No district shall be drawn for the purpose of favoring any political party, incumbent legislator or other person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-9\">\u201c(3) No district shall be drawn for the purpose of diluting the voting strength of any language or ethnic minority group.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-10\">\u201c(4) Two state House of Representative districts shall be wholly included within a single state senatorial district.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-11\">(Emphasis added.) By its terms, ORS 188.010 applies the mandate in its first paragraph to all subsections in that statute, not just to subsection (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-12\">The Legislative Assembly also has directed the Secretary of State to promulgate rules regarding reapportionment. ORS 188.015.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> He has done so. Of particular relevance is OAR 165-008-0060, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-13\">\u201c(1) In developing a reapportionment plan, the Secretary of State will comply with Section 6, Article IV of the Oregon Constitution, ORS 188.010 and any federal law which imposes requirements in addition to those imposed by the Oregon constitution and statutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-14\">\u201c(2) Compliance with the criteria of ORS 188.010(1) shall be to the maximum extent practicable. The following interpretations will be made of specific criteria:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-15\">\u201c(a) \u2018Utilize existing geographic or political boundaries.\u2019 When possible, districts will be drawn to utilize county lines and to maintain cities within a single district;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-16\">\u201c(b) \u2018Not divide communities of common interest.\u2019 Where urban neighborhoods, rural communities or other communities can be identified, an effort will be made to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>retain that community within a single district. Consideration will be given to market areas covered by local media;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-4\">\u201c(c) \u2018Be connected by transportation links.\u2019 Road connections of at least a county road should be available within the district from one area of the district to another. This does not apply to unpopulated areas of the district.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">In reviewing a plan of reapportionment, this court is not privileged to substitute its judgment about the wisdom of the plan. <em>Ater v. Keisling, </em>312 Or 207, 213, 819 P2d 296 (1991). Rather, our task is to determine whether the Secretary of State has complied -with Article IV, section 6(1), \u201cand all law applicable thereto.\u201d Or Const, Art IV, \u00a7 6(3)(c), (d). However, the constitution and ORS 188.010(1) vest the Secretary of State with discretion in preparing a plan of reapportionment so long as the plan is rational and consistent with the fundamental constitutional requirement that apportionment be made according to population. <em>See Ater, </em>312 Or at 213 (noting \u201cbroad discretion vested in the legislature in applying the constitutional formula for apportionment\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). Consequently, this court will void a reapportionment plan only if we can say from the record that the Secretary of State either did not consider one or more criteria or, having considered them all, made a choice or choices that no reasonable Secretary of State would have made. A party challenging a reapportionment plan has the burden to show that one of those circumstances is present.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">That standard of review is dictated \u2014 at least in part \u2014 by the flexibility that is built into the statutes and rules that govern a reapportionment. ORS 188.010(1) provides that \u201c[e]ach district, <em>as nearly as practicable, </em>shall\u201d comply with five sub-criteria. (Emphasis added.) The consideration to be accorded to each criterion in specific districts, then, is in general granted to the reapportioning body, which in this case is the Secretary of State.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">IV. SPECIFIC CHALLENGES</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">With the appropriate standard of review in mind, we turn now to the specific arguments presented by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>A. <em>Challenges Under ORS 188.010(1)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">Numerous petitioners allege that the Secretary of State violated ORS 188.010(1) because he allegedly ignored geographic or political boundaries, communities of common interest, or transportation links.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">1. <em>Challenges to House District 55</em></p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Several petitioners challenge House District 55, which contains Crook and Lake Counties, plus parts of Deschutes, Klamath, and Jackson Counties.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Deschutes, Crook, Lake, and Klamath Counties lie east of the crest of the Cascade Mountain range. The part of Jackson County at issue (which includes the communities of Shady Cove, Eagle Point, and Butte Falls) lies west of the crest of the Cascades.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Petitioners first contend that the Secretary of State failed to consider adequately the criteria found in ORS 188.010(l)(c), (d), and (e) (geographic or political boundaries, communities of common interest, and transportation links), and the related administrative rules, OAR 165-008-0060(2)(a), (b), and (c). They contend that Jackson County does not have a community of interest with the remainder of House District 55, that House District 55 should not cross either the geographic boundary of the Cascades or the political (county) boundary, and that the transportation links to the rest of House District 55 are inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">8. The Secretary of State\u2019s summary regarding House District 55 is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-9\">\u201cHouse District 55 contains a large portion of Central Oregon, including Prineville and many other small communities that have a rural resource economy and share agricultural and timber interests. The entirety of Crook County was placed into this district to assure that it remained whole. This district was altered in response to public testimony in three distinct ways: first, it connects the communities south of Bend (now in House District 53) in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>House district that unites the needs of Deschutes County residents. Second, this district unites all of White City in its borders. Finally, Crook County was united in one House district. To unite these interests, it is necessary to leave the district in order to drive to all portions of the district. The population deviates from the ideal by .5 percent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">One of Platt Petitioners presented comments about House District 55 to the Secretary of State during public hearings. The Secretary of State responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-5\">\u201c* * * There is a clear community of interest along social and commercial lines between Klamath County and Jackson County especially with the Medford area. District 57, now District 55, follows the boundary of Congressional District 2. Klamath Falls and Medford are closely connected by Highways 140 and 62. Sunriver, LaPine and other Deschutes communities were removed and placed in a single district. KOBI/KOTI Television stations share ownership and provide daily news about both areas. One station serves Medford; the other serves Klamath Falls. The combined market of the two stations creates a community of interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Petitioners point to nothing in the record that demonstrates that the Secretary of State did not \u201cconsider\u201d the relevant criteria, nor do petitioners show that his choice to include part of Jackson County in House District 55 was one that no reasonable Secretary of State would have made. Petitioners\u2019 allegations that that part of Jackson County has, for example, more of a community of common interest with other communities west of the Cascades, or better transportation links with that area, do not demonstrate that the Secretary of State inadequately considered the appropriate criteria, or that his conclusions were those that no reasonable Secretary of State would have made. <em>See McCall, </em>291 Or at 685 (\u201cThis court does not inquire if a more nearly ideal apportionment could be designed, even assuming agreement on what is ideal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Anderson Petitioners appear to propose a new district that would meet their concerns. However, Anderson Petitioners fail to submit even the most basic information about their proposed district (such as population), nor do they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>discuss how their proposed change would affect House District 55 or others.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Under those circumstances, their proposal is not an alternative that the court will consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">Anderson Petitioners also contend that the Secretary of State violated OAR, 165-008-0040 because he improperly refused to accept their comments, which they allege were submitted electronically within the time allowed. Anderson Petitioners concede, however, that one petitioner read the comments aloud at a public meeting that the Secretary of State held on August 3, 2001. Even assuming that the Secretary of State erred in refusing to accept their written submission, that error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">2. <em>S48833, Kane and Brummell v, Bradbury</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The substance of Kane Petitioners\u2019 arguments appear to be that the Secretary of State should have paid more attention to county lines, particularly Multnomah County lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">The Secretary of State indicated in his transmittal letter that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-8\">\u201c[c]ounties in the tri-county Portland Metropolitan area play a relatively small role in the lives of residents. For decades, district lines there have routinely cut across county lines to account for more meaningful boundaries such as city lines, geographic boundaries such as the Willamette River, transportation links including highways and railroads, service districts and neighborhood associations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">At bottom, Kane Petitioners are seeking to substitute their judgment for that of the Secretary of State, arguing that he should have placed emphasis on the same criterion that Kane Petitioners do. It is clear that the Secretary of State considered the criterion that Kane Petitioners emphasize; he simply concluded that, on the record before him, other criteria were more important.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">Similarly, we find no merit to Kane Petitioners\u2019 argument that the Secretary of State violated ORS 188.010(1) in dividing the City of Beaverton into four House <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>districts. Kane Petitioners point to nothing in the record that demonstrates that the Secretary of State did not \u201cconsider\u201d the relevant criteria. Kane Petitioners have not shown that the Secretary of State made choices that no reasonable Secretary of State would have made.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">3. <em>S48859, Lehan et al. v. Bradbury</em></p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Lehan Petitioners challenge the placement of the City of Wilsonville in House District 26.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Lehan Petitioners note that virtually all of Wilsonville is in Clackamas County, but that House District 26 joins Wilsonville with Washington County. Lehan Petitioners argue that their community of interest is with the area currently in House District 37. They contend, conversely, that the City of Tualatin shares a community of interest with House District 26. Lehan Petitioners argue that the court should direct the Secretary of State to place Wilsonville in House District 37 and to place Tualatin in House District 26. Lehan Petitioners concede that the populations of the two cities do not match, but suggest that the Secretary of State somehow could correct such problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The Secretary of State explained his reasons for drawing House District 26 as he did as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-7\">\u201cHouse District 26 contains the cities of Gaston, Sherwood and Wilsonville. It also contains a large area of unincorporated Washington County and a smaller area of Clackamas County. The shape of this district changed in response to public testimony, adding areas near Wilsonville including the Wilsonville Tract, an important regional resource. The portion of Hillsboro previously included in this district was removed in response to testimony to contain that city entirely in two House districts. There are good transportation links between the population centers. The population deviates from the ideal by .8 percent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">Regarding House District 37, the Secretary explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-9\">\u201cThis district complies with the principle of not splitting cities by keeping Tualatin and West Linn whole. These two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>communities share an excellent transportation link: Interstate 205. Its southern border is the Willamette. The population deviates from the ideal by zero percent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">The interrelationship of districts means that the Secretary of State must consider the ORS 188.010(1) criteria not only within each district, but also among districts. Lehan Petitioners point to nothing in the record that demonstrates that the Secretary of State did not \u201cconsider\u201d the relevant criteria, n\u00f3r have they shown that the Secretary of State\u2019s choices as to how to draw the districts were those that no reasonable Secretary of State would have made.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">4. <em>S48869, Welsh et al. v. Bradbury</em></p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">In their arguments regarding Article IV, section 7, Welsh Petitioners suggest that the Secretary of State\u2019s reapportionment plan violates county boundaries in violation of OAR 165-008-0060(2)(a). As we have noted, ORS 188.010(1) directs only that the districts comply with political boundaries, among other criteria, \u201cas nearly as practicable.\u201d ORS 188.010(1)(c). Similarly, OAR 165-008-0060(2) directs the Secretary of State to follow ORS 188.010(1) \u201cto the maximum extent practicable.\u201d OAR 165-008-0060(2)(a) interprets ORS 188.010(l)(c) and specifies that, \u201c[w]hen possible, districts will be drawn to utilize county lines.\u201d Welsh Petitioners\u2019 arguments presume that the Secretary of State was required to, or at least should, have emphasized county boundaries at the expense of all the criteria except population. There is nothing in ORS 188.010(1)(c) or OAR 165-008-0060(2) that requires the Secretary of State to place such importance on county boundaries. The Secretary of State did not err as a matter of law.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Welsh Petitioners further contend that the plan violates ORS 188.010(1)(b) because the districts could have a zero percent deviation from the ideal number, but instead have a \u201cplus or minus one percent\u201d deviation from the ideal.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>Again, ORS 188.010(l)(b) is only one of five criteria that each district should strive to reach \u201cas nearly as practicable.\u201d The Secretary of State has discretion as to how to consider those criteria, both standing alone and with respect to each other. The ability to comply perfectly with one criterion does not mean that the Secretary of State must do so at the expense of all others. Petitioners have failed to show that the Secretary of State\u2019s choice to use a \u201cplus or minus one percent\u201d deviation was a choice that no reasonable Secretary of State would have made.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">5. S48870, <em>Gray and Hagborn v. Bradbury</em></p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Gray Petitioners contend that the Secretary of State erred in joining House Districts 1 and 2 to create Senate District l.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> They argue that House Districts 1 and 9 should have been joined in a senatorial district, that House Districts 2 and 7 should have been joined in a second senatorial district, and that House Districts 8 and 10 should have been joined in a third. They present evidence regarding the community of interest that connects the coastal areas assigned to House Districts 1 and 9.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>The Secretary of State must consider numerous criteria in deciding which House districts should be linked into a Senate district. Gray Petitioners point to nothing in the record that demonstrates that the Secretary of State did not \u201cconsider\u201d the relevant criteria. They have failed to show that the Secretary of State\u2019s choice to link House Districts 1 and 2 into a Senate district was a choice that no reasonable Secretary of State would have made.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">6. <em>S48871, Kropf et al. v. Bradbury</em></p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Kropf Petitioners challenge the Secretary of State\u2019s reapportionment plan as it applies to Linn County. They contend that the plan: (1) violates ORS 188.010(1)(a) because Senate District 12 and House District 23 contain counties that are not contiguous; (2) violates ORS 188.010(1)(c) because it fails to use existing geographic or political boundaries, specifically Linn County boundaries; (3) violates ORS 188.010(1)(d) because it divides communities of common interest; and (4) violates ORS 188.010(1)(e) because the part of Linn County placed in House District 23 is not connected to Yamhill County by transportation links.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">ORS 188.010(1)(a) requires only that the <em>district </em>be contiguous; it does not mention counties, much less require that every county within the district touch every other county. Kropf Petitioners\u2019 arguments regarding communities of common interest appear to be based on the unsupported assertion that the only communities of common interest that should be considered are those within Linn County. Transportation links are only one of the criteria that the Secretary of State must consider, and he did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Kropf Petitioners point to nothing in the record that demonstrates that the Secretary of State did not \u201cconsider\u201d the relevant criteria, nor do they show that the Secretary of State made choices that no reasonable Secretary of State would have made in drawing the Linn County districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>7. <em>S48874, McDonnell v. Bradbury</em></p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">Petitioner McDonnell did not submit a brief. We consider the arguments set out in her petition.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Petitioner McDonnell challenges the plan of reapportionment as it applies to Sunriver. She contends that House District 53: (1) violates ORS 188.010(1)(d) because it splits a community of interest between Sunriver and Bend; and (2) violates ORS 188.010(1)(e) because no transportation link within the district connects the northern half with the southern half (all transportation links go through Bend, which is in House District 54).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">House District 54 consists of the City of Bend and a very small amount of the surrounding area. House District 53, which entirely surrounds House District 54, consists of most of the remainder of Deschutes County, including Sunriver. Petitioner McDonnell argues, in effect, that some (unidentified) part of Bend has a greater community of interest with Sunriver than it does with the remainder of Bend. That allegation, and Petitioner McDonnell\u2019s other assertions, merely seek to substitute her judgment for that of the Secretary of State regarding communities of common interest. Transportation links are one criterion that the Secretary must consider, and he did so; but, as we have noted, he is not required to consider that criterion in a vacuum.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Petitioner McDonnell points to nothing in the record that demonstrates that the Secretary of State did not \u201cconsider\u201d the relevant criteria, nor does she show that the Secretary of State made choices that no reasonable Secretary of State would have made in drawing House Districts 53 and 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-3\">8. <em>S48875, Grant et al. v. Bradbury</em></p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Grant Petitioners challenge the plan as it applies to Clackamas County.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Specifically, Grant Petitioners contend that the plan does not comply with ORS 188.010(l)(c) and OAR 165-008-0060(2)(a) because it unnecessarily ignores Clackamas County boundaries, and does not comply with ORS 188.010(l)(d) and OAR 165-008-0060(2)(b) because it breaks up communities of common interest in Clackamas County.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Grant Petitioners appear to argue that the Secretary of State should have treated county boundaries as more important than other criteria. Thus, for example, Grant Petitioners contend that the Secretary of State should not have placed less emphasis on county boundaries in the tri-county Portland metropolitan area. We rejected that argument by Kane Petitioners, and we reject it here. County boundaries are only one of the criteria that the Secretary of State must consider. The remainder of Grant Petitioners\u2019 arguments merely seek to substitute their judgment for that of the Secretary of State as to the various criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Grant Petitioners point to nothing in the record that demonstrates that the Secretary of State did not \u201cconsider\u201d the relevant criteria, nor have they shown that the Secretary of State made choices that no reasonable Secretary of State would have made in drawing the Clackamas County districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">9. <em>S48827, Fabiano and Stern v. Bradbury</em></p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">Fabiano Petitioners present a problem of a different sort. Fabiano Petitioners contend that the official census data incorrectly attribute the population of one census block <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>to another census block in another district. According to the Fabiano Petitioners, House District 23 includes a federal prison in the City of Sheridan with approximately 1,992 inmates. The official census data, however, indicate that that block contains a population of zero. Those petitioners also assert that House District 24 includes a census block with an actual population of zero, but an official census population of 1,992 persons. Fabiano Petitioners therefore contend that the actual populations of House Districts 23 and 24 differ substantially from the populations reported by the Secretary of State.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Fabiano Petitioners contend that, consistent with ORS 188.010(l)(b), the Secretary of State should redraw the district lines to equalize the population between the two districts. The failure to do so could mean that the population of those two districts would violate the plus or minus one percent guideline used by the Secretary of State in every other district.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">The record demonstrates that two witnesses brought the census data error to the attention of the Secretary of State during public hearings regarding the reapportionment plan. The Secretary of State argues that the official population data provided by the United States Census Bureau support the district lines that he drew for House Districts 23 and 24 and that, to date, the federal government has not altered its official census data. The Secretary of State acknowledges that \u201cthere is virtual certainty * * * that the official census blocks have misplaced the Sheridan prison,\u201d as the Fabiano Petitioners argue. He asserts, however, that it is less certain whether that error means that the official census has assigned all 1,992 inmates to the census block in House District 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The Secretary of State argues that he may use only official census data in developing his reapportionment plan and that he lacks authority to correct official census data on his own initiative. To support that claim, the Secretary of State relies on Article IV, section 6(1), of the Oregon Constitution, which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>\u201cAt the regular session of the Legislative Assembly next following an enumeration of the inhabitants by the United States Government, the number of Senators and Representatives shall be fixed by law and apportioned among legislative districts according to population.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">According to the Secretary of State, the wording of Article IV, section 6(1), means that the \u201cenumeration of the inhabitants by the United States Government,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>the official census, is the only measurement of the \u201cpopulation\u201d on which he is entitled to base his reapportionment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The Secretary of State is correct in asserting that, under Article IV, section 6(1), his plan must apportion districts according to \u201cpopulation.\u201d However, that constitutional provision does not by its own terms require the Secretaiy of State to determine population solely by reference to the official census published by the United States Census Bureau. Rather, that provision makes it clear that the enumeration of the inhabitants by the United States Government simply is the event that signals the commencement of the constitutional reapportionment process.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The Secretary of State cites no other source of law in support of his claim that he cannot rely on reliable population information developed from data other than the census.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">We hold that the Secretary of State incorrectly has assumed that, in determining the population of a district in the face of an admitted error in the census data, he nonetheless must rely solely on official census data. The pertinent constitutional and statutory criteria that apply to reapportionment speak only of \u201cpopulation.\u201d <em>See </em>Or Const, Art IV, \u00a7 6(1) (legislative districts must be apportioned \u201caccording to population\u201d); Or Const, Art IV, \u00a7 6(3)(a) (requiring reapportionment \u201cin accordance with * * * all law applicable thereto\u201d); ORS 188.010(l)(b) (stating \u201cequal population\u201d criterion). The Secretary of State\u2019s reapportionment guidelines authorize no more than a plus or minus one percent deviation from the ideal target population. Due to the error in the official census data of the federal prison census block, the population in House District 23 may deviate significantly from those guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>It follows from the foregoing that the Secretary of State\u2019s decision not to attempt to obtain additional or different reliable data regarding the population of the prison census block was one that no reasonable Secretary of State would make. On this record, the failure to seek that data, if available, and to use it to assure compliance with the guidelines, means that the Secretary of State\u2019s reapportionment plan does not comply with Article IV, section 6(1), and all law applicable to the preparation of a reapportionment plan. The Secretary of State must determine the population of the prison as of April 1, 2000, the census date, 13 USC \u00a7 141(a), from other reliable evidence, including federal prison records, if such are available, and make such changes in legislative district boundaries as the Secretary of State may find appropriate to comply with all pertinent legal requirements, including the Secretary of State\u2019s redistricting guidelines.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">B. <em>Challenge Under ORS 188.010(2)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Several petitioners contend that the Secretary of State drew districts for the purpose of benefitting one political party in violation of ORS 188.010(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">ORS 188.010(2) prohibits the Secretary of State from drawing districts with the purpose of favoring a particular political party. It may be true that, in some circumstances, this court could infer from a record that a Secretary of State had the purpose of favoring one particular political party over another. However, the mere fact that a particular reapportionment may result in a shift in political control of some legislative districts (assuming that every registered voter votes along party lines) \u2014 and that is all that petitioners point to on this record \u2014 falls short of demonstrating such a purpose. Petitioners have not met their burden of demonstrating that the Secretary of State had an improper purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>C. <em>Challenge Under ORS 188.010(3)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">Platt Petitioners contend that the Secretary of State improperly diluted the vote of Native Americans by joining part of Jackson County to House District 55. ORS 188.010(3) prohibits drawing a district \u201cfor the <em>purpose </em>of diluting the voting strength of any language or ethnic minority group.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Platt Petitioners have not pointed to any direct or indirect evidence of such a purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The petitions are consolidated for the purpose of this opinion. The Fabiano petition is granted, and all other petitions are dismissed. The reapportionment is voided and is returned to the Secretary of State with directions that the Secretary of State consider the plan of reapportionment further in light of this opinion, and redraw legislative district lines as may be necessary to comply with Article IV, section 6(1), and all law applicable thereto. The Secretary of State shall correct the reapportionment in the particulars discussed herein and shall file the corrected reapportionment with the court on or before December 1, 2001. The appellate judgment shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b639-23\"> Four of the petitions were submitted on the briefs without oral argument: S48829, <em>Moore et al. v. Bradbury, </em>S48833, <em>Kane and Brummell v. Bradbury, </em>S48862, <em>Platt et al. v. Bradbury, </em>and S48874, <em>McDonnell v. Bradbury.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b639-24\">A number of <em>amici curiae </em>filed briefs in support of one or more petitioners. The <em>amici </em>are: Oregonians in Action, in support of Moore Petitioners and Gray Petitioners; Jackson County, in support of Petitioner Goan; Port of Brookings Harbor, Port of Gold Beach, and City of Brookings, in support of Gray Petitioners; Coos County and Curry County, in support of Gray Petitioners; and Clackamas County, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>support of Lehan Petitioners and Grant Petitioners. We have considered the arguments advanced in those briefs to the extent that they supported or augmented those advanced by petitioners.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b640-8\"> Article XVII, section 1, provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-9\">\u201cWhen two or more amendments shall be submitted in the manner aforesaid to the voters of this state at the same election, they shall be so submitted that each amendment shall be voted on separately.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b640-10\"> The Secretary of State also contends that petitioners cannot raise \u201cseparate-vote\u201d and \u201crevision\u201d challenges to the 1986 amendments to Article IV, section 6,15 years after the adoption of those amendments. For purposes of this opinion, we assume, without deciding, that petitioners may do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b641-5\"> For the sake of space, we do not set out the two versions of the section here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b641-6\"> We decline petitioners\u2019 invitation to revisit this court\u2019s decision in <em>Baum </em>in light of <em>Armatta v. Kitzhaber, </em>327 Or 250, 959 P2d 49 (1998). Contrary to petitioners\u2019 arguments, nothing in <em>Armatta </em>suggests that <em>Baum </em>was decided incorrectly; indeed, <em>Armatta </em>cites <em>Baum </em>favorably for the proposition that Article XVII, section 1, \u201cimposes a requirement aimed at ensuring that the voters are able to express their will in one vote as to only one constitutional change.\u201d <em>Armatta, </em>327 Or at 269.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b641-7\"><em> </em>Article XVII, section 2(1), provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-8\">\u201cIn addition to the power to amend this Constitution granted by section 1, Article IV, and section 1 of this Article, a revision of all or part of this Constitution may be proposed in either house of the Legislative Assembly and, if the proposed revision is agreed to by at least two-thirds of all the members of each house, the proposed revision shall * * * be * * * referred by the Secretary of State to the people for their approval or rejection, notwithstanding section 1, Article IV of this Constitution, at the next regular state-wide primary election, except when the Legislative Assembly orders a special election for that purpose. A proposed revision may deal with more than one subject and shall be voted upon as one question.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">Gray Petitioners further contend that the 1952 amendment to Article IV, section 6, similarly violated Article XVII, section 2(1). In light of the 1986 amendment to Article IV, section 6, which, as noted, repealed the 1952 version of that section, we do not address petitioners\u2019 argument respecting the 1952 amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">For the same reason, we do not address petitioners\u2019 additional contention that the 1952 amendment violated the \u201cfull-text\u201d rule of Article IV, section l(2)(d), which provides, in part: \u201cAn initiative petition shall include the full text of the proposed law or amendment to the Constitution.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b642-8\"> That issue is presented by Moore Petitioners, Anderson Petitioners, Petitioner Goan, Welsh Petitioners, Gray Petitioners, and Petitioner McDonnell. <em>Amicus </em>Jackson County, appearing in support of Petitioner Goan, makes the same argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b642-9\"> The Oregon Constitution repeatedly refers to the legislature\u2019s power to \"enact\u201d laws. <em>See, e.g., </em>Or Const, Art II, \u00a7 8 (\u201cThe Legislative Assembly shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>enact laws to support the privilege of free suffrage * * *.\u201d); Art II, \u00a7 31(6) (\u201cThe Legislative Assembly shall enact penalties for violation of section 30 of this Article.\u201d); Art IV, \u00a7 22 (\u201c * * * [I]f, at any session of the Legislative Assembly, there are enacted two or more acts amending the same section, each of the acts shall be given effect to the extent that the amendments do not conflict in purpose. If the amendments conflict in purpose, the act last signed by the Governor shall control.\u201d). We know of no case holding that those words, wherever used, are not intended to be read in the context of the Governor\u2019s veto power. Indeed, Article IV, section 22, expressly contemplates that the acts \u201cenacted\u201d by the Legislative Assembly will be signed by the Governor, as it uses the date of signature to determine which of two conflicting amendments controls.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b643-13\"> Article V, section 15b, provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-14\">\u201c(1) Every bill which shall have passed the Legislative Assembly shall, before it becomes a law, be presented to the Governor; if the Governor approve, the Governor shall sign it; but if not, the Governor shall return it with written objections to that house in which it shall have originated, which house shall enter the objections at large upon the journal and proceed to reconsider it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-15\">\u201c(2) If, after such reconsideration, two-thirds of the members present shall agree to pass the bill, it shall be sent, together with the objections, to the other house, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and, if approved by two-thirds of the members present, it shall become a law. But in all such cases, the votes of both houses shall be determined by yeas and nays, and the names of the members voting for or against the bill shall be entered on the journal of each house respectively.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b644-11\"> The Secretary of State contends that the 1986 amendments to Article IV, section 6, implicitly repealed the part of Article IV, section 7, at issue here. Because of the basis of our decision, we need not decide that question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b645-5\"> In <em>McCall, </em>this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">\u201cWith respect to petitioner\u2019s claim under the 14th amendment, we are of course governed by the decisions of the United States Supreme Court. Petitioner concedes that the degree to which the populations of districts created by chapter 261 [the legislature\u2019s plan of reapportionment] deviate from the mathematically ideal ratios remains well within limits approved in the relevant decisions. <em>Gaffney v. Cummings, </em>412 US 735, 93 S Ct 2321, 37 L Ed 2d 298 (1973), <em>White v. Regester, </em>412 US 755, 93 S Ct 2332, 37 L Ed 2d 314 (1973). He argues, however, that an alternative plan presented to the Legislative Assembly would have deviated even less from the idea of equal district populations, and he candidly urges us to depart from <em>Gaffney v. Cummings, supra, </em>to hold that the choice of the greater deviations must be supported by some more compelling state objective than to avoid election contests among incumbent legislators. Even if we were to disagree with the <em>Gaffney </em>opinion about redistricting for political selfprotection, however, we are not free to hold that the federal Constitution forbids what the United States Supreme Court would sustain. We therefore hold that the legislature\u2019s division of the City of Bend and Deschutes County between two districts does not render chapter 261 unconstitutional.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 673-74 (footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b645-8\"> \u201cAccording to\u201d means \u201cin conformity with; consistently with.\u201d <em>Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary, </em>12 (unabridged ed 1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b646-8\"> Article II, section 1, provides: \u201cAll elections shall be free and equal.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b646-9\"> Article I, section 20, provides: \u201cNo law shall be passed granting to any citizen or class of citizens privileges, or immunities, which, upon the same terms, shall not equally belong to all citizens.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b648-17\"> ORS 188.015 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b648-18\">\u201cThe Secretary of State shall adopt rules the secretary considers necessary in carrying out the secretary\u2019s reapportionment duties * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b650-10\"> The petitioners are: Platt Petitioners, Petitioner Goan, Anderson Petitioners, and Welsh Petitioners.

Regarding the latter district, the Secretary of State has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-8\">\u201cThe decision to extend this district inland into Douglas County was necessary to ensure that cities under a population of 57,023 be kept whole. Although such municipalities can not justify legislative districts entirely on their own, they nevertheless are whole, unique, and compact communities. To divide them into two or more districts unnecessarily reduces their weight and influence in the legislature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-9\">\u201cExtending House District 1 to into [sic] Coos County alone would require cutting into to [sic] the City of Coos Bay to acquire sufficient population to meet the minimum population requirement for a House district. However, taking all of Coos Bay into House District 1 to keep the city intact, would result in a district population greater than the ideal. The draft plan had extended the district into Josephine County to resolve this problem. But this configuration encountered considerable opposition from residents in both Curry and Josephine counties. In response to public testimony, the final plan substitutes a linkage with Douglas County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-10\">\u201cThe record shows that there are strong connections among Coos, Curry and Douglas counties. For example, the United States Economic Development Administration has designated these three counties as a single Economic Development District. There are excellent transportation links among the population centers of the district Highway 101 and Route 42, a much improved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>transportation link over the draft district. The district population deviates from the ideal by -.6 percent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Au5m\">As to Senate District 1, the Secretary of State explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Adk\">\u201cThe Senate district reunites Winston, in House District 1, with other communities near Interstate 5 in House District 2. This builds on the Coos-Curry-Douglas connections noted in the summary for House District 1.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b657-7\"> Previously this court has held that the September 15 deadline under Article IV, section 6(3)(b), is extended to the next business day when it occurs on a weekend. <em>See Ater v. Keisling, </em>312 Or 207, 210 n 1, 819 P2d 296 (1991) (so stating). This year, September 15 fell on a Saturday, and Petitioner McDonnell filed her petition on Monday, September 17. Upon further reflection, we now question this court\u2019s holding in <em>Ater. </em>Under Article IV, section 6(3)(b), this court has original jurisdiction of petitions \u201cfiled with the Supreme Court on or before September 15 * * <em>Ater </em>primarily relied on ORS 174.120 in concluding that, the specific date in the constitution notwithstanding, a filing on a later date nonetheless was timely. <em>Id. </em>By its own terms, ORS 174.120 applies only to civil or criminal procedure statutes, not the Oregon Constitution. Neither could a statute change the plain wording of the Oregon Constitution, which appears to set September 15 as an absolute deadline, regardless of the day on which it falls. The remaining authorities cited by <em>Ater </em>equally are inapplicable. However, in light of our disposition on the merits, we need not consider further the timeliness of McDonnell\u2019s petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b658-9\"> Clackamas County submitted an <em>amicus </em>brief in support of Grant Petitioners, in addition to its <em>amicus </em>brief in support of Lehan Petitioners.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b659-6\"> If Fabiano Petitioners are correct, then House District 23 has an actual population of 58,490, rather than the 56,498 reported, while House District 24 has an actual population of 55,323, rather than the 57,315 reported.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b661-7\"> We stress that this holding is limited to the particular circumstances of this case.
