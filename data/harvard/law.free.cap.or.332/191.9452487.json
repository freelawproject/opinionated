These proceedings are brought under ORS 250.085(2) and concern the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title for a proposed initiative measure, denominated by the Secretary of State as Initiative Petition 18 (2002). Petitioners are electors who timely submitted written comments to the Secretary of State concerning the content of the Attorney General\u2019s draft ballot title. Accordingly, they are entitled to seek review in this court. <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(2) (stating that requirement). We review the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title to determine whether it complies substantially with the requirements of ORS 250.035(2)(a) to (d). ORS 250.085(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Petitioners challenge the Attorney General\u2019s caption, \u201cno\u201d vote result statement, and summary. We have considered each of petitioners\u2019 arguments and conclude that none is well taken. Accordingly, we certify the following ballot title to the Secretary of State:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-6\">AMENDS CONSTITUTION: PROHIBITS PAYROLL DEDUCTION IF ANY PORTION USED FOR \u201cPOLITICAL PURPOSES\u201d (DEFINED) WITHOUT EMPLOYEE\u2019S WRITTEN AUTHORIZATION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-8\">RESULT OF \u201cYES\u201d VOTE: \u2018Yes\u201d vote prohibits payroll deductions if any portion is used for \u201cpolitical purposes\u201d (as defined) without an employee\u2019s written, and annually renewed, authorization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-10\">RESULT OF \u201cNO\u201d VOTE: \u201cNo\u201d vote retains, without modification, current provisions governing authorization of payroll deductions used for \u201cpolitical purposes\u201d (as defined).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-11\">SUMMARY: Amends Constitution.
