Petitioner timely submitted written comments to the Secretary of State concerning the Attorney General\u2019s draft ballot titles and is entitled to seek review in this court. <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(2) (stating that requirement). We review the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot titles to determine whether they \u201csubstantial[ly] complfy] with the requirements of ORS 250.035.\u201d <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(5) (stating that standard).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In these proceedings, the parties agree \u2014 and we concur \u2014 that the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot titles do not comply substantially with ORS 250.035. Under such circumstances, ORS 250.085(5) (1999) \u2014 the statute that was in effect when the petitions were filed \u2014 directed this court to certify to the Secretary of State ballot titles that do meet the statutory standard. The fundamental issue that the parties have joined here is whether this court constitutionally may carry out that function. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that legislative changes to ORS 250.085 make it unnecessary for this court to resolve that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">On September 11, 2000, after receiving and considering petitioner\u2019s comments, the Attorney General certified the ballot titles for Initiative Petition 7,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Initiative Petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>8,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Initiative Petition 9.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Each of the proposed measures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>purports to expand rights of political speech on private property, particularly the right to gather signatures to qualify initiative petitions for the ballot. As written, the measures seek to expand and confirm the right to gather signatures in shopping centers that this court had recognized in <em>Lloyd Corporation v. Whiffen, </em>315 Or 500, 849 P2d 446 (1993). The emphasized parts of each of the ballot titles set out above identify the rule of law stated in <em>Whiffen. Id. </em>at 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Three days after the Attorney General\u2019s certifications, however, this court issued <em>Stranahan v. Fred Meyer, Inc., </em>331 Or 38, 11 P3d 228 (2000). That case overruled <em>Whiffen </em>and held that petitioners seeking signatures to qualify initiative petitions for the ballot do not have a constitutional right to solicit signatures on private property, such as shopping centers, without the owner\u2019s permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Petitioner then filed the present challenges to the Attorney General\u2019s ballot titles, arguing that the summaries in the ballot titles misstate the law. Before <em>Stranahan, </em>it arguably would have been correct to state, as two of the summaries did, that the proposed constitutional amendments would \u201cextend\u201d the signature-gathering right. It also arguably would have been correct to state, as all three of the summaries did, that the Oregon Constitution \u201cnow entitles persons to collect initiative signatures on public property and at large private shopping centers, subject to reasonable restrictions to prevent interference with the owners\u2019 business.\u201d After <em>Stranahan, </em>however, neither statement is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\"> A ballot title must not misstate existing law, either directly or by implication. <em>Adams v. Kulongoski, </em>323 Or 253, 259, 915 P2d 967 (1996); see <em>also </em>ORS 250.035 (setting out statutory requirements for ballot titles). It is uncontested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>that, after this court\u2019s decision in <em>Stranahan, </em>the ballot titles for Initiative Petitions 7, 8, and 9 misstate existing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">Until the 2001 Legislative Assembly amended it, ORS 250.085(5) required this court both to \u201creview the title for substantial compliance with the requirements of ORS 250.035\u201d and, if the Attorney General\u2019s ballot title did not so comply, to \u201ccertify a title meeting this standard to the Secretary of State.\u201d ORS 250.085(5) (1999). Under the 1999 statutory scheme, if a petitioner correctly identified deficiencies in the Attorney General\u2019s ballot title, then there was only one way that this court could carry out its duty under ORS 250.085(5) to \u201ccertify a title meeting [the statutory] standard\u201d: The court was required to write a different ballot title.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">In the past, pursuant to that legislative directive, this court has rewritten many infirm ballot titles. <em>See, e.g., Starrett v. Myers, </em>330 Or 139, 998 P2d 671 (2000) (revising ballot titles to comply with ORS 250.035); <em>Zehner v. Myers, </em>330 Or 162, 5 P3d 600 (2000) (same). Nonetheless, some members of this court from time to time had expressed misgivings with the foregoing procedure, suggesting that this court\u2019s writing or rewriting of ballot titles might violate the constitutional principle of separation of powers. <em>See Dudley v. Jenks, </em>331 Or 1, 10-11, 10 P3d 257 (2000) (summarizing cases in which those concerns had been expressed). Before petitioner brought the present proceedings, however, parties had not focused their briefing on that constitutional issue. Now, the enactment of HB 2213 obviates any need to address those concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">In HB 2213, the legislature deleted the phrase \u201cand shall certify a title meeting this standard to the Secretary of State\u201d from ORS 250.085(5) and added three new subsections \u2014 (8), (9), and (10) \u2014 to that statute. We set them out in their entirety here, because they form the basis for our disposition of this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">\u201c(8) If the Supreme Court determines that the title certified by the Attorney General or prepared by the Legislative Assembly substantially complies with the requirements of ORS 250.035, the court shall certify the title to the Secretary of State. If the Supreme Court determines that the title certified by the Attorney General or prepared by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>the Legislative Assembly does not substantially comply with the requirements of ORS 250.035, the court shall modify the ballot title and certify the ballot title to the Secretary of State <em>or </em>refer the ballot title to the Attorney General for modification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-4\">\u201c(9) Not later than five business days after the Supreme Court refers a ballot title to the Attorney General under this section, the Attorney General shall file a modified ballot title with the Supreme Court and serve copies of the modified ballot title on all parties to the ballot title review proceeding. If no party to the ballot title review proceeding files an objection to the modified ballot title within five business days after the date the modified ballot title is filed, the Supreme Court shall certify the modified ballot title to the Secretary of State and enter an appellate judgment the next judicial day. If any of the parties to the ballot title review proceeding timely files a petition objecting to the modified ballot title, the Supreme Court shall review the modified ballot title to determine whether the modified ballot title substantially complies with the requirements of ORS 250.035.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\">\u201c(10) Upon the filing of a petition under subsection (9) of this section objecting to a modified ballot title:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">\u201c(a) If the Supreme Court determines that the modified ballot title substantially complies with the requirements of ORS 250.035, the court shall certify the modified ballot title to the Secretary of State; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-7\">\u201c(b) If the Supreme Court determines that the modified ballot title does not substantially comply with the requirements of ORS 250.035, the court shall modify the ballot title and certify the ballot title to the Secretary of State <em>or </em>refer the modified ballot title to the Attorney General for additional modification and further proceedings under subsection (9) of this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">HB 2213, section 2 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">As the emphasized parts of the newly enacted subsections demonstrate, the statute no longer requires this court, whenever it concludes that the ballot title certified by the Attorney General fails to comply substantially with the requirements of ORS 250.035, to write and certify to the Secretary of State a corrected ballot title.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Instead, the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>gives the court the discretion either: (1) to revise and certify to the Secretary of State a legally sufficient ballot title; or (2) to \u201crefer\u201d the matter to the Attorney General to correct the deficiencies in the ballot title.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">As we have explained, this is a case in which the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot titles do not comply substantially with the requirements of ORS 250.035. The question thus becomes: Which of the two alternative dispositional models provided in the newly enacted ORS 250.085(8) shall this court utilize?</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The answer is not difficult. Referring the matter to the Attorney General raises no constitutional issues respecting the proper role of the judiciary and the separation of powers. Given the uncertainty and delay that necessarily would attach to any effort by this court to address the constitutional issues further, we perceive no reason to follow that option in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Having identified the ways in which each of the three ballot titles certified by the Attorney General fails to comply substantially with the requirements of ORS 250.035, we refer the ballot titles to the Attorney General for modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Ballot titles referred to the Attorney General for modification.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b370-6\"> The 2001 Legislature amended ORS 250.085(5) in certain respects that we discuss <em>post. </em>Or Laws 2001, ch 802, \u00a7 2 (hereafter \u201cHB 2213\u201d).
