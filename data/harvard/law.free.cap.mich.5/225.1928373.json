Holbrook, claiming to be assignee of a creditor of said estate, on 20th March appeared to resist the allowance of said account, and moved for an order of Court, that an alleged order, removing Cook from his said trust, claimed to have been made by the Court on 22d October, 1856, but which was not entered of record in the Probate Court, might be entered <em>nunc pro tunc; </em>which motion, on 81st March, was granted. The Probate Judge, in Ms return <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>made to the Circuit Court, on appeal, says the administration-account was disallowed. Cook, the administrator, took an appeal to the Circuit Court, from the action of the Probate Court allowing the order of 22d October, 1856, to be entered <em>nunc pro </em>tunc, and refusing to audit his account as administrator. On said appeal, Holbrook appeared as one of the contestants. On the trial, the order of the Probate Court, as to allowing the alleged order of October 22d, 1856, to be entered on 31st March, 1857, <em>nunc pro </em>tunc, was reversed, and an order entered that the case be remanded to the Probate Court of Wayne county, to take such further action on the administration-account which had been presented and \u25a0filed by Cook, as might be proper; and that Holbrook, as contestant, pay Cook\u2019s costs on the appeal, to be taxed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-5\">Thereupon, on the 2d October, 1857, Holbrook sued out this writ of error.

L. </em>\u00a73631. When an appeal is taken, the Circuit Court is to proceed to the trial and determination of the questions involved in the case, according to the rules of law; and an <em>issue may be joined </em>therein, and a <em>trial be had by a </em>jury.\u2014 <em>Comp.

This term, <em>appellate jurisdiction, </em>-used in the statute, is to be understood in its general sense, signifying the power of review, and it is not to be applied to <em>appeals </em>only, as contradistinguished from writs of error. The term, in the statute, is applied to cases in <em>equity, </em>at <em>law, </em>and in <em>pn'obate </em>cases; and the general meaning of the term is as before stated. \u2014 1 <em>Bouv. L.

J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">The writ of error lies, upon any final judgment or determination of a court of law and of record, to remove <em>the </em>record into this Court, for review. \u2014 See <em>Comp. L. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 5332 <em>and </em>5340; <em>and cases cited by counsel. </em>To authorize it, it is necessary that there should be a <em>final </em>judgment or determination upon the matter in controversy in the inferior court, and it is never employed merely to bring up interlocutory decisions, or discretionary orders made pending the litigation. Usually, this writ, being a common law writ, is directed only to courts proceeding after the course of the common law; and I am not aware that our laws, giving to this court a general supervisory power over all inferior jurisdictions, have been construed, in any case, to allow this writ to run to courts of probate, or to any other than a common ,law jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">It is true Probate Courts are \u201c courts of record,\u201d being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>declared to be such by the Constitution, but they are not \u201c courts of law,\u201d according to the ordinary use of the term. They derive their origin and jurisdiction from a source altogether distinct from the common law, and they exercise no functions peculiar to that system. Parties can not litigate questions of fact in them, except in the instance of probate of wills, or when the power of appointment is to be exercised; and then no issues are joined by pleadings, no juries are known, and they render no judgments \u2014 their determinations being called orders, sentences, or decrees \u2014 and upon summary inquiry, with or without notice, as the case may be. If questions of fact, such as are the subjects of ligitation at law, are to be determined within their jurisdiction; as, for instance, the allowance or disallowance of claims against an estate; they are generally determined through the action of commissioners appointed by the Court, and from their decision no appeal lies to the Probate, but does to the Circuit Court. \u2014 <em>Comp. h. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2916, 2928, 2935, 2945. The orders and decrees of these courts are subject to review only in virtue of \u25a0statutory provisions, and not of their inferior character (for, primarily, they are not courts of inferior jurisdiction, as Justices\u2019 and Circuit Courts are); and the statute confers the power of review only upon the Circuit Courts, through an appeal, and thereby confers upon such courts superior jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The character of. this jurisdiction is worthy of notice. While appeals from Justices\u2019 Courts to the Circuit, and from chancery to this Court, are only allowed after final judgment or decree, from Probate Courts they are allowed from orders, sentences, decrees or denials, whenever and as often as occasion may arise <em>[vide, Comp. L. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3007, 3631); and the Circuit Court does not, in analogy with its jurisdiction in appeals from Justices\u2019 Courts, try and determine the issue <em>de novo, </em>and render an original judgment, but proceeds in analogy with the jurisdiction of this Court in appeals from -chancery, and, unless a question of fact is to be decided. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>simply reviews tbe proceedings appealed from. When a-question of fact is to be decided, an issue is joined undertbe direction of tbe appellate court (and here is tbe first and only issue in probate cases); and, after tbe trial of such issue, \u2014as in every other case \u2014 the sentence or act appealed from is reversed or affirmed, in whole or in part; such order or decree as the judge of probate should have made is made-by the Circuit Court, and the case remitted for further pro-, ceedings; or such other order may be taken therein as law and justice may require. \u2014 See <em>Comp. L. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3631, 3635, 3641. These aj&gt;peals may and do occur during the various stages of settling estates, and of the exercise of the peculiar juris-, diction of the court, and upon interlocutory proceedings;, and no final action or determination is necessary, as in cases at law; and, indeed, in the exercise of many of its most important functions, no <em>final </em>determination (technically speaking) is made. The great desideratum in proceedings in probate cases is despatch, and hence the reason of the peculiar jurisdiction conferred upon the Circuit Courts by this remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">To allow a writ of error to the Circuit Court, for the purpose of reviewing its proceedings upon these appeals, would interminably procrastinate the settlement of estates, and operate as a most oppressive burthen upon the public. This consideration, of itself, were the question a doubtful one, would induce us to hesitate long, before we recognized this remedy;, but a consideration of the nature of the Avrit, and the remedy, satisfies us that it lies in no case where the proceedings are not after the course of the common law, and only after judgment on an issue formed according to it; and it is not enough that the proceedings are in a court which ordinarily and, primarily exercises common law jurisdiction. It is true this Court has exercised jurisdiction in cases of appeals from probate judges to the Circuit Courts, and also in appeals from commissioners of claims to that court <em>(vide, In the Matter of the Estate of Godfrey, </em>4 <em>Mich. </em>308; <em>In the Matter of the Appeal of Dickinson, </em>2 <em>Mich. </em>337; <em>McBride vs. Cicott </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>4 <em>Ibid. </em>479; and <em>Millerd vs. Lund, decided at January </em>Term, 185?); but all these cases were after trials in the Circuit upon issues of fact, and where the proceedings were after the course of the common law; and no instance is known of the exercise of this jurisdiction, where the appeal was from an interlocutory order or discretionary ruling, and where the office of the appeal was to obtain a review, and not a trial of a question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">We think the same principle underlies this question as did that in <em>Parker vs. Copland, </em>4 <em>Mich. </em>548, and that the reasons which induced this Court to retain the writ of error in that case would quash it in this.</p>\n<judges id=\"b239-5\">All the Justices concurred.</judges>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">\n<em>Writ of error dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
