Allen, bearing date January 14th, 1854, recorded in the office of the register of deeds for Clinton county, February 6th, 1854, and assigned to the complainant, December 29th, 1855, by one Joseph Hollister, who was the assignee of the said Allen; which mortgage was given to secure the payment of a negotiable note of $650, in annual installments running through seven years. The bill contains the usual prayer for an account, foreclosure and sale, &amp;c. It was taken as confessed by the Walkers, and the defendant Ives appeared and answered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-7\">The answer admits all the facts alleged in the bill, and sets up a defense that the said note and mortgage were given to secure a balance of purchase-money of the premises described in the mortgage, which were sold and conveyed by Allen to the defendant William Walker, by warranty deed, at the same date of the said mortgage; that at the time of said conveyance, the premises were encumbered by a mortgage executed by one Cobb to William W. Forsyth and Douglass Forsyth, dated July 10th, 1849, and recorded December 20th, 1849, to secure the payment of $284.46, in four installments, the last payable within four years thereafter; and that, as a part of the transaction of the said sale and purchase, the said Allen executed and delivered to said William Walker an agreement in writing, that, in consideration of the premises, he (Allen) would pay off and discharge the said last mentioned incumbrance without any trouble or expense to said Walker; and also that the first installments of the said mortgage from the Walkers to Allen, if paid to the said Allen, should be by him applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>to the payment of the said Forsyth mortgage; or, if said Walker should see fit, himself, to pay said Forsyth mortgage, then the amount so paid by him should so far apply as a payment upon the said mortgage from Walker to Allen; which agreeihent bore date, and was duly acknowledged, January 14th, 1854, and was recorded in the office of register of deeds for Clinton county, in the record of deeds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-5\">The answer further sets up that on the 9th of February, 1854, the said Walkers duly conveyed the said premises, and on the 15th of March, 1856, duly assigned the said agreement to one Mortimer Ives; that the said Allen having neglected to pay the said Forsyth mortgage, or any part of it, the said Mortimer Ives, on the 12th of February, 1856, purchased and had duly assigned to him the said Forsyth mortgage, and the bond accompanying the same, and paid therefor the sum of $325.54, which was the amount then due upon the same; that on the 25th of December, 1854, the said Mortimer Ives paid upon the said note and mortgage from the Walkers to Allen the sum of $142.65; that the said Mortimer Ives has since deceased, and that defendant War ren Ives, is the father and sole heir of said Mortimer Ives, and is now in possession of the premises in question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-6\">And the defendant Ives, in his answer, claims to have the sum, so paid by Mortimer Ives for the purchase of the Forsyth mortgage, applied as a payment upon the mortgage from the Walkers to Allen; and that, if so applied, then there was nothing due upon the last mentioned mortgage at the time of filing the said bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-7\">There was no replication, and the cause was heard upon the bill and answer as to the defendant Ives, and <em>pro confesso </em>as to the defendants Walker.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-8\">Some of the facts above stated are not contained in the answer, but were supplied at the hearing, by stipulation in writing, which is made a part of the record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-9\">The Circuit Court refused to allow to the defendant Ives the sum paid for the Forsyth mortgage, and referred the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>case to a circuit court commissioner, to report the amount due and to become due upon the said Walker mortgage; and on the coming in of his report, final decree was entered, for payment, sale, &amp;e.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-5\">The defendant Ives appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b526-6\"><em>.T.

Mortimer Ives did not <em>pay, </em>but <em>purchase, </em>the Forsyth mortgage, and therefore could not, by the terms of the agreement, have any claim to have the amount applied on this mortgage. And in any event, it could not be applied, on this as against the complainant, as the purchase ivas subsequent to the assignment to complainant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-9\">3. Ives is in effect seeking <em>affirmative relief </em>by way of a specific performance of Allen\u2019s agreement.

The assignee of a mortgage takes it subject to all equities existing between the mortgagor and mortgagee. This, as a general rule, is correct, but, like most general rules, it has its exceptions; \u2019 and the case before us is one of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">The mortgage is for the payment of Walker\u2019s promissory note, given to Allen, and made payable to him, or bearer, with interest, in installments. The first installment had been paid, and the others were not due when the assignment was made to complainant, who, at that time, had no knowledge of the written agreement between Allen and Walker. In an action at law on the note, by complainant against Walker, the payment of the Cobb mortgage by Walker would be no defense; and as the liability of Walker and of the mortgaged premises are co-extensive for its payment, and Walker is liable) so are the mortgaged premises. <em>Reeves vs. </em>Scully, <em>Walk. Ch. </em>248; 3 <em>Chand. </em>94; 4 <em>Ibid. </em>153.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">The written agreement between Allen and Walker was recorded before the assignment to complainant; and it is insisted the record is notice to complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">The instrument is not one entitled to record under the registry law, and the record therefore is notice to no one. The 'object of registry laws is to protect subsequent <em>bona fide </em>purchasers against prior purchasers whose deeds have not been recorded. There is no question here between different purchasers of the mortgaged premises from Allen, or between the different assignees of the Walker mortgage from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>There was no merger of the Cobb mortgage. The Walker mortgage, intervening between it and the fee, was sufficient to prevent a merger; while the formal assignment of the mortgage to Mortimer Ives, when he paid it,- shows his intention to keep it alive as a subsisting incumbrance on the estate. And on his death it passed to his personal representative, and not to his father, who inherited the land, unless it was kept alive for the protection of the inheritance, in which case, it probably would. But it is not necessary to decide that point, and we give no opinion upon it; more especially as the personal representative of Mortimer Ives is not a party before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The decree of the Court below must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b528-6\">All the Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
