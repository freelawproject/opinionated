French, which assignment was conceded on the trial to be fraudulent upon its face, as it authorized a sale of the assigned property on credit. French immediately took possession of the property assigned, which, among other things, included a stock of goods in a store at Homer. He remained in possession of said store, publicly selling the goods as assignee, until he sold to Hill &amp; Mahoney, the plaintiffs below. The bargain of sale to these parties was made on the 24th day of September, 1856. They were to have the goods at twelve per cent, discount from New York cost, and were to pay $250 down, and give their joint notes for $250, payable in three months, and, for the balance, their notes in four equal payments, at twelve, eighteen, twenty-four, and thirty months, with interest after six months, and were to take possession next morning. They did so take possession, and commenced the inventory and sale of the goods.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-5\">On the 3d day of October following, the goods in the possession of the plaintiffs below were attached by the defendant below, who was sheriff of Calhoun -county, as the property of the assignor, Lewis, on a writ in favor of Culver, Foote <em>&amp; </em>Wilkie, who were creditors of Lewis. The inventory on the sale to Hill <em>&amp; </em>Mahoney was not then completed, nor the amount of purchase-money ascertained. No money had then been paid to French, nor had any notes, or \u25a0other securities or evidences of debt been given. Some time after the attachment, the $250 was paid, and notes were given for the balance of the purchase-money. Hill <em>&amp; </em>Mahoney replevied the goods from, the sheriff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-6\">O\u00f1 the trial of the replevin suit, the sheriff having justified under the attachment, and these facts appearing in evidence, the Court was asked by counsel for defendant below to charge the jury, \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-7\">That if the jury find that the sale as between the assignee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>and the plaintiffs was complete, so that, as between them, the title passed; yet, if they find -further, that at the time the defendant attached the goods in question, the plaintiffs had neither paid <em>nor secured </em>any portion of the purchase-money, then the attachment was valid, and the defendant is entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-5\">That a mere promise by the plaintiffs to the assignee, to pay money and to give notes, neither having been done at the time of the attachment, did not constitute a sufficient consideration to enable them to hold the goods as against the attaching creditors of the assignor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-6\">But the Court refused this request; and, on the contrary, charged the jury, \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-7\">That if plaintiffs were purchasers of the goods for a valuable consideration, and without notice of the fraud, they had a perfect title of the property, and were entitled to a verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-8\">That if anything passed of a substantial or legal value, it was a valuable consideration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-9\">That if the jury should find that plaintiffs obliged themselves to pay French, the assignee, the purchase - price of the goods In question, whether by writing or parol, the possession having been given to the plaintiffs, that would be a valuable consideration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-10\">To which charge as given, and to the refusal to charge as requested, defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-11\">Verdict having been rendered for plaintiffs in the Court below, and judgment entered thereon, defendant brought the case to this Court by writ of error, for review on the exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b414-12\"><em>WalTsers db </em>Russell, for plaintiff in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b414-13\">The Court erred in his refusal to charge, and in what he did charge, as to what constitutes \u201ca purchaser for a valuable consideration.\u201d \u2014 2 <em>Comp.

And we say a purchaser is neither within the equity or the letter of the Act, unless he is in a situation where, in the language of Lord Hardwicke, he will be \u201c hurt \u201d if the creditors avoid the assignment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b415-6\">Unless therefore he has paid the purchase-money, or secured the payment thereof, he is not, within the purview of this statute, \u201ca purchaser for a valuable consideration.\u201d \u2014 <em>Tourville vs. Naish, </em>3 <em>P.

LeAvis had made a general assignment, including these goods, to George H. French. French made an arrangement to sell the assigned property on credit to the defendants in error, who took possession and went on soiling under the arrangement Avhile the inventory was still incomplete. Before the inventory Ayas finished, and before they had paid or secured any portion of the price, the attachment was levied on the goods, and the defendants in error replevied them. Judgment being given in their favor, the case comes into this Court uj&gt;on writ of error, exceptions having been taken to the rulings on the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">The Court below, having decided that the assignment Avas void upon its face as against creditors, proceeded to charge the jury that it was nevertheless unnecessary that the defendants in error should have either paid or secured to be paid any portion of the purchase-money of the goods, in order to protect their title against the attachment, and that a verbal promise to pay Avas a sufficient consideration for that purpose..</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">No one but a purchaser for a valuable consideration can claim title to property which has been fraudulently assigned, against the action of an attaching creditor. Such purchasers are protected upon the equitable principle that they should not be deprived of that which they have honestly, and with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>out notice of any fraud, bought and paid for in fair dealing with the person holding the legal title. But the consideration must, in all cases, be actually passed before notice. Unless payment has been actually made in some shape, the authorities are quite clear that the purchase will not be upheld. In equity, a purchaser is protected to the extent of the payments actually made, and no further, even where future payments are provided for, unless those are secured in such a manner that the purchaser can not be relieved against them. This could only happen where he gives negotiable paper; for upon a debt not negotiable, the failure of title would exonerate him. It is unnecessary to decide whether in a court of law a purchase can be assailed or apportioned where there has been a partial'payment. In the case before us, no consideration whatever had been paid or secured. Such a purchase can not avail, either at law or in equity, against the remedies of creditors. The Court erred in charging the jury in favor of its validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">As this disposes of the merits of the case, we deem it unnecessary to decide the other points raised by the bill of exceptions. The judgment below must be reversed, with costs, and a new trial granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b417-5\">All the Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
