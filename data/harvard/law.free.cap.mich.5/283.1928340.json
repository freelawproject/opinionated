A plaintiff in error is always in court, and always entitled to notice. Where he does not prosecute his writ by attorney, he is entitled to have notice served upon himself in the manner provided by the Rules. Defendant in error is only entitled to such notice after having appeared.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
