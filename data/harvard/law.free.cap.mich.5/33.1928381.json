It aj)peared from the papers that the cause was tried at the March Term, 1855, without a jury; that judgment was rendered at the September Term, 1855, and the finding of facts then filed; that the bill of exceptions was signed by 'the Circuit Judge in January, 1856, and an addition made by Mm to the finding of the facts m March following. The bill of exceptions did not show on its face, nor was it stated in the record, that time was allowed for preparing and settling it. It was claimed that the Circuit Judge had no power to \u25a0amend the finding after the term when it was filed, and that the signing of the bill of exceptions after the term was unauthorized, unless time appeared to have, been allowed for its preparation.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b41-10\"><em>E. W. </em>Morgan, for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b41-11\">By the Court:</author>\n<p id=\"b41-12\">The question of the propriety of the amendment made by the Circuit Judge to Ms finding of facts, can not be passed upon here. It has been frequently held that a judge may, after the lapse of one or many terms, amend the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>verdict upon the judge\u2019s notes or other proof of the evidence given on the trial, sp as to apply such verdict to the proper counts, for the furtherance of justice. So amendments to bills of exceptions have been made after the lapse of a long time, and judges have been compelled by mandamus to make them where it was shown that they were in accordance with the facts. The amendment here made was entirely within the discretion of the Circuit Judge.\u2014 <em>Clark vs. </em>Lamb, 8 <em>Pick. </em>414; <em>Mathieson\u2019s Admrs. vs. Grant\u2019s Admr. </em>2 <em>How. </em>263.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Besides, this is not a part of our record, but of the record of the Court below; and we have no jurisdiction whatever to amend it. We might have power to compel its correction by that Court, in a proper case, and \u00f3n a proper application; but not to amend it ourselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">As to the other branch of the motion, it appears from the bill that the exceptions were taken at the proper time,\u2014 on the trial. All that the record shows afterwards is the signing. The signing, at least until there is showing to the contrary, is evidence that it was done in time, and that the steps preliminary thereto had been regularly taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">\n<em>Motion denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
