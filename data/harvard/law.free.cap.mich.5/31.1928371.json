The order for judgment recites that the cause was decided at the May Term, 1857, but judgment not then entered. In support of the motion, Mr. Clarke introduced certified copies from the journals of said Court, from which it appeared that two only of the judges who heard the argument were present when judgment was entered. He also read an affidavit of Hon. N. Bacon, one of the Justices of the late Court, that he (Judge Bacon) was deputed to prepare the opinion in the case; that he did prepare, and commence the delivery of an opinion at the May Term, but, on a suggestion by counsel of a mistake of fact, had suspended its reading until the record could be examined, and that, in fact, no decision was made at that term.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b40-5\"><em>Burt &amp; Maynard, </em>for defendant in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3\">objected that, after the lapse of a term, the Court had no jurisdiction to vacate a judgment, or alter the journal. They cited 14 <em>Barb. </em>(Ark.) 203; 16 <em>Ala. </em>26 \u2014 52; 3 <em>Sme. &amp; Marsh. </em>153; 4 <em>McLean, </em>254; 3 Wheaton, 591; 7 <em>Missouri, </em>320; 3 <em>Scammon, </em>170; 4 <em>Missouri, </em>228.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b40-7\">The Court held, that, without reference to the facts shown by the affidavit of Judge Bacon, the motion should be granted. In a case like this, where less than a quorum of the Court has heard 'the argument, there is no authority to render judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">\n<em>Motion granted.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
