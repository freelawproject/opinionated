This was objected to by the counsel of said defendants, on the ground that the writ offered did. not correspond in date with the writ as set forth in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration. This objection was overruled by the Court; to which ruling the-defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-8\">The bill of complainant filed by said Southworth against said Lothrop in the Circuit Court for the county of Lenawee in Chancery, and an order allowing injunction endorsed thereon, were then offered, and read in evidence; which bill, it appeared in evidence, was dated the September 3d, 1855, and was filed November 13th, 1855. The bill, among other things, prayed injunction to restrain the service of said writ of restitution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-9\">The order for injunction was as follows: \u201cLet an injunction issue agreeably to the prayer of the foregoing bill; and it is ordered accordingly until the further order of this Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>the complainant first giving bond in one thousand dollars, according to the provisions of section 102, Revised Statutes 1846', page 36!. Warner Wing, Circuit Judge. Sept. 3d, 1855.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-5\">The fplaintiff then offered in evidence a bond made by said- defendant to said plaintiff, and on file in the Circuit Court for the county of Lenawee in Chancery, in the enrollment of \"\u201cdecree; which' bond bore date September 4th, 1855, and recited that \u201c <em>Whereas, </em>On the eleventh day of July last past, the above named Samuel Lothrop commenced a suit under the provisions of chapter one hundred and twenty-three of the Revised Statutes of this State, entitled \u2018Proceedings to recover the possession of lands in certain cases,\u2019 before Lucien B.

Southworth, then this obligation to be void, otherwise of force.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-5\">This was objected to by the defendants, on the grounds,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-6\">1st. There is a variance between the date of the bond offered in evidence and the bond declared on by plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-7\">2d. The statute requires that the Coiu-t should grant leave before the bond should be delivered to the defendant in the chancery suit, and there is no evidence that the bond was ever, in fact, delivered, or that any order, allowing such delivery had ever been made by said Court in chancery in such case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-8\">3d. That the condition of the bond offered in evidence is not in accordance with the statute, or with the order of the Court, requiring the bond as a condition of the issuing the injunction in the said ohancery case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-9\">These objections were overruled by the Court, and the bond permitted to be read in evidence, and defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-10\">The injunction issued and served in said chancery cause was then read in evidence; and the plaintiff then offered tire journal of the said Circuit Court in Chancery, containing the entry of an order, dismissing the bill of complaint, and referring the cause to the circuit coiirt commissioner, to take proofs and report upon the damages, for the purpose of proving such order; which was objected to by the defendants\u2019 counsel, on the ground that the enrollment of the decree was the best evidence of said order or decree; which objection was overruled by the Court, and defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-11\">The plaintiff then offered in evidence the report of L. B. Bowen, circuit court commissioner as aforesaid, who reported in substance: That injunction was allowed September 3d, 1855, and that knowledge thereof came to defendant and George <em>W. </em>Ketcham, sheriff, in whose hands was the writ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>of restitution, immediately thereafter; but that the same was not issued by the register till about November 13th, 1855 ; that the injunction was dissolved December 21st, 1855; that, on the 3d of September, 1855, the crops on the premises were worth $401, and that the rent of the premises from that time till December' the 21st, 1855, were worth $3 per week; that Southworth harvested and removed all the crops; that the rent of the premises from November 13th to December 21st, 1855, was worth $2.50 per week \u2014 in all, $11; and that Lothrop had sustained $453.50 damages, by reason of the granting of the injunction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-5\">And plaintiff also offered in evidence the enrollment of the decree made in said cause December'16th, 1856; which, among other things, confirms the said report, and decrees that the complainant in said cause pay to the defendant therein the sum so reported by the commissioner, with costs to be taxed, and that execution issue therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-6\">The evidence so offered was objected to by defendants, on the ground that defendant Cleveland, not being a party to said proceedings, could not be bound by them. The objection was overruled, and defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-7\">An execution issued in said cause, and the return of unsatisfied on the same, were then read in evidence, subject to the same objection and exception by defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-8\">On behalf of the defendant Cleveland, his counsel offered to prove as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-9\">1st. The bond given by defendant Southworth and Joseph H. Patterson, at the time the sheriff and the plaintiff went to the premises to serve the writ of restitution, which bond was set out in the notice of defense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-10\">2d. That at that time, and before the final decree in the suit in chancery, the said plaintiff directed the defendant Southworth to remove certain apples, potatoes, corn, produce, and fodder, which had been raised that season upon the premises mentioned in the writ of restitution, and had before that time been severed and harvested by defendant Southworth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>3d. That said plaintiff also pointed out to defendant Southworth certain articles of farming utensils, not including any of the said articles above named, which the said plaintiff claimed as his property, and directed the defendant South-worth not to remove.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-5\">4th. That said articles of produce, so directed to be removed by said Lothrop, were removed by said defendant Southworth; and that the commissioner, in his report of the damages suffered by said Lothrop, included the value of the apples, potatoes, corn, produce, and fodder, so directed by said plaintiff to be removed, and so removed by said defendant Southworth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-6\">Which proof was objected to by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, and the objection sustained by the Court, and the evidence rejected; to which ruling and decision the defendant Cleveland excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-7\">The case was then submitted by the parties; and thereupon the said jury, under the direction of the Court, found a verdict against said defendants, and in favor of said plaintiff, \u2022for the sum of five hundred and thirty-two dollars, being the amount of said decree and costs, with interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-8\">The defendants then moved the Court for a new trial in said cause, for the following reasons:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-9\">1st. That the Court erred in overruling the objection to the reading in evidence the writ of restitution, and permitting said writ to be read in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-10\">2d. That the Court erred in overruling the objections to the bond offered in evidence, and permitting the same to be read in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-11\">3d. That the Court erred in overruling the objection to the reading in evidence the journal entry of the order or decree, and permitting such journal entry to be read in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-12\">4th. That the Court erred in overruling the objection to the giving in evidence the report of the circuit court commissioner, and the decree contained in the enrollment in said chancery case, and permitting the same, together with the execution hnd return, to be read in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>5th. That the Court erred in refusing to permit the defendant Cleveland to give in evidence the proof offered by him in his defense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-5\">Whereupon the-said Circuit Court <em>reserved </em>the-questions arising on\u00bbthe said motion for the opinion of the Supreme Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b451-6\"><em>C.

The bond when sued on, being still on file with the register, and there being no proof that the circuit judge had directed its delivery to plaintiff for prosecution, the plaintiff had in fact no possession of it. Delivery is one of the essential requisites of a bond, and there must be some proof of <em>delivery. </em>\u2014 Jackson <em>vs. Dunlap, </em>1 <em>Johns. Cas. </em>114; 1 <em>Stark. Ev. </em>372; 1 <em>Saund. Pl. &amp; Ev. </em>423; <em>Chandler vs. </em>Temple, 4 <em>Cush. </em>285, 287.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-10\">3. It was essential to the right of action that the circuit judge should have directed the delivery of the bond for prosecution. When an affirmative statute, which is introductive of a new law, directs a thing to be done in a certain manner, it shall not, even if there are no negative words, be done in any other <em>manner. </em>\u2014 Bac. <em>Abr. </em>\u201cStatute,\u201d <em>G.; Gedney vs. Tewksbury, </em>3 <em>Mass. </em>307.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-11\">4. The condition of the bond was not in accordance with the statute. Where the statute prescribes the condition of a bond, it must be strictly adhered <em>to. </em>\u2014 Hurlstone <em>on Bonds, </em>55, 58; <em>Howard vs. Brown, </em>8 <em>Shepl. </em>385.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-12\">The Court erred in permitting the journal entry of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>decree dismissing the bill to be read in evidence. The best evidence which the nature of the case admits must be produced. In this case, the enrolled decree^should have been produced-, and not a copy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-5\">f 5.

Cleveland should have been permitted to give the evidence offered by him. Its object was to show an arrangement between Southworth and plaintiff, in fraud of his rights as surety. A valid agreement between the creditor and principal debtor, without the assent of the surety, by which the rights or remedies of the latter are in any respect changed or delayed, will discharge the surety, though not apparently prejudicial to his <em>interest. </em>\u2014 Bangs <em>vs. Strong, </em>7 <em>Hill, </em>250; <em>Hubbell vs. Carpenter, </em>5 <em>Barb. </em>520; 1 <em>Story Eq.

'But such direction is not a pre-requisite to the commencement of the suit. It is simply an authority for the defendant to take the bond from the files for his own convenience in bringing suit. The right of action is perfect the moment the condition of the bond is forfeited.

The offer was simply an attempt to re-try in this suit the same question which had been directly adjudicated in the Court of Chancery.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b454-7\">Martin Ch. J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">The bond upon which this action was brought was given under the requirements of the statute upon the allowance of an injunction to restrain proceedings at law. In the suit in chancery, a decree had been rendered dismissing the bill, and damages had been assessed against the complainant, and a right of [action had accrued upon the bond. Upon the trial, various objections were taken \u00bfto the rulings and decisions of the Court, which will be examined in their order.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">The objection to the introduction of the writ of restitution was properly overruled. The declaration did not purport to set out the writ in <em>hcec verba, </em>nor to state the precise day of its issue, but that \u201c afterwards, to wit,\u201d &amp;c., it was issued. This mode of referring to the time is not governed by the rules which obtain in cases of recital of an instrument, and the same strictness of proof where time is laid under a videlicet is not required.\u2014 See 2 <em>Greenl. Ev. </em>\u00a712; 1 <em>Ibid. </em>\u00a761. It is, moreover, within the provisions of \u00a74329 of Compiled Laws; and the writ was properly allowed to be read.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">The same remarks will apply to the like objection made to the reading of the bond in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>The second objection to the introduction of the bond we think was not well taken. The defendants\u2019 counsel seems to have taken it on the hypothesis, That the bond was never delivered, but filed with the court as an escrow, and that the order of the judge was' necessary to complete the obligation\u2014 delivery being essential. We think this is not the correct view. The bond is required to be filed in the cause, it is true; but this is not to suspend delivery as in the case of an escrow, until some condition be performed, or event occur, necessary to complete the consideration, but it is a perfect obligation as soon as filed, and its delivery to the party is dependent upon its breach. Before that time, although deposited in court, it is delivered in the manner provided by law, and a right of action accrues upon its breach. The purpose of the statute in requiring a^judge\u2019s order, was to preserve the jurisdiction of the court over it so long as might be necessary to prevent an unjust use of it; and it is answered if the court \u2014 being the same, so far as its officers are concerned \u2014 allows its use on the trial. If the plaintiff was not entitled to it, an appeal should have been made to chancery to restrain its use; the objection can not be taken in proceedings in an action at law to enforce it. If the statute required that application for leave to prosecute it should be made to the court, the want of an order granting such leave would be a valid objection perhaps; but no such power is reserved to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">We can not perceive the force of the third objection to the reading of the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The objection to the introduction of the journal entries of the order dismissing the bill and for a reference to take proofs, upon the ground that the enrollment of the decree was the best evidence of such order, was obviated by the subsequent introduction of such enrollment. The admission of incompetent testimony is not error when the facts are competent to be shown, and are afterwards proven by competent evidence. We can, however, perceive no good rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>sons why the journal entries were not properly admitted; for they are as much the originals, as orders drawn by a solicitor and filed, and are the evidence of such orders, preserved under the immediate direction.of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">The objection to the production of the report of the circuit court commissioner, and of the enrolled decree 'and the execution issued thereon, upon the ground that the defendant Cleveland was not bound by it, he not being- a party to the decree, will be considered with that to the ruling of the Court excluding the evidence offered by the defendants to defeat the plaintiff\u2019s action. This latter evidence tended to shoxv (if it could prove anything) that the defendant SoxAtbworth had a defense to the plaintiff\u2019s claim for damages, which he might have exhibited, and, for anything that appears to the contrary, did exhibit and insist upon in the proceedings in chancery. If the decree was unjust, or not satisfactory, he had his right to appeal. Not having done this, the decree is conclusive upon him. It is also conclusive upon Cleveland. His obligation as surety in the bond is to pay to Lothrop all such damages and costs as should be awarded against Southworth iix the chancei-y suit. This obligation was broken as soon as a decree awarding damages was made, and the execution thereon returned unsatisfied. It did not extend back of the decree, and relate to matters upon which it was founded. The condition was broken upon non-payment; and the proof of the breach maintains the action. This is the rule in all cases. In those cited by the defendants\u2019 counsel where it was held that the judgment against the principal is not conclusive upion the surety, and in all others of the same character-, it is so held because the undertaking related to the cause of action: in the present case, the undertaking relates to the result. The cause was to be litigated by Lothrop and Southworth; Cleveland could not be heard in court, as he had no interest in the subject of the controversy. He, as an indifferent person, stepped in to the aid of Southworth, to enable him to prosecute his action, and undertook that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>lie shotild abide the judgment of the Court. He pan therefore raise no question of the correctness of the decree, nor impeach it in this collateral proceeding. If he apprehends any fraudulent collusion between the parties to the decree, his remedy is in chancery for relief against the bond. If this were not the case \u2014 as the action is against principal and surety jointly \u2014 the result would be that Southworth would be permitted, under color of Cleveland\u2019s claim of injury, to re-litigate the matters settled by the decree, by showing it to be erroneous, or by introducing new matter to diminish or obliterate the c-laiin upon which tho decree was based. This could not be done to defeat the service of the execution, if property had been found; and it can no better be done upon a proceeding subsequent to, and measurably auxiliary to, the execution. To hold otherwise, would be to introduce a dangerous and novel doctrine Into the law of remedies; viz., That when an action is brought upon a bond given for tho performance of a decree against principal and surety, the whole subject of the decree must be re-litigated, if a defense is set up impeaching it, before a joint recovery can bo had. We apprehend that such a rule would make litigation endless.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The motion for a new trial should bo denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b457-6\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
