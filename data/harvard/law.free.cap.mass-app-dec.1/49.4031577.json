However, an examination of the requests which were not briefed by the defendant does not reveal any miscarriage of justice. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">It is clear from the evidence that payments were made by the defendant to the plaintiff in excess of $934, which excess moneys paid for all merchandise purchased after January 9, 1937, excepting charges of $213.25. If the plaintiff had op' plied the sum of $213.25 out of said $934 received from the defendant toward the payment of said balance, there would still have been paid to him by the defendant $720.25 in excess of all purchases made after January 9, 1937.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">For what purpose did the defendant make this payment of at least $720.25 to the plaintiff? What was to have been the disposition of said money? Was this an advance payment? Was the plaintiff to hold it until the defendant made some purchases, some time in the distant future, and then deduct from said sum payment for said purchases; or if defendant made no further purchases, what was to become of said money? How long was it to be held by the plaintiff?</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">There was no evidence presented as to any agreement be' tween the plaintiff and defendant as to the disposition of such excess monies.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Clearly the trial judge was warranted in drawing an infer' ence that said monies, i.e. $934 were paid by the defendant to the plaintiff for the,express purpose of being applied to the debt due the plaintiff, prior to January 9, 1937, the date of bankruptcy. Otherwise, there was no adequate reason for the_ plaintiff to make such payment!</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">A reasonable inference to be drawn is that the plaintiff would not have advanced further credit after bankruptcy unless the prior debt had been paid by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">From the acts of the parties in the light of the circumstances the court could draw the conclusion that the money paid was to be applied to the old debt existing prior to bankruptcy. <em>The Tudor Press, Inc. </em>v. <em>University Distributing Co., </em>292 Mass. 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">\u201cA creditor receiving payments from his debtor without any direction as to their application, may appropriate them to any debt which he holds against him, and which is not illegal, even if it would not support an action, or because a right of action once existing has been barred.\u201d <em>Townsend </em>v. <em>Hargraves, </em>118 Mass. 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-11\">The defendant also claims to be aggrieved by the court\u2019s refusal to grant a request that he is entitled to a credit of $72.85 which was received as a dividend in bankruptcy. This was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>The plaintiff having <em>received </em>full payment from the defendant for the debt incurred prior to bankruptcy is answerable not to the defendant but to the trustee in bankruptcy for the dividend remitted to him by the trustee. <em>Remington on </em>Bankruptcy, Sec. 2864. The trustee is vested by operation of law with the title of the bankrupt's property. <em>Bankruptcy Act, </em>Sec. 70. It is only after all creditors\u2019 claims have been paid in full that any balance remaining shall be paid to the bankrupt.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-2\">Bankruptcy Act, Sec. 66 b.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-3\">Inasmuch as a dividend of only $72.85 was remitted to the plaintiff on his claim of $924 it would appear that all other creditors received but a small portion of their claims; and inasmuch as they were not paid in full, no balance would be due the defendant bankrupt even if he sought to recover same in a proper proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">Report dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
