Defendant\u2019s answer was general denial, payment, statute of limitations and statute of frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">The defendant requested the court to rule as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b98-12\">1. There is insufficient evidence to warrant a finding for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-13\">2. There is evidence sufficient to warrant a finding for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>3. The evidence of the plaintiff, is at variance with his declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-2\">5. The cause of action is within the Statute of Frauds, and the plaintiff cannot recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-3\">6. On all the evidence, the plaintiff has not sustained the burden of proof, and the defendant therefore is entitled to a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">All the facts are perhaps better stated by the trial judge in the finding made by him, all warranted by the evidence. The declaration alleges the conveyance of the land in question upon the agreement of defendant to pay the plaintiff a certain sum of money, to wit: the balance then due on the mortgage note.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The defendant testified that he took the deed to the property in question which is here involved, as security for this note and as a \u201cprotection\u201d for the defendant\u2019s husband and his family, but the matter of protection can well be eliminated from our consideration; there is no reason why the defendant\u2019s claim cannot be restricted to the' money consideration involved, as the finding of the judge shows he did. This finding is conclusive upon the matter of consideration. We are, therefore, forced to the conclusion of the trial judge that in consideration of defendant\u2019s provision to pay the note, the deed in question was given to the defendant. Her obligation to pay the note follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">There is no variance between the declaration and the evidence. The declaration alleges the amount due on the note, as the amount due, and we can discover no variance between the amount declared to be due and the finding of the judge in this particular. According to the declaration, the premises were conveyed to the defendant upon her promise to pay the plaintiff a certain sum; the fact that this sum to be paid is based upon the amount due on a certain note, or' rather is ascertained by the amount due on a certain note, does not create\" a variance. The sum is proved by proof of the amount due. This does not create any variance and, therefore, we think there was no error in the denial of defendant\u2019s request numbered three.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">There was little evidence in the case to sustain the defendant\u2019s claim that either she owed nothing on the note, or only owed fifty dollars, as was claimed by her; and the defendant\u2019s requests 1, 2 and 6 were refused because, as the court says, \u201cthere is sufficient evidence to warrant a finding for the plaintiff.\u201d This sufficiently disposes of these requests. Defendant\u2019s fifth request was properly denied under the authority of <em>Kemp </em>fourth request was waived. Defendant\u2019s fifth request was properly denied under the authority of <em>Kemp </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>248 Mass. 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">In <em>Peabody </em>v. <em>Fellows, </em>177 Mass. 290, at page 293, it is stated \u201cthat if one has received money or other property as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>the consideration of an executory contract which cannot be enforced by reason of the statute of frauds, and if he then refuses to perform the contract, he is liable to the other party under an implied promise to return the money or pay for the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-2\">Finding no prejudicial error, the report is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
