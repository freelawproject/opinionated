The only question argued by the plaintiffs in their brief is whether the judge was justified in ruling, as he did, \u201cas matter of law that there is not sufficient evidence of negligence on the defendant\u2019s part to warrant a finding for either plaintiff in these actions.\u201d The evidence in its aspect most favorable to the plaintiffs may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">\u201cThe plaintiff, F. Berthold Helander, was driving his wife\u2019s automobile toward Framingham, Mass., on West Central St. in Natick. There was a heavy fall of snow on the ground from previous snowstorms and the road was icy and slippery. A little snow was falling at the time of the accident. The road is a main highway and had been well plowed, leaving large banks of snow on either side of the traveled way. There were three lanes on this highway open to traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">\u201cThe plaintiff had been following the defendant\u2019s automobile for about half a mile before they came over the brow of a hill and were descending on the westerly side not very far from the Framingham line. As the two cars came down this hill the plaintiff noticed a pair of horses hitched to a load of hay facing East toward Natick and on the extreme Southerly side of the road. This team was stopped in front of an entrance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>to a driveway. The defendant brought his car to a stop so that the rear of his car was about opposite the rear end of the load of hay, on the extreme Northerly side of the road at the defendant\u2019s right. There remained room enough for the plaintiff\u2019s car to pass between the load of hay and the defendant\u2019s car without turning his car. The plaintiff slowed up as soon as the defendant started to slow up, and the plaintiff at that time was about 75 feet back of the defendant\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-2\">\u201cThe plaintiff saw the defendant's car door open just a few inches, and to avoid hitting the defendant, if he got out, the plaintiff edged his car over towards the load of hay so as to pass far enough from the defendant\u2019s door not to hit him. The plaintiff did not put on his brakes. When the plaintiff made this slight turn his car skidded and turned completely around and hit the horse nearest the road as the side of the plaintiff\u2019s car slid up against him. The plaintiff's car started to skid when about one car\u2019s length East of the horses\u2019 heads.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-3\">The plaintiffs seasonably presented seven requests for rulings. The trial court gave number 4 and denied all others.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">The first, second, third and seventh were based upon the principle of law that violation of a criminal statute, or a bylaw, or a regulation established by specific authority is evidence of negligence. But in order to invoke that principle, it must appear that an infringement of such regulation has occurred and that such violation could be found by the fact finding tribunal to be the cause of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">It could not have been found that the defendant was obstructing traffic as described in section 7, or not conforming to section 11, or parking as described in section 14, or that, his failure to give the necessary hand signal as required by section 12, was the cause of the accident, because the plaintiff slowed down as soon as he saw the defendant slowing down and he was then 75 feet behind the defendant whom he had been following for about half a mile. He also pulled out to pass. There was ample \u201croom for the plaintiff to pass between the load of hay and the defendant\u2019s car without turning his car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">It seems to us that said requests fall within the class referred to in Wilson v. <em>Birkenbush, </em>305 Mass. 173, 175, and cases there cited. The judge was not obliged to <em>give </em>them, although correct principles of law, if not applicable, because the facts found rendered them irrelevant. <em>Rathgeber </em>v. <em>Kelley, 299 </em>Mass. 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Of course, if the plaintiff has failed to maintain the burden of proving the negligence of the defendant, the fifth request became immaterial and was rightly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">The sixth was a request for a finding of fact which the court was not required to give. <em>Castano </em>v. <em>Leone, </em>278 Mass. 429.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">The report contains no error prejudicial to the plaintiffs and <em>'t </em>is, therefore, dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
