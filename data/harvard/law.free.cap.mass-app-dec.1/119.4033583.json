The alleged accident took place beneath the elevated structure of the Boston Elevated Railway Company, on Atlantic Avenue, Boston. It is unnecessary to set out the evidence in detail, be' cause it is conceded by 'the plaintiff, and we think rightly so, that the evidence warranted a finding for either the plaintiff or the defendant depending upon what part of the testimony the court believed. At the conclusion of the trial the court made the following special finding:</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">\u201cUpon the whole case, I find that the plaintiff\u2019s own negligence contributed to his accident and that said accident was in no wise attributable to any negligence or fault on the part of the defendant. I, therefore, find for the defendant.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">The plaintiff duly filed seven requests for rulings and he now claims to be aggrieved by the court\u2019s treatment of requests numbered 1, 2, 3 and 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">The court\u2019s action on requests numbered 1 and 2 shows no prejudicial error. It is plain that the plaintiff was not \u201cdeprived of the right to have the evidence considered upon the material issues of fact\u2019\u2019 raised by those requests. That was all he was entitled to. <em>Strong </em>v. <em>Haverhill Electric Co. </em>299 Mass. 455. Cf. <em>Threlfall </em>v. <em>Coffee Roasters Products, Inc. </em>306 Mass. 378. <em>Home Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Savransky, </em>307 Mass. 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">There is no error connected with the court\u2019s denial of the plaintiff\u2019s third request for several reasons. 1. It is elementary that one does not recover in a tort action of this nature by simply proving negligence on the part of the defendant. The request ignores the question of due care on the part of the plaintiff and also that relating to injury resulting from the defendant\u2019s negligence. The request, therefore, is not sound as an abstract proposition of law. 2. It asks the court to pass upon a \u201cfragment\u2019\u2019 of the evidence 'bearing on the issue involved and ignores evidence sufficient to warrant the trial judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>in reaching conclusions contrary to those desired by the plaintiff. It is well settled that a judge is not required to pass upon requests based upon \u201cfragments of evidence.\u201d <em>Barnes </em>v. Berkshire St. <em>Ry. </em>281 Mass. 47. <em>Tookmanian </em>v. <em>Fanning, </em>308 Mass. 162. 3. It is immaterial in view of the fact that the court did not find \u201cthat any obstruction to the defendants\u2019 view . . . was a contributing cause to the plaintiff\u2019s accident.\u201d <em>Boston Morris Plan Co. </em>v. <em>Repetto, </em>269 Mass. 72. <em>Pemberton Sq. Operating Co. </em>v. <em>Lydon, </em>292 Mass. 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-2\">There also is no error in the court\u2019s denial of the plaintiff\u2019s 7th request. The court found \u201cUpon the whole case . . . that the plaintiff\u2019s own negligence contributed to his accident\u201d and \u201cthat said accident was in no wise attributable to any negligence or fault on the part of the defendant . . .\u201d The evidence reported warrants findings that as the defendant\u2019s car was proceeding along Atlantic Avenue \u201cin a line of traffic . . . travelling 10 to 20 miles per hour\u201d . . . the cars in the line of traffic being . . . \u201cfrom 10 to 15 feet between each other\" . . . \u201cthe plaintiff walked right into the side of the car\"; and \u201cthat at the hospital the plaintiff, when asked how the accident happened, said T don\u2019t want you to blame the driver, I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. I walked into the side of the car.\u2019 \u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">It is plain that the court\u2019s finding of contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff is suported by the evidence. Under these circumstances there could be no recovery by the plaintiff even though the defendant was negligent. Therefore, the question of the defendant\u2019s negligence became immaterial. In view of our conclusion that the plaintiff has no legal grievance by the court\u2019s action on the requests above referred to, it follows that the report must be dismissed. The defendant submits that this appeal is frivolous and that the report should be dismissed with double costs. We so find.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Report dismissed with double costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
