It is admitted that the defendant was driving an automobile in a funeral procession which was passing through the traffic light at an intersection. Before the entire funeral procession had passed, the lights changed, but that part of the procession which had not passed before the light changed still continued to pass, although the light was against it. The trial judge found as fact that the plaintiff \u201cattempted to break through a funeral procession in which at least alternate cars were marked and in which there were spaces but not enough to justify the attempt of the plaintiff even though the light had turned to green.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">The trial judge denied four requests for rulings filed by the plaintiff. At the oral argument the plaintiff stated that he relied for prejudicial error on the denial of the following request: \u201c6. The defendant violated the law in proceeding against a red light even though he may have been part of a funeral procession,\u201d and the granting of the defendant\u2019s re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>quest that \u201cThe evidence warrants a finding that the plaintiff violated G. L. c. 272, s. 42, and said violation of law was a contributory cause to this accident and bars the plaintiff of recovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-2\">The plaintiff has argued strenuously that the defendant was negligent in passing through the traffic light after it became red. The defendant has as strenuously argued that a funeral procession, once started through a traffic light, has a right to continue passing even though the lights change. He points out that G. L. c. 85, s. 14A gives to a funeral procession \u201cof not more than ten vehicles\u201d the same right to use a public way that pleasure vehicles have, and contends that .the unit therein granted the right is the \u201cfuneral procession,\u201d not the individual cars. According to his contention, a funeral procession, having the right to pass through traffic lights, may continue so to pass, until all the cars are through regardless of any subsequent changes of the lights. It is to be noted that the right given under the statute in particular is limited to a procession \u201cof not more than ten vehicles.\u201d There is no finding in the case at bar which establishes.the number of vehicles in the procession of which the defendant was a part.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-3\">But whether or not the defendant was negligent in proceeding against the light and irrespective of whether the trial judge was in error in denying the plaintiff\u2019s sixth requested ruling, which deals with the defendant\u2019s negligence, the plaintiff cannot recover if he himself was not in the exercise of due care.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">The picture presented by the finding of fact made by the trial judge, that the plaintiff \u201cattempted to break through\u201d the funeral procession when he was not justified in making such an attempt, is not only that of an impatient, overzealous driver, trying to edge his way into oncoming traffic and force a path through at the risk of a collision, but is also that of a driver lacking in respect for a funeral procession and willing to disrupt and disorganize it in order to avoid being delayed by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">As far as the first aspect of the plaintiff\u2019s conduct is concerned, trtias always been held that one who goes \u201cinto the path of an obvious danger, voluntarily and not under any constraint for instant action,\u201d does not exercise due care. <em>Will </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated R\u2019y Co. </em>247 Mass. 250. <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated R\u2019y Co. </em>250 Mass. 288. Wade v. <em>Buchanan, </em>Mass. Adv. Sh. (1940) 1069 (25 BTL 70).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">In the other aspect of the case, the trial judge gave the defendant\u2019s third requested ruling, that the evidence warrants a finding that the plaintiff violated G. L. c. 272, s. 42 which prohibits the disturbing of a funeral procession- \u201cBy fast driving or otherwise.\" The evidence warranted such a finding of fact. The plaintiff has raised the issue that such a disturbance must be \u201cwilful\u201d to be within the scope of the statute. We find here present every element necessary to constitute wilfulness. \u201cThe word \u2018wilful\u2019 . . . means nothing more than intentional,\u201d <em>McChristal </em>v. <em>Clisbee, </em>190 Mass. 120. An act that is both in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>tentional and unreasonable is \u201cwilful.\u201d <em>Vermilye </em>v. <em>Postal Telegraph Cable Co. 205 </em>Mass. 598. The plaintiff\u2019s act in at' tempting to break through a funeral procession without any justification was clearly \u201cintentional\u201d and \u201cunreasonable.\u201d His violation of the statute was evidence of negligence and there' fore of contributory negligence. The general finding for the defendant imports not only a finding that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent, but as well a finding that the violation of the statute was a direct contributory cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury. <em>MacLean </em>v. <em>Neipris, </em>304 Mass. 237, at 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-2\">We are of the opinion that the plaintiff\u2019s act in attempting to break through the procession was the direct cause of his injury, and that his contributory negligence bars his recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-3\">The report is to be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
