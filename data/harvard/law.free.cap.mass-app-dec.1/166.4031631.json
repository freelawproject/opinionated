That the determination of the amount of damages found therein is against the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-12\">2. That the award of damages in the amount of two hum dred dollars is inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-13\">and asking that a new trial be granted on the question of dam' ages only.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-14\">In support of this motion, the plaintiff filed an affidavit assigning substantially all matters appearing in the evidence. In addition was the statement that there was an allegation that she had medical bills to the amount of forty-five dollars incurred as a result of this accident. This affidavit, however, in no wise can be considered as raising any issue not concluded by the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-15\">There is no claim set forth in the motion or affidavit that the evidence regarding medical bills was newly discovered evidence. There was no evidence that it was a matter of which the plaintiff had no knowledge before the trial, and it is hardly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>conceivable that she did not know the amount of this bill at the time of the trial, and that it could have been placed ih evidence by the plaintiff at that time, if proper care and consideration had been given to the presentation of plaintiff\u2019s evidence in this case. We do not find that the judge committed any error by the denial of the motion. It was hardly within his judicial discretion. <em>Sawyer </em>v. <em>Boyajian, </em>298 Mass. 415, 416. He may have decided that the bill would in no way change his original decision, <em>Sawyer </em>v. <em>Boyajian, supra, </em>and as no requests for rulings were made, no question of law was raised, by the Court\u2019s decision. <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Appley, </em>187 Mass. 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-2\">And it is also true that the question of law which the plaintiff raised at the trial, or which was open to her to raise, cannot upon a motion for a new trial be brought by appeal to this division. <em>Squires </em>v. <em>Tove, </em>291 Mass. 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-3\">And in <em>Skudris </em>v. Williams, 287 Mass. 568, the ruling is laid down at p. 570, by Mr. C. J. Rugg, that,\u2014\u201cwhen no ruling of law is requested or made touching a motion for a new trial, its disposition rests in sound judicial discretion\u201d and again, in the latter case, the Court reaffirmed the rule that \u201cThe disposition of the motion based on newly discovered evidence likewise rested in sound judicial discretion,\u201d citing <em>Matter of Sleeper, </em>251 Mass. 6, 22 and <em>O\u2019Neil </em>v. <em>Small, </em>268 Mass. 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">Finding no prejudicial error, the report is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
