No other witness testified to the actual happening of the accident. The defendant contented himself by calling only medical witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-2\">The judge found for the plaintiff, and refused to give the following ruling requested by the defendant: \u201c1. That upon all the evidence, the evidence in this case compels a finding that there' is no evidence of negligence on the part of the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\">While it is true, as the defendant contends, .that the mere happening of an accident is not evidence of negligence on the part of the defendant, we have more than that in this case. If the plaintiff could see the defendant\u2019s vehicle one hundred and fifty feet away it is equally true that the defendant could also see the plaintiff for the same distance. The question of the defendant\u2019s negligence was, under these circumstances, a question of fact for the trial judge to decide. <em>Mulroy </em>v. <em>Marinakis, </em>271 Mass. 421.
