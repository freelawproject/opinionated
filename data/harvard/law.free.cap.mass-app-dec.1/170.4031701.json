The reason for this is found in Rule XXVIII of said Rules, which provides in the ninth paragraph thereon, on page 30 that,\u2014 \u201cuntil a report is allowed ... all motions and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>interlocutory matters shall be heard by the justice of the court in which the action is brought.\u201d Therefore, these motions are returned to the court of origin, without other action on the part of this Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-2\">The latter part of said Rule XXVIII also provides for a dif' ferent procedure if the report is allowed or disallowed, and after a petition to establish a report has been , filed. None of these provisions are yet in force.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-3\">The two motions of the defendant, also before us, are in the same class as are the plaintiff\u2019s motions and are likewise returned to the court of origin for action.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">All of the motions above referred to are therefore ordered to be returned to the court of origin for further action in the last mentioned court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
