In this latter case there was no allegation of nonpayment of a debt secured by mortgage, save that a specified sum \u201cis now due and owing.\u201d The court, however, upon an appeal from a default judgment, held the allegation sufficient to support a default judgment, expressly overruling <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Holliday, </em>110 Cal. 337, [42 Pac. 891], where the contrary was held. The court said: \u201cIt is true that the allegation was made in the form of a legal conclusion, in which the material fact was merely implied, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>but, in the absence of any. demurrer such faults of pleading are cured by the judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The allegation that a certain sum \u201cis due and owing\u201d is an allegation of a conclusion of law of the same kind as is the allegation that defendants became indebted to plaintiff in a certain sum. There is no difference in principle between the two forms of pleading. The case of <em>Penrose </em>v. <em>Winter, </em>135 Cal. 289, [67 Pac. 772], is decisive of the point now under discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Cooper, P. J., and Kerrigan, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">A petition for a rehearing of this cause was denied by the district court of appeal on March 8, 1907, and a petition to have the cause heard in the supreme court, after judgment in the district court of appeal, was denied by the supreme court on April 8, 1907.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
