Const. art. IX, \u00a7 4; Code \u00a7 12.1-39; Rule 5:21(g). An order is final and appealable when it disposes of the whole subject, gives all the relief that is contemplated, and leaves nothing to be done in the case except to superintend ministerially the execution of the order.\n   <em>\n    Daniels v.

Indeed, the Commission stated in its January 8, 2004 order that \"there remain fundamental issues underlying this matter yet to be determined by the Commission directly, or upon report by a Hearing Examiner.\" The Commission further stated that \"[t]he decision now, therefore, is at most an interim step in the final disposition of the issues presented by the guaranty associations.\" The Commission also stated that \"[t]his matter is continued.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This Court holds, therefore, that neither order appealed from in the present case is final. Accordingly, the appeals are hereby dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <author id=\"p-10\">\n    Justice LACY took no part in the consideration of these appeals.\n   </author>\n   <p id=\"p-11\">\n    This order shall be certified to the State Corporation Commission and shall be published in the Virginia Reports.\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
