Greer, Deputy.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"An\">\u201cThere is oral evidence going to show that there was no notice or publication made in a newspaper or otherwise of the intention to reduce the capital stock of the bank. There is no affirmative evidence tending to show that notice or publication of any character was given or made at all, for thirty days or any period of time, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>the purpose or intention of reducing the capital stock of the bank, or of purpose to change to the bond plan of securing depositors. The amount of the reduced capital stock was not withdrawn, but passed to the surplus in the bank and used as assets in the liquidation of the bank. It was agreed upon as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">\u201c \u2018That the First State Bank delivered to the Banking Commissioner of Texas, by way of pledge and to secure its depositors, $100,000.00 United States Bonds on May 6, 1926, and that said \u2018Commissioner received and accepted said bonds so pledged, and approved the same, said bonds having been previously approved by the County Judge of Lamar County, Texas.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">\u201c \u2018That the First State Bank of Paris, from the date of its organization up to April 13, 1926, operated under the Guaranty Fund plan.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">\u201c \u2018That the Banking Commissioner of Texas took charge of the First State Bank, Paris, Texas, for liquidation on May 26, 1926.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">\u201c \u2018That prior to the failure of the bank plaintiff and his assignors had no actual knowledge of the change, if any, by the bank from the Guaranty Fund plan to the Bond plan, unless the posting of the notice, if any, in the bank operated to charge them with notice and knowledge of such change.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">\u201c \u2018That A. Collier and his assignors were depositors in the First State Bank, Paris, Texas, on April 13, 1926, and continued to be such depositors until the bank was closed for liquidation. That the claims were unsecured and non-interest-bearing deposits.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b61-11\">\u201cThere is no pretense in the evidence that the bank filed with the Banking Commissioner a bond or policy of insurance on April 13, 1926, or afterwards. The United States bonds deposited with the Banking Commissioner on May 6, 1926, were purchased by the bank with its \u2018bills receivable.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b61-12\">\u201cIt was further agreed upon:</p>\n<p id=\"b61-13\">\u201c\u2018That on February 14, 1927, a dividend of 13.817% was declared in favor of depositors of the First State Bank, payable out of the proceeds of the bonds pledged by said bank to secure its depositors, and that said dividend was paid to plaintiff and each of his assignors.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b61-14\">\u201c \u2018That on January 19, 1928, a dividend of 13% was declared payable out of the assets of the bank in favor of all creditors of the bank, including plaintiff and his assignors.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b61-15\">\u201c \u2018That the assets of the bank have been reduced to cash.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b62-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>\u201cIt appears that the bank was closed by its board of directors on May 26, 1926, and placed in the hands of the Banking Commis'sioner. The Banking Commissioner on taking charge of the bank proceeded to liquidate it as a bank operating on the bond plan. 'He published a notice to that effect in the papers, a copy of which was mailed to each depositor, including plaintiff and his assignors. All the depositors filed claims, and the commissioner approved them as payable out of assets and the bonds pledged to the commissioner. Plaintiff\u2019s original petition was filed May 19, 1928, and the amended original petition was filed on September 10, 1928. It was agreed \u2018That the first and only demand, prior to the filing of this suit, made upon the Banking Commissioner and the Banking Board for payment of the claims sued upon out of the Depositors\u2019 Guaranty Fund was made in writing on or about May 3, 1928, and which demand was refused by the Banking Commissioner and the Banking Board.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b62-3\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">\u201cThe case was submitted to the jury upon the following special issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">\u201c \u2018Question No. 1: Was the First State Bank of Paris, Texas, insolvent on May 6th, 1926?</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">\u201c \u2018Answer: Yes, it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">\u201c \u2018Question No. 2: Did the officers in charge of the First State Bank of Paris, Texas, have notice (as that term is above defined) on May 6th, 1926, that said bank was at that time insolvent?</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">\u201c \u2018Answer: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">\u201c \u2018Question No. 3: Did the Banking Commissioner of the State of Texas on May 6th, 1926, have notice (as that term is above defined) that the First State Bank of Paris was on said date insolvent?</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">\u201c \u2018Answer: Yes.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">\u201cThere is evidence to support the findings of the jury, and we adopt their answers as findings of fact. We further conclude that the bank was insolvent on April 13, 1926.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-12\">\u201cThe court entered judgment in favor of the plaintiff, decreeing that the claims in suit be classified and paid as general unsecured and \u2022 non-interest-bearing claims out of the Depositors\u2019 Guaranty Fund of the state, \u2018less a deduction of 26.817% previously paid by the Banking Commissioner of the State of Texas\u2019 (meaning out of the general assets of the bank in the course of liquidation).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-13\">\u201cQuestion 1. In the circumstances stated above, did the First State Bank legally effect a change from the Guaranty Fund plan to the Bond Security system of securing its depositors, and thereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>release the Depositors\u2019 Guaranty Fund from the payment of the unsecured and non-interest-bearing deposits of the First State Bank?</p>\n<p id=\"b63-3\">\u201cQuestion 2. In order to effect a change from the Guaranty Fund plan to the Bond Security system was it legally necessary that the First State Bank make publication in a newspaper published in the town where the bank was domiciled, of intention to effect such change? There was no such publication made. The question involves the determination of whether or not Article 502, Revised Civil Statutes, has application to a change in the plan of securing depositors.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">\u201cQuestion 3. Can the reduction of the capital stock of the First State Bank from $150,000.00 to $100,000.00 be regarded in this case as having been legally authorized to be made, and as becoming legally effective against creditors and depositors, there having been no publication made nor notice given of the intention so to do as required by Article 500, Revised Civil Statutes, and the bank at the time being insolvent? If such reduction of the capital stock was not legally authorized and did not become legally effective, then in this case the bank did not comply with Article 475, Revised Civil Statutes, and file with the Banking Commissioner of Texas \u2018guaranty of indemnity in an amount equal to its capital stock.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"AqW\">\u201cQuestion 4. The First State Bank made deposit of $100,000.00 in United States Bonds only, and did not file either a bond or a policy of insurance with the banking commissioner. Under Article 475, Revised Civil Statutes, was the deposit of United States Bonds allowable to be made by the bank under the Bond Security system as the kind of security inuring to the benefit of depositors?</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">\u201cQuestion 5. In the circumstances of the case as afore set out, did the deposit of the $100,000.00 in United States bonds with the Banking Commissioner legally operate to release the Depositors\u2019 Guaranty Fund from payment of the unsecured and non-interest-bearing deposits of the First State Bank ?</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">\u201cQuestion 6. Were the plaintiff and his assignors concluded from seeking a decree directing that the balance of their claims be classified and made payable out of the Depositors\u2019 Guaranty Fund after having received at the hands of the Banking Commissioner, in the course of liquidation, the partial payment arising out of the United States Bonds that had been deposited with him?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ao\">We have reached the conclusion that an affirmative answer must be given to the final question propounded by the Court of Civil Appeals. This being decisive of the case, renders unnecessary an answer to the other questions submitted.'</p>\n<p id=\"b64-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>It appears the bank involved, prior to its failure, had attempted to comply with the statutes of this state authorizing a bank operating under the guaranty fund plan to change to the bond security system. For the purpose of securing its depositors under such system it deposited with the banking commissioner $100,000.00 in United States government bonds, which securities were duly approved by the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-3\">Later when the bank was placed in the hands of the Banking Commissioner for liquidation, that official proceeded to\u2018 liquidate the same as a bond security bank. The government securities deposited with him by said bank were sold, and appellees, as its depositors, were accorded preferential payment from these proceeds upon the assumption by the Commissioner that there had been a valid change in the securing of such depositors from the guaranty fund plan to the bond security system. At the time of the reception of such payments, appellees were duly notified that the sums paid them by the Banking Commissioner were the proceeds of securities deposited with him by the bank under the bond security system. Each of the appellees accepted such payments and made no protest whatever to the Commissioner against the bank being liquidated as a bond security bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">Appellees received a further dividend on their claims as creditors of the bank from its general assets and some two years afterwards .brought this suit in which they, for the first time, set up the claim that the effort on the part of the bank to- change from the guaranty fund plan to the bond security system was ineffective because of a failure to comply with the statutes regulating such change. They did not offer to return the amounts paid them from the sale of securities in liquidating the bank as a bond security bank, but sought to retain such payments and to recover the unpaid balance of their claims against the guaranty fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">It is shown that appellees received the same amount on their claims as they would have been entitled to had every step taken by the bank in changing from the guaranty fund plan to1 the bond security system been in strict compliance with the statute. Having thus obtained the full benefit of the bond security system, they should not be permitted to change their position and obtain the payment of the balance of their claims out of the guaranty fund upon the theory that the bank at the time of its failure was not legally operating under such system, but was in truth and in fact under the guaranty fund plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>It was never contemplated under the bank guaranty law that any depositor in a state bank should be permitted to have his deposit protected by both the bond security system and the guaranty fund plan. Banks were required by the plain terms of such law to choose one plan or the other. A bank, under the law, could not be a bond security bank and at the same time have its depositors protected under the guaranty fund plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-3\">To permit appellees to now avail themselves of the benefit of the guaranty fund would result in a serious loss to a fund in which the depositors of other failed banks have an interest. If this bank had been liquidated under the guaranty fund plan, such fund would have been entitled, after paying the claims of depositors, to share ratably with other creditors in the assets of the bank in order to reimburse itself for the amount paid out. It would be impossible for the guaranty fund to obtain such reimbursement after liquidation has been had upon the assumption that the bank was legally operating under the bond security system because the proceeds of the government bonds have been applied as preferential payments to appellees\u2019 claims. If such application had not been made the securities would have been a part of the general assets of the bank in which all of the bank\u2019s creditors, including the guaranty fund, would have been entitled to participate. The proceeds of such securities have been distributed to appellees to the complete exclusion of other creditors upon the hypothesis that the bank was a bond security bank and that the general creditors were not entitled to share therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">We think the facts disclose the presence of all the elements necessary to sustain the plea of estoppel interposed by the Commissioner of Banking, and the State Banking Board. Whether the Commissioner of Banking rightly or wrongly liquidated the bank under the bond security system is immaterial. Appellees voiced no protest against such liquidation, but on the contrary acquiesced therein, by accepting preferential payments from the securities placed with the Commissioner which they were only entitled to if the bank was in fact lawfully operating under the bond security system. By such conduct they affirmed the validity of the transfer attempted to be made by the bank from the guaranty fund plan to the bond security system. They cannot now change their base because to permit them to do so would cause a loss to the guaranty fund and general creditors of the bank which would not have been sustained had the bank originally been liquidated as a guaranty fund bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>Also, we think appellees are precluded from receiving payment of their claims as depositors from the guaranty fund because they have, with knowledge of all the facts, elected the remedy under which they would obtain payment of their claims. It is asserted in their behalf that there has been no election by them which forecloses their, right to pursue the guaranty fund for the reason that under the doctrine of election of remedies in order to constitute a valid election there must have been presented two inconsistent remedies, either of which they could have legally enforced. It is argued that in this case there could not have been two inconsistent legally enforceable remedies open to them, as the bank under the law must have been either a guaranty fund or a bond security bank. That if its change from the guaranty fund plan to the bond security system was illegal, then it remained a guaranty fund bank and they were therefor afforded no legally enforceable remedy by proceeding against it as a bond security bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-3\">While the doctrine is settled that the fruitless pursuit of a supposed but non-existent remedy does not constitute an election, (Bierce v. Hutchins, 205 U. S., 340, 51 L. Ed., 828; Poe v. Continental Oil &amp; Cotton Co., (Com. App.) 231 S. W., 717), appellees cannot invoke this well established rule, as their conduct effectually prevents them from asserting that they had no effective remedy against the bank under the bond security system. By proving their claims against the bank as a bond security bank and receiving payment thereon, they recognized the validity of the transfer made by the bank from the guaranty fund plan to the bond security system and waived their right to thereafter denounce such transfer as unlawful. In Re Jacob Berry &amp; Co., 174 Fed., 409, 98 C. C. A., 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">Appellees have been accorded all the relief they would have received if this bank had fully complied with all of the laws governing the change from one system of securing its depositors to another. If the change in systems had been in all things valid, the only advantage they would have had over other creditors of the bank would have been a preferential right to the proceeds of the sale of the securities deposited by the bank in its effort to comply with the bond security system. They have fully availed themselves of this privilege, hence they cannot change their position and assert that their remedy under the bond security system was either unavailable or ineffective. Whether legally available or not, they have received as full a benefit as if it were, hence they must be bound by their election to pursue the bank as a bond security bank and can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>not now assume the inconsistent position that their claims should be paid out of the guaranty fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">If this bank had not taken proper steps to change its plan of securing depositors from the guaranty fund plan to the bond security system, it was the duty of appellees when they were offered preferential payment out of the proceeds of the securities deposited as a bond security bank to decline to receive such payment, and demand that their claims be satisfied from the guaranty fund. Otherwise, they would be in the attitude of obtaining the benefits of the bond security system and also of the guaranty fund to the injury of that fund as well as depositors of other failed banks having substantial rights therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Under the circumstances, we conclude that appellees\u2019 acceptance of preferential payments from the sale of securities deposited by the bank in an effort to change its plan of securing depositors, with full knowledge that it was being accorded them upon the supposition that the bank had legally become a bond security bank, estops them from denying the validity of the bank\u2019s change in system of securing its depositors and was an election upon their part which effectually forecloses their right to demand further payment of their claims from the guaranty fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">We recommend that the sixth question be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">The opinion of the Commission of Appeals answering the certified questions is adopted and ordered certified.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\"><em>C. M. </em>Cureton, Chief Justice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
