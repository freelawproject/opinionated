ARTHUR KELSEY.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The circuit court in this case granted a special plea in bar dismissing, on statute of limitations grounds, a declaratory judgment action filed by Steven F. Tvardek and Marta P. Tvardek against their homeowners' association. Because the court erred in doing so, we reverse the dismissal order and the circuit court's ancillary award of attorney fees to the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2013, the Tvardeks filed a declaratory judgment complaint against their homeowners' association, Powhatan Village Homeowners Association, Inc. (the \"HOA\"). They challenged the validity of a 2008 amendment to the Powhatan Village Declaration of Protective Covenants and Restrictions (the \"2008 Amendment\") on the basis that it unlawfully deprived them of a preexisting right to rent their home, which they purchased in 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After the Tvardeks filed an amended complaint amplifying their claim, the HOA filed a special plea in bar asserting that the case should be dismissed as untimely under the one-year statute of limitations prescribed by Code \u00a7 55-515.1(E). The Tvardeks responded with a motion for partial summary judgment claiming that the statute of limitations was inapplicable because the 2008 Amendment never became \"effective\" under the Virginia Property Owners' Association Act, Code \u00a7 55-509\n   <em>\n    et seq. ,\n   </em>\n   and specifically pursuant to Code \u00a7 55-515.1(F), which is a prerequisite for the running of the one-year limitations period in Code \u00a7 55-515.1(E). Without taking evidence, the circuit court reviewed the pleadings, heard arguments of counsel, and entered an order granting the special plea in bar asserting the statute of limitations defense. The court later entered an order granting \"prevailing party\" attorney fees, in the amount of $12,237.50, to the HOA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Code \u00a7 55-515(A); J.A. at 219.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The debate over the statute of limitations turned on a single uncontested fact: the text of a certification attached to the 2008 Amendment, which was recorded in the land records of the clerk of the circuit court. The certification stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    CERTIFICATION REQUIRED BY VIRGINIA CODE \u00a7 55-515.1.F\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The undersigned President of the Association does hereby certify that this Amendment has been approved by a vote of two-thirds of the Class A votes in the Association, as evidenced by the results of the meeting at which the vote was taken, such evidence on file with the Association, as required by Section 9.2 of the Declaration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   EXECUTED on the date first written above by the duly authorized officer of the Association.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   POWHATAN VILLAGE\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION, INC., a Virginia Nonstock Corporation\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   By:\n   <em>\n    /s/Barbara G. Moody\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Barbara Moody, President\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   This certification was important because the one-year statute of limitations prescribed by Code \u00a7 55-515.1(E)only bars actions challenging the validity of amendments when the action is \"brought more than one year after the amendment is effective.\" The next subsection of the statute defines the events that make an amendment effective under the Act:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Agreement of the required majority of lot owners to any amendment of the declaration shall be evidenced by their execution of the amendment, or ratifications thereof, and the same\n   <em>\n    shall become effective\n   </em>\n   when a copy of the amendment is recorded together with a certification, signed by the principal officer of the association or by such other officer or officers as the declaration may specify, that the requisite majority of the lot owners signed the amendment or ratifications thereof.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Code \u00a7 55-515.1(F)(emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On appeal, the Tvardeks argue that the HOA filed a certification that did not comply with Code \u00a7 55-515.1(F), thus precluding the 2008 Amendment from becoming \"effective\" for purposes of triggering the one-year limitations period in Code \u00a7 55-515.1(E). The HOA disagrees, arguing that the limitations period should begin when the amendment is recorded and that, at any rate, the certification was sufficient to be \"effective\" under Code \u00a7 55-515.1(F). We agree with the Tvardeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"The common law of England was brought to Virginia by our ancestors\" in large part \"to settle the rights of property.\"\n   <em>\n    Briggs v.

In general terms, the Act permits the creation of a restrictive covenant running with the land and enforceable against subsequent owners of the parcels covered by the declaration, whether or not they consent, so long as the association follows the statutorily prescribed\n   procedures governing the association's declaration and amendments to it. Code \u00a7 55-515.1lays out a detailed process necessary for the effective adoption of an amendment to an association's declaration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The amendment must be agreed to \"by a two-thirds vote of the owners.\" Code \u00a7 55-515.1(D). Under subsection F, an amendment agreed to by a two-thirds vote \"shall become effective\" only \"when a copy of the amendment is recorded together with a certification\" signed by an authorized officer of the association. The certification must state \"that the requisite majority of the lot owners\n   <em>\n    signed\n   </em>\n   the amendment or ratifications thereof.\" Code \u00a7 55-515.1(F)(emphasis added). For statute of limitations purposes, subsection E closes the loop by providing that the one-year limitations period runs from the date the amendment becomes \"effective.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In this case, the certification stated only that the \"Amendment has been\n   <em>\n    approved\n   </em>\n   by a vote of two-thirds\" of the eligible members and that \"evidence on file\" with the HOA confirmed this fact. J.A. at 109 (emphasis added). The HOA contends that this language adequately satisfied the definition of \"effective\" used in Code \u00a7 55-515.1(F). The circuit court agreed, concluding that the text of the certification, while not technically compliant, was nonetheless sufficient to trigger the one-year limitations period under Code \u00a7 55-515.1(E). We cannot concur with the circuit court's interpretation of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Adhering closely to statutory texts, Virginia courts \"presume that the legislature chose, with care, the words it used when it enacted the relevant statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Zinone v.

It requires the certification to verify that the requisite majority \"signed the amendment or ratifications thereof.\" There is a difference between\n   <em>\n    adopting\n   </em>\n   an amendment and\n   <em>\n    signing\n   </em>\n   it or some written ratification of it. In theory, a requisite majority could simply make a show of hands at an association meeting and thereby adopt an amendment. Code \u00a7 55-515.1(F), however, demands the extra precaution of requiring that the members voting in favor of an amendment verify that vote with their signatures-no doubt to discourage quarrelsome disputes between neighbors about who voted for what and when.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defending the circuit court's interpretation, the HOA urges us to adopt a loose interpretative interplay between subsections E and F of Code \u00a7 55-515.1, an interpretation that would allow for differing meanings for the word \"effective\" used in both subsections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Under this view, for purposes of running the statute of limitations period, \"effective\" simply means the date of \"recordation\" because that is when \"all purchasers of lots were on notice of the amendment and treated it as if it was in effect.\" Appellee's Br. at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We reject this argument, as it takes us perilously close to rewriting the statute under the subtle \"guise of judicial interpretation.\"\n   <em>\n    Holly Hill Farm Corp. v.

The fact that a defective certification might be viewed by a title examiner as effective does not make it so. Nor would it warrant a binary interpretation of the same statutory word even if true.

Subsections E and F use exactly the same word and are in close company. No textual or contextual grounds support the conclusion that \"effective\" should have dissimilar meanings in these adjacent subsections of Code \u00a7 55-515.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The HOA next argues, in the alternative, that its certification actually did comply with the requirement that it certify \"that the requisite majority of the lot owners signed the amendment or ratifications thereof.\" Code \u00a7 55-515.1(F). This is because the certification's mention of \"evidence on file\" with the HOA \"evidenced\" the fact that two-thirds of the members \"approved\" the 2008 Amendment. J.A. at 109;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Appellee's Br. at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We reject this interpretation as well. The issue here is not whether the certification declared that the requisite majority\n   <em>\n    approved\n   </em>\n   the 2008 Amendment-but, rather, whether it certified that each member of that majority\n   <em>\n    signed\n   </em>\n   the amendment or ratifications of it. A bare reference to some unspecified \"evidence on file\" adds nothing to the analysis. J.A. 109. That evidence could be nothing more than minutes of the meeting, perhaps signed only by the association's secretary and by none of the majority voters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   This discussion of the statutory text returns us to our first observation. The Virginia Property Owners' Association Act authorizes the creation and enforcement of restrictive covenants against nonconsenting landowners in a manner unknown to the common law. The General Assembly, however, policed the imposition of these covenants with a host of strict procedural requirements-not the least of which is the plainly worded command that no recorded amendment shall be \"effective\" unless it is accompanied by a certification verifying that the requisite majority signed the amendment or a ratification of it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Code \u00a7 55-515.1(F). In effect, the General Assembly created something entirely new to the law (the right to form private associations having power over land use) while adding precautions to honor the common law's ancient antipathy toward restrictions on the free use of private property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Anticipating our interpretation of the statute, the HOA makes its last stand with an invocation of the anti-absurdity principle. Any interpretation requiring that certifications must \"strictly comply\" with Code \u00a7 55-515.1(F), the HOA argues, \"leads to absurd results\" and would violate the \"well recognized principle that the court should reject a literal construction of the words of a statute that leads to absurd results.\" Appellee's Br. at 5-6. We again disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In this context, the anti-absurdity limitation has a legal, not colloquial, meaning. Our fidelity to the statutory text does not permit us to weigh policy arguments for and against legislation, holding out the possibility that we would fashion an interpretation based upon avoiding policies that a litigant thinks to be absurd. We have no constitutional authority to judge whether a statute is \"unwise, improper, or inequitable,\"\n   <em>\n    Holly Hill Farm Corp.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2109318\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/241/425/#p431\">\n    241 Va. at 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=404%20S.E.2d%2048\">\n    404 S.E.2d at 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , because the legislature, not the judiciary, is the sole \"author of public policy,\"\n   <em>\n    Campbell v.

We merely presume that the legislature, whatever its policy rationale, did not intend the statute to collapse under the weight of its own words.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In this case, the HOA argues that a literal interpretation of Code \u00a7 55-515.1would permit a landowner an unlimited amount of time to challenge an amendment merely because the certificate fails to recite the \"magic words\" required by subsection F, Oral Argument Audio at 13:43 to 13:55, thus placing on the HOA \"the burden of maintaining records forever\" to refute a later possible challenge, Appellee's Br. at 7. Equally absurd, the HOA contends, is that the limitations period in subsection E would never run on an ineffectiveness challenge based upon a certification in violation of subsection F. Coupled with these arguments is the suggestion that innocent purchasers may have relied on the apparent effectiveness of a legally ineffective amendment and may not learn of the problem until years after the fact.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. These proffered absurdities are offered in support of the assertion by the HOA that the only \"logical interpretation\" is that the limitations period \"begins to run when it is expected that the members comply with the rule.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   We see nothing legally absurd in a literal interpretation of Code \u00a7 55-515.1(E)that begins to run the limitations period when the amendment becomes effective under Code \u00a7 55-515.1(F). That interpretation does not offend logic or render the statute inoperable. A challenge to the validity of an amendment, after all, can be asserted on grounds other than its failure to \"become effective\" under Code \u00a7 55-515.1(F). In such circumstances, the challenge could still be barred by the limitations period in Code \u00a7 55-515.1(E). Nor does a literal reading create an irreconcilable inconsistency in the statutory text. Just the opposite is true. A literal reading avoids the most basic of textual inconsistencies-the same word meaning two different things in the same statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In sum, we agree with the Tvardeks that: (i) the one-year limitations period in subsection E of Code \u00a7 55-515.1runs only from the date of an \"effective\" amendment; (ii) subsection F of that statute defines the requirements for an \"effective\" amendment; and (iii) one of those requirements, a proper certification, was not satisfied in this case. On this basis, we reverse the circuit court's order granting the HOA's special plea in bar and dismissing this case as untimely. It necessarily follows that the award of prevailing party attorney fees to the HOA must likewise be reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Reversed and remanded.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    First enacted in 1776, Code \u00a7 1-200provides that \"[t]he common law of England, insofar as it is not repugnant to the principles of the Bill of Rights and Constitution of this Commonwealth, shall continue in full force within the same, and be the rule of decision, except as altered by the General Assembly.\" As Justice Spratley explained, Virginia \"expressly provided that [English common law] shall 'be the rule of decision, except in those respects wherein it is or shall be altered by the General Assembly.'
