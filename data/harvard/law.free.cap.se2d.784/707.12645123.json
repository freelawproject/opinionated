The appellant also asks us to vacate an award of attorney's fees assessed by the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND AND MATERIAL PROCEEDINGS BELOW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Michael Luttrell (\"Luttrell\") and Samantha Cucco (\"Cucco\") were married on January 6, 1992. They later separated, and Cucco filed for divorce on October 5, 2007. Subsequently, they executed a \"Property, Custody, and Support Settlement Agreement\" (the \"PSA\"). The PSA was affirmed, ratified, and incorporated into the final decree of divorce granted by the Circuit Court of Fairfax County on November 6, 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Pursuant to the PSA, the divorce decree ordered Luttrell to pay monthly spousal support to Cucco for a term of eight years. However, the PSA provided further that the payments would terminate upon\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   the death of either party, the remarriage of the wife, or as a result of action by the Court taken pursuant to \u00a7 20-109 of 1950 Code of Virginia, as amended, relative to cohabitation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Also relevant to this appeal, the PSA contained a cost-shifting provision in the event of an enforcement action by one of the parties. That provision states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The parties agree that any reasonable expenses incurred by a party in the successful enforcement of any of the provisions of [the PSA], or in taking action as a result of the breach of [the PSA] by the other party, whether through litigation or other action necessary to compel compliance herewith, or to cure such breach, shall be borne by the defaulting party. Any such expenses incurred by a party in the successful defense to any such action shall be borne by the party seeking to enforce compliance. \"Reasonable Expenses\" as referenced herein shall include, but not be limited to, counsel fees, court costs, and expenses of travel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 10, 2014, Luttrell filed a motion for adjustment of spousal support in the Circuit Court of Fairfax County. In his motion, Luttrell alleged that Cucco was \"engaged to be married\" and had been \"cohabiting continuously\" with her fianc\u00e9e for at least a year. Pursuant to the PSA, Luttrell sought a court order terminating his spousal support obligation on the basis of Cucco's alleged cohabitation. Luttrell also requested an order directing Cucco to refund \"the equivalent of at least one year of Spousal Support payments.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At the hearing on Luttrell's motion, Cucco did not dispute the allegations. Rather, she contended that her relationship was with another woman, and therefore she was not \"cohabiting\" within the meaning of Code \u00a7 20-109(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The circuit court reasoned that the right to marry was distinct from the question of its authority to terminate spousal support pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-109(A). Citing the dissent in an unpublished opinion from the Court of Appeals, the circuit court concluded that only opposite-sex couples could cohabit for purposes of Code \u00a7 20-109(A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the court denied Luttrell's motion and awarded Cucco attorney's fees pursuant to the cost-shifting provision in the PSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Luttrell appealed to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the judgment of the circuit court in an unpublished opinion.\n   <em>\n    Luttrell v. Cucco,\n   </em>\n   Record No. 1768-14-4,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201782065\">\n    2015 WL 1782065\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2015 Va.App. LEXIS 135 (Apr. 21, 2015). As relevant to this appeal, the court began its analysis by looking to the history of Code \u00a7 20-109, noting that \"[b]efore 1997, Code \u00a7 20-109 permitted termination of spousal support only 'upon the death or remarriage of the spouse receiving support.' \" In 1997, the General Assembly amended Code \u00a7 20-109(A) to authorize termination of spousal support \"[u]pon order of the court based upon clear and convincing evidence that the spouse receiving support has been habitually cohabiting with another person in a relationship analogous to marriage for one year or more.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5, 2015 Va.App. LEXIS 135, at *13 (citing 1997 Acts ch. 241.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Court of Appeals interpreted this provision in light of two cases decided five years prior to its enactment. First, the court identified a statement from this Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Schweider v. Schweider,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2111989\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/243/245/#p248\">\n    243 Va. 245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 248,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=415%20S.E.2d%20135\">\n    415 S.E.2d 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 137 (1992), which noted that previous case law had defined \"cohabit\" to mean \"liv[ing] together in the same house as married persons live together, or in the manner of husband and wife.\" The court also cited\n   <em>\n    Frey v. Frey,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4404774\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/14/270/#p275\">\n    14 Va.App. 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 275,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=416%20S.E.2d%2040\">\n    416 S.E.2d 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 43 (1992), which had construed a property settlement agreement providing for the termination of spousal support upon the former wife's \"cohabitation, analogous to marriage, with another man.\" In that context, the court held that the phrase \"cohabitation, analogous to marriage\" meant \"a status in which a man and woman live together continuously, or with some permanency, mutually assuming duties and obligations normally attendant with a marital relationship.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=416%20S.E.2d%2040\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Reasoning that the General Assembly was aware of these cases when it amended Code \u00a7 20-109(A) in 1997, the Court of Appeals concluded that the legislature intended the phrase \"habitually cohabiting with another person in a relationship analogous to a marriage\" to mean \"a status in which a man and a woman live together continuously ... mutually assuming duties and obligations normally attendant with a marital relationship.\" Therefore, it affirmed the circuit court's order denying Luttrell's motion for an adjustment of spousal support. After reviewing the PSA's cost-shifting provision, the Court of Appeals also affirmed that portion of the circuit court's order awarding attorney's fees to Cucco.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A. Code \u00a7 20-109(A)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Under the terms of the PSA, Luttrell cannot terminate his spousal support obligation on grounds of \"cohabitation\" until a court takes action pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-109. Thus, the parties effectively incorporated the provisions of Code \u00a7 20-109 with respect to \"cohabitation\" into the PSA, and agreed to be bound by the same. Accordingly, whether Luttrell can terminate his spousal support obligation on grounds of \"cohabitation\" depends on whether Cucco's relationship with\n   another woman can constitute \"cohabitation\" for purposes of Code \u00a7 20-109(A). This presents a question of statutory interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We review questions of statutory interpretation de novo.\n   <em>\n    Eberhardt v. Fairfax Cnty. Emps. Ret.

As the Court of Appeals recognized, the 1997 amendments to Code \u00a7 20-109 occurred against a backdrop of case law interpreting property settlement agreements that provided for termination of spousal support under certain circumstances. In\n   <em>\n    Schweider,\n   </em>\n   the Court interpreted a provision in a property settlement agreement stating that the husband's spousal support obligation would terminate upon the \"wife's death or remarriage.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2111989\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/243/245/#p248\">\n    243 Va. at 246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=415%20S.E.2d%20135\">\n    415 S.E.2d at 136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Indeed, it\n   would produce the following untenable result: two identically-situated individuals with identical spousal support awards would receive opposite treatment if one cohabits in a same-sex relationship and the other cohabits in an opposite-sex relationship. The individual in the same-sex relationship would continue to receive support while the individual in the opposite-sex relationship would not. We cannot conclude that the General Assembly intended such a result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Accordingly, the Court of Appeals erred when it concluded that the General Assembly intended the phrase \"habitually cohabiting with another person in a relationship analogous to a marriage\" to refer only to opposite-sex relationships.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   B. Attorney's Fees\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The circuit court awarded Cucco attorney's fees pursuant to the PSA, which states that \"[a]ny [reasonable] expenses incurred by a party in the successful defense to any [enforcement] action shall be borne by the party seeking to enforce compliance.\" The Court of Appeals affirmed that award because Luttrell had filed a motion to adjust spousal support, which the court found was an attempt to enforce the PSA, and because it concluded that Cucco had prevailed on her defense to the motion. As we conclude that same-sex couples can cohabit for purposes of Code \u00a7 20-109(A), we find that Cucco has not prevailed on her defense to the motion at this time. Accordingly, we will vacate the circuit court's award of attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   III. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   For the reasons stated, we find that the Court of Appeals erred when it concluded that same-sex couples cannot \"cohabit\" for purposes of Code \u00a7 20-109(A). Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and vacate the award of attorney's fees. We remand the case to the Court of Appeals with direction to remand the case to the circuit court for an evidentiary hearing consistent with this opinion to determine whether Cucco cohabited with her fianc\u00e9e within the meaning of Code \u00a7 20-109(A), and for reconsideration of attorney's fees pursuant to the PSA at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Reversed, vacated and remanded.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    <em>\n     Brennan v.
