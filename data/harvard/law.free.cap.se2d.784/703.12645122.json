Relying upon\n   <em>\n    Warren v. Clinchfield Coal Corp.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1961609\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/166/524/\">\n    166 Va. 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=186%20S.E.%2020\">\n    186 S.E. 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1936), the circuit court held that the term \"minerals\" included the gas as a matter of law and sustained demurrers to Dye's original and amended complaints. On appeal, Dye argues that the circuit court erred because the term \"minerals\" was ambiguous and extrinsic evidence would have shown that the grantors in those deeds did not intend to convey the gas. Because we agree with the circuit court, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As alleged in her original complaint, Dye is a successor in title to property interests retained by the grantors in the disputed severance deeds, which are attached as exhibits to the complaint and incorporated therein by reference. In the 1886 deed, the grantor conveyed \"all the coal and minerals\" underlying a certain 289-acre tract located in Buchanan and Russell Counties. In the 1887 deed, the grantors conveyed \"all the coal &amp; other minerals\" underlying a certain 280-acre tract also located in those counties. It is further alleged that appellee Buckhorn Coal Co., LP (\"Buckhorn\"), as the successor in title to the property interests conveyed to the same grantee in each of those two deeds, owns \"the coal and certain minerals underlying the [two] tracts,\" and has \"purported[ly]\" leased \"certain oil and gas rights on the property, including the coal bed methane,\" to appellee CNX Gas Company, LLC (\"CNX\"). However, according to the complaint, Dye owns the gas underlying a portion of the two tracts, consisting of approximately 261 acres, which she acquired in 1961. This is based on her allegation that the term \"minerals\" as used in the severance deeds was not intended to \"sever or convey\" the gas. Dye thus requested a declaration by order of the circuit court to that effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Buckhorn and CNX filed demurrers to Dye's complaint. Citing\n   <em>\n    Warren,\n   </em>\n   they asserted that it has long been settled under Virginia law that a conveyance of all \"minerals,\" as set forth in the disputed severance deeds, includes the gas. Therefore, they argued, the complaint was deficient as a matter of law and should be dismissed. Dye argued in response that the deeds were ambiguous as to whether the conveyances of \"minerals\" included the gas, thus entitling her to present extrinsic evidence to prove that was not the grantors' intent when the deeds were executed, respectively, in 1886 and 1887.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The circuit court ruled as a matter of law that the severance deeds conveyed the gas, and sustained the demurrers. In a letter opinion, the circuit court reasoned that these mineral conveyances were materially indistinguishable from the mineral conveyance at\n   issue in\n   <em>\n    Warren,\n   </em>\n   where this Court held that a conveyance of \" 'all the coal and minerals of every description' \" in a severance deed for property in Russell County executed in 1887 included the \"petroleum, oil and gas [as] minerals.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1961609\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/166/524/\">\n    166 Va. at 525-527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=186%20S.E.%2020\">\n    186 S.E. at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Underlying the circuit court's ruling was its determination that the severance deeds in the present case, like the one in\n   <em>\n    Warren,\n   </em>\n   were unambiguous. That is, the court found nothing within the \" 'four corners' \" of the deeds \"to show 'a contrary meaning or less comprehensive meaning' \" of the term \" 'minerals' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Warren,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1961609\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/166/524/\">\n    166 Va. at 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=186%20S.E.%2020\">\n    186 S.E. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   22 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Dye subsequently filed an amended complaint after the circuit court granted her motion for leave to amend.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Buckhorn and CNX filed demurrers to the amended complaint, asserting the same grounds as they did when demurring to the original complaint. By final order, the circuit court sustained the demurrers for the reasons stated in its earlier letter opinion and dismissed the action. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The purpose of a demurrer is to determine whether a complaint states a cause of action upon which the requested relief may be granted.

For the reasons explained below, this rule applies equally here. Accordingly, we must decide whether, under\n   <em>\n    Warren,\n   </em>\n   the term \"minerals\" in the severance deeds unambiguously included the gas as a matter of law and we conclude that it did, as the circuit court ruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Warren,\n   </em>\n   this Court addressed as an issue of first impression in Virginia whether a conveyance of \"minerals\" in a severance deed included the petroleum, oil and gas.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1961609\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/166/524/\">\n    166 Va. at 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=186%20S.E.%2020\">\n    186 S.E. at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For the two respective tracts, the grantor in the 1886 deed conveyed \"all the coal and minerals\" and the grantors in the 1887 deed conveyed \"all the coal &amp; other minerals.\" The word \"all\" plainly modifies the word \"minerals\" as well as the word \"coal\" in both of these deeds. In this regard, we reject Dye's argument that these deeds are distinguishable from the one at issue in\n   <em>\n    Warren\n   </em>\n   because it used more \"expansive language\" by conveying \" 'all the coal and minerals\n   <em>\n    of every description.\n   </em>\n   ' \"\n   <em>\n    Warren,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1961609\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/166/524/\">\n    166 Va. at 526-28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=186%20S.E.%2020\">\n    186 S.E. at 21-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). There is nothing in\n   <em>\n    Warren,\n   </em>\n   nor in any other case that we have found applying the majority rule, to indicate that the words \" 'of every description' \" is anything more than mere surplusage as relates to the conveyance of the gas when the \"minerals\" are otherwise conveyed without limitation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Thus, the term \"minerals\" in the instant severance deeds effected conveyances of the\n   gas, absent some other language in the deeds indicating a different intent or creating sufficient ambiguity to permit the introduction of extrinsic evidence. We find no such language in the deeds, Dye's assertions of ambiguity notwithstanding. Dye points specifically to the language in the deeds addressing the \"mining\" rights provided to the grantees in conjunction with the conveyances of all the coal and other minerals; and to the absence of language relating specifically to equipment and mechanisms involved in the collect and transfer of gas. But both of these deeds generally grant to the grantees the right to enter upon, over and under the subject lands for the \"purpose of mining and removing\" all of the coal and other minerals conveyed therein. In this regard, as with their mineral conveyancing language, these deeds are materially indistinguishable from the deed in\n   <em>\n    Warren,\n   </em>\n   which provided that the conveyance of all the coal and other minerals \"included the right to enter upon the land conveyed 'for the purpose of digging, mining or otherwise securing the coal and other things on said tracts of land ... and removing same from off said lands.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1961609\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/166/524/\">\n    166 Va. at 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=186%20S.E.%2020\">\n    186 S.E. at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
