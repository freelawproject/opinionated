As a member of the support staff, Bartow was included in a bargaining unit which was exclusively represented by the Hocking Technical College Education Association OEA/NEA (\u201cthe union\u201d). From 1993 to 1996, support staff personnel were protected by, and subject to, a collective bargaining agreement (\u201cCBA\u201d) negotiated by their union with the college.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">In Article II of the CBA, the college reserved the right to suspend, discipline, demote or discharge all covered employees for \u201cjust cause.\u201d Moreover, Article XIII of the agreement expressly provided that \u201c[ejmployees shall be disciplined or discharged for just cause only.\u201d Finally, paragraph four of Article XII, regarding attendance and tardiness, states that \u201c[a]ny employee accumulating * * * seven unexcused absences in any consecutive 365 calendar day period will be subject to discharge for just cause.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Article IV of the CBA provided a four-step procedure for resolving grievances. A \u201cgrievance\u201d is defined by the agreement as \u201ca claim that there has been a violation, misinterpretation or misapplication of any provision of this Agreement.\u201d The final step of the procedure permitted an employee to request that the grievance be resolved through arbitration. The agreement expressly provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to add to, subtract from, modify, change or alter any of the CBA\u2019s provisions. Finally, the agreement made the arbitrator\u2019s decision final and binding on the college, the union and the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">Throughout the proceedings up to and including arbitration, the college had advanced three distinct reasons justifying its discharge of Bartow: insubordination, falsification of time records, and excessive unexcused absences. In vacating the arbitrator\u2019s award, however, the trial court narrowed its focus solely to the issue regarding Bartow\u2019s allegedly excessive unexcused absences. The evidence' in the record relevant to that single issue reveals the following facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">First, based upon timesheets personally maintained by Bartow, she was tardy twenty-one times from September 21, 1993 to April 8, 1994. Second, based upon the personal observations of Bartow\u2019s immediate supervisor during this same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>time period, he documented eight instances of tardiness in addition to the twenty-one occasions noted by Bartow. And, third, also during the same period of time, Bartow was totally absent from work without excuse seven times.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">On April 8, 1994, the college notified Bartow of its intention to discharge her. As noted above, the college gave three reasons: insubordination, falsification of time records, and excessive unexcused absences. Bartow was suspended with pay pending a discharge hearing. Bartow and a union representative were present at a hearing in which the college presented documentation in support of its discharge of her. No information rebutting the college\u2019s charges was provided on Bartow\u2019s behalf. By letter dated April 26, 1994, the college immediately terminated Bartow\u2019s employment for the same three reasons given in the April 8, 1994 notification.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Subsequently, the union filed a formal grievance against the college, alleging that Bartow had been discharged in violation of the just-cause standard in Article XIII of the CBA. In response, the college denied the grievance, since it believed that no violation of the agreement had occurred in Bartow\u2019s discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">Following a hearing on the grievance, the arbitrator determined that the college\u2019s failure to provide Bartow with formal warnings that her various documented misdeeds would subject her to possible termination \u201crequires a finding that no just cause existed for Grievant\u2019s discharge.\u201d The arbitrator also expressed concern that the college had not formally tallied or computed Bartow\u2019s absences and tardiness prior to notifying her of the reasons for its decision to dismiss her. As a result, the arbitrator ordered the college to reinstate Bartow to her former or a comparable position with full back pay, vacation and holidays for the 1993-1994 and 1995-1996 academic years. However, due to his reservations about Bartow\u2019s \u201chabitual tardiness\u201d and \u201cher failure to acknowledge deadlines or follow instructions,\u201d the arbitrator did not award her back pay and benefits for the 1994-1995 academic year.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">Pursuant to R.C. 2711.10, the college filed a motion with the Athens County Court of Common Pleas to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The college argued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>that the arbitrator exceeded his powers and acted outside the scope of the CBA by interpreting the agreement so as to add to, subtract from, or modify the college\u2019s obligations. In response, the union and Bartow filed a separate action with the common pleas court, pursuant to R.C. 2711.09, to confirm the arbitrator\u2019s award.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The common pleas court granted the college\u2019s motion to consolidate these two actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">After examining the parties\u2019 briefs, the common pleas court granted the college\u2019s motion to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award and denied the union and Bartow\u2019s motion to confirm it. The court ruled that the arbitrator\u2019s award, failing to find just cause for Bartow\u2019s discharge, was arbitrary and capricious due to the imposition upon the college of procedures not incorporated in the parties\u2019 agreement. Furthermore, the arbitrator\u2019s finding of no just cause, despite Bartow\u2019s unexcused absences in excess of those permitted by Article XII of the agreement, improperly added to or modified the parties\u2019 obligations. The union and Bartow filed this appeal from the court\u2019s judgment vacating the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">At the outset, we recognize the strong public policy in Ohio favoring the arbitration of public sector labor disputes. <em>Hillsboro v. Fraternal Order of Police, Ohio Labor Council, Inc. </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 174, 177-178, 556 N.E.2d 1186, 1189-1191; <em>Mahoning Cty. Bd. of Mental Retardation v. Mahoning Cty. TMR Edn. Assn. </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 80, 83-84, 22 OBR 95, 97-99, 488 N.E.2d 872, 874-876. An arbitrator\u2019s power, however, is limited by certain statutory constraints. See R.C. 2711.10 and 2711.11. For example, an arbitration award will be vacated if the arbitrator exceeds his powers in making the award. R.C. 2711.10(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">-An arbitrator acts within his powers so long as the award \u201cdraws its essence\u201d from the applicable collective bargaining agreement. <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Local Union No. 200 </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 516, 71 O.O.2d 509, 330 N.E.2d 703, paragraph one of the syllabus. The award draws its essence from the agreement when there is a rational nexus between the agreement and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>award and it is not arbitrary, capricious or unlawful. <em>Findlay City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Findlay Edn. Assn. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 129, 551 N.E.2d 186, paragraph two of the syllabus; <em>Mahoning Cty. Bd. of Mental Retardation, supra, </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus. Conversely, an award departs from the essence of the collective bargaining agreement when the award conflicts with the express terms of the agreement. <em>Ohio Office of Collective Bargaining v. Ohio Civ. Serv. Employees Assn., Local 11, AFSCME, AFL-CIO </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 177, 572 N.E.2d 71, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">In this appeal, the union and Bartow argue that the arbitrator\u2019s award reinstating Bartow due to the absence of just cause for her discharge draws its essence from the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement. They also contend that the common pleas court has inappropriately substituted its judgment for that of the arbitrator. On the other hand, the college submits that the court properly vacated the arbitrator\u2019s award because he exceeded his powers. That is,- the arbitrator\u2019s determination that there was no just cause simply because the college failed to issue more formal warnings to Bartow imposed an additional requirement upon the college which the union had not secured in the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"A-K\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">The central issue in this case involves the application of Article XII, paragraph four, of the collective bargaining agreement. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-8\"><em>\u201cAny employee accumulating </em>five (5) unexcused absences in any consecutive sixty (60) calendar day period, or <em>seven (7) unexcused absences in any consecutive 865 calendar day period will be subject to discharge for just cause.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">The parties\u2019 arguments regarding this provision are easily summarized. On one hand, the union and Bartow contend that this paragraph permits the college to discharge an employee who has exceeded the prescribed number of unexcused absences only if the college, otherwise, has just cause to discipline the employee. That is, the language \u201cwill be subject to discharge for just cause\u201d allegedly requires a two-step analysis in order to determine whether an employee was properly discharged under this paragraph: First, did the employee exceed the number of unexcused absences, and if so, second, did the college have just cause to discipline the employee? The arbitrator applied this analysis in his award.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">On the other hand, the college submits that this paragraph simply provides that an employee's accumulation of an objective number of unexcused absences \u25a0within a specific time period equals just cause for discharge. The college argues for a one-step analysis in order to determine whether it properly discharged an employee under this paragraph: Did the employee exceed the number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>unexcused absences within the applicable time period? If so, the college has just cause to discharge that employee? The common pleas court applied this analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Thus, 'the determinative issue in this case is simply whether or not Article XII(4) is reasonably subject to different interpretations. If it is, the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the contract must govern. <em>Hillsboro, supra. </em>On the other hand, if the contract is not ambiguous and can only reasonably be construed to mean in essence that seven unexcused absences constitutes \u201cjust cause\u201d <em>per se, </em>the trial court\u2019s judgment is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">After considering the CBA, the arbitrator\u2019s award and the judgment of the common pleas court, we hold that the court properly vacated the award, since the arbitrator exceeded his powers. Although we acknowledge the public policy favoring arbitration, we agree with the common pleas court\u2019s determination that the award departs from the essence of the CBA. Our independent and <em>de novo </em>examination of the record reveals that the award clearly conflicts with the express terms of the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">A similar issue was presented to the Supreme Court of Ohio in <em>Ohio Office of Collective Bargaining v. Ohio Civ. Serv. Employees Assn., Local 11, AFSCME, AFL-CIO, supra. </em>The case involved the termination of an aide employed by a facility for mentally retarded individuals. After being discharged for allegedly verbally and physically abusing a resident of the facility, the aide took the dispute to arbitration. Although the arbitrator awarded reinstatement to the aide, the common pleas court vacated the award and the appellate court upheld the common pleas court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">At issue in that case was the following disciplinary provision in the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-10\">\u201cDisciplinary action shall not be imposed upon an employee except for just cause. * * * In cases involving termination, if the arbitrator finds that there has been an abuse of a patient * * *, the arbitrator does not have authority to modify the termination of an employee committing such abuse.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">The arbitrator in the case conducted a bifurcated hearing on the employee\u2019s grievance. In the first phase, the arbitrator defined the term \u201cabuse.\u201d As a result of the second phase, the arbitrator determined that the employee had \u201cabused\u201d a resident of the facility. Despite his factual finding of \u201cabuse,\u201d though, the arbitrator nevertheless reinstated the employee to her former position. The arbitrator reasoned that the employer violated the notion of fair treatment, as implied in the just-cause provision cited above, by neglecting to inform the employee of the possible form of discipline. <em>Id., </em>59 Ohio St.3d at 182, 572 N.E.2d at 75-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>The Supreme Court reviewed this provision and held that the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation violated the clear and unambiguous terms expressed in the parties\u2019 agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 183, 572 N.E.2d at 76-77. The court noted that the award imposed an additional requirement upon the employer in order to discharge its employee for abusing a resident <em>(i.e., </em>fair treatment) which was not expressly provided for in the agreement. <em>Id. </em>Specifically, the court held that a just-cause analysis was not required in the case because \u201cabuse is <em>per se </em>just cause\u201d pursuant to the explicit terms of the agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 184, 572 N.E.2d at 77-78. Only if the arbitrator had found that the employee\u2019s actions amounted to something less than \u201cabuse\u201d would a just-cause analysis be necessary under the agreement. <em>Id. </em>The court concluded that the arbitrator, in effect, improperly created his own contract rather than apply the contract agreed to by the parties. <em>Id. </em>at 183, 572 N.E.2d at 76-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">This court is presently faced with circumstances analogous to those in <em>Ohio Office of Collective Bargaining. </em>That is, the agreement in this case simply provides that \u201c[a]ny employee accumulating * * * seven unexcused absences in any consecutive 365 calendar day period will be subject to discharge for just cause.\u201d The arbitrator here found, as a fact, that Bartow \u201cwas absent on numerous occasions and <em>sufficient in number to cause her discharge under the provisions of the Collective Bargaining </em>Agreement.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Despite this finding, though, the arbitrator determined that the provision required the college to notify Bartow that her- conduct subjected her to possible discharge and that in the absence of such notice, the college did not possess just cause to discharge her.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Like the Supreme Court above, we hold that the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of this CBA violated the clear and unambiguous terms expressed in the agreement. The award imposed an additional requirement upon the college in order to discharge Bartow for her excessive unexcused absences <em>(i.e., </em>notice of possible discipline) which was not expressly provided for in the agreement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Similar to the Supreme Court in <em>Ohio Office of Collective Bargaining, </em>we believe that a just-cause analysis is unnecessary in this case because excessive unexcused absence is <em>per se </em>just cause pursuant to the express terms of this agreement. In other words, the terms of the CBA are not ambiguous and thus not reasonably subject to different interpretations. Accordingly, no deference is due the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the agreement. Only if the arbitrator had found that Bartow had less than the prescribed number of unexcused absences would a just-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>cause analysis be required under this agreement. To interpret Article XII(4) to require the specified number of absences and instances of tardiness plus just cause before taking disciplinary action would render that paragraph either meaningless or redundant.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Our decision in this matter is further supported by the holding in <em>Fraternal Order of Police, Ohio Labor Council v. Mahoning Cty. Sheriff\u2019s Dept. </em>(Mar. 22, 1995), Mahoning App. No. 94 C.A. 81, unreported, 1995 WL 138903:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-6\">\u201cWhere the collective bargaining agreement contains a provision that certain conduct will result in a specific discipline, an arbitrator must affirm that discipline once it has been determined that the violation occurred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">In this case, the relevant provision in the agreement provides that any employee who accumulates seven unexcused absences in a three-hundred-sixty-five-day period is subject to discharge for just cause. Since the express terms of this agreement clearly prescribe that a specific disciplinary action can result from the performance of certain conduct, the only proper review for the arbitrator to perform is to determine whether the prohibited conduct occurred. Once that issue has been resolved, the arbitrator must affirm the particular disciplinary action chosen by the employer. Because the arbitrator in this case determined that Bartow was absent without excuse for a number of times sufficient to trigger her discharge for just cause under the parties\u2019 agreement, the college\u2019s discharge of her should have been upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">We also agree with the trial court\u2019s implicit finding that the arbitrator\u2019s concern over the timing of a formal computation of absences does not control the outcome of this case. The college was steadfast in its grounds for dismissal. While failure to formally tally the exact number of absences might conceivably have created a burden-of-proof problem ultimately, it could not affect either the potential ambiguity of the CBA or the choice of grounds for disciplinary action consistently expressed by the college.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">In conclusion, since the arbitrator in this case essentially created his own contract rather than apply the contract agreed to by the college and the union, he has clearly exceeded his power in violation of R.C. 2711.10(D). Due to the inherent conflict between the arbitrator\u2019s award and the express terms of the\u2019 parties\u2019 agreement, the award does not draw its essence from the agreement. <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>and <em>Ohio Office of Collective Bargaining, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Athens County Court of Common Pleas vacating the arbitrator\u2019s award is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b195-12\">Stephenson, P.J., and Kline, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b189-10\">.
