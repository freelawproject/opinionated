Bryant, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">This appeal is taken by defendant-appellant Gary Risner from a jury verdict in the Court of Common Pleas of Crawford County finding him guilty of nonsupport under R.C. 2919.21.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">On September 9, 1996, Risner was indicted for nonsupport in violation of R.C. 2919.21(A)(2). The indictment claimed that Risner had failed to provide support for more than twenty-six weeks out of one hundred four consecutive weeks, thus charging Risner with a felony of the fourth degree. On October 21, 1996, Risner pled not guilty to the charge. A jury trial was held on March 6 and March 7, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">Before the trial, Risner requested jury instructions on the affirmative defense set forth in R.C. 2929.21(C). The trial court refused to give the instruction and would not allow Risner to introduce evidence concerning his alleged inability to pay. The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and Risner was sentenced to prison for one year. It is from this judgment that Risner appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">Risner claims the following assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-12\">\u201cRisner\u2019s fourteenth amendment right to due process of law was violated when the trial court refused to allow him to present any evidence during his jury trial concerning the statutory affirmative defense of paying support within one\u2019s ability and means as stated at R.C. 2919.21(C).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-13\">\u201cRisner\u2019s fourteenth amendment right to due process of law was violated when the trial court refused to give any jury instructions concerning the statutory affirmative defense of paying support within one\u2019s ability and means as stated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-14\">We find Risner\u2019s claims to be well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-15\">R.C. 2919.21 stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-16\">\u201c(A) No person shall abandon, or fail to provide adequate support to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-17\">* :f:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>\u201c(2) His or her legitimate or illegitimate child who is under age eighteen, or mentally or physically handicapped child who is under age twenty-one[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-5\">\u201c(C) It is an affirmative defense to a charge under division (A) of this section of failure to provide adequate support that the accused was unable to provide adequate support, but did provide such support as was within his ability and means.\u201d 141 Ohio Laws, Part I, 361-362.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Here, the trial court denied to Risner the opportunity to introduce evidence of the statutory affirmative defense recognized by R.C. 2919.21(C). Specifically, the transcript of the pretrial conference reveals the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-7\">\u201c[The Court]: Now, what you\u2019re asking this Court to do at this point, Mr. Widman, is to say that, even though Mr. Risner filled out an application under'the guidelines to have his child support adjusted, that that means nothing, nothing now, two years later, when he\u2019s facing a criminal charge. If it was good enough in \u201992 when he started it, when he voluntarily did it, then it\u2019s good enough now. I\u2019m not going to change those guidelines. I can\u2019t change those guidelines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-8\">\u201cBut I will not permit a situation, somebody voluntarily sets up a program at his own instance and then says, Well, I don\u2019t have to abide by that, because I was not \u2014 I was unable to do this.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-9\">\u201cThat isn\u2019t what the law of Ohio says. That isn\u2019t what the guidelines say. And I\u2019m not going to let an affirmative defense that permits that or suggests that to come into this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-10\">\u201cAny \u2014 there will be no affirmative defense regarding his ability to pay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-11\">\u201cThe Court: I am not going to permit any testimony with respect to his inability to pay when he clearly indicated to the Court that he was able to pay X number of dollars back in \u201992.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-12\">* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-13\">\u201cMr. Widman: Okay. It\u2019s my understanding that you will not give the instruction to the jury after this trial on the affirmative\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-14\">\u201cThe Court: No. I said that how many times now?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-15\">During the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief, the trial court further expounded on its decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-16\">\u201c[The Court]: The affirmative defense is not available when we are dealing with an order that comes under the Child Support Enforcement Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-17\">\u201cAnd I\u2019m not going to rule \u2014 I am not going to permit any further discussion of ability and means. The ability and means have been determined, and that\u2019s by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>the guidelines. And the guidelines, after they were applied from information furnished by the Defendant, that took care of that issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-5\">\u201cYou have exceptions, but I am not going to have any more on ability and means.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-6\">\u00cd\u00cd* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-7\">\u201cMr. Widman: You Honor, I would simply object to your ruling and ask\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-8\">\u201cThe Court: You heard it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-9\">\u201cMr. Widman: \u2014 I would ask the Court if it\u2019s the Court\u2019s opinion that the affirmative defense \u2014 I\u2019d like the Court to be a little bit more clear. Is it the Court\u2019s opinion that the affirmative defense spelled out in Subsection (C) does not apply to a violation charged under Subsection (A)(2)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-10\">\u201cThe Court: With respect to failure \u2014 abandon or failure to provide adequate support to the child \u2014 person\u2019s child who is under the age of 18.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-11\">\u201cMr. Widman: Okay. So it\u2019s the Court\u2019s opinion that the affirmative defense spelled out in Subsection (C) will not apply in any child support situation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-12\">\u201cThe Court: That\u2019s right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-13\">We find the trial court\u2019s ruling to be an error of law. The statute specifically provides that paying to one\u2019s ability and means is an affirmative defense to a crime under Subsection (A). The statute does not exclude child support. \u201cThe defendant in [a nonsupport] proceeding is presumed to have the ability to support the child unless he raises his inability as an affirmative defense.\u201d <em>State v. Schaub </em>(1984), 16 Ohio App.3d 317, 319, 16 OBR 348, 350-351, 475 N.E.2d 1313, 1316. Thus, the trial court erred by denying Risner\u2019s opportunity to present evidence of this defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-14\">Risner had the burden of proving the affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence. R.C. 2901.05. Whether an affirmative defense is proven is an issue of fact for the jury. The trial court was required to allow Risner to present his evidence and then, if sufficient to permit reasonable minds to find it to be established, submit the issue to the jury with proper instructions. Therefore, Risner\u2019s assignments of error are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-15\">The judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Crawford County is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in compliance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-16\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b606-17\">Shaw and Hadley, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
