In 1950 he made application for a writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>based on a contention that <em>R. 8. </em>3:103-7, as amended by <em>L. </em>1940, c. 319, \u00a7 1 (the \u201cHabitual Criminal\u201d statute), under which he was sentenced, is unconstitutional because it violates the due process clause and the equal protection of the law provision of the 14th Amendment to the Federal Constitution; the Mercer County Court denied the application, and we affirmed. <em>State v. </em>Payne, 17 <em>N. J. Super. </em>561 <em>(App. Div. </em>1951). On that appeal Payne, for'the first time, advanced the contention that the sentence imposed upon him was illegal because the maximum legal sentence which could be imposed for the crime for which he was convicted was 14 years. Following a suggestion made by us, Payne made an application to the trial court, under <em>Rule </em>3:7\u201413, for the correction of his sentence on the ground that it was illegal. On December 31, 1951, the trial court ordered the sentence theretofore imposed upon this defendant corrected to provide : \u201cthe defendant be imprisoned in the State Prison of this State for a minimum term of twelve years and a maximum term of fourteen years * * *; this sentence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>commence as of May 12, 1948, the date defendant was originally sentenced.\u201d In spite of the fact that it is conceded, as it must be, that the sentence as corrected on December 21, 1951 is a legal sentence for the crime for which the defendant was indicted, tried and convicted, the defendant made another application to the trial court \u201cfor correction and reduction of sentence.\u201d The trial court denied this application on May 1, 1952, and the defendant appeals from this denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The entire argument now advanced by the defendant is based on the premise that he never was sentenced at any time for the crime for which he was indicted, tried and convicted. The premise is false. Because the original sentence imposed was for a maximum term of 24 years, and such a maximum term would have been a legal sentence for the crime of assault with intent to commit rape <em>(B. S. </em>2:110-2), the defendant now argues that the trial court, on May 12, 1948, \u201capparently\u201d sentenced him for that crime rather than the crime for which he was convicted. Aside from the fact that there is nothing in the record to support the fact relied on, the transcript of the minutes of the Essex County Court of Quarter Sessions (included in the defendant\u2019s appendix) sets forth that the sentence imposed on May 12, 1948 was for the crime for which he had been convicted; namely, breaking and entering with intent to commit rape. <em>Cf. State v. Noel, </em>102 <em>N. J. L. </em>659 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1926); <em>Wasserman v. State, </em>103 <em>N. J. L. </em>128 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1926). Further, when the defendant made his first application to the tria] court for the correction of sentence, he represented that the sentence imposed on May 12, 1948, was for the crime of breaking and entering with intent to commit rape; and the trial court acted thereon in reducing the maximum sentence from 24 years to 14 years in order to bring the maximum sentence imposed within the legal limits permitted for the - crime for which he was actually convicted and sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
