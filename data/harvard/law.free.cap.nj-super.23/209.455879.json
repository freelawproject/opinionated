J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"APf\">The determinative question is whether the Essex County Court erred in denying the petitioner, in <em>habeas corpus </em>proceedings, the right to offer testimony to establish the motives and <em>animus </em>of the complaining witnesses whoso testimony allegedly resulted in the criminal indictments returned against him in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Cohen was indicted by the grand jury of Suffolk County, Massachusetts, for the alleged larceny of $3,100 from one Howard Eveleth and for obtaining by false pretense certain moneys of one Alfred J. Tomasi. The Governor of Massachusetts forwarded a requisition with accompanying papers to the Governor of New Jersey on March 11, 1953, requesting Cohen\u2019s arrest and return as a fugitive from justice. The requisition was honored by the Governor of New Jersey on March 19, 1953; a warrant of rendition was issued and duly executed on March 38. 1953. On the latter date the Honorable W. Stanlej- Naughright, Judge of the Essex County Court, allowed a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>to test the validity of the extradition. At the hearings there was no dispute as to the question of the petitioner\u2019s identity, or that the charges in the indictments were crimes under the law of Massachusetts, or that petitioner was present in the demanding state on or about the times alleged in the indictments. The only question raised by Cohen before Judge Naughright, and the only question raised here is whether the court erroneously rejected certain evidence tending to show that the bases for the indictments were of a civil nature and that the purpose of the extradition was to secure Cohen\u2019s presence in Massachusetts to obtain service of civil process upon him and enforce the civil claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">So far as the courts of New Jersey are concerned, the case is one of first impression. As we shall demonstrate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>there are numerous decisions in this State and other states which establish the rule that in <em>habeas corpus </em>proceedings such as that under review here, the court may1' not take testimony as to the merits of the prisoner\u2019s defense to the charges or' as to his guilt or innocence. However, an examination of the New Jersey cases does not reveal any decision that directly meets the specific issue raised here.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">We think it will be interesting and informative to state the prevailing rule in New Jersey and other jurisdictions ,with respect to the scope of the inquiry that may be made at a <em>habeas corpus </em>hearing in extradition cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">The return of fugitives from one state to another is a federal and not a state matter, governed by the Constitution of the United States and the act of Congress passed pursuant thereto. <em>U.

There is no obligation upon the Governor, upon whom requisition is made for a fugitive from justice, to hear the accused before ordering his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>removal, and the person demanded has no constitutional right to be heard before the Governor. <em>Munsey v.

The Governor may properly exercise a discretion in determining whether a case contemplated by the Constitution and the laws of the United States has been presented for his action. He cannot be interfered with in the exercise of this discretion should he decide that no such crime is charged. 22 <em>Am. Jur., Extradilion, sec. </em>34, <em>pp. </em>272, 273. There is apparently no authority whereby one may compel the Governor to issue his warrant if he refuses to do so. <em>Drew v. Thaw, </em>235 <em>U. S. </em>432, 35 <em>S. Ct. </em>137, 138, 59 <em>L.

The guilt or innocence of the accused may not be inquired into by the Governor \u201cor in any proceeding after the demand for extradition, accompanied by a charge of crime in legal form as above provided, shall have been presented to the Governor, except as it may be involved in identifying the person held as the person charged with the crime.\u201d <em>R. 8. </em>2:185-28 (now <em>R.

Super. </em>557, 58 <em>A. 2d </em>842, 844 (1948), where the State of Ohio was seeking the return of the accused on a charge that he had escaped from confinement under a sentence imposed in that state, it was held that in the <em>habeas corpus </em>proceeding, the trial court erred by inquiring into the merits of the case when the prisoner was permitted to testify that he had been a law-abiding citizen since his escape and that he had been threatened with violence in denial of a fair and impartial trial in the demanding state, citing <em>Commonwealth v. Supt. of Philadelphia County Prison, </em>220 <em>Pa. </em>401, 69 <em>A. </em>916, 917, 21 <em>L. R. A. N. S. </em>939 <em>(Sup.

If the court on <em>habeas corpus </em>inquires into the merits of the charge against the prisoner, or into the motives which inspired the prosecution in the demanding state, it exceeds its authority under the constitutional and statutory provisions regulating the extradition of criminals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-5\"><em>Cf.

The reason for the issuance of a warrant of extradition is not a proper subject of judicial inquiry. <em>Ex parte Wallace, supra. </em>The courts of the state of asylum have no authority in <em>habeas corpus </em>proceedings to consider the question of the present sanity or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>insanity of an alleged fugitive from justice, but that must be determined by tlie law and courts of the demanding state. <em>State ex rel.

Nor may the court in the asylum state inquire into the validity and the merits of proceedings in the parole board in tin; demanding state and thereby decide upon the propriety of its action. <em>In re Trignani, </em>13 <em>N.

Nor may the court inquire; as to the motive of the accused which induced him to depart from the demanding slate where he was accused of having successfully conspired to effect his escape from a state hospital for insane criminals. <em>Brew v. Thaw, supra. </em>Any investigation as to the motives which induced the action taken by the Governors of the demanding and asylum states would be improper and irrelevant. Pet<em>tibone v.

Our examination of the New Jersey cases convinces us that our courts in dealing with the question of what evidence may be admissible on a <em>habeas corpus </em>proceeding in an extradition case, clearly hold that it is strictly limited to the questions of the validity of the extra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>dition proceedings, the identity of the accused as being the person named in the requisition and rendition and 'whether he is a fugitive from justice from the demanding state. <em>La Sasso v. MacLeod, </em>136 <em>N. J. L. </em>345, 351 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1948). The courts of the asylum state have no right to consider the merits of his trial, the question of his guilt or' innocence or whether his constitutional rights were violated in the proceedings leading to his conviction. <em>State v. Wilson, supra, </em>and cases cited therein. The general rule throughout the several jurisdictions of the United States is that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-4\">\u201cThe courts, on <em>habeas corpus, </em>will not inquire into the motives which induced a governor to grant, honor or refuse a requisition, since such an inquiry would be opposed both to the plainest principles of public policy and to freedom of action by the executive within his constitutional authority.\u201d 94 <em>A. L. R., </em>at <em>p. </em>1496.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">In <em>25 Am. Jur., Habeas Corpus, sec. </em>67, <em>p. </em>192, the rule is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\">\u201c* * * The court, however, cannot go into the merits of the cause and is not allowed to inquire into the guilt or innocence of the prisoner or to let its decision be influenced by an opinion as to what should be the result of a trial of the person held for extradition, in the jurisdiction which seeks to obtain him for trial, by a suggestion that race prejudice in the demanding state will operate to deprive him of a fair and impartial trial or expose him to mob violence therein, or by the fact that extradition proceedings have been delayed. The scope of its inquiry is limited to a determination of the sufficiency of the papers and of the identity of the prisoner. * * <em>*\"</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">And further, in <em>25 Am.

E. 2d </em>411 (1941), it was held that the question of the motive or good faith of a prosecution is not admissible in a <em>habeas corpus </em>proceeding in an extradition matter, stating [68 <em>Ohio App. </em>97, 40 <em>N. E. 2d </em>168 ] : \u201cThis is in accord with the great weight of authority in this country and the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d citing <em>Drew v. Thaw, supra, </em>wherein Mr. Justice Holmes, referring to extradition proceedings, said [235 <em>U. S. </em>432, 35 <em>S. Ct. </em>138] : \u201cThere is no discretion allowed, no inquiry into motives.\u201d See also, the case of <em>People ex rel. Carr v. Murray, </em>357 <em>Ill. </em>326, 192 <em>N. E. </em>198, 94 <em>A. L. R. </em>1487 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1934), wherein the applicable cases in this country are collated. On the other hand, the courts of North Dakota in <em>habeas corpus </em>proceedings in a,n extradition case hold that the motive which lies behind an extradition proceeding may not be generally inquired into, save as it is necessary to show that the requisition is for the purpose of subjecting the defendant to prosecution for the offense charged and not merely to subserve private malice or to obtain service upon him for some other purpose. <em>Ex parte Bruchman, </em>28 <em>N. D. </em>358, 148 <em>N. W. </em>1052 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1914). And in Oklahoma, the rule is that in every extradition case the question of the good faith of the prosecution is open to inquiry on <em>habeas corpus </em>on the premise that the pertinent provision of the Eederal Constitution\u2014and the act of Congress passed to carry out that provision\u2014was never intended to be used to set in motion the executive departments of the two states at the instance of a private person, to enable him to gratify his malice or to aid him in enforcing the collection of a debt. <em>Ex parte Patrick, </em>86 <em>Okl.

App. </em>1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>In the instant case, the accused relies strongly upon the cases of <em>Klaiber v. Frank, </em>9 <em>N. J. </em>1 (1952) and <em>In re Slauson, </em>73 <em>F. </em>666 <em>(C. C. Va. </em>1896). The <em>Klaiber </em>case did not involve the question whether evidence of guilt or innocence or of motive may be submitted in a <em>habeas corpus </em>proceeding in an extradition case. It involved a civil action on a foreign judgment in which it was established that a fraud had been perpetrated on the defendant after his return to the demanding state on a rendition warrant issued by the Governor of New Jersey. A <em>criminal information </em>filed in Florida against Frank, charging him with selling and secreting personal property upon which he had given a chattel mortgage as security for the payment of a promissory note, was made at the instance of an attorney named Miller, who was the prosecuting attorney of Broward County, Florida and was also attorney for the plaintiff in the civil action brought against Frank in Florida upon his enforced return. The Governor of New Jersey honored the requisition of the Governor of Florida for the rendition of Frank. Thereupon, Frank obtained a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>to test the validity of the extradition proceedings and, at the hearing, the court refused to permit the introduction of testimony to establish the motive of the complaining witness in Florida, contending, <em>inter alia, </em>the charge was of a civil nature and not criminal. The County Court\u2019s dismissal of the writ was affirmed. <em>Frank v. Naughright, </em>1 <em>N. J. Super. </em>242 <em>(App. Div. </em>1949). Within two days after Frank was returned to Florida, and while incarcerated in jail, he was served with summons <em>ad respondendum </em>in a civil 'action instituted by the complaining witness only three days prior thereto. Frank. did not defend the civil suit and judgment by default was entered against him. Thereafter, an action was brought in the Superior Court, Law Division, to enforce payment of the Florida judgment. This latter action was defended by Frank, principally on the theory that he was immune from service of process while in Florida on the criminal charge and a fraud was perpetrated on the Florida court when judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>was entered there against him. The Law Division decided against Frank. <em>Klaiber v. Frank, </em>13 <em>N. J. Super. </em>388 <em>(Law Div. </em>1951). In reversing, Mr. Justice Ileher, speaking for the Supreme Court, 9 <em>N. J. </em>1 (1952), stated, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-5\">* * <em>The criminal action was hut a pretext to bring the defendant within the domain of the Florida court for the purpose of proceeding against him civiliter. </em>Tlie course of proceeding in Florida bespeaks this design beyond reasonable doubt. It was not a <em>bona fide, </em>invocation of the law for interstate rendition. It was rather a j&gt;er-version of the extradition process to the service of a private and wholly foreign to its nature and function. * \u00ae * and when Frank was finally brought into Florida the civil action was begun forthwith and the prosecution of the criminal information abandoned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-8\">\u201cCertain it is that if the <em>executive authority </em>of the asylum state was aware of the intent thus to use the extradition proceeding as a means to private ends, the rendition warrant could not lawfully issue. <em>In re Slauson, </em>73 <em>F. </em>666 <em>(C. C. Va. </em>1896).\u201d (Italics ours.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">It is quite apparent that the <em>Klaiber </em>case is not applicable. <em>We </em>concur in Mr. Justice Holler\u2019s condemnation of the abuse of the use of the criminal processes \u201cas a means of bringing a party into a jurisdiction in order that service of civil process may be had on him there. <em>Crusco v. Strunk Steel Co., </em>365 <em>Pa. </em>326, 74 <em>A. 2d </em>142 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1950).\u201d However, it is significant that there does not appear one word of criticism or condemnation of the decision of the Appellate Division\u2019s affirmance of the county court\u2019s refusal iu the <em>habeas corpus </em>proceeding to permit Frank to offer testimony as to motive. The issue decided by the Supreme Court was that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-10\">\u201cA foreign judgment is subject to collateral attack for fraud in the procurement of the appearance of the defendant. * * * Thus, for want of jurisdiction <em>in personam, </em>the Florida judgment was void and not merely irregular or erroneous and voidable, and the judgment rendered thereon in this action has nothing to sustain it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-12\">The hereinabove quoted language employed by Mr. Justice Ileher has apparently encouraged Cohen to prosecute this appeal and upon which he fastens his hopes for a reversal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Mr. Justice Heher\u2019s comments in the <em>Klaiber </em>case merely reiterate the prerogative of the Governor to \u201ccall upon the attorney general or any prosecuting officer in this state to investigate or assist in investigating the demand, and to report to him the situation and circumstances of the person so demanded, and whether he ought to be surrendered.\u201d <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:160-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Nor does the <em>Slauson </em>case, supra, add any support to Cohen\u2019s contention. In this case the requisition of the Governor of Tennessee, honored by the Governor of Virginia, was based upon an <em>ex parle </em>affidavit charging Slauson with the crime \u201cof a 'fraudulent appropriation of money\u2019 \u201d in the demanding state. At the <em>habeas corpus </em>proceeding, the court held that Slauson had the right to show the <em>animus </em>of the person who instigated the criminal proceeding. An examination of the case reVeals that the court did not cite a single case in support of its holding. Additionally, for all that may appear from the opinion, the State may have interposed no objection to such proofs. At least, the case is silent with respect. thereto. Further, in the <em>Slauson </em>case, it is apparent from the following significant comments of the court, that in admitting testimony to show motive or <em>animus </em>of the complaining witness, it was actuated principally by- the fact that the requisition was based upon an <em>ex parte </em>affidavit, and not, as here, by indictments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-5\">&lt;\u2022* * * Requisitions fox- pex-sons stigmatized as fugitives fx-om justice, when issued, as in the ease at bax-, on mex-e <em>ecc parte </em>affidavit, and not fouxxded upon indictment, ax-e liable to abxxse. Little cax-e can be taken to obtain the x-eal facts of the case by the officex-s issuing a x-equisition. Papers ax-e prepared and the demand issued, often in the most perfunctory- manner; and it is impracticable for the gov-ex-nor, to whom the requisition is addressed, to inquire into the merits of the proceeding. i! * \u00ae\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">From a studied consideration of the opinion, it may be reasonably stated that the basis of the court\u2019s discharge of the prisoner was in fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>\u201cThe law in such proceedings requires that the charge shall be substantially set forth in the papers filed. In these papers there is no crime substantially set forth. There is merely a reference to a criminal statute, Itself not identified by the reference. Merely to refer to a class of criminal acts is not to charge a specific crime. This is all that has been done in this affidavit. Nor does the affidavit set out important elements of this statutory offense. The warrant is vague, and does not inform the prisoner of the character of the crime, nor the time, place, or circumstance of its commission, of which every prisoner is entitled to be advised.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, \u25a0 </em>that the Slauson case is authority for the admissibility of testimony as to motive or <em>animus, </em>it is clearly contrary to the weight of authority throughout the United States, as hereinabove set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">In the instant ease, Cohen made no denial of his identity as the person named in the indictments or that he had been in Massachusetts at the times mentioned in the indictments, nor did ho make any application to the Governor following his arrest, seeking an opportunity to be heard before the Governor on the question of the good faith of the charges contained in the indictments, although he was taken into custody on February 28, 1952, and did not file his petition for writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>until on or about April 8, 1952. In conformity with the clear indication of our New Jersey cases cited hereinabove, we think that the rule that has been adopted in many other jurisdictions of the United States prohibiting an inquiry into the motives or <em>animus </em>of the complaining witnesses whose testimony has induced the indictments returned against the defendant in Massachusetts should prevail here. In passing upon the validity of a requisition it must be borne in mind that it is not the application of some creditor or person holding a selfish private motive, and who may have instigated the prosecution, but that it is made at the instance of a sister state having sovereignty equal to our own. It would be destructive of and subversive to the clear intent and meaning of the Federal Constitution, if an investigation of its motives were permitted to be made by the asylum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>state. A motive, when proved, is either a matter of express .declaration or of circumstantial evidence. Such an inquiry, if allowed, might well result in endless trials on vague and ill-formed issues, requiring witnesses and depositions from distant points, testifying to no conclusive purpose. The end result might well be to embarrass the enforcement of the constitutional provision and, in many cases, would have the effect of total abrogation thereof. <em>People ex rel.
