J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AbI\">who had sponsored and fostered and growth of the Appellate Division of this court, said in <em>Mitchell v. Boston Elevated Railway, </em>47 App. Div. 11 (where the facts were somewhat similar to the instant case in that there were two reports and the petitioner sought to establish report No. 2.):</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">\u201cThere is no provision in the rules for such procedure. These rules are modeled upon the established methods for proof of bills of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">\u201cThe underlying proposition of every such petition is that within the time allowed the petitioner filed a draft stating with substantial truth the exception saved, with its supporting evidence, verified by oath, in such form as the judge ought to have allowed. If disallowed it is that draft which is to be set up by petition.\u201d See: <em>Allen v.
