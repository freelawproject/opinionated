GONYEA v. LEO A. BELLIVEAU MOTOR VEHICLES. COLLISION. PASSENGER.</parties>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number><em>Present: </em>Garvey, P.J., Moore, J. and Allen, J.</p>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"A9E\">Tried to: <em>Walsh, J., </em>in the District Court of Springfield.</p>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b197-5\"><em># </em>164704.</docketnumber>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b197-6\">\n<em>Garvey, P.J.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AjU\">In this motor tort action there was a finding for the plaintiff. The defendant claimed a report. Did the evidence warrant the finding that the defendant was the operator of the motor vehicle causing injury to the plaintiff as a result of a collision with another motor vehicle in which he was a passenger, is the only issue briefed or argued by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">The reported evidence shows that the accident occurred on <em>November 17, 1959, </em>and the docket entries that the case was entered on <em>December 16, 1961 </em>and heard on <em>March 15, 1967, </em>(emphasis supplied) and that the defendant did not appear or testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">We quote from the report the only evidence offered by the plaintiff on the issue of identity. The plaintiff on direct examination testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-9\">Q. \u201cDid the driver of the other car have a discussion with you?\u201d A. \u201cWe had a discussion. He said, \u2018I\u2019m sorry for what I did. I was watching a girl. She distracted me.\u2019 He said, \u2018I\u2019m Leo Belliveau\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">This evidence, without more was not sufficient to establish the identity of the defendant. See <em>Varisco </em>v. <em>Malovin, </em>District Court of Springfield, # 180308, decided today by this Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">The report then states: \u201cIn further testimony the plaintiff testified the same man approached him three or four years ago (obvious<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>ly between the time the action was entered and the date of trial) and said a lawyer contacted him and he didn\u2019t appear in court. The plaintiff in response stated, \u2018There\u2019s nothing I can do for you\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b198-7\">Edward N. Hurley of Springfield for the Plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b198-9\">Darling &amp; McLaughlin of Waltham for the Defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">This summary of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, vague as it is, seems to us, the \u2018 \u2018 slight evidence \u2019 \u2019 sufficient to establish identity. <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>DiPaolo, </em>313 Mass. 492. <em>Brockton Hospital </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>345 Mass. 616. <em>Nugent </em>v. <em>Popular Markets, Inc., </em>1967 A. S. 1161. The trial judge could infer that the operator of the motor vehicle causing the plaintiff\u2019s injury acknowledged that he had been served with process.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The report is to he dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
