The defendant claimed to have proved that the cause of the failure of his wife to keep the car under control was due to the binding of the steering mechanism of the car, thus causing it to become rigid. The jury might reasonably have found either theory proven, and therefore the trial court was without power to have granted defendant\u2019s motion and set aside the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
