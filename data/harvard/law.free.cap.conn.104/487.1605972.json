Thereupon, on motion for a directed verdict, the trial court ruled that because of the plaintiff\u2019s failure to indorse.his license as required by \u00a7 20 of Chapter 400 of the Public Acts of 1921, his motor vehicle was being so operated in violation of that section as to bring him within the provisions of \u00a7 61 of that chapter and prevent his recovery, and that the defendant was in the same situation as to its counterclaim by reason of the failure of its driver to indorse his license, and directed a verdict accordingly. The correctness of these rulings is the only question presented by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Section 20 of Chapter 400 of the Public Acts of 1921 is as follows: \u201cEvery person licensed, to operate a motor vehicle shall, before operating any motor vehicle upon a public highway, indorse his signature on the back of his operator\u2019s license in a space provided for the purpose. Operators\u2019 licenses shall expire at midnight on the last day of February in each year. Any person who shall violate the provisions of this section shall be fined not more than twenty-five dollars for the first offense and for any subsequent offense not more than fifty dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">Section 61 provides tha,t \u201cno recovery shall be had in the courts of this State by the owner of a motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>vehicle which has not been legally registered in accordance with section nine for injury to person or property received by reason of the operation of such motor vehicle upon any public highway, . . . nor shall such recovery be had, if such motor vehicle be legally registered but was being operated by an unlicensed person in violation of any provision of section fifteen, twenty or twenty-one of this Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Section 1565 of the General Statutes was practically identical with \u00a7 61 of the present statute except that the references therein were, of course, to other sections of Chapter 77 of the General Statutes, including \u00a7\u00a7 1530, 1531 and 1532 instead of to \u00a7\u00a7 15, 20 and 21. Section 1532 comprised three subsections, (a), (b) and (c). Subsection (a) contained provisions, now embodied in \u00a7 19 of Chapter 400 of the Public Acts of 1921, for applications for numbering and recording of motor vehicle registrations and operators\u2019 licenses. Subsection (b) provided that \u201cevery person licensed to operate motor vehicles shall indorse his signature on the back of his license, in a space provided for the purpose, and such license shall not be valid until so indorsed. Such licenses shall expire at midnight on the last day of February in each year.\u201d Subsection (c) provided that such licenses shall be carried by the licensee when operating a motor vehicle upon any highway. The penalty section of Chapter 77, \u00a7 1556, provided for punishment by fine for violation of subsections (b) and (c) of \u00a7 1532.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Chapter 233 of the Public Acts of 1919, was enacted as a complete substitute for Chapter 77 of the General Statutes and repealed the latter. In \u00a7 16 of Chapter 233, subsections (a), (b) and (c) corresponded, in substance, with the same subsections of \u00a7 1532 except that the provision in (b) that \u201csuch license shall not be valid until so indorsed\u201d was there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>omitted, and has not been since re-enacted. The same section also provided for punishment, by fine, for violation of subsections (b) and (c). Section 1565 was re-enacted as \u00a7 44, being identical in substance, except changes in section numbers, including reference to \u00a7 16 instead of \u00a7 1532. In Chapter 400 of the Public Acts of 1921, subsection (a) of \u00a7 16 of the 1919 Act appears as \u00a7 19, (b) as \u00a7 20, and (c) as \u00a7 35, each with the penalty applicable thereto embodied in the section; \u00a7 44 of the 1919 Act is made \u00a7 61, and of the above-mentioned sections refers only to \u00a7 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">A sensible and probable reason for the important amendment, in 1919, of what is now \u00a7 20, may be found in the nature and purpose of the licensing of operators as distinguished from the registration of motor vehicles. The registration certificate is for the purpose of identification and revenue. An operator\u2019s license is purely a personal privilege granted by the State on account of fitness. <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Corbett </em>(1921) 97 Conn. 141, 145, 115 Atl. 694. The indorsement of the license is, at most, a convenient aid, supplementing the personal statistics contained in the application and appearing on the license, in identifying the possessor as the person to whom it was issued, and the General Assembly may well have regarded the prescribed fine as a sufficient penalty for failure to so indorse it, and the provision of the prior statute making indorsement an essential prerequisite to the validity of the license as too drastic a consequence of such failure. Whatever the incentive may have been, the provision was dropped from the statute and there can be no question that a person who has lawfully obtained an operator\u2019s license, whether or not he has indorsed it, is a licensed operator. To hold otherwise would be to deny effect to the amendment, which cannot be regarded other than significant; nor can the equally suggestive reten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>tion in \u00a7 61 of the limitation to unlicensed persons be lost sight of in the application of that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The disability imposed by \u00a7 61 relates only to operation by an \u201cunlicensed person,\u201d in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 15, 20 and 21. Section 15 provides, in substance, that no person shall operate a motor vehicle upon any public highway until he shall have obtained an operator\u2019s license; \u00a7 21 prohibits operation of a public service motor vehicle by a person who has not obtained a special public service motor vehicle operator\u2019s license in addition to his regular operator\u2019s license. The reason for including \u00a7 20 with these two sections must be, and be confined to, such feature of it, if any, as renders the person violating it \u201cunlicensed.\u201d Originally, before the provision making a license invalid for failure to indorse it was eliminated, operation under a license which had not been made valid by such indorsement would be within the scope of the statute, now \u00a7 61, as would, also, operation under a license which had expired by the limitation of time which was and is also imposed in the same section. Since the 1919 amendment, however, the holder of a lawfully obtained operator\u2019s license, whether or not he has indorsed it, is not an \u201cunlicensed person\u201d and so not within the purview of \u00a7 61; but a person who has obtained a license on or before the last day of February but which license, under the provision of \u00a7 20 relating thereto, has expired at midnight on that day, becomes thereafter an \u201cunlicensed\u201d operator, unless he has obtained a renewal of his license. This feature of \u00a7 20 affords a sufficient and the only apparent reason for the retention of the reference to that section in \u00a7 61 ; otherwise there is no more reason for the reference to \u00a7 20 than to the present \u00a7 19 and \u00a7 35 which, as above stated, were originally included, with \u00a7 20, in \u00a7 1532 of the General Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>A helpful analogy is apparent between the question here presented and that relating to subsection (c) of \u00a7 1532 of the General Statutes (in which the provision now under consideration appeared as subsection (b),) which was decided in <em>Kiely </em>v. <em>Ragali, </em>93 Conn. 454, 457, 106 Atl. 502. In that case the operator of the plaintiff\u2019s car, although a licensed driver, did not have with him his license card, as required by subsection (c), and it was claimed that there could be no recovery by the plaintiff because his motor vehicle, although legally registered, was being operated in violation of \u00a7 1532. The trial court charged, in substance, that if the jury found that the chauffeur was a licensed driver, the fact that he forgot to take his license with him would not, of itself, prevent a recovery. In sustaining this charge this court held that if an operator has lawfully obtained a valid and subsisting license, he does not become an \u201cunlicensed person\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1565 (now \u00a7 61) merely by . omitting to carry the license on his person. No more reason appears why, in the present case, since the operator of the plaintiff\u2019s car held \u201ca valid and subsisting license,\u201d he should be held to have become unlicensed by violating a similar provision, which was originally contained in the same statute (\u00a7 1532).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The only instance in which a motor vehicle may be held to be operated by an \u201cunlicensed person\u201d in violation of a provision of \u00a7 20, and so within the scope of \u00a7 61, is when his operator\u2019s license has expired' by the limitation of time therein specified. The driver of the plaintiff\u2019s car was not such ah unlicensed person, and the plaintiff is not barred of recovery, under \u00a7 61, by his failure to indorse his operator\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">There is error and a new trial is ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
