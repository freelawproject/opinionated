The finding of facts discloses that there was no misconduct of the juror, that the claimed misconduct was too trivial for consideration, that the act alleged was not occasioned by the prevailing party or anyone in his behalf, and that it did not unfavorably prejudice the appellant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rubuka, </em>82 Conn. 59, 61, 72 Atl. 566; <em>Pettibone </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>13 Conn. 444; <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Holah, </em>80 Conn. 314, 316, 68 Atl. 323.
