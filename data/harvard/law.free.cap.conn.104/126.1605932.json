The City Court and the Court of Common Pleas had jurisdiction over the parties and the subject-matter. The stipulation was not an attempt by parties to give jurisdiction to- a court, which had no jurisdiction over either the subject-matter or &gt; the parties. The claimed defect was a formal defect, and not a defect of a matter of substance. Such a defect may be waived by failure to object to it at the proper time.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">\u201cThe general rule is that an objection to a pleading may be waived by failure to urge the objection at a proper time. ... A failure to make a motion is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>generally deemed a waiver of defects or objections for which the motion lies.\u201d 31 Cyc. 717, 718.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The statute as to \"circumstantial errors, mistakes or defects\u201d is applicable.
