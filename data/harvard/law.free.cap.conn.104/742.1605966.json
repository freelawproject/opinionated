She has not pursued either method in accordance with our practice. Rules of Supreme Court of Errors, Practice Book, p. 309, \u00a7 11, and Form 3, page 313. For these reasons her assignments of error as to corrections claimed in the finding must be disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">Errors predicated upon the failure of the subordinate facts to support the court\u2019s conclusions that none of the acts of negligence on the part of the defendant as alleged have been established are very plainly without merit.
