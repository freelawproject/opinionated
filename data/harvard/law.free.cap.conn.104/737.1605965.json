The collision occurred at a highway intersection, and defendant\u2019s automobile was upon the right of the plaintiff\u2019s as they came to it. If they were arriving at approximately the same time, it would be the duty of plaintiff\u2019s driver to yield the right of way to the defendant\u2019s automobile. Public Acts of 1921, Chap. 334, \u00a7 2; <em>Neumann </em>v. <em>Apter, </em>95 Conn. 695, 700, 112 Atl. 350; <em>Bettilyon </em>v. <em>Smith &amp; Son, Inc., </em>96 Conn. 16, 20, 112 Atl. 649; <em>Lamke </em>v. <em>Harty Bros. Trucking Co., </em>96 Conn. 505, 508, 114 Atl. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>533. That the situation was such as to bring this rule into operation and that the driver of plaintiff\u2019s car was negligent in not heeding it, slackening his speed, or giving any warning, are not merely reasonable, but almost inevitable conclusions. That being so, it becomes of no consequence whether the driver of defendant\u2019s automobile was also negligent, for the negligence of the driver of plaintiff\u2019s car must certainly, on the facts found, be regarded as at least materially contributing to bring about the collision, even if it could not be said to be the sole cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
