The status and effect of the bill of lading, to be determined upon the facts found, is decisive of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The Act of Congress of August 29th, 1916, relating to bills of lading (39 U.S. Stat. at Large, 638 <em>et seq. </em>Fed. Stat. Anno., 1918 Supp. [2d Ed.] p. 72 <em>et seq.; </em>8 U.S. Comp. Stat., \u00a7 8604 aaa-w) provides, in \u00a7 1, that \u201cbills of lading issued by any common carrier for the transportation of goods . . . from a place in one State to a place in another State, . . . shall be governed by this Act.\u201d Since the shipment here under consideration was interstate, questions as to the construction and effect of the bill of lading are controlled by this Act, so far as it applies. In \u00a7 2 a \u201cstraight bill\u201d is defined as one \u201cin which it is stated that the goods are consigned or destined to a specified person,\u201d and in \u00a7 6 it is provided that \u201ca straight bill shall have placed plainly upon its face by the carrier issuing it \u2018nonnegotiable\u2019 or \u2018not negotiable.\u2019 \u201d The trial court finds that the present bill of lading was a straight bill, and plainly marked nonnegotiable. Section 29 is as follows: \u201cA bill may be transferred by the holder by delivery, accompanied with an agreement, express or implied, to transfer the title to the bill or to the goods represented thereby. A straight bill can not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>negotiated free from existing equities, and the indorsement of such a bill gives the transferee no additional right.\u201d Other relevant sections of the Act are set forth in the footnote.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">The very evident intention and accomplishment of the Act is to make straight bills nonnegotiable, and if the form of indorsement by defendant to the Bridgeport Iron &amp; Metal Company might, standing by itself, be regarded as an attempt to convert the bill into an order bill, such would be an alteration after issue, without authority from the carrier, and void under \u00a7 13 as well as futile under \u00a7 29. It is clear, then, that the form of the indorsement worked no change in the nature or effect of the bill, that it continued to be nonnegotiable, and both as to the original and subsequent transferees, it is to be treated as subject to such limitations as are imposed by law upon such bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">As between the defendant American Company as the seller and the Bridgeport Iron &amp; Metal Company as the original buyer and transferee, the rights and reme<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>dies of an unpaid seller, including the right of stoppage <em>in transitu </em>in case of the buyer\u2019s insolvency, manifestly would obtain. General Statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 4719, 4723, 4725, 4728; <em>Interstate Window Glass Co. </em>v. <em>New York, N.H. &amp; H.R.Co., </em>104 Conn. 342, 133 Atl. 102. \u201cWhere a bill of lading is outstanding for the goods, the seller is not driven to rely upon the doctrine of stoppage <em>in transitu </em>unless the bill is either a straight bill of lading to the buyer, or unless, if negotiable in form, it has come into the hands of the buyer, either by delivery, if it originally ran to the buyer\u2019s order, or by indorsement and delivery, if it ran to the seller\u2019s order. Where the bill is a straight or nonnegotiable bill to the buyer, there can be no doubt of the applicability of the doctrine of stoppage <em>in transitu. </em>This is the typical case where the doctrine should be permitted.\u201d 2 Williston on Sales (2d Ed.) \u00a7 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">And the sale of the goods by the . buyer while they are in transit does not depriye the seller, of his right to stop the goods. Unless a <em>negotiable </em>document of title is negotiated for value, or the seller has consented to the subsale, the right of stoppage <em>in transitu </em>still remains. General Statutes, \u00a7 4728; 2 Williston on Sales (2d Ed.) \u00a7 538. Since the bill of lading here was not a \u201cnegotiable document of title,\u201d this established principle of the law of sales would seem to be, of itself, sufficient to sustain the defendant\u2019s right of stoppage <em>in transitu </em>as against these plaintiffs as well as against the original buyer. The existence of such right is, however, further confirmed by provisions of the Federal Bills of Lading Act, especially \u00a7 29, hereinbefore quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">In <em>Quality Shingle Co. </em>v. <em>Old Oregon Lumber &amp; Shingle Co., </em>110 Wash. 60, 187 Pac. 705, the controlling facts were strikingly similar to those of the present case. The plaintiff, consignor and consignee of a car<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>load of shingles, received, indorsed in blank, and delivered a straight bill of lading to Shepard-Traill Company, from which company the defendant purchased and paid for the shingles and took the bill of lading, so indorsed. Before the defendant obtained possession of the shingles or any right therein other than as evidenced by the bill of lading, the plaintiff, because of nonpayment of a check given it by Shepard-Traill Company in payment for the shingles, claimed ownership of the property, and so notified the defendant and the carrier. The decisive question was whether or not the assignment of the bill of lading from ShepardTraill Company to the defendant vested in the latter a title superior to that possessed by Shepard-Traill Company as against the plaintiff. In affirming a judgment for the plaintiff, the court held that the language of the Federal Act (\u00a7\u00a7 2 and 29) places the assignee of a straight bilk of lading in all respects in the shoes of his assignor, so that \u201cwhatever right, legal or equitable, may exist in the property described in the bill of lading in favor of someone other than the assignor of the bill of lading as against him, continues to exist as against his assignees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">In <em>Getchell </em>v. <em>Northern Pac. Ry. Co., </em>110 Wash. 66, 187 Pac. 707, a case similar to the foregoing except that in the bill of lading a party other than the consignor was named as consignee, the same court held that \u201ca straight bill of lading, whether naming another than the consignor as consignee or naming the same person as both consignor and consignee and thereafter assigned to another, is not evidence of superior title in anyone other than the consignor, to the property herein specified.\u201d See also <em>Hinrichs, Inc. </em>v. <em>Standard Trust &amp; Savings Bank, </em>279 Fed. 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Under provisions of State bills of lading statutes which are similar to \u00a7 29 of the Federal Act (as is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>\u00a7 4642 of the General Statutes) it is held that indorsement of a nonnegotiable.bill of lading is ineffectual to confer any additional right and the transferee obtains only such interest as the transferor had. <em>Ward-Lewis Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Mahony </em>(Cal.) 234 Pac. 417; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Floersheim Mercantile Co., </em>206 Mass. 373, 375, 92 N.E. 494; <em>Dewberry-Hargett Co. </em>v. <em>Arkansas State Bank, </em>164 <em>Ark. </em>223, 261 S.W. 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Again, the limited and conditional character of the title contemplated by the Federal Act as passing by the transfer of a straight bill is manifested by the provisions in \u00a7 32 as to rights of creditors of, or subsequent purchasers from, the transferor, prior to notification, to the carrier, of the transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The trial court was correct in concluding that the nonnegotiable bill of lading issued to the defendant American Company, remained such notwithstanding the indorsement of it; that the plaintiffs were chargeable with knowledge of the nature of the bill and the title they obtained thereby (which conclusion eliminates any question of estoppel); and that the defendant retained the right to stop the goods <em>in transitu </em>and effectively exercised.-that right, and hence was entitled to recover their agreed value.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"\u00a7\" orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b495-6\"> 13. That any alteration, addition, <em>or </em>erasure in a bill after its issue without authority from the carrier issuing the same, either in writing or noted on the bill, shall be void, whatever be the nature and purpose of the change, and the bill shall be enforceable according to its original tenor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u00a7\" orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b495-7\"> 32. That a person to whom a bill has been transferred, but not negotiated, acquires thereby as against the transferor the title to the goods, subject to the terms of any agreement with the transferor. If the bill is a straight bill such person also acquires the right to notify the carrier of the transfer to him of such bid and thereby to become the direct obligee of whatever obligations the carrier owed to the transferor of the bill immediately before the notification. Prior to the notification of the carrier by the transferor or transferee of a straight bill the title of the transferee to the goods and the right to acquire the obligation of the carrier may be defeated by garnishment or by attachment or execution upon the goods by a creditor of the transferor, or by a notification to the carrier by the transferor or a subsequent purchaser from the transferor of a subsequent sale of the goods by the transferor.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
