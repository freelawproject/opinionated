Other errors assigned, in refusing to find additional facts as requested, are not properly before us, since they were not incorporated in the motion to correct; and this appeal was taken under General Statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 5829, 5830.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
