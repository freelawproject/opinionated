Y. and Keansburg without a seasonal limitation. A careful study of the preceding rights, commencing with a grandfather right in 1935, shows that originally only a limited or seasonal right from May 15th to September 15th was involved. However, thereafter on the purchase of the original right and the acquisition of two other rights, Hudson, on the date of the order now complained of, was, by the language of that order, as well as by the language of an earlier order, dated June 11, 1942, vested with an unlimited right to operate the year round. Plaintiff urges that this extended right is in competition with its rights and was permitted by the Commission through \u201cinadvertence.\u201d This raises a question of fact. Did the Commission function through inadverfence ? The record discloses that it did not. That it at all times functioned with actual knowledge of the original limitation, and that it struck out the seasonal limitation by the order complained of and the compliance order of 1940 on which the certificate of June 11, 1942 was based, in the exercise of its discretionary power and in the interest of public necessity and convenience. There can be no doubt of the Commission\u2019s authority to enlarge the scope of Hudson\u2019s authority. This right, in the Commission, is emphasized in Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway Co. v. United States, 322 U. S. 1, 64 S.Ct. 842, 843, 88 L.Ed. 1093, wherein the court held that the Commission \u201chad power to include in the authorization provision for service greater than the carrier had asked.\u201d Moreover the best answer to the charge of \u201cinadvertence\u201d' is the ruling by the Commission itself on that point, found in-its opinion dated December 10, 1945, wherein it is said \u201cThe description of operating authority therein duplicates exactly the description contained in the Hudson order of July 20, 1940.\u201d We therefore conclude that there was no inadvertence by the Commission on the point raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">plaintiff further urges that the action of the Commission is invalid because in its order of June 11, 1942 the route is defined as being partially \u201cover city streets.\u201d It is argued that this description is bad for uncertainty. Under date of December 10, 1945 the Commission filed an opinion covering the use of the phrase, \u201cover city streets\u201d reciting, among other things, that it had been the practice of the Commission, in issuing certificates to long haul carriers, to designate the highways composing the authorized routes but not to specify the streets that might be used in terminal or intermediate points along the route, citing the Lincoln Tunnel application, 12 M.C.C. 184. The Commission concludes by saying: \u201cAt the time the Hudson order was issued, there was no apparent reason why the city streets should be specified therein. The omission from the certificate issued to Hudson, pursuant to that order of the designation of the streets over which it was authorized to operate, does not establish that the certificate was inadvertently issued.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">It is interesting to note that the certificate, under which plaintiff, Boulevard, now operates,,is subject to the same criticism it directs toward the defendant Hudson\u2019s certificate. Boulevard is authorized to operate partially \u201cover city street\u201d and its certificate contains no specification as to that street.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\"> It appears from the record here that Hudson\u2019s right to operate over the year, and without seasonal limitation and \u201cover city streets,\u201d ripened in the certificate dated June 11, 1942. This certificate was final and the Commission could not revoke or amend it save under the provisions of 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 312(a), nor can we make a ruling controlling the Commission on this point. Nothing here indicates the presence of the conditions under which that section may be invoked. See United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>States v. Seatrain Lines, Inc., 329 U.S. 424. 67 S.Ct. 435, 91 L.Ed. 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Findings of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">The ultimate or relevant facts are found as follows i<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">1. Louis Binetti, doing business as West New York-Keansburg Bus Line, filed an application for an operating certificate, as a common carrier, by motor vehicle of passengers and their baggage, between West New York and Keansburg, on February 8, 1936.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-7\">2. The application of Binetti was filed pursuant to Section 206(a) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 306(a), under the \u201cgrandfather\u201d clause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-8\">3. Jersey City-Keansburg Transit Lines, Inc., filed an application for an operating certificate as a common carrier, by motor vehicle of passengers and their baggage, between Jersey City and Keansburg, on January 30, 1936.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-9\">4. The application of Jersey CityKeansburg was filed pursuant to Section 206(a) of the Interstate Commerce Act, under the \u201cgrandfather\u201d clause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-10\">5. On May 9, 1938, a compliance order was granted to Binetti authorizing him to operate between West New York and Keansburg during the season extending from May 15 to September 15, inclusive. \u201cFrom West New York over City Streets via Union City, Jersey City and Bayonne, N. J., Staten Island, N. Y., Perth Amboy, South Amboy, Morgan, Lawrence Plarbor, Clifford Beach,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Keyport and Union Beach, N. J., to Keansburg and return over the same route.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-11\">6. On May 17, 1938, a compliance order issued to Jersey City-Keansburg Transit Lines, Inc., authorizing it to operate between Jersey City and Keansburg over a route similar to that of the Binetti route from Jersey City to Keansburg via Bayonne and Staten Island.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-12\">7. The compliance order of May 17, 1938 to Jersey City-Keansburg Transit Lines, Inc., contained no seasonal limitation but did specify the city streets over which the route was to be operated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-14\">8. On August 9, 1939, Hudson Bus Transportation Co. was authorized to acquire control of Jersey City-Keansburg line by purchase of its capital stock and to purchase the \u201cgrandfather\u201d rights of the Binetti line.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-15\">9. On April 15, 1940, the Commission approved the purchase by Hudson of the \u201cgrandfather\u201d rights of the Jersey CityKeansburg line and unification of such rights, with those that had previously been acquired from Binetti, with duplications eliminated, was authorized.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-16\">10. On July 20, 1940, the Commission issued a compliance order to Hudson. This order vacated the Binetti and Jersey City-Keansburg orders and authorized Hudson, as successor in interest to Jersey City and Binetti, to operate as a common carrier by motor vehicle of passengers and their baggage, between West New York and Keansburg, as follows: \u201cFrom West New York, over city streets via Union City, Jersey City and Bayonne, N. J., Staten Island, N. Y., Perth Amboy, South Am-boy, Morgan, Lawrence Harbor, Cliffwood Beach, Keyport and Union Beach, N. J., to Keansburg and return over the same route.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-17\">11. The order of July 20, 1940, did not contain the seasonal restriction that formerly had been imposed on Binetti nor did it contain the specific designation of city streets that had been imposed on the Jersey City-Keansburg line. The order permitted a year round operation, over city streets, between West New York and Keansburg.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-18\">12. No protest was filed to any order, by any party, at any time prior to June 11, 1942.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-19\">13. On June 11, 1942, the certificate, based on the compliance order of July 20, 1940, was issued to Hudson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-20\">14. On June 3, 1940, independently of the prior proceedings, the Commission issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity to Hudson Bus Transporta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>tion Co., authorizing it to operate as a common carrier by motor vehicle in a short haul mass transportation of passengers and their baggage between Jersey City and Mid-town Manhattan, N. Y. This certificate was later modified by the Commission in a certificate dated March 16, 1942.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-5\">15. On September 24, 1943, the Commission issued to Hudson a certificate which superseded and combined all the operating rights possessed by it under the certificates dated June 11, 1942 and March 16, 1942, as amended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">16. Operation of service between West New York and Keansburg had been suspended during the war by the Commission under date of December 22, 1944.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-7\">17. By order of February 9, 1945, the Commission permitted a partial resumption of the suspended service between West New York and Staten Island.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-8\">18. The Commission, by virtue of the rights contained in Hudson\u2019s certificate of September 24, 1943, stated, by letter dated January 26, 1945, that Hudson could combine its authorized routes so as to permit a through, connecting service between Staten Island, N. Y., and Mid-town Manhattan, N. Y., via Bayonne and Jersey City, N.J.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-9\">19. The through service between New York and Staten Island was accomplished by a combination of the West New YorkKeansburg and the Jersey City-Manhattan route, using Jersey City as the connecting point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-10\">20. Plaintiff, Boulevard Transit Lines, Inc., a New Jersey Corporation, is a common carrier engaged in a short haul mass transportation operation between Port Richmond, Staten Island and Manhattan, N. Y. via Bayonne and Jersey City, N. J., and is in competition with the defendant herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-11\">21. The failure of the Commission to include in the certificates of June 11, 1942, or September 24, 1943, the seasonal limitation on the West New York to Keansburg operation was not inadvertent but was a result of a careful, studied, procedure surrounding the issuance of the compliance order of July 20, 1940, which, also, did not contain the seasonal limitation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-14\">22. The failure of the Commission to include a specific designation of city streets, in the certificates of June 11, 1942 or September 24, 1943, issued to Hudson, was not inadvertent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-15\">23. In a petition to the Commission, plaintiff sought to modify or revoke the certificate of September 24, 1943, which was denied in an opinion dated December 10, 1945 by Division 5.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-16\">24. Petition for reconsideration before the entire Commission was denied September 13, 1946.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-17\">25. A hearing and investigation, to determine if Hudson was operating within the scope of its certificate, was conducted at which time evidence bearing on seasonal operations was excluded, resulting in an opinion of the Commission, sustaining Hudson, dated September 9, 1946.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-18\">26. Plaintiff\u2019s petition for reconsideration of this opinion, before the entire Commission, was denied April 8, 1947.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-19\">27. Plaintiff thereafter filed its compliant and, pursuant to Statute, this Court heard oral argument on December 19, 1947, reserving decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-20\">Conclusions of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b647-21\">We conclude as matters of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-22\">1. This Court has jurisdiction of the parties and subject matter of this suit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-23\">2. The Interstate Commerce Commission, by virtue of the power granted to it by Congress, had the authority to issue the certificates of June 11, 1942 and September 24, 1943.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-24\">3. It is not mandatory on the Commission to designate specific streets where the streets are not the essence of the operation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-25\">4. The Commission can grant more authority than is sought by applicant in its request for a certificate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-26\">5. Objections to the issuance of the certificates, dated June 11, 1942, and September 24, 1943 were made out of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-27\">6. The Commission properly excluded evidence bearing on seasonal limitations at the hearing to determine if defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>was operating within the scope of its certificate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-4\">7. The Commission is without authority to modify or revoke a certificate once it has issued, unless it <em>comes </em>within one of the provisions in Section 212(a) of the Act, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 312(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-5\">8. There is present no condition that would bring the instant case within Section 212(a) of the Act, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 312 (a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">9. The order of the Commission, dated April 8, 1947 denying plaintiff\u2019s request for reargument and rehearing on a petition to set aside an order of Division S, was proper and is hereby in all aspects affirmed.</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b646-21\"> Bowles v.
