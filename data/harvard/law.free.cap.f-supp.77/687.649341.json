The writ was issued and served, return made setting forth the above commitment, the petition stipulated to be a traverse of the return, and hearing had.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-16\">At the hearing, it appeared from the record and authorities cited that Wright has made motions in the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Illinois respecting the judgment of conviction, long after the term of court in which it was entered. The parties agree that the facts are that these proceedings were not in the nature of coram nobis, and I so find. It was also there agreed that if the ten year sentences were invalid, Wright\u2019s petition for release should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-17\">Wright there stated he desired no counsel and would conduct his case propria persona. The Warden was represented by Assistant United States Attorney Joseph Karesh. Stipulated evidence was introduced and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>case argued and submitted, dence I make the following Upon this evi-</p>\n<p id=\"b739-3\">Findings of Fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">Prior to the time of his arraignment, Wright, without counsel, had been confined in Joliet Penitentiary, Illinois, on a sentence for a state offense. On the 16th of September, 1930, he was taken to the United States District Court in Danville, Illinois, and arraigned with the three other defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">The judge there presiding deposes that Wright (a) had no attorney, and (b) had no funds to hire one, and (c) that he had no means of securing one, and I further so find.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">None of the other three accused had counsel, and the court appointed an attorney then in the court room, one J. D. Allen, stipulated now to be deceased, to serve in that capacity for all of them. That judge deposes that he \u201cdirected the United States Attorney to give Mr. Allen full access to all of the file, disclosing all evidence against the defendants, and the United States Attorney complied with the request.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">Though, neither Wright nor any of the three had had counsel theretofore, the court nevertheless set the case for trial for September 17th, the next day after arraignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">Allen left the court, went to the office of the United States attorney and there discovered that each of three of his clients had given statements in writing, each (a) charging Wright with the crimes for which he was to be tried the next day and also (b) confessing their own participancy in the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">The unfortunate Allen, a reputable colored practitioner, thus found himself within a few hours of a trial with three clients accusing Wright, a fourth client, and the likelihood that his duty to Wright could oblige him to tell the jury that: \u201cYou must disregard the statements of my three other clients accusing Wright of the crime. These are statements of dishonest men\u2014 scoundrels who have sought to charge an innocent man with participating in a crime which they alone committed. You cannot believe men of such character.\u201d At the same time, Mr. Allen might well be compelled to argue on behalf of the three that: \u201cYou must acquit these men because they are innocent, honorable, law-abiding men who could not possibly have done any of the violent and criminal things with which they are charged. They have pleaded not guilty, and you must believe them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-11\">In the few remaining hours for the preparation of the several defenses of the four men, no reputable member of the legal profession could proceed with the case without the frustating knowledge he was violating its primary canon \u2014 detachment of interest. Conscientious counsel, as Allen is shown to be, so profoundly embarrassed,, was not qualified to give efficient representation to any of his clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-12\">To add to Attorney Allen\u2019s confusion and perturbation of mind, he learned from Wright that his defense was an alibi to be established by two witnesses whose names, and addresses in Decatur, Illinois, he was-given. All this appeared on a statement given by Wright to the investigating officers and in possession of the prosecuting-attorney when Wright was arraigned. Allen thus had to prepare the cases of three of his clients on the three serious crimes charged and to seek to make some overnight contact with Wright\u2019s alibi witnesses at the addresses given. Decatur, the town of their residence, is 73 miles from Danville,, the place of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-13\">In this situation, Allen waited till the next morning when the trial began, when he made a motion for a continuance as to Wright to have an opportunity to seek his witnesses for his only and, if true, his sufficient defense. For this motion he had prepared an affidavit signed by Wright setting forth the facts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>The court denied this motion for a continuance. On this, the presiding judge later deposed: \u201cThe motion for continuance was denied because I thought that no legal ground for continuance existed. The affidavit disclosed that defendant was evidently aware of the indictment against him as he said that he had attempted to write to two witnesses, but that the authorities at the State Penitentiary did not let his letters go out, but he did not show that from the time he acquired knowledge of the indictment up until the time of the trial, he made any other effort or attempt to get in contact with witnesses or arrange for their presence, or subpoena them. He consulted no lawyer; he wrote no lawyer. He did not write the Judge of the United States Attorney, but waited until the time of his trial, and then made an application for continuance. I believed he had not shown due diligence. If I erred, it was because I believed that fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">With the case not at issue till arraignment, Wright could not know before arraignment the date the trial would be set. It was not till arraignment that the federal trial judge could perform his obligation to advise Wright of his right to counsel to prepare his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">To meet the situation of the conflict of interest between his three other clients and Wright, Attorney Allen moved for a severance as to Wright, Wright\u2019s affidavit having stated: \u201cThis affiant further says that he is informed and believes that the issues involved in this cause will be controverted, and that the evidence relating to such issues will be highly conflicting, as introduced by the respective parties.\u201d This the court denied, the judge' later deposing that: \u201cAs to the motion for severance, I thought that inasmuch as these defendants had been indicted together, as co-defendants, inasmuch as they were charged with conspiracy j ointly, the Government should not be put to the expense of more than one trial before one jury. I believed that I could adequately <em>protect the rights of each defendant </em>by my charge to the jury, and this I attempted to do, and, in my discretion, therefore I denied the motion.\u201d (Emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Attorney Allen made no further motion to relieve himself of his dual and conflicting representation, and on September 17th the trial was commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">At the - trial, what had appeared in the affidavit for severance was further confirmed. The prosecution introduced the statements of Allen\u2019s three other clients accusing Wright of the three crimes and also confessing their own guilt. Also was introduced Wright\u2019s statement showing his claim of alibi and the names and addresses of his witnesses. The two witnesses to prove the alibi were not procured and the prejudicial inference necessarily arose in the jurors\u2019 minds that his failure to produce such clearly exculpating testimony meant there was no such testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">As to the statements of the three co-defendants charging Wright with the crimes and also confessing their own participancy therein, the judge deposes that he charged the jury that \u201cno confession was binding on any person other than the one who made it, and that it was not to be considered as evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>dence against any other defendant,\u201d and I further find that he so charged the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">There was evidence other than the statements sufficient for a verdict of guilty against Wright.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">The jury\u2019s verdict of the guilt of Wright and of the three other defendants was rendered that day, and immediately thereupon Wright was given the sentences here in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">Conclusions of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">From the above findings of fact as to the conflicting interest represented by Attorney Allen, I conclude that Wright was denied the right to the efficient assistance of counsel given him by the Sixth Amendment, and that with a counsel so embarrassed, compelling him to undertake the conflicting defenses in less than 24 hours, and in the same time to seek and procure Wright\u2019s witnesses, is a denial to Wright of the due process of law, to which he is entitled under the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-10\">The proof of Wright\u2019s claims of alibi by the named witnesses at the given, or even later discovered addresses if they had moved, would be a complete defense to the crimes charged against him. Obviously, counsel Allen, representing the conflicting interests of his three other clients, was totally incapable in the few hours before the following morning of the trial to search for and procure their presence, and at the same time prepare the defense of his other clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-11\">The trial judge decided that Wright had forfeited his right to time to have counsel singly devoted to his interest to procure his witnesses, and that he must go to trial the next day without such witnesses. The reasons he gives constitute a grossly finjust judicial absurdity. Joliet Penitentiary, in which Wright was confined until he was arraigned, is about 100 miles from the district court at Danville. The judge\u2019s subsequent deposition states that Wright had no counsel, had no \u201cfunds\u201d to procure one and no \u201cmeans\u201d to procure one. He then states as his reason why Wright, before arraignment, that is, before the case was at issue and when he could not possibly have known the date of trial, had forfeited his right to secure witnesses with the aid of counsel, that \u201cThe affidavit disclosed that defendant was evidently aware of the indictment against him as he said that he had attempted to write to two witnesses, but that the authorities at the State Penitentiary did not let his letters go out, but he-did not show that from the time he acquired knowledge of the indictment up until the time of the trial, he made any other effort, or attempt to get in contact with witnesses or arrange for their presence, or subpoena them. He consulted no lawyer; he wrote no lawyer. He did not write the Judge or the United States Attorney, but waited until the time of his trial, and then made an application for continuance. I believed he had not shown due diligence. If I erred, it was because I believed that fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-13\">It is an injustice for the court to find Wright without counsel and without money or means to procure one and then give as one of the reasons for the forfeiture of his due process right to procure witnesses that \u201cHe consulted no lawyer; he wrote no lawyer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-14\">It is a further injustice to assume from Wright\u2019s affidavit as a further fact for forfeiting his right to secure his witnesses that-he \u201cdid not write the United States Attorney\u201d concerning his alibi. The fact is that the prosecuting attorney had Wright\u2019s signed statement stating the alibi defense and the names and addresses of his witnesses, a fact disclosed to the judge at the beginning of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-15\">The only ground left to justify the forfeiture of Wright\u2019s right to have his witnesses found and produced is that he did not write the judge about it, that is, from a prison which the judge states prevented him from writing directly to the witnesses who, he claimed, would establish his innocence. The petitioner in Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 461, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed, 1461, 146 A.L.R. 357, also in prison, did not communicate with the trial judge, yet his petition was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-16\">In this situation, I hold that-Wright, a layman, did not forfeit his right to a counsel singly devoted to his defense, with sufficient time after the case became at issue-by arraignment to procure his witnesses. In this I am following the decision of the. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>tenth circuit in Walleck v. Hudspeth, 128 F.2d 343, a habeas corpus proceeding where the prisoner was granted the- writ and returned for a new trial on facts essentially like those here.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">In Hawk v. Olson, 326 U.S. 271, 66 S.Ct. 116, 90 L.Ed. 61, a habeas corpus proceeding, the writ was held to be sustainable where it be shown \"that no <em>effective </em>assistance of counsel was furnished <em>in the critical time between the plea of not guilty and the codling of the jury.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied) Id., at page 278 of 326 U.S., at page 120 of 66 S.Ct. There counsel was appointed on the day of trial and no continuance granted. It is no distinction that here the professionally hamstrung Allen was appointed the day before, with the witnesses he was to procure in a town 73 miles away and he required, at the same time, to prepare the defense of the three others.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">The trial judge contends that his conduct, if wrongful, is mere error. Of course, Allen could have appealed, but so Hawk\u2019s attorney could have appealed but did not. Nevertheless, the Hawk case holds \u2022such claimed fundamental error denying \u25a0constitutional rights may be adjudicated in a habeas corpus proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">In the habeas corpus proceeding of Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1024, 82 L.Ed. 1461, 146 A.L.R. 357, the court held that as soon as the accused is deprived of counsel, the court loses jurisdiction to proceed with the case, stating: \u201cIf the accused, however, is not represented by counsel and has not competently and intelligently waived his constitutional right, the Sixth Amendment stands as a jurisdictional bar to a valid conviction and sentence depriving him of his life or his liberty. A \u25a0court\u2019s jurisdiction at the beginning of trial may be lost \u2018in the course of the proceedings\u2019 due to failure to complete the court\u2014 .as the Sixth Amendment requires \u2014 -by providing counsel for an accused who is unable \u2022to obtain counsel,, who has not intelligently \u2022waived this constitutional guaranty, and whose life or liberty is at stake. If this requirement of the Sixth Amendment is not \u25a0 complied with, the court no longer has jurisdiction to proceed. The judgment of -conviction pronounced by a court without jurisdiction is void, and one imprisoned thereunder may obtain release by habeas corpus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">Citing the Zerbst case, the Supreme Court in Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, states at page 70, 62' S.Ct. 457, at page 464, 86 L.Ed. 680: \u201cEven as we have held that the right to the assistance of counsel is so fundamental that the denial by a state court of a reasonable time to allow the selection of counsel of one\u2019s own choosing, and the failure of that court to make an effective appointment of counsel, may so offend our concept of the basic requirements of a fair hearing as to amount to a denial of due process of law contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment, Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 53 S.Ct. 55, 77 L.Ed. 158, 84 A.L.R. 527, so are we clear that the \u2018Assistance of Counsel\u2019 guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment contemplates that such assistance be untrammeled and unimpaired by a court ord\u00e9r requiring that one lawyer shall simultaneously represent conflicting interests. If the right to the assistance of counsel means less than this, a valued constitutional safeguard is substantially impaired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">In that case, Glasser, an attorney, indicted, as was Wright, for conspiracy, had another attorney to represent him. The court appointed that attorney to represent a co-conspirator having an interest opposed to Glasser\u2019s. As with Wright, Glasser did not himself object. There was not, as here, a motion to segregate Glasser\u2019s trial. In that situation, the court, at page 71 of 315 U.S., at page 465 of 62 S.Ct., stated: -\u201cThe court made no effort to reascertain Glasser\u2019s attitude or wishes. Under these circumstances to hold that Glasser freely, albeit tacitly, acquiesced in the appointment of Stewart is to do violence to reality and <em>to condone a dangerous laxity on the part of the trial court in the dischm-ge of its duty to preserve the fundamental rights of an accused.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-10\">Concerning the effect' in a conspiracy trial of appointing one attorney for two persons of diverse interests, the court\u2019s condemnation states, 315 U.S. at page 75, 62 S.Ct. at page 467:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-11\">\u201cTo determine the precise degree of prejudice sustained by Glasser as a result of the court\u2019s appointment of Stewart [Glasser\u2019s attorney] as counsel for Kretske is at once <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>difficult and unnecessary. <em>The right to have the assistance of counsel is too fundamental and absolute to allow courts to indulge in nice calculations as to the amio-imt of prejudice arising from its denied. </em>Cf. Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291, U.S. 97, 116, 54 S.Ct. 330, 336,-78 L.Ed. 674, 90 A.L.R. 575; Turney v. Ohio, 273 U.S. 510, 535, 47 S.Ct. 437, 445, 71 L.Ed. 749, 50 A.L.R. 1243; Patton v. United States, 281 U.S. 276, 292, .50 S.Ct. 253, 256, 74 L.Ed. 854, 70 A.L.R. .263; And see McCandless v. United States, .298 U.S. 342, 347, 56 S.Ct. 764, 766, 80 L.Ed. 1205. <em>Of equal importance with the duty of the court to see that an accused has \u25a0the assistance of counsel is its duty to refrain from embarrassing counsel in the defense of an accused by insisting, or indeed, even suggesting that counsel undertake to concurrently represent interests which .might diverge from those of his first client, \u25a0.when the possibility of that divergence is \u25a0 brought home to the court. </em>In conspiracy cases, where the liberal rules of evidence and the wide latitude accorded the prosecution may, and sometimes do, operate unfairly against an individual defendant, it is especially important that he be given the benefit of the undivided assistance of his -counsel without the court\u2019s becoming a party to encumbering that assistance. Here the court was advised of the possibility that conflicting interests might arise which would diminish Stewart\u2019s usefulness to \u25a0Glasser. Nevertheless Stewart was appointed as Kretske\u2019s counsel. Our examination of the record leads to the conclusion \u25a0 that Stewart\u2019s representation of Glasser was not as effective as it might have been if the appointment had not been made. We \u2019 hold that the court thereby denied Glasser his right to have the effective assistance of counsel, guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. This error requires that the verdict be set aside and a new trial ordered as to \u25a0Glasser.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-7\"> No divergence of interest more clearly could have been \"brought home to the court\u201d than did the inculpatory statements of Attorney Allen\u2019s three other clients. At the moment of their introduction in evidence, Allen becomes disqualified . as Wright\u2019s attorney and he, in effect, had none. Then, if not before, the court lost jurisdiction to proceed as stated in Johnson v. Zerbst, supra. The trial judge\u2019s statement that he \u201cthought that * * * inasmuch as they were charged with conspiracy jointly, the government <em>should not be put to the expense of more than one trial </em>before one jury\u201d (emphasis supplied), in defiance of the Glasser case, is typical of the court\u2019s attitude. \u201cExpense\u201d is no factor in determining the accused\u2019s right of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">So, also, is the statement that he \u201ccould adequately protect the rights of each defendant by my charge to the jury.\u201d No charge to the jury could relieve Attorney Allen of his embarrassment when he learned a few hours before trial of his conflicting professional duties and the impossibility, before the next morning, of obtaining the witnesses to testify to Wright\u2019s alibi. This is even assuming that the court had instructed the jury clearly, not only that the confession portions of the three statements were to be disregarded, but also the statements implicating Wright.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-10\">It is my opinion that the court lost jurisdiction to proceed on the denial of the motion for a continuance. If it had not lost jurisdiction then, it was lost as soon as the conflicting statements were introduced into evidence and it became apparent that either the motion for a severance should be granted, or that a separate attorney should be appointed for Wright with a continuance adequate for such separate attorney to prepare his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-11\">Further Findings of Fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-12\">I further find that after June 21, 1947, when Wright had served the imprisonment portion of a sentence of five years to Alcatraz Penitentiary, on January 8, 1948, Wright filed with the United States District Court of the Northern District of California, in case No. 27833-H, the same petition as here filed. That court denied the petition and discharged an order to show cause, not on the merits of the petition. Instead it stated: \u201cPetition for Writ of Habeas Corpus having been briefed and submitted for decision, and it being noted by the court that the issues raised by the petition have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>been decided adversely to petitioner in previous actions before this court.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">I further find that prior thereto Wright filed in the district court of the Northern District of California two other petitions, that is, both filed prior to his service of the above five year sentence, when the court had no power to consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">In the first of these, case No. 23,647-S, on a similar petition filed on March 28, 1942, that court found that the imprisonment portion of the above five year sentence had not been served. Then, having found itself without jurisdiction to adjudicate the validity of the instant sentence, on the same facts as here presented that court purported to make findings relative to its validity. In them is no finding on the ultimate fact of the diverse interest represented by Attorney Allen, and no finding of probative facts remotely suggesting the presence of this issue. Nevertheless, the court stated as a \u201cconclusion of law\u201d that \u201cpetitioner was not denied the right of assistance of counsel at any time during the course of the proceedings, and was there duly represented by counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Succeeding this, the same petition was filed in Case 23546-R on September 18, 1944. It showed on its face the pendency of the above five year sentence. Relief was denied on the ground that facts alleged in the petition \u201care insufficient on their face to justify the discharge of the petitioner.\u201d That case was appealed and decided on June 18, 1945. 149 F.2d 648. Within a month prior thereto, that circuit court decided the case of McDonald v. Johnston, 9 Cir., 149 F.2d 768, in which it held at page 769, concerning its power to adjudicate non-validity of a sentence where another is being served: \u201cThe federal courts have no' power in a habeas corpus proceeding, once it is shown that in any event the petitioner is presently held legally by his jailor, to determine such questions as the future termination of his sentence. McNally v. Hill, 293 U.S. 131, 138 et seq., 55 S.Ct. 24, 79 L.Ed. 238; De Maurez v. Squire, 9 Cir., 121 . F.2d 960, 962 and cases cited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-10\">Though without power to determine the merits of Wright\u2019s two contentions respecting, his ten year sentence, that court, in a casual per curiam of a single paragraph based upon the decision in the first case 23647, affirmed the district court. Wright v. Johnston, 9 Cir., 149 F.2d 648. The opinion does not mention the issue of the conflicting interests of Allen\u2019s clients nor the single,day in which Allen was to prepare the defenses of his three other clients and procure the -witnesses to prove Wright\u2019s alibi.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-11\">I further find that it is not true that nine petitions presenting these issues have been filed. There are but three, the one since the imprisonment portion of the five year sentence was served and the two others above stated, decided without power to consider such issues. Wright filed other petitions,, but they concern entirely different issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b744-12\">Further Conclusions of Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-13\">From these findings concerning these three cases, I conclude that Wright has never been tried in this circuit in a manner legally considering or disposing of his contentions that he has been denied the efficient assistance of counsel or given ariy time after arraignment to prepare his defense. In this connection it should be noted that in Hawk v.
