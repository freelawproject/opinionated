The next day, the State placed a hold on Maciaszek in Collier County, Florida, where he was serving a\n   sentence on an unrelated conviction with a release date of August 1, 2012. When Indiana placed that hold, Maciaszek was already subject to holds placed by New Hampshire and Maine, where he also was alleged to have committed crimes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   After completing his sentence in Florida, Maciaszek was transported to New Hampshire, where he was found guilty and given a sentence of one-and-a-half to six years, with a parole eligibility date of February 27, 2014. On January 10, 2013, while incarcerated in New Hampshire, Maciaszek filed a Request for Disposition of his pending Indiana charges under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (\"IAD\"), which provides a mechanism for the \"attendance of defendants confined as prisoners in institutions of other jurisdictions of the United States\" in an Indiana court.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2035-33-10-4\">\n    Ind.

On August 6, 2013, he pled guilty to two counts of Class B felony burglary and was sentenced to sixteen years with no credit for time served prior to sentencing (\"Indiana Sentence\"). The trial court ordered Maciaszek \"shall be immediately returned to the New Hampshire State Prison, Northern Correctional Facility, Berlin, New Hampshire. Upon completion of the New Hampshire sentence, authorities of the State of Indiana shall be notified and custody of Jacob Maciaszek returned to the State of Indiana.\" (App. at 9/1 [sic] ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   On November 5, 2015, Maciaszek filed, pro se, a \"Verified Petition for Presentence Jail Time Credit and Earned Credit Time,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13), arguing he should have been given credit on his Indiana Sentence from May 23, 2012, when Indiana put a hold on him in Florida, until his sentencing in Indiana on August 6, 2013. The trial court did not hold a hearing, and on December 4, 2015, the trial court denied Maciaszek's petition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Maciaszek v.

The matter was remanded to the trial court, and, on March 14, 2018, the trial court entered an amended judgment of conviction in which it clarified that Maciaszek's Indiana sentence would run consecutively to his New Hampshire sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   [4] Maciaszek challenges the propriety of the trial court's amended judgment, arguing that under the law of the case doctrine, the trial court was bound by the conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Maciaszek I\n   </em>\n   that the Indiana and New Hampshire sentences would run concurrently. Generally, the law of the case doctrine binds the court on appeal in any subsequent appeal, and the doctrine applies whether the earlier decision was right or wrong.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ind.

Therefore, application of the law of the case doctrine would result in the imposition of an illegal sentence. We have previously concluded that when the sentence imposed is improper, \"it is the general if not unanimous rule that the trial court has the power to vacate the illegal sentence and impose a proper one.\"\n   <em>\n    Lockhart v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10821795\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/671/893/#p904\">\n    671 N.E.2d 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 904 (Ind. Ct. App. 1996). Further, although one could argue that Maciaszek would suffer a manifest injustice,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , he would be subjected to a longer term of incarceration, if the law of the case doctrine were not applied, we have previously recognized that following vacation of an illegal sentence, the trial court may impose a proper sentence even if it \"results in an increased sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    Niece v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11051002\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/456/1081/#p1084\">\n    456 N.E.2d 1081\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1084 (Ind. Ct. App. 1983). Thus, given the interstate nature of Maciaszek's seemingly repetitive criminal behavior, one could reasonably conclude that application of a lawful sentence will not result in a manifest injustice to him. Moreover, one could also reasonably conclude that imposition of illegal concurrent sentences would result in a manifest injustice to the citizenry of both Indiana and New Hampshire, especially those individuals victimized by Maciaszek.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2035-43-2-1\">\n     Ind.
