A tax certificate entitles the certificate holder to the first lien on the real property. R.C. 5721.32. A property owner can redeem the certificate and remove the lien by paying the certificate holder the purchase price plus interest, penalties, and costs. R.C. 5721.38. If the property owner fails to redeem the certificates, the tax certificate holder may initiate foreclosure proceedings on the real property after\n   complying with certain statutory requirements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Woods Cove II, L.L.C. v.

Woods Cove purchased tax certificates representing the tax liens on the properties from the county treasurer. When Papadelis and American Guaranteed failed to redeem the certificates, Woods Cove filed foreclosure actions pursuant to R.C. Chapter 5721. The cases were assigned to the same trial court judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Papadelis and American Guaranteed filed identical answers to the complaints, and both asserted a counterclaim seeking a declaratory judgment that Ohio's tax certificate legislation is unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Woods Cove subsequently filed identical motions for summary judgment in both cases. In its motions, Woods Cove asserted that there were no genuine issues of material fact that (1) it was the holder of the tax certificates, (2) the amount and nonpayment of the taxes as shown on the tax certificates was presumptively valid, (3) it had not received any payment on the assessments referred to in the tax certificates, (4) it had filed a notice of intent to foreclose with the county treasurer, and (5) the treasurer had certified that the properties had not been redeemed. Accordingly, Woods Cove argued that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In their identical motions for summary judgment and responses to Woods Cove's motion, Papadelis and American Guaranteed did not dispute Woods Cove's arguments regarding their liability on the tax certificates, or the amount and validity of the taxes, assessments, charges, penalties, and interest due and unpaid. Instead, they argued they were entitled to summary judgment on their counterclaims that Ohio's tax certificate legislation is unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Papadelis and American Guaranteed argued that the tax certificate legislation violates the equal protection requirements of the United States and Ohio Constitutions because the statute treats similarly situated property owners (i.e., those on the delinquent land list) differently by allowing the treasurer to arbitrarily select which tax certificates will be sold, thereby requiring the property owners chosen for tax certificate foreclosure to pay interest and fees to redeem their property that property owners subject to a noncertificate foreclosure are not required to pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 8} They argued further that Ohio's tax certificate legislation violates due process protections of the United States and Ohio Constitutions because under R.C. 5721.40, after two unsuccessful attempts to sell the tax certificate property, the tax certificate holder obtains an \"incontestable\" title to the parcel. Appellants argued that because the title obtained by the tax certificate holder is \"incontestable,\" a property owner is precluded from appealing any mistakes in the foreclosure process, in violation of the property owner's due process rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Last, appellants argued that Ohio's tax certification legislation is unconstitutional because it violates the doctrine of separation of powers by allowing the county treasurer, instead of the judiciary, as trier of fact, to decide the amount of attorney fees related to tax certificate foreclosures. They argued further that R.C. 5721.37(F), which provides that the tax\n   certificate is \"presumptive evidence\" in all courts \"of the amount and validity of the taxes, assessments, charges, penalties * * * and interest\" is a legislative intrusion into the court's rule-making authority to regulate court procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 10} In its identical journal entries regarding the respective motions for summary judgment, the trial court noted that in light of the \"ever-present disparity in the application of fees and costs associated with the treasurer's tax foreclosures and those of private investors like Woods Cove,\" it was \"no surprise\" that appellants had raised a constitutional challenge to Ohio's tax certificate legislation. Nevertheless, without addressing Papadelis's and American Guaranteed's specific constitutional challenges, the trial court found that the tax certificate statute was presumptively valid and granted Woods Cove's motion for summary judgment and denied appellants' motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 11} This court dismissed appellants' subsequent appeals of the trial court's ruling for lack of a final, appealable order because the trial court's judgment entries had not made a determination as to the priority of liens or the amount of the judgment.\n   <em>\n    Woods Cove III, L.L.C. v.

The trial court subsequently denied appellants' motions for an extension of time to file objections to the magistrate's decisions and issued journal entries in both cases adopting the magistrate's decisions. Papadelis and American Guaranteed both appealed, and the cases were consolidated for briefing, argument, and disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Constitutionality of Ohio's Tax Certificate Statute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In their first assignment of error, appellants contend that the trial court erred in denying their motions for summary judgment after finding that Ohio's tax certificate legislation is constitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 14} We review summary judgment rulings de novo, applying the same standard as the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Grafton v.

Extension of Time\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 27} On December 16, 2016, the magistrate issued decisions in both cases granting foreclosure and setting forth the lien priorities and judgment amounts. On December 30, 2016, counsel for Papadelis and American Guaranteed filed in both cases a notice of appearance and a motion for a 30-day extension of time to file objections to the magistrate's decision, asserting that he was newly retained and needed additional time to analyze and prepare objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Woods Cove opposed the motion, arguing that although counsel had newly made a formal\n   <em>\n    appearance\n   </em>\n   in the cases, he was in fact not newly\n   <em>\n    retained\n   </em>\n   because he had been working with Woods Cove's counsel since October 2016 to resolve the matter. Woods Cove pointed out that appellants' \"new\" counsel had entered an appearance on October 11, 2016, in their appeals of the trial court's judgment, and had filed motions to consolidate the cases for appeal and to extend the time for filing the appellate brief. Thus, Woods Cove argued that counsel had actually been working on the case for at least two months prior to his notice of appearance in the trial court cases. The trial court subsequently denied the motion for extension of time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 28} In their third assignment of error, appellants contend that the trial court erred in denying their request for an extension of time to file objections to the magistrate's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Pursuant to Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(b)(i), a party may file objections to a magistrate's decision within 14 days of the filing of the decision. However, Civ.R. 53(D)(5) permits the trial court to grant a reasonable extension of time for a party to file objections outside the 14-day period \"for good cause shown.\" \"The definition of good cause is without precise parameters and varies according to the facts presented in each individual case.\"\n   <em>\n    Woodruff v.

We find no abuse of discretion here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 31} First, appellants waited to file their motion for an extension until the day the objections were due. Moreover, they asked for an additional 30 days to prepare their objections to the magistrate's decision, a period well beyond the normal time allocated for responding to a magistrate's decision. Furthermore, although appellants' counsel asserted he needed more time because he was newly retained, the record reflects that counsel had been working on the cases since October 11, 2016, when he entered appearances in this court in appellants' appeals of the trial court's decisions granting Woods Cove's motions for summary judgment. Appellants did not dispute Woods Cove's assertion that appellants' counsel had been working with Woods Cove since October 2016 to resolve the matter. Accordingly, appellants did not demonstrate good cause for an extension of time to file their objections to the magistrate's decision, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. The third assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Motion to Reconsider\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 32} After the trial court denied Papadelis's motion for extension of time to file his objections to the magistrate's decision, but before the trial court had adopted the magistrate's decision, Papadelis filed a motion in Cuyahoga C.P. No. CV-14-836666 asking the court to reconsider its judgment granting Woods Cove's motion for summary judgment, and to reconsider its judgment denying the motion for extension, or in the alternative, to vacate the magistrate's decision. The trial court denied the motion to reconsider. In the\n   fourth assignment of error, Papadelis argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to reconsider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 33} The Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure do not provide for a motion for reconsideration after a final judgment in the trial court, and thus any judgment or order regarding such a motion is a nullity.\n   <em>\n    Cleveland Bd. of Zoning Appeals v.

A trial court has inherent authority, however, to revise its interlocutory orders prior to its entry of a final order.\n   <em>\n    Miller v. Gen. Motors Corp.\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 55200,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1989%20WL%2030547\">\n    1989 WL 30547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *3 (Mar. 30, 1989). Here, because the trial court had not yet adopted the magistrate's decision granting summary judgment and setting forth the judgment amount, there was no final judgment, and the court could properly reconsider its interlocutory orders. Nevertheless, we find no error in the trial court's denial of the motion for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 34} In his motion for reconsideration, Papadelis argued, as he does on appeal, that the trial court improperly granted summary judgment to Woods Cove because (1) the affidavit of Woods Cove's agent attached to its motion for summary judgment fraudulently failed to disclose payments Papadelis had made to Woods Cove; (2) Woods Cove incorrectly calculated the interest due on Papadelis's property; and (3) Woods Cove's calculation of attorney fees was unlawful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Papadelis's motion for reconsideration raised new defenses to Woods Cove's motion for summary judgment that were not raised in either his answer to the complaint or his motion for summary judgment and response to Woods Cove's motion for summary judgment. Papadelis's answer and motion for summary judgment raised only constitutional objections to Woods Cove's foreclosure complaint; he did not dispute his liability on the tax certificates, and made no arguments regarding alleged payments to Woods Cove, the improper calculation of interest by Woods Cove, or attorney fees. As the trial court stated in its journal entry denying the motion, Papadelis's motion for reconsideration was \"an attempt to restructure the litigation\" at a late date without filing a proper pleading seeking to amend his answer to the complaint and counterclaim. Accordingly, the trial court properly overruled the motion. The fourth assignment of error is therefore overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   TIM McCORMACK, P.J., and PATRICIA ANN BLACKMON, J., CONCUR\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
