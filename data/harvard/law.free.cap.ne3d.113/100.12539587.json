The state, plaintiff-appellee/cross-appellant, cross-appeals the trial court's failure to impose a prison term for the first-degree felony conviction. We find that Yavorcik's challenge on the issue of venue has merit and vacate the conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background and Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The case arises from activities that took place in the city of Youngstown, located in Mahoning County, Ohio, between 2005 and 2009. On May 14, 2014, a 73-count indictment was handed down against Mahoning County Commissioner John McNally (\"McNally\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mahoning County Auditor Michael Sciortino (\"Sciortino\"), and 2008 county prosecutorial candidate Yavorcik. The charges included engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity ( R.C. 2923.32(A)(1) ) and conspiracy to engage in a pattern of corrupt activity ( R.C. 2923.01 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Unindicted individuals who were allegedly part of the criminal enterprise underlying these charges include several prominent Youngstown area business men and women, Cuyahoga County law firms and attorneys, and the following Mahoning County officials and employees:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   John Reardon (\"Reardon\"), County Treasurer to 2007\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Lisa Antonini (\"Antonini\"), County Treasurer succeeding Reardon in 2007\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   John Zachariah (\"Zachariah\"), Director of Mahoning County Department of Jobs and Family Services (\"JFS\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The defendants entered not guilty pleas. Multiple counts were dismissed prior to trial. Sciortino and McNally accepted plea agreements the morning of trial. Yavorcik, a licensed Ohio attorney, proceeded pro se during the two-week jury trial that\n   involved 26 witnesses and numerous exhibits. The trial began on March 14, 2016, and the verdict was rendered on March 25, 2016. Yavorcik was found guilty of:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Count 1: January 1, 2005 to January 1, 2009-engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, R.C. 2923.32(A)(1) conspiracy, a first-degree felony;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Count 3: January 1, 2005 to February 1, 2014\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   -conspiracy, R.C. 2923.01(A)(2), a second-degree felony;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Count 8: March 1, 2008 to November 30, 2008-bribery, R.C. 2921.02(B), a third-degree felony;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Count 9: March 1, 2008 to November 30, 2008-bribery, R.C. 2921.02(B), a third-degree felony (Yavorcik only)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Count 10: March 1, 2008 to November 30, 2008-bribery, R.C. 2921.02(B), a third-degree felony (Yavorcik only)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Count 11: October 23, 2008-tampering with records, R.C. 2913.42(A)(1), a third-degree felony (Yavorcik only)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Count 53: March 20, 2008-money laundering, R.C. 1315.55(A)(2) (Yavorcik only)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Count 54: September 1, 2008 to September 30, 2008-money laundering, R.C. 1315.55(A)(2) (Yavorcik only)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The state alleges that a pattern of corrupt activity is demonstrated by two conspiracies. The first conspiracy is commonly referred to as the Oakhill Renaissance conspiracy. The second conspiracy is based on Yavorcik's 2008 prosecutorial campaign.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Oakhill Renaissance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In 1987, JFS leased 96,000 square feet of space in McGuffy Plaza (\"McGuffy Plaza\") for $400,000 per year. McGuffy Plaza was owned by Ohio Valley Mall (\"OVM\"), a subsidiary of the Youngstown-based Cafaro Company (\"Cafaro Co.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Cafaro Co., founded, owned, and operated by the Cafaro family, operates through a number of subsidiaries and affiliates. Cafaro Co. is one of the largest privately owned retail business development and management companies in the United States. The Cafaro family members relevant to this case are Anthony Cafaro, Sr. (\"Cafaro, Sr.\"), his brother John J. Carfaro (\"J.J. Cafaro\") and sister Flora Cafaro (\"F. Cafaro\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In 2004, Oakhill Renaissance Place (\"Oakhill Renaissance\"), a commercial building owned by the Southside Community Development Corporation (\"SCDC\"), was experiencing fiscal difficulty. The Southside Medical Center hospital and several county departments were already located at the building. The SCDC offered to donate the building to the county.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The county refused the offer due to: (1) excessive expenses associated with the hospital operations, (2) extensive repairs were needed, and (3) the building was encumbered by a $440,000 Ohio Department of Development (\"ODOD\") loan balance, and $400,000 in back taxes. (Tr. 1773-1774.) In 2005, Cafaro Co. rejected SCDC's offer to sell them the property. SCDC filed for bankruptcy in May 2006 and the hospital vacated the building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Without the added expense of the hospital, the county considered purchasing Oakhill Renaissance out of bankruptcy and relocating JFS to the building. According to the state, Cafaro Sr. wanted to prevent the purchase and relocation. Though McGuffy Plaza was in great need of repair, the county was obligated to pay for the repairs under the lease. OVM hired law\n   firms located in Cuyahoga County (\"Cuyahoga Firms\") to provide legal advice regarding the Oakhill Renaissance bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Mahoning County Commissioners Anthony Traficanti (\"Traficanti\") and David Ludt (\"Ludt\") supported the purchase and relocation of JFS to Oakhill Renaissance. McNally, Sciortino, Reardon, and Reardon's successor Antonini were against the move due to the cost of assuming the ODOD lien, remediation expenses relating to the presence of lead and asbestos, the expense of operating a building with thermal heat, and the history of negative cash flow. The opponents generally referred to the facility as a money pit. (Tr. 1316, 1353, and 1598.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 12} McNally, Reardon, and Sciortino requested that county prosecutor Paul Gains (\"Gains\"), who represented the county's interests as well as those of the county officials, appoint outside counsel pursuant to R.C. 305.14\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   to assist them with filing objections to the purchase of Oakhill Renaissance from the bankruptcy estate. Gains denied the request and the officials filed suit requesting outside counsel. The denial was ultimately appealed to the court of appeals that ruled against them more than a year after the bankruptcy matter was over and ownership had transferred to the county. (Tr. 1536.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Denied counsel, McNally and Sciortino, licensed attorneys who lacked bankruptcy law experience, filed pro se objections along with Reardon. Gains filed a motion to strike the objections that was granted by the trial court for lack of standing. Some of the information furnished by the Cuyahoga Firms to OVM was also shared with McNally and Sciortino to assist them with preparing their bankruptcy case objections. The state alleges that the sharing of this information constituted bribery of the public officials by the Cafaros to influence the county's Oakhill Renaissance purchase decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 14} On July 27, 2006, the bankruptcy court approved the county's offer to purchase Oakhill Renaissance. Traficanti and Ludt voted to confirm. McNally dissented. McNally, Sciortino, and Reardon appealed the bankruptcy order approving the sale, and the Cuyahoga Firms again provided advisory assistance. The appeal was withdrawn shortly after filing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 15} On August 7, 2006, OVM filed a taxpayer's suit against the county under R.C. 309.13,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the board of commissioners, Sciortino, Reardon, and several county officials including Gains in his capacity as prosecutor. The suit requested rescission of the Oakhill Renaissance purchase. On August 15, 2006, OVM filed suit against the county for breach of the McGuffy Plaza lease agreement. The Cuyahoga Firms represented OVM in both lawsuits as well as during OVM's attempt to intervene in a\n   mandamus action initiated by the county against Reardon and Sciortino. (Tr. 1309.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Gains represented the county in the breach of lease and the taxpayers suit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The county filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that OVM, as the JFS lessor, had a personal financial interest in the case and therefore, was not a proper representative of county taxpayers in the suit. (Tr. 1802-1803.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 17} According to assistant county prosecutor Linette Stratford (\"Stratford\"), OVM refused to respond to the first set of interrogatories and request for production of documents. The county contacted the OVM attorneys of record, the Cuyahoga Firms, and received a 31-page response that included a copy of a February 2, 2006 note \"reflecting a telephone conversation between\" Carfaro, Sr. and \"Zachariah\" requesting to \"get together with\" McNally to \"strategize.\" (Tr. 1839.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The county obtained authority from the board of commissioners and the court of common pleas to appoint outside counsel in the taxpayers case for McNally, administrator Harry Tablack, Sciortino, Zachariah, and Antonini who assumed the office of treasurer in February 2007. The county served discovery regarding communications between OVM, the Cafaros, and county officials including McNally, Sciortino, Reardon, Zachariah, and Antonini due to concerns raised by attorney-client privilege claims in the discovery responses. The asserted ground for the privilege was that \"OVM and their lawyers\" \"had a common interest\" with the public officials named in the county's discovery request. (Tr. 1842.) Stratford explained that \"[w]e couldn't understand how\" attorneys were communicating \"with our clients and us not knowing about it.\" (Tr. 1843.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The trial judge ordered the production of responsive information for in camera inspection, as well as requested communications between Carfaro, Sr., J.J. Carfaro, Cafaro Co. in-house counsel James Dobran (\"Dobran\"), Cafaro Co. representatives, and the Cuyahoga Firms. The information was to be accompanied by an explanation of the legal grounds for the privilege claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 20} In March 2007, the trial court issued an opinion addressing the privilege issue, and outlined the documents that were produced for in camera review. The outline was detailed enough to let the county know which items were produced and which were not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 21} The information that was not subject to privilege was delivered to the county. Also discovered were handwritten notes regarding meetings referenced in the previously produced information to discuss Oakhill Renaissance. According to the county, Cafaro, Sr., McNally, Zachariah, and Sciortino could not recall certain meetings or communications or denied they occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 22} While the trial court deemed OVM to be a proper party to pursue the taxpayers suit, the trial court later ruled against OVM on the merits and the case was appealed. OVM dismissed the appeal in October 2007. The breach of the McGuffy Plaza lease agreement suit was settled at approximately the same time. (Tr. 1906.) The billing records of the Cuyahoga Firms confirm that the matters concluded in early October 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 23} On October 31, 2007, based on information received during discovery in the taxpayer's suit, Gains sent a letter to the Ohio Ethics Commission (\"OEC\"), reciting deposition excerpts and referencing\n   a number of accompanying documents\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   obtained from the taxpayers suit discovery. Gains suggested that the evidence supported an investigation of McNally, Reardon, Antonini, and Sciortino.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Concurrently, the county sheriff was conducting an investigation into the activities of the alleged enterprise members and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\") was investigating suspected corruption in Trumbull and Mahoning counties. The organizations joined forces in furtherance of the investigations, ultimately resulting in a number of indictments, including those in the instant case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Prosecutorial Campaign\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 25} At the end of 2007, Yavorcik decided to run for county prosecutor against Gains. Yavorcik, a long time Democrat, ran as an Independent. The state offers this fact as support for the theory that Yavorcik's campaign, supported by a number of Democrats, was motivated by an illegal agreement with the Oakhill Renaissance enterprise members to quash the ethics investigations and criminal indictments if Yavorcik was elected. Thus, Yavorcik also became a target of the agency investigations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Yavorcik was not shy about sharing his belief that Gains's role in investigating and prosecuting his own clients, the county officials who were actually represented by the office of the prosecutor, was unethical. He also held the opinion that, based on what he had heard and read, the activities that took place regarding Oakhill Renaissance were not illegal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 27} According to the record, there was no love lost between Yavorcik and Gains. In fact, Gains had a number of political antagonists including members of the Cafaro family and those ultimately indicted as a result of the Oakhill Renaissance investigations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Yavorcik's political run was unsuccessful and concluded in November 2008. However, his involvement with the alleged enterprise members resulted in the instant case. Yavorcik is accused of being a member of the criminal enterprise who acted \"with purpose to commit or promote or facilitate the commission of Engaging in a Pattern of Corrupt Activity\" by conspiring to conceal or cover-up the investigation and charges arising from the Oakhill Renaissance conspiracy by accepting campaign contributions as bribes, and omitting or misclassifying information in campaign financial reports. Amended indictment, pg. 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Yavorcik's three bribery convictions were for violations of R.C. 2921.02(B) between March 1, 2008 and November 4, 2008, alleging that he:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Count 8: knowingly solicited or accepted money, services to corrupt or improperly influence him regarding the discharge of his official duty \"either before or after\" being elected or sworn in;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Count 9: knowingly solicited or accepted a $2,500 campaign contribution from Antonini to corrupt or improperly influence him regarding the discharge of his official duty \"either before or after\" being elected or sworn in;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Count 10: knowingly solicited or accepted a $2,500 campaign contribution from Antonini to corrupt or improperly influence him regarding the discharge of his official duty \"either before or after\" being elected or sworn in.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Amended indictment, pg. 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 30} The jury also found Yavorcik guilty of tampering with records on October 23, 2008, by filing an inaccurate 2008\n   pre-election campaign report. The tampering charge stems from the failure to properly list $15,000 received from F. Cafaro to be used for a poll to determine Yavorcik's potential election success. Yavorcik deposited the check into his personal account and issued a $15,000 check for the poll. The poll was listed on the report as an in-kind contribution from Yavorcik. (Tr. 2297.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 31} In addition to multiple witnesses, portions of audio and video recordings were provided by FBI informant and public relations person Harry Strabala (\"Strabala\"). FBI agent Wally Sines (\"Sines\") introduced himself to Strabala in 2002 or 2003 and asked him to be a \"listening post\" for \"issues of public corruption.\" (Tr. 1004.) In 2005, Strabala became a paid FBI informant and recorded conversations with various public officials and others, some of whom are alleged to be part of the enterprise in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Yavorcik sought Strabala's professional assistance with his prosecutorial campaign and was first recorded on February 28, 2008, the day that he filed his intention to run for office. Strabala was instructed by the FBI to \"create conversation\" with Yavorcik so that he would \"be critical\" of Gains and to \"try to align\" himself with Yavorcik so that Yavorcik \"would feel open enough\" to discuss matters freely. (Tr. 1013.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Strabala identified the participants in select excerpts of the FBI surveillance recordings. The technical evidence involved various conversations conducted at functions, restaurants, and meetings. The content introduced for the record focused on Antonini, McNally, Reardon, and others supporting Yavorcik's campaign. Yavorcik publicly and freely acknowledged while seeking petition signatures that he was a long-time Democrat running as an Independent against the Democratic incumbent, Gains.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 34} According to the amended indictment, disbarred attorney Richard Goldberg, a friend of Carfaro, Sr., was \"involved with recruiting Yavorcik to run against Gains.\" Amended Indictment, pg. 4. FBI agent Dean Hassman (\"Agent Hassman\") testified that Yavorcik, who already knew Goldberg, asked Goldberg to approach Cafaro, Sr. to seek campaign support. Yavorcik ultimately met with Cafaro, Sr. in person to seek support. Cafaro, Sr. informed him that the campaign funds would not be available until the campaign finance report deadline so that the contribution \"would not be reflected until after the campaign was over.\" (Tr. 2271.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Yavorcik asked Strabala early in the campaign planning how a \"527 PAC\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   works, a question that followed Yavorcik's expression of concern about the possible public political impact of accepting money from the Cafaros. Strabala advised that a \"527 PAC\" allows contributions without identifying who contributed or how much. Strabala explained that 527 PACs are not illegal and are widely used, including by recent presidential candidates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 36} There were also discussions of why Yavorcik's supporters disliked Gains and that many attorneys were concerned about supporting Yavorcik against Gains due to potential retribution. The relationship between Gains and the Cafaro family was rather contentious, and the Cafaro family historically supported Gains's campaign opponents, including one launched by a Cafaro in-house attorney several years earlier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Yavorcik states in the FBI recordings that he did not believe the Oakhill Renaissance activities were illegal, and that it was his opinion that it was unethical for Gains, as prosecutor, to prosecute his own clients, the county officials. The latter opinion is supported by the ultimate request by Gains, a year after the grand jury subpoenas were issued by Gains's office, for appointment of three special prosecutors recommended by Gains to handle the cases due to the conflict of interest. Gains advised that the subpoenas were issued by his office at the request of the OEC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Gains, who has been prosecutor since 1982, testified that he was a former policeman who was sworn in as prosecutor after the scheduled date because he was shot in his home for refusing to accept \"mafia money.\" (Tr. 1949.) Gains alternately was not aware or could not recall that Yavorcik supported Gains's opponent in the primary, was supported by certain judges, was endorsed by the police union during his campaign, or that he told others regarding Yavorcik, \"f**k that punk.\" (Tr. 2011.) Gains did recall that when Yavorcik applied for a job with his office, he refused to hire him because of the circumstances surrounding Yavorcik's departure from the Youngstown's prosecutor's office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 39} When working for the city, Yavorcik discovered that the city was arresting people and charging them with a crime on Friday, and those arrested would have to remain in jail through the weekend without arraignment. At the Monday hearing, \"the charges would mysteriously disappear.\" (Tr. 2012.) Yavorcik resigned on a Friday, sued the city the following Monday and later was awarded $10,000 for legal fees. (Tr. 2011.) Gains stated that Yavorcik was motivated by profit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Gains has known the Cafaros for years and said that he did not consider the Cafaros to be political enemies but he does not like Cafaro, Sr. Gains admitted that he was angry that Yavorcik entered the campaign and was allowed to remain on the ballot. He felt that Yavorcik's campaign as an Independent was a lie because he was really a Democrat. Gains also denied disliking Yavorcik, saying he had no feelings about him either way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 41} The $120,000 amount of the Cafaro contributions was a point of focus by the state. Gains testified that he had never heard of campaign contributions as significant as those made to Yavorcik by the Cafaros, though he admitted that it was not illegal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Another mainstay of the state's case was that Yavorcik intentionally and expressly cooperated with the asserted cover-up. The county public officials who testified in the case, each of whom were indicted in other cases or in the instant case, testified under plea agreements with transactional immunity and an agreement to cooperate with the prosecution. Every official testified that they \"believed,\" \"thought,\" or was \"of the impression\" that, if Yavorcik was elected, the investigation would stop. This was so in spite of the fact that, as Gains testified, the OEC and sheriff's department were driving the investigation and special prosecutors had been appointed by the court so there would be no conflict of interest by the county prosecutor's office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Antonini's boyfriend, Michael Kurt Welsh (\"Welsh\"), also testifying under a plea agreement based on his cooperation in the case, stated that he \"believed\" Yavorcik would be more favorable than Gains in light of the Oakhill Renaissance investigations, which he labeled as a \"witch hunt,\" and Welsh's pending legal problems. (Tr. 2171.) Welsh was a heavy drinker and faced multiple DUIs and a felonious assault case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Welsh talked with Yavorcik about representing him. Welsh was often inebriated, including when speaking with Yavorcik on surveillance recordings. Yavorcik did not represent Welsh in any of his cases. Welsh told the state during his proffer meetings for the current case that he was concerned that if Gains found out that he worked on Yavorcik's campaign, he would be treated unfairly in his pending cases. (Tr. 2198.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 45} The state also pointed to certain fiscal activities as evidence of corruption and conspiracy such as a campaign finance report entry that listed a $250 campaign donation as a loan. Agent Hassman testified that he has worked in the Youngstown area for 20 years and investigates financial crimes with a focus on public corruption. The FBI, who already had several county officials under investigation, assisted the county sheriff's department and OEC:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   The allegations that were surfacing was that a number of public officials started having private concealed contacts with the Cafaro family and the Cafaro lawyers and that those contacts were not transparent and in an adverse position to the official position of Mahoning County who officially had voted two to one to move Job and Family Services and to purchase the building.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   (Tr. 2262.) Agent Hassman also reviewed the records of the Cuyahoga Firms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 46} In March 2010, Agent Hassman and Special Agent Mike Pikunas (\"Agent Pikunas\") interviewed Yavorcik at his residence. Yavorcik told them that one of the individuals that he approached for campaign support was Cafaro, Sr. who told Yavorcik he would be willing to make a contribution after the campaign finance deadline prior to the general election. Cafaro Sr. advised him that it was legal to do so and it was not unusual to borrow funds to sustain a campaign and later repay the loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 47} J.J. Cafaro, F. Cafaro, and Cafaro, Sr. each contributed a check to the campaign for $40,000. The checks were issued on October 16, and 17, 2008. Agent Hassman's calculation of Yavorcik's available cash for the campaign, after deducting loans from Yavorcik, family members, and others, was $150,000, $135,000 of which was sourced to the Cafaros, including the $15,000 provided by F. Cafaro to fund the political poll.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 48} The primary campaign finance and strategy meeting participants were Antonini, Sciortino, McNally, Reardon, Bishop Jennings, a prominent local pastor, Herman Hill, a politically active councilman, and Khaled Tabbara, a media consultant working with the campaign.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 49} Some public officials stated during the secretly recorded meetings that their \" 'asses were on the line.' \" (Tr. 2279.) Meeting attendees were aware of the Cafaros' contributions because the topic sometimes came up. Committee members confirmed to Yavorcik that he could properly borrow campaign funds and pay them back later when received.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 50} Agent Hassman read from several 2008 campaign finance reports. Yavorcik's October 23, 2008 report listed $2,500 loans each from the committees of Reardon, Sciortino for auditor, and Antonini for treasurer. Reardon's campaign finance report listed a $2,500 amount as a donation, indicating no need for repayment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 51} Yavorcik's post-general election December 12, 2008 report did not indicate cash contributions from several individuals including $200 from McNally though cash contributions occurring by November 3, 2008, must be listed. Agent Hassman stated that the report had not been amended as of two days prior to his testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 52} The $15,000 poll check Yavorcik received to secure a poll to gauge the possibility of a successful campaign was deposited into Yavorcik's personal account. Yavorcik issued a check for that amount to the polling company. According to Agent Hassman, the funds flowed from \"Flora Cafaro personally to the Cafaro [Co.] checking account\" to Yavorcik. (Tr. 2290.) Polls are legitimate campaign expenses for campaign accounts when properly reported.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 53} A March 20, 2008 \"receipt or invoice\" was issued by Yavorcik to \"William M. Cafaro/American Gladiator Fitness Center.\" (Tr. 2290.) The invoice is for \"services rendered\" from February 20, 2008. Agent Hassman speculated that the document was backdated to reflect services rendered prior to Yavorcik's filing of his intention to run for office on February 22, 2008.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 54} An FBI video surveillance contains a conversation during which campaign committee members discussed making cash payments to the poll workers. The state argued that Yavorcik was aware of the conversation but failed to include the information on his financial reports. Yavorcik advised that he was not in the room at that time, as the video appears to confirm, and was not aware of the payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 55} Also during the October 2010 interview, Yavorcik stated he was aware that Gains initiated a referral to the OEC regarding Oakhill Renaissance. On the question of Yavorcik's motives in entering the prosecutorial race, Agent Hassford attributed the following statements to Yavorcik:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   Counsel: Did you question the defendant about the motives of the public officials who were helping him in his 2008 campaign?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   Witness: I did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   Counsel: What did the defendant tell you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   Witness: He acknowledged that\n   <em>\n    looking back\n   </em>\n   he felt that the public officials who were helping him may have had ulterior, other motivations in wanting him to get elected.

Appellant argued that the state failed to prove venue under R.C. 2901.12(H)(3) or (4) for Count 1, pattern of corrupt activity, and Count 3, conspiracy to engage in a pattern of corrupt activity. As a result of that failure, Yavorcik offered that venue was also improper for the remaining counts. The trial court responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   Defendant Yavorcik's motion for acquittal is denied. The motion begins with a false premise. It posits that the state's failure to prove venue for count 1, engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, and count 3, conspiracy to engage in a pattern of corrupt activity, would necessarily mean that no venue could be established for the remaining counts in the indictment in which defendant was found guilty. The defendant ignores the fact that for each count, the court defined the term \"in Cuyahoga County\" to have a broader meaning than merely limiting all activity to having occurred within the borders of Cuyahoga County. The jury was instructed that each of the counts represented a distinct and independent question from the other counts; the jury\n   was instructed that the counts were not inter-related with each other.

The asserted common purpose of the Oakhill Renaissance enterprise was to \"improperly influence elected officials in Mahoning County with money and legal services\" to prevent the county from purchasing Oakhill Renaissance and relocating JFS to the facility. The sole event involving Cuyahoga County was the retention of, and services rendered by, the Cuyahoga Firms involving Yavorcik's alleged \"co-conspirators.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   {\u00b6 89} Twenty-six witnesses testified in the case including FBI agents, Cafaro Co. employees, J.J.

None of the witnesses testified that Yavorcik was recruited to run for prosecutor. Instead, the testimony reveals that Yavorcik announced his campaign intentions and sought support from individuals including the alleged enterprise members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   {\u00b6 94} The evidence also fails to support that Yavorcik decided to run for prosecutor so that, as \"super prosecutor,\" he could interfere with the activities of the FBI, County sheriff, OEC, and the appointed special prosecutors, to halt all investigations regarding the alleged enterprise members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   {\u00b6 95} Reardon testified that he did not believe that he and the others committed any crimes, and felt that the investigation was politically motivated. Reardon learned that Yavorcik, whom he had known for a number of years, was running for prosecutor when he heard it \"in the news,\" and he approached Yavorcik to ask how he could be involved with the campaign. (Tr. 2243.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   {\u00b6 96} Reardon was not told that Yavorcik would halt the investigation. \"I assumed it would go away.\" (Tr. 2255.) \"[T]ruthfully, long prior to [meeting with Yavorcik], I had assumed that [the investigation] would go away if Paul Gains was no longer the prosecutor.\" (Tr. 2255.) \"I felt and still do that Paul Gains was politically motivated in going after us in trying to bring down his political enemies.\" (Tr. 2256.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   {\u00b6 97} Antonini said that she \"believed\" that a prosecutor would have the power to impede or stop an active investigation. (Tr. 2161.) Antonini's boyfriend, Welsh, who suffered from alcoholism and legal problems, said that he supported Yavorcik because of a \"belief\" that Yavorcik would be more favorable to his legal concerns with\n   multiple DUIs and a pending felonious assault case than Gains. (Tr. 2171.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   {\u00b6 98} Welsh also believed the Oakhill Renaissance investigation was a \"witch hunt\" and he \"was hopeful that\" Yavorcik's becoming prosecutor \"would benefit people that I was associated with.\" (Tr. 2170-2171.) Welsh's additional concern was that working on Yavorcik's campaign would work against him if Gains remained in office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   {\u00b6 99} McNally never had an agreement with Yavorcik to help him get elected and was not aware of any \"arrangements\" between Yavorcik and Antonini, Welsh, Reardon, Sciortino, or Cafaro, Sr. (Tr. 1582.) \"They\" were all \"upset,\" felt that they were being treated unfairly and believed that \"there was a fair amount of politics involved\" in the investigations.

GALLAGHER, J., CONCURS IN JUDGMENT ONLY WITH SEPARATE OPINION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   {\u00b6 109} I concur in judgment only. The state charged Yavorcik because of his campaign pledges, made during the failed attempt to become the Mahoning County Prosecutor in 2008, (1) to end an investigation instigated by the Ohio Ethics Commission, and (2) to prevent a Mahoning County prosecution that apparently never materialized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   {\u00b6 110} According to the state, before 2008, a law firm located in Cuyahoga County provided legal advice to members of the alleged conspiracy and it also received a faxed copy of Mahoning County's purchase proposal for the Oakhill Renaissance property that was orally deemed \"confidential\" under R.C. 102.03(B) by Yavorcik's political opponent-under R.C. 102.99(B) it is a first-degree misdemeanor offense to disclose a document \"designated\" confidential. The state indicted Yavorcik because of a misdemeanor offense allegedly having been committed by a codefendant within Cuyahoga County before Yavorcik allegedly joined the criminal enterprise. This is a thin argument given the local resources\n   devoted to this prosecution; however, Ohio's criminal venue statute, R.C. 2901.12(H), is broad. Thereunder, any offense constitutes a basis for venue, and the misdemeanor suffices to establish venue in Cuyahoga County for that defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   {\u00b6 111} Although the state repeatedly referred to the local law firm and its attorneys as coconspirators in front of the jury in its attempt to prove venue, nothing in the record substantiates the allegation. The state contends that the law firm's client authorized the disclosure of work product to a government official, which he used as part of his official, overt effort to prevent the county from purchasing the property, a purchase he believed to be antithetical to the interests of his constituents. Nothing in the record demonstrates that the law firm engaged in criminal behavior in furtherance of a conspiracy. Simply providing legal advice to a third party with the consent of a client does not make an attorney a coconspirator for the purposes of establishing venue. There are no allegations that the law firm was aware of criminal behavior that required reporting or that it knowingly facilitated criminal objectives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   {\u00b6 112} The state's position is concerning. At the least, it creates a chilling effect on criminal defendants seeking attorneys in other jurisdictions to represent them, at the risk of creating venue in another county. But more important, taking the state's theory to its logical ends, any criminal defense attorney could be considered a coconspirator by merely providing legal advice to a person who may have committed a crime. That proposition, if accepted, would have devastating consequences for the criminal defense community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   {\u00b6 113} Nevertheless, I agree that venue has not been established for the offenses with which Yavorcik was charged. \"[\n   <em>\n    E\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    ach defendant\n   </em>\n   possesses a constitutional right to be tried in the 'district wherein the crime shall have been committed.' \" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

It is an individual right based on the defendant's conduct. Thus, the state must prove venue with respect to Yavorcik and his alleged crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   {\u00b6 114} At trial the state told the jury that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-213\">\n   Venue lies in Cuyahoga County because the conspiracy that was formed, because the legal services were paid in Cuyahoga County, legal services were provided by [local law firms] in Cuyahoga County.

Tr. 2565:22-2566:6, 2567:1-3. The state repeated that argument in this appeal: \"At trial, the State showed venue over [\n   <em>\n    Yavorcik\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    was established in Cuyahoga County by the overt acts of\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Yavorcik's\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    coconspirators\n   </em>\n   in relation to the Cleveland law firm, * * * and its involvement in the underlying conspiracy in the Oakhill [Renaissance] matter.\" (Emphasis added.) According to the state, because venue may have been proper over crimes allegedly committed by codefendants, the state may prosecute Yavorcik's subsequent concealment efforts as part of the original conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   {\u00b6 115} Venue, although not jurisdictional, is a limit on the state's power to prosecute crimes. On this point, the law regarding\n   the statute of limitations as applied to conspiratorial charges is instructive.

R.C. 2901.12(H) (\"the offender\n   <em>\n    may be tried for all those offenses\n   </em>\n   in any jurisdiction in which one of\n   those offenses or any element of\n   <em>\n    one of those\n   </em>\n   offenses occurred.\" (Emphasis added.) ). Because none of the elements of the offenses for which Yavorcik stood trial were based on conduct occurring in Cuyahoga County, the state failed to establish venue. Yavorcik's convictions cannot be sustained.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-222\">\n    Titles refer to the capacities held by the individual during the 2005 to 2009 time period.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-223\">\n    It appears that, based on the jury instructions, the proper time period for this count of the amended indictment is also 2005 to 2009.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-224\">\n    R.C. 305.14 provides that, upon application of the prosecuting attorney and the board of county commissions, the court of common pleas may authorize \"the board to employ legal counsel to assist the prosecuting attorney, the board, or any other county officer in any matter of public business coming before such board or officer, and in the prosecution or defense of any action or proceeding in which such board or officer is a party or has an interest, in its official capacity.\" Generally, where a prosecuting attorney has a conflict of interest, the prosecutor's approval is not required in addition to that of the county commissioners.\n    <em>\n     State ex rel.
