Day and Charles J. Przyjemski.\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-6\">\n   The defendant, Paul J. Przyjemski, appeals from the order denying his motion to vacate a judgment entered in the Probate and Family Court on an equity complaint concerning certain parcels of real estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . This dispute arose among four brothers over two parcels of real estate. The first parcel is recorded land located at 84 Cliffe Avenue in Lexington. The second parcel is an adjacent lot that is registered land. The parcels were owned by the brothers' mother, Marcella Przyjemski. In 1999 and 2000, following her husband's death, Marcella\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   conveyed the properties to Paul. Sometime thereafter, Marcella executed a will that purported to retain a life estate in the properties for herself and to create a trust for the benefit of her four children. Marcella passed away approximately five years later. Her estate was not probated. In 2016, the plaintiffs filed a complaint in equity seeking, inter alia, the imposition of a resulting trust, the sale of the properties, and distribution of the net proceeds. The complaint and summons were served on Paul at his last and usual place of abode and by first class mail (to the same address), both by a process server.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Paul failed to answer the complaint and did not appear for any court hearings despite a scheduling order that provided that if Paul did not appear, \"the case will go to judgment.\" Thereafter, judgment entered; it was docketed on January 31, 2017. The judgment, in essence, mirrored the proposed language set forth in the plaintiffs' motion for default judgment. In March of 2017, Paul filed a motion to vacate the judgment which, after notice to all parties, was denied in a margin notation. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <em>\n    Subject matter jurisdiction\n   </em>\n   . Paul argues that the Probate and Family Court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the adjacent lot because it is registered land. We agree. \"Subject matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred by consent, conduct or waiver\" and therefore may be raised for the first time on appeal.\n   <em>\n    Litton Business Sys., Inc\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Revenue\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"813456\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/383/619/#p622\">\n    383 Mass. 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 622 (1981). The Land Court has exclusive original jurisdiction over complaints affecting title to registered land, with certain exceptions which are not relevant here. See G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 1 (\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   1/2). Accordingly, the Probate and Family Court judge could not \"fashion a judgment which has the effect of imposing an encumbrance on the registered title.\"\n   <em>\n    Feinzig\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ficksman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1606128\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/42/113/#p116\">\n    42 Mass. App. Ct. 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 116 (1997). See G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 86. Because the resulting trust is an encumbrance\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   on registered land, so much of the judgment as relates to the adjacent parcel must be vacated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Motion to vacate judgment\n   </em>\n   . Paul sought to vacate the judgment contending that he \"never received a copy of the complaint.\" His motion is tantamount to a motion filed pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 60 (b) (1),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=365%20Mass.%20828\">\n    365 Mass. 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1974).
