(\"Willoughby Supply\"), appeals the judgment of the Lake County Court of Common Pleas granting the Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss filed by appellee, Ryan E. Villhauer (\"Villhauer\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   At issue is whether the trial court erred in dismissing appellant's claim on an account against Villhauer. For the reasons that follow, we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The statement of facts that follows is derived from the complaint with its attachments filed by Willoughby Supply. On or about August 8, 2014, \"the Defendants,\" meaning Villhauer and his company Superior Structures of Ohio, L.L.C. (\"Superior Structures\"), \"made application for credit with [Willoughby Supply] by executing an Application and Agreement,\" a copy of which was attached to the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On page 2 of the Application and Agreement, Villhauer stated he was the \"Owner/President\" of Superior Structures. He also provided his personal information, including his date of birth, driver's license number, home address, cell phone number, bank information, and credit accounts with other supply companies. He also stated he was authorized to order and pick up material from Willoughby Supply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On page 3 of the Application and Agreement, in the signature section on the line for \"firm name,\" Villhauer wrote \"Superior Structures of Ohio.\" He also signed his name on behalf of Superior Structures as its \"Owner/President\" and dated it August 8, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Directly beneath the section that Villhauer signed on behalf of Superior Structures, Page 3 also contains a section providing for a personal guarantee. This section stated in all capital letters and in a font size larger than other terms on the page:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 6} * * * THIS APPLICATION WILL NOT BE APPROVED IF PERSONAL GUARANTEE IS NOT SIGNED * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 7} IN CONSIDERATION OF THE EXTENSION OF CREDIT BY [WILLOUGHBY SUPPLY] TO [SUPERIOR STRUCTURES], AND\n   <em>\n    AS A SUBSTANTIAL AND MATERIAL INDUCEMENT\n   </em>\n   TO [WILLOUGHBY SUPPLY] TO GRANT SUCH CREDIT, THE UNDERSIGNED INDIVIDUAL [VILLHAUER] PERSONALLY GUARANTEES THE FULL AND PROMPT PAYMENT OF ALL AMOUNTS PAYABLE TO [WILLOUGHBY SUPPLY] FOR GOODS PURCHASED BY SAID ENTITY. (Emphasis in original.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Directly beneath this language, Villhauer hand-wrote his name by printing it on the \"name\" line and dated the personal guarantee August 8, 2014. However, he left the line for his signature blank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The complaint alleged that Willoughby Supply granted credit to Villhauer and Superior Structures, resulting in an unpaid balance due and owing as of July 31, 2016, in the amount of $28,832. A copy of the statement of account, dated August 29, 2016, attached to the complaint, shows that Superior Structures made multiple purchases of materials from Willoughby Supply between July 2015 and July 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The complaint alleged that Villhauer and Superior Structures failed and refused to pay Willoughby Supply the balance due and owing, which, as of December 21, 2016, including interest, was $30,865.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On December 29, 2016, Willoughby Supply filed its complaint against Villhauer and Superior Structures. Instead of filing an answer, on April 7, 2017, Villhauer filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that he could not be held liable because he did not sign the personal guarantee. Willoughby Supply filed a brief in opposition. The trial court granted the motion, simply finding that \"Villhauer did not sign the Application and Agreement attached to Plaintiff's Complaint.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Villhauer failed to file an answer on behalf of Superior Structures and, as a result, Willoughby Supply filed a motion for default judgment against Superior Structures. The trial court granted the motion and entered default judgment in favor of Willoughby Supply and against Superior Structures, making the court's order granting Villhauer's motion to dismiss a final appealable order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Willoughby Supply appeals the trial court's judgment granting Villhauer's motion to dismiss, asserting the following for its sole assignment of error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 14} \"The trial court erred by granting defendant-appellee's motion to dismiss where, if the court were to presume the allegations of the complaint as true and make all reasonable inferences in favor of plaintiff-appellant, a cause of action does exist under which defendant-appellee could be found liable on the personal guarantee.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 15} A motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted is procedural in nature and tests the sufficiency of the complaint.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

THE COMPLAINT PROVIDES FOR RELIEF ON A THEORY THAT VILLHAUER IS INDIVIDUALLY LIABLE.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 22} First, Willoughby Supply alleged that both Villhauer and Superior Structures applied for credit by executing the application; that Willoughby Supply granted credit to both of them, resulting in an unpaid balance; and that they have failed and refused to repay the balance owned. While Villhauer argues his purported signature on the personal guarantee is insufficient to impose liability, the trial court was required to determine if the complaint provided for relief \"on any possible theory.\" Thus, as an alternative to the guarantee theory of liability, the allegations of the complaint provide for relief on a theory of Villhauer's individual liability on the account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 23}\n   <strong>\n    II. THE COMPLAINT PROVIDES FOR RELIEF ON A THEORY THAT VILLHAUER SIGNED THE GUARANTEE.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Second, while Villhauer argues he cannot be liable on the guarantee because he did not sign it, it is not quite accurate to say he did not sign the guarantee. In fact, he does not dispute he\n   <em>\n    hand-wrote\n   </em>\n   his printed name and\n   <em>\n    dated\n   </em>\n   the personal guarantee. As a result, this case is very different from a case in which a purported guarantor did not write his name on the guarantee in any way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 25} \"A contract can only be interpreted if the provisions are ambiguous or uncertain.\"\n   <em>\n    Career &amp; Technical Assn. v.

In support of a finding that he intended to be bound, Villhauer provided his personal information, bank information, and a list of his credit accounts with other suppliers, apparently with a view to induce Willoughby Supply to provide credit to Superior Structures. In fact, the notice in the guarantee section stated that \"the undersigned individual,\" i.e., Villhauer, \"personally guarantees\" the payment of all amounts due as a \"material inducement\" to Willoughby Supply to grant credit to Superior Structures. Further, directly below the additional notice that \"THIS APPLICATION WILL NOT BE APPROVED IF PERSONAL GUARANTEE IS NOT SIGNED,\" Villhauer wrote his name on the space provided for his \"name\" and dated the guarantee. He could have crossed out the personal guarantee section; left it blank; or sought another supplier, but he chose not to. In light of the uncertainty and ambiguity created by Villhauer's printed signature on the guarantee, Willoughby Supply may present\n   parol evidence of his intent to be bound thereby and potentially prevail on a guarantee theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 27}\n   <strong>\n    III. THE COMPLAINT PROVIDES FOR RELIEF ON A RATIFICATION THEORY.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Third, ratification also provides a possible theory of recovery. In a similar case involving the\n   <em>\n    same creditor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Willoughby Supply Company, Inc. v. Inghram\n   </em>\n   , 11th Dist.,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-952\">\n    2015-Ohio-952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20N.E.3d%20230\">\n    30 N.E.3d 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Inghram, the person against whom Willoughby Supply sought to enforce the guarantee, denied the signature on the personal guarantee was his. However, Willoughby Supply's financial officer testified he contacted Inghram and he orally ratified the guarantee. This court stated that to prove ratification, the proponent must show the principal engaged in conduct, with full knowledge of the facts, which manifested his intent to ratify the unauthorized transaction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13. This court held there was competent, credible evidence that Inghram ratified the guarantee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Here, even if Villhauer's signature on the personal guarantee was insufficient, by accepting more than $28,000 worth of supplies on credit during the course of an entire year from Willoughby Supply, knowing it would not have approved the credit application if Villhauer had not signed the guarantee, Willoughby Supply may recover on a ratification theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 30}\n   <strong>\n    IV. THE COMPLAINT PROVIDES FOR RELIEF UNDER THE \"LEADING OBJECT RULE.\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Fourth, Villhauer argued below that, because he did not sign the personal guarantee, enforcement of the Application and Agreement against him is barred by the statute of frauds. R.C. 1335.05 provides: \"No action shall be brought whereby to charge the defendant, upon a special promise, to answer for the debt * * * of another * * * unless the agreement upon which such action is brought * * * is in writing and signed by the party to be charged therewith * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Here, even if Villhauer did not sign the personal guarantee, the leading object rule is an exception to the statute of frauds. In\n   <em>\n    Inghram, supra\n   </em>\n   , this court stated: \"The leading object rule provides that oral contracts by third parties guaranteeing another's debt are not within the Statute of Frauds, if the guarantor's principal purpose is to benefit his or her own business or pecuniary interests.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8, citing\n   <em>\n    Wilson Floors Co. v. Sciota Park Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6711721\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-2d/54/451/\">\n    54 Ohio St.2d 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=377%20N.E.2d%20514\">\n    377 N.E.2d 514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , syllabus (1978). \"The determination of whether an oral promise to answer for another's debt exists, and is outside the Statute of Frauds, is a question of fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 33} In\n   <em>\n    Inghram, supra\n   </em>\n   , this court applied the leading object rule in finding Inghram's oral guarantee was enforceable since he was the president and owner of the debtor-company and he clearly benefited by being able to purchase from Willoughby Supply materials on credit he needed to keep the company operating.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23, 31. Each of these circumstances is present here. Thus, the leading object rule provides another possible theory of recovery for Willoughby Supply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 34} We accordingly conclude, the trial court erred in dismissing the complaint. Willoughby Supply's sole assignment of error has merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 35} For the reasons stated in the opinion of this court, it is the judgment and order of this court that the judgment of the Lake County Court of Common Pleas is reversed, and this matter is remanded\n   to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   TIMOTHY P.

This allegation is flatly contradicted by the actual Application and Agreement attached to the Complaint. By attaching the credit Application and Agreement, the sufficiency of Willoughby Supply's Complaint must be considered in light of the fact that Villhauer did not sign the Application in his personal capacity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Civ.R. 10(C) (\"[a] copy of any written instrument attached to a pleading is a part of the pleading for all purposes\");\n   <em>\n    Radtke v.

Willoughby Supply failed to allege any basis for Villhauer's personal liability other than his execution of the credit Application.

At most, Villhauer's potential liability is that of a guarantor of the debt.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
