On appeal, he focuses on those claims related to (1) the ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel; (2) the defendant's absence from a pretrial conference; (3) the sufficiency of the evidence; and (4) the prosecutor's opening and closing arguments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, he claims that the motion judge abused her discretion by not holding an evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Ineffective assistance\n   </em>\n   . The defendant claims that his trial and appellate counsel, in a variety of ways, provided him ineffective assistance. We review claims of ineffective assistance of counsel using the two-prong test outlined in\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Saferian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"314554\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/366/89/#p96\">\n    366 Mass. 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 96 (1974). The defendant bears the burden of establishing that counsel's behavior fell \"measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer\" and that such behavior has \"likely deprived [him] of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pike\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1168008\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/53/757/#p760\">\n    53 Mass.

Without such statements, we cannot conclude that either counsel's numerous alleged failures were \"manifestly unreasonable\" tactical decisions.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Acevedo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3783409\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/446/435/#p442\">\n    446 Mass. 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 442 (2006), quoting\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3871295\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/374/722/#p728\">\n    374 Mass. 722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 728 (1978) (\"A strategic or tactical decision by counsel will not be considered ineffective assistance unless that decision was 'manifestly unreasonable' when made\"). Accordingly, \"because there is no affidavit from trial [or appellate] counsel, the defendant's assertions about what counsel did not do is speculative and need not be considered.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"411762\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/441/291/#p304\">\n    441 Mass. 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 304 (2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Waived arguments\n   </em>\n   . The remaining arguments raised by the defendant concern his absence from a pretrial conference, the judge's failure to rule on a motion for a required finding of not guilty, and the prosecutor's opening and closing arguments. We note that \"the trial judge correctly observed that these claims ... could have been raised through [direct appeal] and were not.\"\n   <em>\n    Fogarty\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3885319\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/406/103/#p110\">\n    406 Mass. at 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, they are waived. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (c) (2), as appearing in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=435%20Mass.%201501\">\n    435 Mass. 1501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001). Even if these claims were not waived, they are without merit, and thus there is no risk that justice miscarried. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Randolph\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"201298\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/438/290/#p294\">\n    438 Mass. 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 294-295 (2002) (standard of review for unpreserved errors is substantial risk of miscarriage of justice).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   First, the defendant argues that he was unlawfully absent from the May 2, 1974, pretrial conference. However, the portion of Mass. R. Crim. P. 11 (a), as appearing in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=442%20Mass.%201509\">\n    442 Mass. 1509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004), requiring the defendant's presence at a pretrial conference, did not exist at the time of the defendant's convictions. In any event, even under the modern rule, \"[a] defendant need not be present ... at any proceeding where evidence is not to be taken.\" Mass. R. Crim. P. 18 (a) (3),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=378%20Mass.%20888\">\n    378 Mass. 888\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979). Moreover, even accepting the defendant's contention that he was denied a right to attend a pretrial conference, he has failed to raise any substantial issue as there is no affidavit from trial counsel to support this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Additionally, based on the limited record before us, it is unclear whether trial counsel ever filed a motion for a required finding of not guilty. In the defendant's brief, he frames his request for a required finding of not guilty as a request for a jury instruction made by trial counsel. We are not presented with any motion, or record thereof, that was filed by trial counsel. Therefore, the defendant's argument that the trial judge failed to rule on any such motion is without merit. Even if we consider the defendant's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, the defendant fares no better. The defendant's argument, insofar as we understand it, rests on the assertion that the Commonwealth's identification evidence did not outweigh the evidence presented by the defendant's alibi witnesses. As the weight and credibility of the evidence are factors solely within the province of the jury, the defendant's argument fails. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dubois\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3788689\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/451/20/#p28\">\n    451 Mass. 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 28 (2008) (\"The weight and credibility of the evidence is the province of the jury\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Likewise, the defendant's claim that the prosecutor's opening and closing statements denied him a fair trial is unsupported. Prosecutors may \"argue forcefully for the defendant's conviction.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"310260\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/427/336/#p350\">\n    427 Mass. 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 350 (1998).
