However, after stating \"You may consider this testimony ... about the first complaint for specific limited purposes,\" the judge omitted the following sentence: \"You may not consider this testimony as evidence that the assault in fact occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2823323\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/445/217/#p218\">\n    445 Mass. at 247-248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, this omission did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. The judge's initial instruction admonished the jury to use Jim's testimony for its proper, limited purpose: \"to permit you to find that the testimony that [Estelle] gave is supported or detracted by\" Jim's testimony. Moreover, Jim did not testify about the substance of Estelle's first complaint on direct; he merely clarified some terms he used in his messages to Estelle. Most importantly, the judge's final charge, given on the same day as Jim's testimony, thoroughly explained the first complaint doctrine as\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   required. Taken together, the judge's instructions sufficiently mitigated the risk that the jury used Jim's testimony as proof that the assaults in fact occurred. See\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=91%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%20651\">\n    91 Mass.

Finally, the defendant argues, again for the first time on appeal, that the judge abused her discretion in allowing the prosecutor to read into the record statements from Estelle's postassault hospital records. The defendant now claims these statements were inadmissible hearsay that improperly corroborated Estelle's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Even assuming that this evidence was hearsay, the prosecutor used it permissibly. Estelle's hospital records were admitted in evidence at the defendant's request to support his theory that Estelle fabricated her allegations. Defense counsel referenced these records in his opening statement, during his cross-examination of Estelle, and in his closing argument. The defendant having introduced the hospital records in evidence, the prosecutor was free to use them as well.
