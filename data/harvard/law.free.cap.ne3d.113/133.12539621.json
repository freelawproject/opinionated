LaFave, and Ralph C. Brown, Jr. and Patricia A. Brown appeal the August 3, 2017 order of the Guernsey County Court of Common Pleas granting appellee's motion for summary judgment and finding that appellee owns and is vested with all right, title and interest in and to the subsurface of the subject property. Appellee is Mid-Ohio Coal Company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF FACTS AND THE CASE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} This case arises out of a dispute over the ownership of mineral rights appurtenant to real estate located in Guernsey County. Appellee contends and the\n   court found it holds title to all subsurface rights without limitation, based upon the interpretation of the deed recorded by Jesse and Sarah Linkhorn in 1882. Appellant contends that a proper reading of the Linkhorn deed limits the appellee's claim to the subsurface coal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The issue of ownership of the mineral rights in this property was considered by the trial court in a prior case. In 1993 appellants Ralph C. Brown, Jr. and Patricia A. Brown filed a quiet title action in the Guernsey County Court of Common Pleas claiming ownership of the mineral interests in the same property. Mid-Ohio Coal was not named as a party in that litigation. In that case, no party responded to the complaint and the Browns were granted default judgment.\n   <em>\n    Ralph C. Brown, et al. v.

Case No. 93-CV-266 (Aug. 25, 1993)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On June 10, 2014, appellee filed a complaint requesting declaratory judgment, quiet title, ejectment, injunctive relief, and alleging continuing trespass and conversion regarding the property that was the subject of the complaint in\n   <em>\n    Brown, supra\n   </em>\n   . Appellee named several defendants including appellants and others who might claim any interest in the property\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   . Ralph C. Brown, Jr., Patricia A. Brown and EQT Productions filed motions for summary judgment contending appellee's claim was barred by the doctrine of res judicata. Appellant opposed the motions, but on April 20, 2015 the trial court found \"Defendants EQT Productions (sic) and Defendant Brown's Motion for Summary judgment is GRANTED and this case is DISMISSED as Plaintiff's claims are barred by res judicata.\"\n   <em>\n    Mid-Ohio Coal Company v. Ralph C. Brown\n   </em>\n   , Guernsey C.P No.14-OG-276, Entry, April 20, 2015, p. 2. The trial court issued no further findings nor did it rule on any other issues. Appellants filed a timely appeal to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} We reversed the trial court holding that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   We therefore conclude the doctrine of res judicata does not bar the filing of the complaint in the present case. The Brown Quiet Title Action is not binding or enforceable against appellant. The action never cleared the title as to the named defendants who at the time were not the record holders of the subsurface rights in question. Therefore, the judgment is subject to collateral attack by appellant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Mid-Ohio Coal Co. v. Brown\n   </em>\n   , 5th Dist.

Appellee attached the affidavit and report of their expert, Robert T. Erhard, who traced the title of the property from Jesse and Sarah Linkhorn's deed recorded in 1882. Mr. Erhard prepared a Certificate of Title and Opinion dated February 27, 2017 and concluded that the fee simple title to the oil and gas interests at issue in this case was vested in appellee. On April 19, 2017, appellants filed their memorandum contra and, on April 26, 2017, appellee filed its reply. On June 21, 2017, appellants requested that the court consider their memorandum\n   contra a motion for summary judgment and, by agreed entry dated June 28, 2017, the court ordered that the memorandum contra was deemed as the appellants' motion for summary judgment and that appellee's existing briefing would constitute its brief in opposition to appellants' cross motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On August 3, 2017, the trial court issued its entry granting appellee's motion for summary judgment \"on all counts of its complaint\" and entered \"an order declaring that Mid-Ohio owns and is vested with all right, title and interest in and to the subsurface and the estate to the exclusion of the defendant's interest as they may appear of record.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Appellants filed their notice of appeal on August 29, 2017 and included one assignment of error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 9} THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GRANTING SUMMARY JUDGMENT TO APPELLEE IN FINDING THE LINKHORN DEED CONVEYED ALL SUBSURFACE RIGHTS TO GRANTEE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Summary judgment proceedings present the appellate court with the unique opportunity of reviewing the evidence in the same manner as the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Smiddy v.

Mr. Erhard concluded appellants hold only rights to the surface of the property as well as the stone and water privileges reserved by the Linkhorn deed. Appellants disagree and contend that coal was the only mineral conveyed by the Linkhorn deed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 15} In September 1882 Jesse and Sarah Linkhorn delivered a deed to the Akron and Cambridge Coal Company and recorded the same with the Guernsey County Recorder.

The Linkhorns reserved only water and stone privileges and excepted coal from the reservation. Aside from those reservations, the Linkhorn deed conveyed to Cambridge and Akron Coal a fee simple title to the land, gas and oil included.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Appellant argues that continued reference to coal or minerals in the chain of title as well as any lack of reference to gas and oil should be viewed as persuasive evidence that the Linkhorns did not intend to convey gas and oil in their deed. The granting language of the deed is a clear and unambiguous conveyance of fee simple. The reservation language does not include gas and oil, so we are restricted to reviewing the language of the deed and may not resort to the extrinsic evidence promoted by appellants. \"* * *A court cannot interpret the parties' intent in a manner contrary to the clear, unambiguous language of the deed.* * *\"\n   <em>\n    American Energy Corp.,supra.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Appellant's attempt to interpret the language of the deed as transferring only rights to coal is a strained and unsupportable interpretation of the deed. Coal or \"stone coal\" as it is referenced in the deed is only included as an exception to the grantor's reservation to themselves and cannot be interpreted as a part of the granting language. We cannot construe this deed as a transfer of mineral rights only but, instead, must find it a conveyance of a fee simple estate subject to the reservation of surface rights as well as stone and water privileges. \"A deed of real property which conveys a fee-simple estate in the granting and habendum clauses\" but contains a provision exception the surface, stone and water, conveys all other rights and interests in the land, including oil and gas.\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.
