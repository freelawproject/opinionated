L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal, Lopez claims the motion judge erred in concluding that El-Werfalli's counterclaims were not SLAPP claims. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   To prevail on a special motion to dismiss under the anti-SLAPP statute, the movant bears the initial burden of showing that the nonmovant's claims \"are 'based on' the petitioning activities alone and have no substantial basis other than or in addition to the petitioning activities.\"\n   <em>\n    Blanchard\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Steward Carney Hosp., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451894\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/477/141/#p147\">\n    477 Mass. 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 147 (2017), quoting\n   <em>\n    Fustolo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hollander\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3665667\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/455/861/#p865\">\n    455 Mass. 861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 865 (2010). If the movant makes this showing, the burden shifts to the nonmovant to prove that the petitioning activity \"was devoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law\" and caused the nonmovant \"actual injury.\" G.

We examine each counterclaim separately and we review the judge's ruling for abuse of discretion or error of law. See\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Parsons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1080007\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/434/543/#p550\">\n    434 Mass. 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 550 (2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   In his G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, counterclaim, El-Werfalli alleged that Lopez failed to abide by the terms of the lease, including Lopez's failure to obtain insurance for the commercial premises and properly maintain the premises. El-Werfalli further claims that Lopez's attempt to collect damages after the fire while knowing that El-Werfalli had relied on Lopez's duty to obtain insurance and maintain the premises was an unfair and deceptive trade practice. Given these allegations, the judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the special motion to dismiss because Lopez failed to meet his initial hurdle of showing that the 93A claims were \"based on the petitioning activities alone and ha[d] no substantial basis other than or in addition to the petitioning activities.\"\n   <em>\n    Blanchard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 147. See\n   <em>\n    477 Harrison Ave., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451895\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/477/162/#p168\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451895\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/477/162/#p168\">\n    at 168, 171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The abuse of process claim stands on a different footing. In this counterclaim, El-Werfalli asserts that Lopez, by filing the underlying meritless and improper action, is attempting to recover monies he is not due. \"Given that the invocation of process necessarily constitutes petitioning activity for the purposes of the anti-SLAPP statute, see G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H (petitioning activity includes 'any written or oral statement made before or submitted to a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other governmental proceeding'), an actionable abuse of process claim will always be, at least in part, based on a special movant's petitioning activities.\"\n   <em>\n    477 Harrison Ave., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451895\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/477/162/#p168\">\n    477 Mass. at 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The key inquiry here is whether \"the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   conduct complained of is ... petitioning activity.\"\n   <em>\n    Fabre\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Walton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1178199\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/436/517/#p524\">\n    436 Mass. 517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 524 (2002). Here, Lopez met his burden that the claim was based on petitioning activity alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   As Lopez met the initial burden, the analysis then shifts to El-Werfalli to demonstrate, \"by a preponderance of the evidence,\" that Lopez's petitioning activity upon which the abuse of process claim is based is illegitimate -- i.e., that it \"lacked any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law,\"\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1080007\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/434/543/#p550\">\n    434 Mass. at 553-555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and caused it \"actual injury.\" G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. In the alternative, if he cannot make this showing, El-Werfalli may now also prevail by establishing to the judge's fair assurance that its abuse of process claim is not a SLAPP suit under the augmented\n   <em>\n    Duracraft\n   </em>\n   framework -- i.e., \"that [his] primary motivating goal in bringing [his] claim, viewed in its entirety, was 'not to interfere with and burden [Lopez's] ... petition rights, but to seek damages for the personal harm\" to him from Lopez's alleged conduct.\n   <em>\n    Blanchard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451894\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/477/141/#p147\">\n    477 Mass. at 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Here, El-Werfalli's abuse of process counterclaim rests on two grounds other than Lopez's invocation of process: (1) Lopez breached the lease by not obtaining insurance for the premises, and (2) El-Werfalli is blameless and owes Lopez no money. Passing on the legitimacy of the claim, we conclude that, on this record, the judge could have been fairly assured that the abuse of process claim is not a SLAPP suit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451894\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/477/141/#p147\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The abuse of process count was brought as a counterclaim to Lopez's action, i.e., his petitioning activity. Accordingly, it is difficult to discern how the counterclaim could interfere with or burden Lopez's petitioning activity, when the action had already been filed, especially where the abuse of process count is just one of several unrelated counterclaims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Order denying special motion to dismiss affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    This interlocutory appeal is properly before us under the doctrine of present execution.\n    <em>\n     Fabre\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Walton\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1178199\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/436/517/#p524\">\n     436 Mass. 517\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 521-522 (2002).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    Lopez's request for attorney's fees is denied.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
