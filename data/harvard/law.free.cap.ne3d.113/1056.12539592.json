(\"CFC\"), Samantha Green, and Aaron Niemeier. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} CFC is a for-profit corporation that organizes an annual \"pub crawl\" in Columbus, Ohio, with proceeds benefitting cancer research and persons being treated for the disease. Approximately 26 percent of CFC's revenues are donated to cancer research and treatment. CFC's pub crawl of May 24, 2014 was a seven hour event attended by approximately 5,500 persons. During the event, participants visited various bars from 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. before attending an after-hours party from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m., where CFC provided 367 kegs of beer. Participants formed teams of 10 to 12 persons and paid CFC to participate. During the \"crawl\" portion of the event, CFC assigned each team 5 bars to visit and provided tickets to redeem 4 pitchers of beer at each bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} One participant, Angela Yeager, drove while intoxicated after leaving the event. She hit Lytal's car after crossing the center line of the road while driving in the opposite direction, causing Lytal's car to flip over and land in a nearby field. As a result, Lytal suffered from numerous broken bones, a lacerated liver, and a traumatic head injury. Even after two years of medical care and therapy, Lytal did not completely recover and she anticipates that some of her injuries are permanent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On May 23, 2016, Lytal and Duggan filed suit against CFC, Green, Niemeier,\n   and five other defendants who were later dismissed. Lytal asserted a claim for \"negligent and malicious conduct\" against CFC, Green, and Niemeier, and Duggan asserted a derivative claim for loss of consortium. (May 23, 2016 Compl.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} After answering, CFC, Green, and Niemeier filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings under Civ.R. 12(C) on July 29, 2016. The trial court granted the motion on October 3, 2017, on the grounds that, as a matter of law, CFC, Green, and Neimeier owed no legal duty to Lytal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Lytal and Duggan appealed. They assert the following assignment of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The Trial Court erred when it granted Appellees' motion for judgment on the pleadings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

There are exceptions arising from legislative enactment and the common law which recognize that a defendant owes a duty to prevent an intoxicated person from injuring third persons.

Columbus Fair Auto Auction\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist. No. 94APE09-1394,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1995%20WL%20360323\">\n    1995 WL 360323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (June 13, 1995). (Appellants' Brief at 10.) They argue that the allegations in the complaint described a degree of CFC's \"control\" over the intoxicated driver consistent with the duty recognized in\n   <em>\n    Fletcher Trucking\n   </em>\n   that made it error for the trial court to dismiss the negligence claim. These allegations included: CFC organized a seven hour drinking party; it knew that 5,500 people would be going to the bars in the crawl; CFC had a \"special relationship of control over the drinkers at their driving party,\" as demonstrated by giving the participants a list of bars to attend and tickets to redeem pitchers of beer at the bars; CFC knew that the participants would drink even more beer than the kegs provided; and CFC failed to take adequate precautions to protect the public from the dangers created by the event. (May 23, 2016 Compl.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In\n   <em>\n    Fletcher Trucking\n   </em>\n   , the relationship of control that served as the foundation for recognizing the defendant's duty\n   arose from an employer-employee relationship, the employer's actual knowledge of the employee's intoxication, and the employer's affirmative assumption of the responsibility to deal with his intoxication. In that case, a supervisor was alerted that the employee was behaving erratically.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. When the supervisor located the employee, he was found with a beer and \"did not answer or respond\" when questioned.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The supervisor suspended the employee and told him to wait in a car while they arranged a ride home for him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. The employee was seen crashing the car, then got into another car with keys in the ignition, drove it off the lot, crashed it, and injured another driving while killing himself.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 14} In recognizing that the employer owed a duty of care, we noted that the employee, who had a previous conviction for drunk driving, was left unattended in a lot full of cars with keys in them when the employer knew he was intoxicated, and was seen crashing one vehicle; the employee \"used an opportunity arguably created by [the employer] to inflict himself on the motoring public and would never have been on the highway but for his access to his employer's vehicles.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. Key to the recognition of the employer's legal duty was the employer's actual knowledge of the employee's intoxication and its affirmative action of asserting control over him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Here, even when the allegations of Lytal and Duggan's complaint are assumed true in all respects, they fail to describe a relationship of control comparable to the one in\n   <em>\n    Fletcher Trucking.\n   </em>\n   The intoxicated driver who injured Lytal was one of approximately 5,500 persons participating in the event organized by CFC. There is no allegation that CFC, Green, or Neimeier had actual knowledge that she was intoxicated or, like the employer in\n   <em>\n    Fletcher Trucking\n   </em>\n   , affirmatively assumed an obligation to control her after learning of the intoxication. Unlike the employer in\n   <em>\n    Fletcher Trucking\n   </em>\n   , neither CFC nor its corporate officers provided the driver with access to vehicles. Although CFC provided all of the participants with pitchers of beer, the act of merely providing alcohol to an inebriated person is insufficient to create a general legal duty to protect the public from injuries caused by that person.\n   <em>\n    See Settlemyer.\n   </em>\n   We agree with Judge Bowman's concurring opinion in\n   <em>\n    Fletcher Trucking\n   </em>\n   : the \"case addresses a particular, narrow issue,\" and its holding \"should be confined to the facts of [that] particular case and should not be found to extend beyond it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31. (Bowman, J., concurring.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 16} For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that, as a matter of law, CFC, Green, and Neimeier did not owe a duty of care to Lytal. Consequently, she cannot state a negligence claim against them and Duggan cannot bring a derivative claim for loss of consortium. Thus, the trial court did not err when it granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings under Civ.R. 12(C).
