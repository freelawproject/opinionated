Although defendant-appellee, Miclara, LLC (\"Appellee\"), filed a response in opposition to Appellant's application, the trial court treated it as a motion to vacate the arbitrator's decision. On appeal, Appellant contends that the trial court erred (1) by vacating the arbitrator's decision without a motion to vacate and (2) by vacating the arbitration award under the incorrect standard of review. For the following reasons, we find that the trial court erred as a matter of law by vacating the arbitrator's decision without a motion as prescribed in R.C. 2711.13 and without reviewing the decision under R.C. 2711.10(D). Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In 2003, the Brooklyn Estates Subdivision was established in Ross County and a Declaration of Covenants, Easements, Restrictions and Assessment Lien (\"Declaration\") was recorded with the Ross County Recorder. Appellant governs the Brooklyn Estates Subdivision, which consists of eighteen lots and a large common area of approximately 29.293 acres. The common area, with its fields, wooded land, and large pond, adds substantial value to the property for its residents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Appellee purchased and owns \"Lot 12\" of the Brooklyn Estates Subdivision. Thereafter, a dispute arose as to whether Appellee could use the Brooklyn Estates Subdivision's common area for commercial purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Appellant elected to pursue arbitration, pursuant to Article XI, Section 2 of the Declaration, which provides in pertinent part that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any dispute between the Association and any lot owner or occupant, other than with regard to assessments, that cannot be settled between them, the matter shall first be submitted to arbitration in accordance with, and pursuant to, the arbitration law of Ohio then in effect (presently Chapter 2711 of the Revised Code of Ohio), by a single independent arbitrator selected by the Board.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} After conducting the arbitration proceeding on September 16, 2016, the arbitrator, J. Stephen Teetor, entered an arbitration award on November 21, 2016. Arbitrator Teetor found, in relevant part, that: (1) arbitration was binding; and (2) Appellee was not permitted to use the common area for commercial use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Pursuant to R.C. 2711.09, Appellant filed an \"Application for Order Confirming Arbitration Award\" on January 18, 2017. Appellee filed a response in opposition on February 17, 2017, asking that the petition be dismissed. Because Appellee filed its response within the time frame contemplated by R.C. 2711.13, the trial court treated it as a \"motion\" to vacate the award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In its judgment entry, the trial court found that the provision at issue-Article XI, Section 2 of the Declaration-provided for non-binding arbitration as the first step in dispute resolution. Because the provision was non-binding, the trial court denied Appellant's application and vacated the arbitration award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Assignments of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On appeal, Appellant assigns the following errors for our review:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Assignment of Error I:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The trial court erred in vacating the arbitrator's decision in violation of R.C. 2711.10 and without a motion to vacate by Appellee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Assignment of Error II:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The trial court misapplied the standard of review for arbitration awards and\n   thus erred in vacating Arbitrator Teetor's award and by denying Appellant's petition to confirm the arbitrator's award.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Because the arbitrator found the arbitration provision was binding and Appellee failed to file a motion to vacate, the trial court was obligated under R.C. 2711.09 to grant Appellant's motion to confirm the arbitrator's award. Also the trial court failed to review the decision under R.C. 2711.10(D). Accordingly, we sustain Appellant's assignments of error and reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the cause for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   JUDGMENT REVERSED AND REMANDED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   McFarland, J.: Concurs in Judgment and Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Harsha, J.: Concurs in Judgment and Opinion as to Assignment of Error I with Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 23} I concur in the judgment and opinion sustaining of the homeowners' association's first assignment of error.
