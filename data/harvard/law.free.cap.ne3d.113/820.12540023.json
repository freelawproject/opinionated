The claim arose out of an incident in Florida. A deputy sheriff served both defendants with in-hand process in Worcester. The defendants moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction pursuant to Mass. R. Civ.

The defendants are the parents of the team's head coach. During a spring training trip to Florida, the team and coaches visited with the defendants at a house the defendants had rented. The house had a swimming pool. As part of an initiation ritual, without warning, upperclassmen members of the team pushed the freshman members into the pool. The plaintiff hit and injured her shoulder on the edge of the pool. According to the complaint, the defendants \"negligently allowed a dangerous act of initiation or hazing to be imposed upon\" the plaintiff and \"negligently failed to obtain or seek immediate medical attention and/or medical advice\n   for\" her. The defendants were served with process while attending a softball game at Worcester State College in Worcester.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The judge held a nonevidentiary hearing on the defendants' motion to dismiss. At the hearing, plaintiff's counsel contended that the Superior Court had personal jurisdiction over the defendants because the defendants were served in Massachusetts. The judge responded that service of process is conceptually distinct from personal jurisdiction, and suggested that personal jurisdiction was improper here because the plaintiff's case had no connection to Massachusetts. The judge allowed the defendants' motion to dismiss in a summary order, reasoning, \"Personal service on the Defendants does not confer jurisdiction on the court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . Massachusetts courts have personal jurisdiction over any person \"domiciled in\" the Commonwealth, G. L. c. 223A, \u00a7 2, and, in certain circumstances, over nonresidents. The plaintiff argues that under the common-law rule of transient jurisdiction, a nonresident defendant's mere presence in the forum State when served with process confers personal jurisdiction over the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Burnham\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Superior Court of Cal\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634278\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/604/\">\n    495 U.S. 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 629 n.1,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634278\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/604/\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634278\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/604/\">\n    109 L.Ed.2d 631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990) (Brennan, J., concurring) (defining \"transient jurisdiction\" as \"jurisdiction premised solely on the fact that a person is served with process while physically present in the forum State\").

General Laws c. 209D, \u00a7 2-201 (\n    <em>\n     a\n    </em>\n    ) (1), codifies transient jurisdiction with regard to support orders and parentage disputes. However, G.

That the Legislature has limited the use of transient jurisdiction with regard to modifying support orders is evidence that it has not eliminated transient jurisdiction as a general matter.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    The Legislature did not implicitly repeal common-law transient jurisdiction when it enacted the long-arm statute in 1968. See St. 1968, c. 760. The long-arm statute established a list of ways to exercise personal jurisdiction over nonresident defendants, and presence in Massachusetts was not included on that list. However, statutes conferring personal jurisdiction through implied consent and presence already existed when the Legislature enacted the long-arm statute. See, e.g., G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 3B, inserted by St. 1923, c. 431, \u00a7 2 (implicitly appointing in-State agent for service of process for any driver involved in an \"accident or collision\" in Massachusetts); G. L. c. 223, \u00a7 38, inserted by St. 1906, c. 269 (discussing service of process on foreign corporations). If the Legislature intended the long-arm statute to be comprehensive, it would have been effectively abolishing these other statutes. But the Appeals Court has held, and we agree, that at least one of these laws continues to provide a basis for personal jurisdiction.
