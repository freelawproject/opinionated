Johnson\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (collectively \"the Johnsons\"), appeal from a decision of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas entered on January 26, 2017, granting the motion for summary judgment of defendant-appellee, American Italian Golf Association of Columbus d/b/a Riviera Country Club (\"the association\"), against the Johnsons' claims for damages. Because we find that genuine issues of material fact exist with regard to the evidence considered by the trial court on summary judgment, we reverse its decision and remand this matter for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Georgia was attending a golfing event at the association's property, Riviera Country Club (\"Riviera\"), on July 10, 2015, when she tripped and fell over a concrete curb between a grass surface and an artificial turf surface, suffering a right proximal humerus fracture, which required two surgeries to repair. It was Georgia's first time at Riviera, and she claimed she did not see the curb because it was hidden by overgrown grass. Moreover, she testified that, as an experienced golfer, she would never have anticipated a concrete curb being in that location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On December 11, 2015, the Johnsons filed a complaint in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas alleging that Georgia was a business invitee at Riviera when she tripped over the curb while walking to the driving range. The Johnsons asserted that the curb \"was a hazard that was not open, obvious or observable.\" (Dec. 11, 2015 Compl. at \u00b6 6.) The Johnsons alleged that the association was negligent because it knew of the hazard, but had failed to alleviate, remove, or\n   post warnings about it, creating unreasonable risk of harm to patrons. The Johnsons claimed that, as a direct and proximate cause of the association's negligence, Georgia incurred serious injuries and lost earnings. Additionally, Robert claimed loss of care, companionship, consortium, services, and society of his wife, Georgia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} As part of the discovery process, the association deposed Georgia on September 23, 2016. The association's counsel asked Georgia to described the fall, and she testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   I stepped and I couldn't-all I saw was grass and Astroturf. I saw nothing else but grass and Astroturf, and in a golfer's mind, when you see grass and Astroturf, there is a rubber mat under that to soften the blow for the clubs, okay. Never in my wildest dreams would I have dreamed there was concrete under the Astroturf.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   My foot stepped, so my foot stepped and it stepped like this (indicating). And because there was a deep, deep step that I did not see, my foot, when it hit like this, when it did that, because of the weight-when I stepped, it propelled me forward. This shoulder hit the other edge of the Astroturf and that's how it broke in four places (indicating). It kind of hit a line and shattered and then it threw me back. It's hard to explain.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (Sept. 23, 2016 Georgia Johnson Dep. at 53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On October 28, 2016, the association filed a motion for summary judgment, contending the Johnsons' claims fail because the curb was open and obvious. In support of its motion, the association filed the deposition transcript of Georgia and several photographs that had been admitted as deposition exhibits. The association claimed that the photographs it provided (Georgia's deposition exhibits A through H) \"clearly show a difference in elevation that is visible to the naked eye between the grass and the turf surface.\" (Oct. 28, 2016 Def.'s Mot. for Summ. Jgmt. at 6.) The association argued that, had Georgia been paying attention, \"she would have noticed the concrete slab itself protruding from underneath the turf.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The association continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   What makes the elevation more obvious is that, even if the grass was in fact overgrown in places at the time of the fall as the Plaintiff alleges, one can easily see in the photos of the injury site that there is the presence of the grass, a grey material, followed by a thick layer of green artificial turf overlaying that grey material. The thickness of both materials, combined with the fact that they contrast in color, would lead a reasonable person to observe some difference in elevation despite whether or not they were actually aware it was concrete or any other surface on which the turf was mounted. * * * [O]ne can conclude that a reasonable person would have been able to observe the existence of an elevation difference in the exercise of reasonable care an [sic] could take reasonable precautions for their own safety.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Id.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On November 28, 2016, the Johnsons filed a memorandum contra asserting the curb was obscured. They supported their memorandum contra with Georgia's affidavit, as well as three \"true and accurate photographs of the artificial turf and the surrounding grass as it existed on July 10, 2014.\" (Georgia Johnson Aff. at \u00b6 9, attached to Nov. 28, 2016 Pls.' Resp. in Opp.) Georgia testified that she had arrived at Riviera at approximately 7:45 a.m., took care of some preliminary matters and walked from the parking lot to the driving range area. She testified that, between the parking lot and the area of the driving range where golfers were\n   warming up, there was a strip of artificial turf which appeared to be level with the surrounding grass. She continued in her affidavit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   11. When I went to cross the artificial turf, my foot stepped on the edge of an obscured concrete curb that could not be seen due to overgrown grass;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   12. I tripped over the hidden curb, fell forward, and broke my right shoulder;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   13. I later learned that the curb was several inches deep; however, as the pictures make clear, as one approaches the artificial turf, the turf and grass appear to be level. The concrete curb underneath the turf was covered by weeds and grass and was not visible to me;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   14. Before this incident, I played golf five to six times per week. I have played dozens of different golf courses. I have never seen a concrete curb like the one in this case supporting artificial turf on a golf course driving range;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   15. Indeed, other than as part of a cart path, I have never seen a concrete curb like the one depicted in [her three photographs] in the middle of a driving range.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The Johnsons asserted that photographs provided by the association with its motion for summary judgment also showed that the curb was obscured. They claimed that the association owed a duty to protect invitee Georgia from concealed hazards. They argued that there existed a genuine issue of fact as to whether the association breached that duty, making summary judgment inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The association filed a reply in support of its motion for summary judgment on December 5, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 9} By decision entered January 26, 2017, the trial court granted the association's motion for summary judgment. The trial court stated in pertinent part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant moves the Court for summary judgment, submitting that Plaintiffs' claims fail because the curb is open and obvious. Plaintiff counters that the curb was obscured. Under Ohio law, there is no duty to warn invitees of or remove an open and obvious hazard.\n   <em>\n    Armstrong v.

In support of its motion, Defendant relies upon photos of the curb which clearly show a difference in elevation that is visible to the naked eye between the grass and the turf. (Plaintiff Depo. Exs. A-H). The Court further notes that the curb itself is plainly visible in the photos Plaintiff submitted with its Memorandum Contra.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   As such, the Court finds that Defendant was under no duty to warn Johnson of the curb's existence and finds Defendant's motion for summary judgment well taken.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (Jan. 26, 2017 Decision and Entry at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The Johnsons now appeal the judgment of the trial court granting summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ASSIGNMENT OF ERRORS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The Johnsons present for our review two assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   1. The trial court erred in granting summary judgment as there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether the hazard was open and obvious.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   2.

From its decision, it appears the trial court selected the photo it wanted to use to make its decision from among competing photos of the parties.

The trial court appears to have ignored or discounted this testimony from Georgia in reaching summary judgment for the association.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Third, construing the location of the hazard in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party, the question of whether the attendant circumstances (golfers warming up) could have reduced an ordinary person's expectation of discovering and protecting oneself against it remains reasonably open to question.

The trial court did not, in its determination of summary judgment, make mention of the attendant circumstances alleged by Georgia to have diverted her attention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Our de novo review of the record and the arguments of the parties show that the evidence provided for determining summary judgment to avoid a trial was in the form of undisputed testimony and photographs, which in and of themselves we find elicited material questions of fact. The photographic evidence, even only that provided by the association, is subject to differing interpretations as to whether it constituted an observable danger. Taking into consideration all the testimony and documentary evidence and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the Johnsons, we cannot say that no genuine issue of material fact remains. Thus, we cannot find as a matter of law that the placement and condition of the curb that Georgia said she fell on was an open and obvious danger. Nor can we say, when construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the Johnsons, that the association was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Having independently reviewed the record, we find there was ample evidence from which the trial court, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the Johnsons, should have found a genuine issue of material fact about whether the curb was open and obvious. By simply looking at the photograph and drawing a conclusion, the trial court engaged in weighing the evidence; that is, determining its quality, all of which is impermissible on summary judgment. It is a standard jury instruction for determining proof by a preponderance of the evidence, that, \"[i]t is the quality of the evidence that must be weighed, and quality may or may not be identical with the quantity or the greater number of witnesses.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Levonyak\n   </em>\n   , 7th Dist.

Thus, when a court on summary judgment draws inferences from photographs deeming them to be of such quality that the court can make the factual call, it impermissibly weighs the evidence. More simply put: \"Where the evidence presented allows conflicting inferences, a court considering a summary judgment motion may not weigh the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Thyssen Krupp Elevator Corp. v. Constr. Plus, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist.

The trial court could not, under this set of facts, negate a duty to warn of an open and obvious danger and award judgment to the association. It should have denied the association's motion for summary judgment. Instead, it weighed the evidence and impermissibly reached factual conclusions that supplied the basis to render judgment for the association using the open-and-obvious doctrine and thereby barred recovery by the Johnsons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 24} The Johnsons' first assignment of error is sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Second Assignment of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 25} The Johnsons argue that the trial court, in basing its analysis on photographs provided by the association, while ignoring the photographs and testimonial evidence provided by the Johnsons, improperly weighed the evidence in considering the motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   This is really a sub-argument of the first assignment of error relating to the more general assignment the trial court erred in granting summary judgment as there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether the hazard was open and obvious. Because we have already determined that the trial court impermissibly weighed the evidence to reach the legal conclusion that no duty to warn was owed to the Johnsons under the open-and-obvious doctrine, the Johnsons' second assignment of error is already addressed by our finding as to the first assignment of error and we consider the second assignment no further.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 26} In our de novo review of the record, we hold the trial court's summary judgment in favor of the association was granted in error. Having reviewed the evidence and drawn all reasonable inferences therefrom in favor of the Johnsons as we are required to do by Civ.R. 56, we do find that the association was not legally entitled to summary judgment. We sustain the Johnsons' first assignment of error and decline to address the Johnsons' second assignment of error because we have already addressed the issues relevant to that assignment in our first assignment of error. We thus reverse the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas and remand this matter to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment reversed; cause remanded.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   TYACK and HORTON, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Because the appellants share the same last name, for ease of reference we refer to them by their first name.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
