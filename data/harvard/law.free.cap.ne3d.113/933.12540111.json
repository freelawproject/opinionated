(proposed interveners) appeal from the denial of their motion to intervene in an action between the town of Falmouth (town) and the Falmouth zoning board of appeals (board) in which judgment had already entered. The judgment declared that two wind turbines operated by the town were a nuisance and ordered that their operation cease and desist.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The town did not appeal from that judgment. The proposed interveners sought to defend the interests of the town by intervening for the purpose of filing a motion for relief from judgment to modify the remedy pursuant to Mass. R. Civ.

We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . Barry and Dianne Funfar (the Funfars) filed a request with the Falmouth building commissioner for enforcement of the zoning code as to the operation of two wind turbines in Falmouth. Their request was denied and the Funfars appealed to the board, which reversed the commissioner's decision. The town appealed and after a bench trial in the Superior Court, the judge found the turbines violated the zoning code and ordered that they cease operation. Judgment entered on June 21, 2017, and the town did not appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   On November 15, 2017, after the thirty-day deadline to appeal the judgment had passed, the proposed interveners filed a motion to intervene pursuant to Mass.

Their purported interests are financial, environmental, and professional.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   As residents and taxpayers, they assert that they will ultimately be responsible for the wasted costs in the production, erection, and removal of the wind turbines, and that the town, and therefore its residents, will lose revenue that the wind turbines would have produced that could have been used to offset some of the town's expenses. Further, they contend that whatever source of energy is used to replace the energy that the wind turbines would have produced will likely be generated by fossil fuels and will therefore contribute to the town's pollution and emissions and negatively affect the proposed interveners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The prevention of a waste of tax revenue is not a direct or immediate interest because the harm taxpayers will suffer is too generalized. See\n   <em>\n    Application of Biester\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1759111\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/487/438/#p444\">\n    487 Pa. 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 444 (1979) (prevention of waste of tax revenue, under circumstances presented, is merely same interest all citizens have in having others comply with law or constitution). So too is the assertion that fossil fuels will be used in place of the turbines. Neither of these is a direct or immediate interest to town residents. Further, these interests are not distinct from those of the town, which is tasked with representing the interests of all of its residents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As an organization, The Green Center has not offered sufficient evidence to support the assertion that its interest in reducing environmental contamination will in fact be harmed by the judgment. See\n   <em>\n    Citizens to End Animal Suffering &amp; Exploitation\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    New England Aquarium\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3861102\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/836/45/#p53\">\n    836 F. Supp. 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 53 (D. Mass. 1993) (standing requirements not satisfied where organizational plaintiffs failed to offer evidence of actual or imminent harm). Accordingly, The Green Center also does not meet the \"interest\" requirement as set forth in the rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Even if the proposed interveners asserted a protectable interest distinct from that of the town, they have not demonstrated that the town failed to adequately represent their interests. To succeed under rule 24 (a) (2), the proposed interveners had \"the burden ... of making a compelling showing of inadequate representation\" (citation omitted).\n   <em>\n    Planned Parenthood League of Mass., Inc\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Attorney Gen\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"117629\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/424/586/#p599\">\n    424 Mass. 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 599 (1997). They did not carry their burden here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Moreover, the proposed interveners do not contend that the town's interest is adverse to theirs, or that the town has colluded with the opposing party or failed to fulfil its duty of representation. See\n   <em>\n    Massachusetts Fed'n of Teachers, AFT, AFL-CIO\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    School Comm. of Chelsea\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3893310\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/409/203/#p207\">\n    409 Mass. 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 207-208 (1991) (record did not support claim that parents' objectives differed from those of school committee where school committee was as dedicated as parents to goal of improving quality of education while maintaining public oversight). A government \"is presumed to represent the interests of its citizens ... when it is acting in the lawsuit as a sovereign.\"\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1704635\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/820/554/#p558\">\n    820 F.2d 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 558 (2d Cir. 1987). \"[I]f disagreement with an actual party over trial strategy, including over whether to challenge or appeal a court order, were sufficient basis for a proposed intervenor to claim that its interests were not adequately represented, the requirement [that a State is presumed to represent the interests of its citizens when acting as a sovereign in litigation] would be rendered meaningless.\"\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Yonkers Bd. of Educ\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10528257\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/902/213/#p218\">\n    902 F.2d 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 218 (2d Cir. 1990). The town sought judicial review of the board's decision and presented all colorable contentions, but lost. See\n   <em>\n    Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    New York State Dep't of Envtl. Conservation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10543438\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/834/60/#p61\">\n    834 F.2d 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 61-62 (2d Cir. 1987) (\"So long as the party has demonstrated sufficient motivation to litigate vigorously and to present all colorable contentions, a district judge does not exceed the bounds of discretion by concluding that the interests of the intervenor are adequately represented\"). The fact that the town did not appeal the judgment does not mean that it failed to fulfil its duty to its residents. To the contrary, a taxpayer may be well served by a government which makes strategic decisions about when to stop spending taxpayer dollars in litigation. In any event, if a citizen believes that the town government has made incorrect decisions with respect to litigation, that does not mean that the town has not adequately represented the citizen's interest such that he or she can take over that litigation. The citizen's remedy can be found at the ballot box, not in the rules of civil procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Permissive intervention\n   </em>\n   . Alternatively, the proposed interveners claim that they were entitled to permissive intervention pursuant to rule 24 (b) (2) because their claim -- enduring financial, environmental, and professional loss -- has a question of law or fact in common with the main action. An individual may be permitted to intervene in an action \"when an applicant's claim or defense and the main action have a question of law or fact in common.... In exercising its discretion the court shall consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties.\" Mass. R. Civ. P. 24 (b) (2). We review for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Bolden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"235658\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/50/56/#p62\">\n    50 Mass. App. Ct. at 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Abuse of discretion occurs where the judge \"made a 'clear error of judgment in weighing' the factors relevant to the decision ... such that the decision falls outside the range of reasonable alternatives\" (citation omitted).\n   <em>\n    L.L\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4144900\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/470/169/\">\n    470 Mass. 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 185 n.27 (2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We see no reason to disturb the judge's ruling. He was aware of the history of this litigation, including negotiations between the town and the proposed interveners beginning in 2013. The judge was required to consider whether intervention would delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties. Here, he properly considered that intervention would delay and complicate the final resolution that was achieved between the original parties, and would therefore prejudice those parties. Indeed, the original parties considered the matter to be concluded. Moreover, reopening the case would cause the original parties to incur additional legal expenses. See\n   <em>\n    Peabody Fed'n of Teachers, Local 1289, AFT, AFL-CIO\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    School Comm. of Peabody\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4000100\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/28/410/#p414\">\n    28 Mass. App. Ct. 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 414 (1990) (no abuse of discretion where \"reopening the judgment would have been delay in the payment of back pay ... [and] [a]dditional legal expenses would be incurred which would likely deplete the settlement pot\"). For these reasons, the judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Pleading requirement\n   </em>\n   . Lastly, the proposed intervener's motion did not comply with Mass. R. Civ. P. 24 (c), which states that \"[a] person desiring to intervene shall serve a motion to intervene upon the parties .... The motion shall state the grounds therefor and shall be accompanied by a pleading setting forth the claim or defense for which intervention is sought.\" The proposed interveners did not file a \"pleading,\" but argue that their rule 60 (b) motion suffices for the purposes of rule 24 (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The rule 60 (b) motion did not constitute a pleading under Mass.

For this reason alone, the motion to intervene was properly denied.
