(\"Niederst\"), appeals from the trial court's denial of its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, remittitur, or for a new trial. It raises one assignment of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   [T]he trial court erred by denying Niederst Management, LTD's motion for a new trial, or alternatively a remittitur or judgment notwithstanding the verdict given the improper argument by Mr. Kassay's counsel, the jury's excessive damages awards, and the absence of legally sufficient evidence to support the jury's damage awards.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Finding no merit to the assignment of error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Procedural History and Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On October 15, 2014, Kassay filed a complaint against Niederst, Lisa Weth, and Denise Pacak alleging wrongful termination based on disability discrimination, failure to provide reasonable accommodation, unlawful retaliation in violation of R.C. 4112.02(I), and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The case proceeded to a jury trial where the following evidence was presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Niederst is a property management company that owns a number of apartment buildings. As part of its property management business, Niederst hired and trained individuals as pest-control technicians to exterminate bed bugs in its buildings. Pest-control technicians are responsible for lifting heavy equipment, including\n   fans (35 lbs.), power cords (75 lbs.), and furnaces (240 lbs.). Two technicians are required to move each furnace. When exterminating bed bugs in apartments on higher floors of Niederst's buildings that do not have elevators, technicians are required to carry the furnaces up the stairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Niederst had a high turnover rate for its technicians. Additionally, a number of technicians that Niederst hired had disciplinary issues, including tardiness and absenteeism, damaging or losing company property, and trespassing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In August 2012, Niederst hired Kassay as a pest-control technician. According to Kassay's supervisor, Lisa Weth, Kassay was a good employee and had no performance issues. On October 24, 2013, Kassay showed up to work wearing a brace on his left wrist. According to Kassay, he had worn the brace to work on occasions because he suffered from a chronic wrist disability that was the result of an injury he suffered at a previous job for another company. One of Kassay's coworkers told Weth that Kassay was wearing a brace to work. Weth met with Kassay and informed him that she would have to speak to the human resources department about his brace because she was concerned that his injury may put him or others in danger while carrying the heavy equipment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Weth informed Kassay that based on instructions from the human resources department's director, Pacak, he would have to complete Family and Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\") paperwork and be able to work without \"any limitations.\" Weth told Kassay that she was not sure why he needed to fill out FMLA paperwork because she believed that it did not pertain to him. As a result, she told him that if he had any questions or concerns to speak with Pacak. According to Weth, she expected Kassay to complete and submit the paperwork and return to work within a week, although she did not say that she told Kassay what her expectations were.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Kassay reached out to Weth on a number of occasions after that meeting to discuss his return to work and express his frustrations. Weth told Kassay that he had to reach out to Pacak. Kassay then made multiple attempts to contact the human resources department, but received no response. As a result, he continued to go to work through the next week. On October 29, 2013, however, Weth sent him a text message informing him that he was being taken off of the work schedule until he completed the FMLA paperwork. She also informed him that according to instructions from Pacak and Sean Whiteman, vice president of Niederst, he could not return to work until he completed the FMLA paperwork and received a \"return-to-work note from the doctor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The next day, Kassay went to the human resources department and met with Pacak, who reiterated that he needed to complete the FMLA paperwork and obtain medical documentation indicating that he could work without restrictions. At trial, Pacak agreed that Niederst had a policy requiring that \"employees must be able to work full time, full duty, with absolutely no restrictions in order to be able to work and be employed[.]\" At trial, Pacak testified that she did not give Kassay a deadline by which he was to complete and submit the FMLA paperwork. Neither Weth nor Pacak, however, asked if Kassay was still able to perform his work duties while wearing the brace.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 10} After his meeting with Pacak, Kassay tried to contact someone at Niederst every day or \"every other day\" but was unable to get through to anyone. At trial, he testified that he was unable to schedule an immediate appointment with his doctor because his doctor was out of\n   the country. Kassay also testified that when he was finally able to arrange an appointment with a doctor and presented the FMLA paperwork, the doctor told Kassay that he would not fill it out because it would constitute fraud since Kassay still intended to work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 11} During the first week of November, Kassay contacted Weth and told her that he finally met with his doctor and had the appropriate medical documentation. Weth told him to contact Pacak. When Kassay called Pacak, she informed him that he had lost his job because he failed to show or notify his supervisor that he was not coming in to work for two straight days, violating Niederst's attendance policy, and that under that policy's terms, Niederst considered Kassay to have voluntarily resigned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 12} According to Niederst's handbook, \"[e]mployees must call in to report their absence each day unless prior notification has been given to cover a longer period of time.\" The handbook also states, \"Employees who are absent two (2) consecutive work days without notifying their supervisor are considered to have resigned.\" Weth explained, however, that a suspended employee does not have to call into work to report his absence if the human resources department has a \"return-to-work date\" established for that employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 13} At trial, Kassay called Weth, Pacak, and himself to the stand. After he rested his case, Niederst, Pacak, and Weth moved for a directed verdict, which the court denied. The defendants then presented their case in chief, recalling Pacak and Weth. After resting their case, the defendants renewed their motion for a directed verdict, which the court denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The jury returned a verdict in favor of Kassay and against all of the defendants individually and unanimously found Niederst liable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 15} As to Niederst, it awarded Kassay $32,329 in economic damages and $248,900 in noneconomic damages, for a total of $281,229.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The case proceeded to the punitive damages phase, where Kassay recalled Weth and Pacak and additionally called Adrina Niederst, the owner of Niederst, to the stand. Defendants cross-examined all of the witnesses, but did not present any on their own behalf. The jury imposed punitive damages on Niederst in\n   the amount of $250,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court also awarded Kassay $201,854.84 in attorney fees, one year's worth of front pay, and prejudgment interest for which all of the defendants were jointly and severally liable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Subsequent to trial, Niederst and Pacak timely filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (\"JNOV\"), remittitur, or for a new trial which the court denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Niederst appeals that denial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 17} In its sole assignment of error, Niederst argues that the trial court erred when it denied its motion for JNOV, remittitur, or for a new trial. Niederst did not challenge the jury's finding of liability in its motion; instead, it challenged the jury's awards for damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A. JNOV\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Niederst argues that the trial court erred in denying its motion for JNOV because the noneconomic and punitive damages were not supported by the evidence. Specifically, Niederst argues that Kassay's testimony regarding his emotional distress was not sufficient to award noneconomic damages and Kassay's proof of malice was not sufficient to award punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Civ.R. 50(B) allows a party to \"serve a motion to have the verdict and any judgment entered thereon set aside and to have judgment entered in accordance with the party's motion[.]\" \"If a verdict was returned, the court may allow the judgment to stand or may reopen the judgment. If the judgment is reopened, the court shall either order a new trial or direct the entry of judgment[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 20} We review the trial court's ruling on a motion for JNOV de novo.\n   <em>\n    Environmental Network Corp. v.

Noneconomic Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Niederst first argues that Kassay's self-serving testimony, without corroborating evidence, was insufficient to support the jury's award of noneconomic damages in the amount of $248,900.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 22} R.C. 2315.18(A)(4) defines \"noneconomic damages\" as \"nonpecuniary harm that results from an injury or loss to person or property that is a subject of a tort action, including, but not limited to, pain and suffering, loss of society, consortium, companionship, care, [or] assistance, * * * mental anguish, and any other intangible loss.\" Here, the trial court's instructions to the jury, which both parties agreed to, stated that when deciding an amount for noneconomic damages the jury should \"consider nature, character, seriousness and duration of any emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish\n   and loss of enjoyment of life Kassay may have experienced.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Niederst supports its argument that corroborating or expert testimony is necessary to support an award for noneconomic damages with a number of cases:\n   <em>\n    McJennett v.

In all of those cases, however, the courts analyzed whether there was sufficient evidence to support the plaintiff's separate and independent cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, which requires a plaintiff to establish that \"the defendant intended to cause the plaintiff serious emotional distress.\"\n   <em>\n    Allen v.

A majority of those cases were also analyzing the issue under summary judgment and directed verdict standards.

You * * * may not [award punitive damages] unless you find that Mr. Kassay has met his burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant or defendants, A, acted with malice[.] * * * Malice means a state of mind characterized by retaliation or the spirit of revenge or a conscious disregard for the rights and the safety of another person that has a great probability of causing substantial harm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 32} The evidence presented during trial shows that Kassay met his burden to show actual malice. Weth and Pacak contradicted one another on a number of occasions. Neither admitted to being involved in the decision to give Kassay FMLA paperwork or to end Kassay's employment, and while Weth testified that Niederst's vice president was involved in the decision, Pacak said she did not know who made the decision. Weth testified that she believed the FMLA paperwork did not pertain to Kassay, but gave it to him anyway. Both Weth and Pacak admitted to consciously disregarding Kassay's attempts to reach either of them, joking about his termination, and not taking corrective measures after realizing their mistakes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Kassay testified that when he was finally able to schedule an appointment with his doctor, his doctor informed him that he would not complete the FMLA paperwork because Kassay intended on working and, thus, filling out the paperwork would constitute fraud. Even after the jury returned a verdict in favor of Kassay-finding that Niederst failed to engage in an interactive process or to provide a reasonable accommodation to Kassay, took an adverse action against Kassay because of his perceived disability, and retaliated against him-the owner of the company seemed more concerned about being sued than about her employees' actions affecting Kassay's livelihood and stated that Kassay could return to work if he dropped the lawsuit against Niederst. As a result, there was certainly clear and convincing evidence allowing the jury to infer actual malice from the testimony, conduct, and surrounding circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Further, while Pacak and Weth testified that they made an innocent mistake when they improperly provided Kassay with FMLA paperwork, the jury was free to reject that testimony and find that, based on the evidence discussed above, they acted with ill will, hatred, and a conscious disregard of Kassay's rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Toole v.

Specifically, it argues that the court's statement-\"If you find that defendants retaliated against Mr. Kassay, this finding is sufficient to find malice.\"-is contrary to law and, therefore, the jury's verdict against Niederst on Kassay's retaliation claim is not sufficient evidence to show actual malice. First, Niederst failed to raise this argument below in its post-trial motion for JNOV, remittitur, or for a new trial, and we will not address it for the first time on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walker v.

Moreover, Niederst did not raise this argument as a separate assignment of error on appeal and only argued that the jury instructions were contrary to law for the first time in its reply brief. Niederst only made this argument in support of its position that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of actual malice, which, as discussed above, we rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Second, Niederst agreed to the jury instructions and, thus, invited the error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The court's instruction did not equate a tort action for retaliation with actual malice as Niederst contends.

Kassay counters that Niederst waived this issue because (1) it did not object to the comments during the closing argument, (2) it waived the issue as to certain comments because they were not included in Niederst's post-trial motion for a new trial, and (3) his counsel's comments were not prejudicial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Civ.R. 50(B) allows a party to file a motion for a new trial jointly with its motion for a JNOV.

Thus, we find that the disparity between the awards is not enough to show that the jury's award for noneconomic damages was against the manifest weight of the evidence.

While we consider a number of factors when reviewing a punitive damages award for excessiveness-\"(1) the degree of reprehensibility of the party's conduct, (2) the ratio of punitive damages to the actual harm inflicted by the party, and (3) sanctions for comparable conduct\"-punitive damages are not to be calculated using a precise mathematical formula.\n   <em>\n    Northpoint Props. v.
