For the reasons that follow, we affirm in part the trial court's decision but remand for the limited purpose of staying all claims against all parties pending arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The Neels filed a complaint on August 16, 2016, against defendant-appellee A. Perrino Construction, Inc. (\"Perrino\"), along with defendants Pat Perrino, Greenwalt Architects, Inc., and Christopher E. Greenwalt. The complaint alleged breach of contract, fraudulent misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, civil conspiracy, and violations of R.C. 4722.02, et seq., the Home Construction Service Suppliers Act (\"the HCSSA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The Neels had contracted with the defendants to construct a new home in Hinckley, Ohio. Pursuant to a restrictive covenant in the Neels' deed, the home was required to be at least 2,800 square feet. The Neels entered into a contract with Perrino by which Perrino was to construct a custom home for them for a contract price of $364,900. The contract was six pages long. It included an arbitration provision in paragraph 13, which stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Aside from warranty claims that shall be processed in accordance with the Limited Warranty procedure described in paragraph 8 above, should any dispute arise between the parties with respect to the completion of any stage of construction, the completion of the entire construction, or any other matter involved in the construction, disbursement of funds, amounts due and payable, said dispute shall be decided by arbitration in accordance with the Construction Industry Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The cost of the Arbitration shall be paid by the parties in equal shares. Further, the Contractor and Owner do hereby agree to abide by the decision of the American Arbitration Association and the judgment of the American Arbitration Association shall be final and not appealable. The parties further agree and consent to the application of the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure to govern the scope and extent of discovery in preparation for such arbitration. Contractor and Owner hereby acknowledge that by agreeing to binding arbitration, they are waiving their right to a trial by jury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In addition to the various allegations described above, the Neels' complaint alleged that the parties had agreed that the home would be at least 3,000 square feet, but the home's actual footprint was several hundred feet smaller.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On September 19, 2016, Perrino filed an answer and counterclaim. In this pleading, Perrino expressly stated that it was not waiving its right to insist upon arbitration. Perrino also filed a new party complaint asserting claims against the Neels' counsel for defamation, tortious interference\n   with contract, and tortious interference with business relationships. While these claims stem from counsel's representation of the Neels in the underlying case, they are unrelated to the contract between the Neels and Perrino and they are not subject to arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On November 17, 2016, counsel for all parties participated in a pretrial conference. The parties discussed ongoing discovery. In its journal entry, the trial court stated, \"A. Perrino Construction (D1) is ordered to file with the court its intention to pursue private arbitration with [plaintiffs] or waive its rights under the arbitration clause no later than the end of business on 11/28/2016.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On November 28, 2016, in accordance with the trial court's instruction, Perrino filed a motion to stay all proceedings pending arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On January 5, 2017, the trial court granted Perrino's motion to stay pending arbitration. The court's journal entry stated, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The court carefully reviewed the [plaintiffs'] causes of action and the very broad scope of the arbitration clause within the contract between the [plaintiffs] and [defendant] Perrino Construction. All of [plaintiffs'] claims include [defendant] Perrino Construction as a party. The scope of the arbitration clause is clearly broad enough to cover-without question-all of the [plaintiffs'] claims against this single [defendant.] Therefore the court grants the motion to stay proceedings as against [defendant] Perrino Construction. All proceedings by and between [plaintiffs] and [defendant] Greenwalt Architects Inc. are not stayed and litigation and discovery shall continue unabated between them. The court ignores the existence of the two individual [defendants] Pat Perrino and Christopher Greenwalt as it is not clear that [plaintiffs] enjoy any cause of action under Ohio law against the principals of their corporations that are [codefendants] in the litigation. The court will determine the existence of causes of action against the latter two individual [defendants]. Notice issued.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 9} It is from this decision that the Neels appeal, presenting three assignments of error for our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Assignment of Error No. 1\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 10} In their first assignment of error, the Neels argue that the trial court committed reversible error when it granted Perrino's motion to stay. Within this assignment of error, the Neels argue that the arbitration clause was substantively and procedurally unconscionable, that the arbitration clause was so ambiguous as to be unenforceable, and that Perrino waived its right to demand arbitration by participating in litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Appellate review of issues surrounding arbitration can involve various standards of review, depending on the precise questions raised challenging the applicability of the arbitration provision.\n   <em>\n    McCaskey v.

To meet this burden, the Neels must provide more than unsupported allegations of prohibitive costs, because \"the mere risk that a plaintiff would be forced\n   to pay exorbitant costs is too speculative to justify invalidation of the arbitration agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Taylor Bldg.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The Neels have attempted to provide evidence of the costs associated with arbitration, submitting affidavits from themselves and their attorney, along with the relevant American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") Construction Industry Arbitration Rules and fee schedule. However, we have very little information regarding the Neels' financial situation that would inform a determination of whether the cost of arbitration would be prohibitively expensive in this case. Beyond the statements made by the Neels in their affidavits, the record reflects that the Neels engaged Perrino to construct a custom-built home costing $364,900.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 21} In an appeal concerning the validity of an arbitration rider to a mortgage agreement, this court was not persuaded by similar arguments made by the defendants-appellants in that case.\n   <em>\n    Wilkens,\n   </em>\n   8th Dist.

The Wilkenses argued that a $2,450 filing fee for their $300,000-$500,000 claim rendered arbitration unconscionable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39. This court found the asserted estimate of their claims was \"highly speculative.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38. Further, beyond providing a fee schedule, the Wilkenses made no attempt to provide evidence regarding the costs of arbitration beyond the filing fee, and this court declined to speculate as to what those costs were.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39. Similarly, the Neels assert that the amount of their claim is potentially in excess of $1 million, with little explanation for that figure beyond the potential for punitive damages for fraud and anticipated cover costs in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. While the Neels mentioned some of the other costs involved in arbitration, they made no attempt to quantify them. We note that, like in\n   <em>\n    Wilkens\n   </em>\n   , even if this court were to accept the $1 million claim amount, their speculative estimation of the costs of arbitration could be easily exceeded by litigation expenses. The Neels are therefore unable to establish substantive unconscionability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Procedural unconscionability \"involves the specific circumstances surrounding the execution of the contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12. Where the circumstances are such that no voluntary meeting of the minds was possible, a contract is procedurally unconscionable. Here, the Neels argue that the fact that the contract was preprinted and drafted by Perrino and was never explained to them renders the clause procedurally unconscionable. They also argue that they were rushed through Perrino's sales presentation, Perrino was more knowledgeable about the subject of the contract and the arbitration clause, the arbitration clause was not brought to their attention or explained to them, Perrino was dishonest, the clause contained a loser-pays provision, and the Neels were unfairly surprised by a high filing fee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 23} There are a number of factors courts consider in analyzing procedural unconscionability.

Blossom Homes L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-7480\">\n    2016-Ohio-7480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=63%20N.E.3d%201245\">\n    63 N.E.3d 1245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 23 (8th Dist.). In\n   <em>\n    Conte\n   </em>\n   , this court found that the consumer was unable to establish procedural unconscionability where he alleged that his meeting with a builder was hurried, he had no knowledge of construction contracts or regulations, he did not understand what arbitration was, he was otherwise unable to understand the terms of the agreement, and he was pressured to sign the contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Here, we do not dispute that Perrino was likely more knowledgeable than the Neels regarding home construction and arbitration. However, the record does not support the Neels' assertion that they could not possibly have had any idea what they were agreeing to under the circumstances. While the Neels claim they were rushed through the signing of the contract, the record shows that they met with Perrino several times before ultimately signing the contract. The Neels did not ask for more time to review the contract, and nothing in the record indicates that they could not have done so. Similarly, the Neels argue that Perrino failed to explain the arbitration clause to them. Although they concede that they had the opportunity to ask questions, they apparently did not do so. Additionally, nothing in the record indicates that the Neels were pressured to sign the contract, or that Perrino was the only builder with whom they could have contracted. Finally, the Neels' claim that no one pointed out the arbitration clause to them is not persuasive to establish procedural unconscionability. The Neels were entering into a contract for a custom-built home worth over $300,000. Their status as consumers does not free them of their duty to read the contract they signed. As such, we do not find the arbitration clause substantively or procedurally unconscionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Ambiguity and Scope\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 27} The Neels also assert that the arbitration clause is unenforceable because the clause is so ambiguous that no meeting of the minds occurred. In support of this assertion, the Neels point to the absence of financial liability information from the clause. To the extent the financial liability argument concerns the overall costs of arbitration, this has been addressed in the foregoing analysis. To the extent this argument concerns the loser-pays provision, it will be addressed in our discussion of the third assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 28} The Neels also argue that the arbitration clause is too ambiguous to enforce because it excludes \"warranty claims\" without defining that phrase. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 29} The first sentence of the arbitration provision references a Limited Warranty procedure that is described in an earlier paragraph of the contract, stating: \"[a]side from warranty claims that shall be processed in accordance with the Limited Warranty procedure described in paragraph 8 above * * *.\" Paragraph 8 of the contract describes a one-year limited warranty agreement \"which shall be executed by Contractor and Owner at closing.\" The paragraph goes on to state that the limited warranty agreement \"shall be governed by the 'Construction Standards' set forth in the\n   <em>\n    Registered Builder Construction Standards\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    &amp; Maintenance Guide &amp; Limited Home Warranty Agreement\n   </em>\n   (the Builders Guide), which Owner hereby acknowledges receipt of and which is incorporated herein by reference.\" As described in paragraph 8, the limited warranty agreement obligated Perrino to make any repairs or replacements to the home within one year of the date the Neels occupied the home, and it covered the materials as specified in the contracts plans and specifications and provided that all work was to be completed in a workmanlike manner according to standard construction practices. Further, paragraph 9 of the contract specified six items that would not be covered by the limited warranty agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Although \"warranty claims\" are not a defined term in the agreement, paragraph 8 provides a detailed explanation of the limited warranty agreement. Therefore, we do not find the arbitration clause so ambiguous as to be unenforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Waiver\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 31} The Neels also argue that the trial court erred in granting Perrino's motion to stay because Perrino waived its right to enforce the arbitration clause by participating in the underlying litigation.

We find that these factors are outweighed, however, by the totality of the circumstances. First, we note that Perrino's participation in the litigation was relatively limited. We also note that the Neels make no argument that they were prejudiced by the passage of time-approximately three months-between their initiation of litigation\n   and Perrino's filing of a motion to stay pending arbitration. Finally, Perrino consistently reserved its right to arbitration. Therefore, the Neels have not met their burden to establish an unequivocal waiver of Perrino's right to arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Because we do not find the arbitration agreement unconscionable or ambiguous, and we do not find that Perrino waived its right to arbitrate, the Neels' first assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Upon review, we agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Ohio courts have consistently held that when a trial court grants a motion to stay proceedings, the entire action must be stayed, not only the arbitrable claims between parties to the arbitration agreement.\n   <em>\n    Maclin v.

Assignment of Error No. 3\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 40} In the Neels' third assignment of error, they assert that even if the trial court properly granted Perrino's motion to stay pending arbitration, the trial court erred in failing to strike Rule 48 of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") Construction Industry Arbitration Rules because it is procedurally and substantively unconscionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 41} The arbitration clause in the agreement here provides that the cost of arbitration shall be paid by the parties in equal shares. It also provides, however, that the AAA Construction Industry Arbitration Rules govern arbitration between the parties. Rule 48(d)(ii) of the rules states that the arbitrator's award may include \"an award of attorneys' fees if all parties have requested such an award or it is authorized by law or their arbitration agreement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 42} One count of the Neels' complaint against Perrino alleged that Perrino had committed violations of the HCSSA, codified as R.C. 4722.01, et seq. The fee-shifting provision in Rule 48 conflicts with the HCSSA. Specifically, R.C. 4722.08(D) provides that \"the court may award to the prevailing party a reasonable attorney's fee limited to the work reasonably performed\" if either the owner filed an action in bad faith or the home construction service supplier knowingly committed an act that violates the HCSSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 43} In light of this conflict, similar \"fee-shifting\" or \"loser-pays\" provisions have been found unconscionable and against public policy by this court.

Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Conte,\n   </em>\n   this court concluded that the loser-pays provision \"effectively nullifies the OCSPA and HCSSA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   provisions that allow the imposition of such fees only where a consumer acts in bad faith and files a groundless complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    Conte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-7480\">\n    2016-Ohio-7480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=63%20N.E.3d%201245\">\n    63 N.E.3d 1245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 34, citing R.C. 4722.08(D)(1) ; 1345.09(F).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 44} We agree with our precedent and find that, to the extent Rule 48(d)(ii) governs arbitration between the parties here, it is unenforceable.
