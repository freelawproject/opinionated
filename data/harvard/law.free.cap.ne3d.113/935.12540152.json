Specifically, he claims that when he pleaded guilty in January, 2017, his attorney did not advise him that the plea would subject him to virtually automatic deportation. He further asserted that if he had been informed of the consequences, as an almost life-long resident of the United States, he would have taken the risk of going to trial. The motion judge, who was also the plea judge, denied the motion, as well as a subsequent motion for reconsideration. The judge reasoned that because the evidence against the defendant was overwhelming and the defendant had violated the terms of probation by testing positive for drugs and alcohol, allowing the motions would not be in the interests of justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Because the defendant satisfied his burden to prove plea counsel's inadequacy and resulting prejudice under\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kentucky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    559 U.S. 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010), on November 2, 2018, we issued the following order: \"The orders denying the defendant's motion to vacate conviction and the defendant's motion to reconsider denial of motion to vacate are reversed, and the judgment of conviction is vacated. Opinion to follow.\" This memorandum and order states the reasons for our order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . A joint Federal-State police operation executed a search warrant at a Fitchburg address on October 28, 2016. As a result of the search, the defendant was arraigned in the District Court on October 31, 2016, on a criminal complaint charging possession of a Class B substance, crack cocaine, with intent to distribute, in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A (\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ), and conspiracy to violate the State controlled substances act, in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Less than three months later, at the defendant's third court date on January 26, 2017, he pleaded guilty to the charge of possession with intent to distribute a Class B substance, and was sentenced to a term of probation. The Commonwealth dismissed the conspiracy charge. Ten months later, on November 21, 2017, while reporting to his probation officer at the Worcester County sheriff's station in Fitchburg, the defendant was taken into custody by the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On February 5, 2018, the defendant filed a \"motion to vacate conviction\" supported by his own affidavit, the affidavit of plea counsel, and the affidavit of his new counsel, an attorney who specializes in immigration law. In the motion, the defendant sought to withdraw his guilty plea and be granted a new trial. The Commonwealth assented to the motion and recommended that the judge enter a \"guilty file[d]\" disposition with respect to the charge of possession with intent to distribute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The defendant stated in his affidavit that he was born in Haiti in 1976 and legally immigrated to the United States with his mother and four sisters at the age of seven to join his father, who had obtained United States citizenship. The defendant's entire family resided in the United States. He had no family left in Haiti, and any property the family owned there was destroyed by the earthquake in January, 2010. The defendant had two children, ages two and seven, and was responsible for them financially, even though they lived with their mothers. He was self-employed as an independent contractor installing satellite dishes throughout Worcester County for a television service provider.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plea counsel stated in his affidavit that the extent of his advice to the defendant regarding immigration consequences was to review the Tender of Plea or Admission &amp; Waiver of Rights form, known as the \"green sheet,\" with the defendant, which states in general terms that a guilty plea \"may have\" various immigration consequences. The defendant added that when he asked plea counsel about the possibility of deportation mentioned in the standard immigration warnings, counsel \"reassured [him] that as a life-long resident of the United States the chance of that outcome was slim to none.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In fact, the conviction that resulted from the defendant's guilty plea was an aggravated felony under Federal law,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (43) (B), and subjected the defendant to automatic deportation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant averred that if he had been advised that his plea would result in his automatic deportation, he \"would never, ever have pleaded guilty to this charge\" and \"would have staked it all and gone to trial regardless of the risk involved\" rather than being separated from his sons and family and \"barred from a country that is [his] home.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The judge held a nonevidentiary hearing on the motion on February 26, 2018. The defendant did not appear because he was in ICE custody, and ICE refused to transport him to the hearing or to allow him to participate by videoconference. At the hearing, the judge expressed concern about the procedure for acting on the Commonwealth's recommendation to file a guilty finding when the defendant was not present to consent, as required by Mass. R. Crim. P. 28 (e),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=453%20Mass.%201501\">\n    453 Mass. 1501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). The judge also noted that the defendant had a pending probation violation warrant after testing positive for alcohol.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on these factors, the judge concluded, \"I don't think it's in the interest of justice to allow this motion,\" and denied it without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the hearing on the defendant's motion for reconsideration held on March 16, 2018, the judge continued to question how allowing the motion would advance the interests of justice. The judge had read the affidavit in support of the search warrant, which indicated that the defendant had sold drugs to a confidential informant on three occasions, and noted that the evidence against the defendant was \"overwhelming.\" Defense counsel responded that under a recent United States Supreme Court decision,\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12605079\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1958/\">\n    137 S. Ct. 1958\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017), a defendant facing certain deportation could rationally and credibly elect to go to trial, even in the face of overwhelming evidence. Nonetheless, citing the overwhelming evidence against the defendant -- although the judge allowed, \"I know that's not the standard\" -- and evidence that the defendant violated probation by using drugs and alcohol, the judge denied the motion for reconsideration as not being \"in the interests of justice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   .
