The motion judge dismissed the case on the basis that the complaint was a restatement of an action previously filed in 2014. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (9), as amended,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=450%20Mass.%201403\">\n    450 Mass. 1403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008). We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   \" Rule 12(b)(9) provides for the dismissal of a second action in which the parties and the issues are the same as those in a prior action still pending in a court of this Commonwealth. The rule prohibits the long-barred practice of claim-splitting.\" (Footnote omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Lyons\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Duncan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3899992\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/81/766/#p770\">\n    81 Mass.

Whether the difference in the time periods is enough to state a legally separate claim is a question that can only be decided upon careful review of the 2014 record. The motion judge was also the trial judge in the 2014 case and was therefore intimately familiar with the nature of the allegations of the 2014 case. X.Z. has not, however, provided a record of the 2014 case to this court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The record we have does not contain anything other than the first page of the 2014 complaint. We cannot consider the substance of the husband's appeal because he has failed to provide an adequate record appendix in compliance with Mass. R. A.
