Additionally, Appellee/Cross-Appellant, Tesar Industrial Contractors, Inc., appeals from the trial court's judgment. For the reasons set forth below, this Court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In 2012, Republic initiated a project to construct an electronic arc furnace at Republic's facility in Lorain, Ohio. The project involved several components, including the erection of supporting and surrounding structures. Republic solicited bids for the project, which required multiple contractors to perform different and overlapping portions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Tesar submitted an initial bid of $5,482,495.00 to perform work on the project as a structural contractor for the exhaust system. After some negotiation, Tesar submitted a reduced proposal to Republic on March 22, 2013, with a quote of $4,830,000.00 to perform its portion of work on the project. Republic accepted Tesar's bid, and issued a purchase order dated March 27, 2013, resulting in the parties' original contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The project fell significantly behind schedule and costs began to mount. Republic faulted Tesar's mismanagement for these issues, but Republic also acknowledged\n   that it had some degree of responsibility for initial delays on the project and recognized that unforeseen difficulties had led to some cost overruns. Both Republic and Tesar desired to push forward and complete the project quickly, so the parties began to negotiate a revised contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Tesar, then in a position to appreciate the scope of the remaining work, submitted a proposal to complete the project. The parties entered into their revised contract when Republic accepted Tesar's proposal and issued a purchase order on August 20, 2013, authorizing payment to Tesar in an amount not to exceed $3,712,701.20 for the scope of work described therein. This purchase order also specified that, if any additional work should be required, Republic must issue a revision to the purchase order prior to the work being performed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Once again, the work on the project strayed off course both in terms of time and costs. Republic accused Tesar of persistent performance failures and failure to abide by Republic's policies. Tesar blamed Republic for the delay and increased costs, citing Republic's overall failure to adequately manage the project and attempts to cut corners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Tesar contends that Republic's project manager, Mark Qualls, began to directly manage the project on a time and materials basis. Further, Tesar claims that Mr. Qualls began verbally instructing Tesar to perform additional work and \"out of scope\" work prior to obtaining additional purchase orders with assurances of payment. Ultimately, Republic determined that Tesar could not credibly guarantee completion of the project, so it terminated Tesar and obtained another contractor to complete the work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Tesar filed suit against Republic in November of 2013, alleging that Republic breached the parties' original agreement from March of 2013, the parties' revised agreement from August of 2013, and agreements for \"out of scope\" work that Republic directed Tesar to perform in addition to the scope of work described in the original and revised agreements. Tesar also asserted claims for fraudulent inducement and unjust enrichment. Republic answered Tesar's complaint, and filed a counterclaim alleging three causes of action, including a claim that Tesar breached the original and revised contracts. Republic also asserted a claim for declaratory judgment and a claim of unjust enrichment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The matter proceeded to a jury trial. At the close of Tesar's case, the court granted Republic's motion for directed verdict, disposing of Tesar's claim for fraud in the inducement. After fourteen days of trial, the remaining claims were submitted to the jury. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Tesar on its breach of contract claim, awarding $3,078,000.00 in damages, and a verdict in favor of Tesar on its claim of unjust enrichment and awarded damages in the amount of $462,128.00, for a total damage award of $3,540,128.00. As to Republic's counterclaims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment, the jury found in favor of Tesar and entered verdicts against Republic on both claims. The jury's resolution of these claims rendered moot, and thereby effectively disposed of, Republic's claim for declaratory judgment. On January 29, 2016, the trial court entered judgment accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Thereafter, Republic filed post-trial motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, a new trial, or remittitur. The trial court denied these motions in its April 28, 2016 journal entry. On May 26, 2016, Republic appealed the trial court's judgment denying the post-trial motions. Tesar filed a cross-appeal on June 6, 2016. Initially,\n   the cross-appeal was docketed separately, but the matters have been consolidated. Republic raises three assignments of error for our review, while Tesar raises one assignment of error in its cross-appeal. For ease of analysis, we consider the assignments out of order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Republic's Assignment of Error II\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    The trial court erred by not granting Republic a new trial on the breach of contract claim because the jury was not correctly instructed on the contract duties.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 11} In its second assignment of error, Republic argues that it is entitled to a new trial because it is error to instruct a jury as to the breach of duties not presented in a contract, and to instruct the jury that they may find a breach based on such nonexistent duties. Specifically, Republic claims that the court erred by including in the instructions an \"enumerated list of actions[,]\" or purported breaches, which Tesar failed to tie back to a contractual duty. Republic claims to have objected to the format of the instructions enumerating alleged breaches and, further, that it objected specifically to instructing the jury on duties that did not exist in the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Civ.R. 59(A) provides multiple grounds upon which a party may base a motion for a new trial and, depending on the basis stated in the motion, \"this Court will review a trial court's decision to grant or deny the motion under either a de novo or an abuse of discretion standard of review.\"\n   <em>\n    Jackovic v.

Republic contends that, because its \"new trial motion was based on a question of law,\" this Court must apply a de novo standard of review. Obscuring the issues, however, Republic only cited generally to Civ.R. 59(A) in the portions of its motion for a new trial based on the alleged error in the jury instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 13} On appeal, as in its motion for a new trial, Republic has failed to designate any particular Civ.R. 59(A) grounds as a basis for this argument. Additionally, Republic made \"no attempt to explain why or how Civ.R. 59(A)'s particular components apply to any of its arguments.\"\n   <em>\n    Ulrich v.

The record, however, belies Republic's claim that it objected to the\n   <em>\n    form\n   </em>\n   of the jury instructions the court gave for breach of contract. During the jury instruction conference, Republic did express some concern by stating counsel's uncertainty as to whether some of the alleged breaches were \"obligations under the contract.\" However, this comment was in the context of the parties' ongoing discussion as to the appropriate way to instruct the jury on this particular matter and Republic stopped short of specifically objecting to an instruction enumerating alleged breaches. Regarding the list of alleged breaches, Republic informed the trial judge that it was \"okay removing it all to make it more simple and not confuse the jury,\" but that if Tesar was going to include a list of alleged breaches, Republic wanted to \"reciprocate\" and have its alleged breaches \"listed the same way.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 17} After closing arguments the trial judge instructed the jury, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [F]or the claim of the breach of contract, before you can find for Tesar they have to prove by a preponderance of the evidence [A,] that Tesar and Republic entered into one or more contracts; [B,] that Republic breached the contract or contracts by, and I'm going to list a number of things which Tesar claims was a breach.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The trial court listed the following alleged breaches:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   a. failing to timely provide materials to Tesar;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   b. providing Tesar with damaged or defective materials;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   c. failing to provide materials to Tesar in a manner consistent with industry standards;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   d. failing to provide timely and/or accurate design information, including drawings and specifications, for Tesar's labor, work, and/or services;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   e. failing to timely provide erection drawings to Tesar and/or, in other cases, failing to provide any erection drawings to Tesar;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   f. failing to coordinate the labor, work, and/or services of other contractors\n   or persons for whom Republic was responsible;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   g. directing the means and methods of Tesar's labor, work, or services;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   h. directing cardinal changes to Tesar and Republic's agreed-to scope of work without the issuance of a purchase order; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   i. failing to compensate Tesar for labor, work, services, material, and equipment provided by Tesar to Republic.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The judge further instructed: \"[s]o those are a list of potential ones. However, even if they prove that those were breaches, you have, Tesar has to prove that such a breach was a material breach, and not just a minor breach * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 18} This format of the instructions-enumerating Tesar's alleged breaches-is at least manifestly correct. The standard Ohio Jury Instructions for proof of claim for a breach of contract states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Before you can find for the plaintiff, you must find by the greater weight of the evidence that\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (A) the parties entered into a contract, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (B) the defendant (broke) (breached) the contract by (\n   <em>\n    insert nature of breach[es] claimed by the plaintiff\n   </em>\n   ), * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   (Emphasis sic.)\n   <em>\n    Ohio Jury Instructions\n   </em>\n   , CV Section 501.01. The lower court's instructions listing the nature of the breaches alleged by Tesar are consistent with this format.

As the judge and counsel for Tesar were discussing alleged breach (h), counsel for Republic interjected:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Your Honor, I would be okay with this if it said something directing cardinal changes to Tesar and Republic's agreed to scope of work without the issuance of out-of-scope purchase orders, without the issuance of the purchase order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The judge stated that the instructions would include the clarifying language Republic suggested, and the parties agreed without any objection. It is disingenuous for Republic to now claim that the trial court erred by failing to grant a new trial\n   based, in part, on an instruction submitted to the jury upon agreement of the parties. Republic not only failed to object to such an instruction, but affirmatively agreed to it so long as the charge included Republic's proposed language.

The jury found that Republic breached one or more contracts with Tesar, and entered a verdict in favor of Tesar for its breach of contract claims. Tesar argued for compensatory damages on the breach of contract claims totaling $3,893,631.00 and the jury awarded $3,078,000.00. Republic asks that the damages be reduced to no more than $1,681,403.00.

Tesar argues that Mr. Gunter \"orchestrated an effort to drive Tesar to his own internal goal number by\" stating that he had at least one lower bidder at $4,830,000.00 and that Tesar could complete the project for $4,830,000.00. Tesar argues that Mr. Gunter's statement as to a fair price to complete the work constitutes a material misrepresentation because his use of the \"very specific figure\" of $4,830,000.00 was significant, in that \"owners who claim prior experience such as Republic * * * ordinarily make their own calculation of construction costs against which they evaluate bidders.\" Tesar also argues that Mr. Gunter falsely claimed that Republic had at least one lower bidder at $4,830,000.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   {\u00b6 47} The record reflects that Tesar reviewed the plans for the project, assessed the scope of work, and considered the man-hours involved before calculating an estimate of $5,482,495.00. Tesar submitted an initial proposal to complete the work for that amount, but Republic indicated the bid was too high. Mark Kahanca, Tesar's project manager, then emailed Mr. Gunter, reducing Tesar's proposal \"to an even $5 million[,]\" adding that \"[it] reflects as much as we can comfortably reduce our bid.\" Mr. Gunter responded with a request for a second meeting with Tesar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   {\u00b6 48} Mr. Kahanca testified that, during the second meeting, Mr. Gunter indicated that there was another bid on the project lower than Tesar's, but that Mr. Gunter expressed that Republic wanted to work with Tesar and would do so if they agreed to lower their bid to $4,830,000.00. Mr. Gunter represented that he had experience constructing arc furnaces: one in Mexico and one in Brazil. Mr. Kahanca testified that \"[Mr. Gunter] told [him] based on his experience with these other plants that he felt that was a fair and accurate number that [Tesar] could perform this work.\" Following the meeting, Mr. Gunter emailed Mr. Kahanca in reference to their recent conversation and wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   [i]n order to [give you all the structural work] we need to equalize the other structural quotes that is why we need you to keep with the $4.83 million [ ] figure. As I said to you before, if you can achieve this number then the order is yours and I will give you the preference in the mechanical erection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   {\u00b6 49} Initially we note that it is not clear that Mr. Gunter's statements, (1) asserting his belief that Tesar could complete the work for $4,830,000.00 and (2) making reference to the existence of lower quotes, were false or that they can be construed as misrepresentations. At trial, Mr. Gunter confirmed that he had expressed his belief that an experienced and well-organized Tesar could complete the work for $4,830,000.00, though he could not recall his basis for arriving at that particular number. Mr. Gunter also testified that he had indeed disclosed to Mr. Kahanca that Republic received lower bids on the project, though he did not disclose the identity of these other companies. Mr. Gunter acknowledged that those companies did not propose a specific number to Republic, but rather a cost range within which they could complete the work. The issue lies in Mr. Kahanca's interpretations and assumptions regarding these statements, which Tesar asserts both as the basis for claiming that the statements are misrepresentations\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   for relying on those representations. Nevertheless, even if this Court were to assume that Mr. Gunter's statements constitute misrepresentations as to Tesar's ability to perform the work for $4,830,000.00, Tesar must still identify sufficient evidence in the record to show that it justifiably relied on such representations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   {\u00b6 50} \"Reliance is justifiable if the representation does not appear unreasonable on its face and if there is no apparent reason to doubt the veracity of the representation under the circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Lapos Constr. v.

Mr. Kahanca explained\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   from my experience it was, if the plant had been built somewhere else before what it would cost to do it there or a piece of equipment, and the supplier always gives you some kind of guesstimate on how much it's going to do to put their equipment together.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Mr. Kahanca claims to have relied on Mr. Gunter's representations because he was \"very professional\" and because Mr. Gunter told Mr. Kahanca that \"he had built one plant and was in the process of building another plant, and he had very much experience with this type of equipment.\" Further, Mr. Kahanca testified that he understood Mr. Gunter's reference to equalizing pricing to be \"in reference to the quotes that were received other than [Tesar's] in that range of [$4,830,000.00,]\" which he interpreted to mean that there were other quotes at $4,830,000.00. Tesar also argues the significance of the specificity of Mr. Gunter's $4,830,000.00 number. Mr. Kahanca testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   Q. And that's a very specific number, $4.83 million?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   A. Yes, it is.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   Q. Did you draw any conclusions by such a specific number?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   A. Well, by the specific number, like I said, if he had said about 5 million or about 4., he never used the word about, he said that is the price.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   Q. So did that influence your decision in reducing your bid?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   A. Yes, it did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   Q. And did you-you relied on the representations?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   A. I did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Thus, in light of Mr. Gunter's experience on two similar projects located outside of the United States, his reference to the existence of lower bidders, and his use of a specific number, Mr. Kahanca understood the figure to be not just a guess, but rather a \"guesstimate\" as to how much it should cost to complete the work. Tesar then argues that it was justified in relying on the number that Mr. Gunter proposed as fair and reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   {\u00b6 52} Tesar does not point to any evidence or even suggest that Mr. Gunter, or any other representative from Republic, ever claimed to have based this $4,830,000.00 number on calculations or an estimate as to what it would\n   <em>\n    actually cost Tesar\n   </em>\n   to complete the work. The record reflects that Republic, while negotiating bids, indicated that it would work with Tesar\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   Tesar could \"achieve\" the $4,830,000.00 number. The testimony and evidence indicate that Tesar and Republic were dealing on equal terms, and that Mr. Kahanca had not previously worked with Mr. Gunter. Despite Tesar's industry knowledge and experience bidding contracts, it chose not to inquire as to the basis for Mr. Gunter's target number of $4,830,000.00 and failed to independently determine the facts of the circumstances. Notwithstanding the fact that Tesar's own cost estimates provided a reason to doubt its ability complete the work for that amount, Tesar agreed to lower its bid by $170,000.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   {\u00b6 53} The law affords protection for a party's \"interest in formulating business judgments without being misled by others into making unwise decisions which result in financial loss[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Davidson v.

Mr. Kahanca's testimony as to his subjective interpretations and assumptions regarding Mr. Gunter's statements is insufficient evidence to support Tesar's claim that they justifiably relied on any alleged misrepresentation by Mr. Gunter in reducing their bid. In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the trial court correctly granted a directed verdict in Republic's favor on Tesar's fraud in the inducement claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   {\u00b6 55} Tesar's assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   {\u00b6 56} Republic's assignments of error are overruled.
