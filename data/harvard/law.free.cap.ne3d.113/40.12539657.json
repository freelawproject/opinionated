Stalker, M.D. appeal the September 18, 2017, decision of the Stark County Court of Common Pleas ordering production of certain documents sent to the State Medical Board of Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Appellee is Mohammed M. Aljaberi, M.D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    STATEMENT OF THE FACTS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In 2002, Appellee Mohammed Aljaberi, M.D. became employed as a senior physician at Appellant Neurocare. For more than a decade, in addition to being a physician employee, he has been a shareholder and a director of the company. As of September 2016, Neurocare was a close corporation with eight physician shareholders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On September 7, 2016, Dr. Aljaberi was locked out of his computer, and Appellees Dr. Stalker and Dr. Drake informed Dr. Aljaberi that he should take a few days off due to an incident involving colleagues. As per Dr. Stalker and Dr. Drake's instruction, Dr. Aljaberi took the days off as they requested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On or about September 12, 2016, the members of the Neurocare Board of Directors, held a meeting wherein Neurocare's doctors voted to remove Dr. Aljaberi as a director and to terminate his employment as a senior physician with Neurocare. Appellants cited repeated misconduct, including physically assaulting a staff member, insulting/offending patients, and exposing staff members, including schedulers and a medical student, to pornography on his work computer as the basis for the termination of Dr. Aljaberi. At his deposition, Appellee admitted to all of this misconduct. He claimed that he deserved to be disciplined, but not terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On December 8, 2016, Appellee filed a Complaint against Appellants Neurocare\n   Center, Inc., Ryan S. Drake, D.O. and Andrew P. Stalker, M.D., which included claims for Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Breach of Contract, Civil Conspiracy, and Declaratory Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On December 9, 2016, Appellants filed a complaint with the State Medical Board of Ohio concerning Dr. Aljaberi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On May 4, 2017, Dr. Aljaberi amended his Complaint, asserting claims of Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Breach of Contract, Civil Conspiracy, Conversion, Declaratory Judgment, Production of Corporate Books and Records, Production of Annual Financial Statements, and a Request for an Accounting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} During discovery, Appellee made the following document request relating to reports/complaints made to the Ohio State Medical Board:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Request for Production No. 8:\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Produce all document relating to any communications, notes and memoranda sent by any employee, agent and/or representative of Neurocare to the State Medical Board of Ohio that in any way refer or relate to Aljaberi. Appellants objected to this request on the basis that any responsive documents would be privileged and thus completely shielded from discovery by operation of statute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 10} After the parties were unable to resolve their disagreement over the appropriateness of this request, the issue was raised with the trial court at an on the record pretrial. The trial judge issued a briefing schedule that the parties complied with.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 11} After briefing was completed, the trial court ordered that any responsive documents be submitted to the court for an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review. Appellants complied with this directive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On September 18, 2017, the trial court ordered that the documents be produced but delayed disclosing the documents to the Appellee so that Appellants could file an interlocutory appeal concerning the ordered production of arguably privilege materials, if they chose to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 13} It is from this decision Appellants now appeal, raising the following error for review:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 14} \"I. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY ORDERING PRODUCTION OF PRIVILEGED PHYSICIAN MANDATORY REPORT SUBMITTED TO THE OHIO STATE MEDICAL BOARD, I.E., A REPORT PERTAINING TO THE PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT OF A PHYSICIAN.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 15} In their sole assignment of error, Appellants claim the trial court erred in ordering the production of the requested material. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 16} The subject of the discovery dispute in this matter is the content of the report made to the State Medical Board. Appellants maintain that such report is confidential and privileged. Appellee argues that such report was made in retaliation and does not meet the requirements of R.C. \u00a7 4731.224 and thus should not be afforded any statutory protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 17} In\n   <em>\n    Ward v.

The board may use the information obtained only as the basis for an investigation, as evidence in a disciplinary hearing against an individual whose practice is regulated under this chapter, or in any subsequent trial or appeal of a board action or order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   The board may disclose the summaries and reports it receives under this section only to health care facility committees within or outside this state that are involved in credentialing or recredentialing the individual or in reviewing the individual's clinical privileges. The board shall indicate whether or not the information has been verified. Information transmitted by the board shall be subject to the same confidentiality provisions as when maintained by the board.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Appellants further cite R.C. \u00a7 4731.22(F)(5), in support of their position that the subject report was confidential and not discoverable:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (F)(5) A report required to be submitted to the board under this chapter, a complaint, or information received by the board pursuant to an investigation or pursuant to an inspection under division (E) of section 4731.054 of the Revised Code is confidential and not subject to discovery in any civil action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Appellee herein argues that the Complaint made against Dr. Aljaberi to the State Medical Board does not meet the requirements of R.C. \u00a7 4731.224 because the report was not made within 60 days of the complained of conduct as required by subsection (C) of the said statute, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (C) Any professional association or society composed primarily of doctors of medicine and surgery, doctors of osteopathic medicine and surgery, doctors of podiatric medicine and surgery, or practitioners of limited branches of medicine that suspends or revokes an individual's membership for violations of professional ethics, or for reasons of professional incompetence or professional malpractice, within sixty days after a final decision shall report to the board, on forms prescribed and provided by the board,\n   the name of the individual, the action taken by the professional organization, and a summary of the underlying facts leading to the action taken.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Upon review, we find that the report which is the subject of this appeal would have been made pursuant to R.C. \u00a7 4731.224(B), not R.C. \u00a7 4731.224(C), which does not contain a time requirement. We therefore find this argument unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Appellee further argues that Lisa Wesie's testimony before the Medical Board that she witnessed Dr. Aljaberi physically assault another employee waived any potential privilege argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 24} We likewise find this argument unpersuasive. Ms. Wesie is a medical secretary employed by Neurocare and as such, she has no authority to make decisions or waive privilege on behalf of the corporate entity. While the issue has never been directly addressed in Ohio, it can safely be said that, in cases where a corporation, partnership, or other collective entity is the client, the attorney-client privilege belongs to the company and not to its employees outside of their employment capacity.\n   <em>\n    Shaffer v.

These statutes clearly provide that reports made to or received by the State Medical Board pursuant to R.C. Chapter 4731 are confidential and not subject to discovery. It is apparent that the legislature made the decision to protect reporters in this situation. While it is possible that such may serve to shield retaliatory reports in rare instances, the legislature has decided that the benefit of providing protection for reporters outweighs said possibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Based on the foregoing, we find that the confidentiality protections and privileges set forth in R.C. \u00a7 4731.224 protect the reports made to the State Medical Board in this case and that such are not subject to discovery. We therefore find the trial court erred in compelling disclosure of the privileged documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Accordingly, Appellants' assignment of error is sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 28} For the reasons stated in the foregoing opinion, the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas OF Stark County, Ohio, is reversed and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the law and this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Gwin, J., and Baldwin, J., concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
