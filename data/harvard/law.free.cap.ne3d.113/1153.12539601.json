STEWART, JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 1} As plaintiff-appellee Victoria Daniels was about to have surgery, the defendant-appellant-anesthesiologists Zoard Vasarhelyi, M.D. and Rostyslav Koziy, M.D., approved the placement of a transdermal patch on her to prevent postoperative nausea. Daniels appeared to have an allergic reaction to the patch and went into anaphylactic shock. She stopped breathing and experienced low blood oxygen for close to 30 minutes, causing her to suffer brain damage. Alleging that the active ingredient in the transdermal patch was part of the same family of drugs to which she had previously disclosed a serious allergic reaction, Daniels brought this medical malpractice action against both physicians and their employer, defendant-appellant Northcoast Anesthesia Providers, Inc., claiming that they violated the standard of care by failing to formulate an anesthesia plan to prevent her from being given drugs belonging to the same class of drugs to which she had an established allergy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   She also alleged that the physicians violated the standard of care in failing to give her adequate doses of a drug called \"Epinephrine\" to resuscitate her. A jury found in Daniels's favor and awarded damages. The court subsequently awarded her prejudgment interest on the damages award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The ten assignments of error on appeal contest various pretrial and trial rulings by the court, as well as an award of prejudgment interest. We conclude that the court abused its discretion by admitting Daniels's summary of the medical records evidence to go to the jury; that the court abused its discretion by not giving the \"bad results\" instruction to the jury; and that the court abused its discretion by allowing Daniels's demonstrative boards to be considered by the jury. We further find that the cumulative effect of these errors deprived Vasarhelyi and Koziy of a fair trial. The assignments of error relating to the limitation on closing argument and prejudgment interest are moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. Hearsay\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The first assignment of error is that the court abused its discretion by admitting into evidence, and sending to the jury for its deliberations, a learned treatise in violation of Evid.R. 803(18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The basis of Daniels's claims against Vasarhelyi and Koziy was that prior to surgery, she disclosed an allergy to an asthma medication called Atrovent. She maintained that the antinausea patch placed on her prior to surgery contained a drug called Scopolamine and that Scopolamine and Atrovent belong to the same family of drugs known as \"belladonna alkaloids.\" She maintained that the allergic reaction to Scopolamine could have been prevented had Vasarhelyi and Koziy cross-checked the drug using, among other resources, an online service called Lexi-Comp that provides drug information such as dosing, warnings, and precautions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Daniels's expert testified at trial that there were a variety of resources that doctors and nurses could consult about\n   drugs, including Lexi-Comp. The expert identified plaintiff's exhibit No. 26 as a printout from Lexi-Comp titled \"Belladonna Alkaloid Allergy.\" The printout contained a list of \"associated drugs\" including Scopolamine. According to Daniels's expert, the printout showed that Scopolomine \"could potentially crossreact in that category.\" The expert said that the Lexi-Comp entry \"instructs to avoid scopolamine, which was in the patch; it talks about Atrovent * * *.\" The expert then identified a second printout from Lexi-Comp, plaintiff's exhibit No. 26B, titled, \"Reported Allergy: Patient Management Considerations.\" The expert testified that the printout stated: \"In general, when a previous severe reaction has occurred, repeated exposure to the initial agent and related compounds should be avoided. * * * Per the manufacturer's labeling, use is normally contraindicated in patients with prior allergic reactions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} \"Hearsay\" is defined as \"a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\" Evid.R. 801(C). Statements in a \"learned treatise\" established as reliable authority are not excluded by the hearsay rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Evid.R. 803(18). However, Evid.R. 803(18) states that \"[i]f admitted, the statements may be read into evidence but may not be received as exhibits.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Daniels stated at trial that she laid a foundation for exhibit No. 26B as a learned treatise and told the court that the exhibit should not be allowed into evidence. Despite Daniels agreeing that exhibit No. 26B should be withdrawn, the court inexplicably submitted it to the jury. This was an error. With Daniels having conceded that the document was a learned treatise, the court violated Evid.R. 803(18).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moretz v.

Several courts have refused to admit the PDR and similar materials into evidence under rules similar to Evid.R. 803(17).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aurora v.

Evid.R. 803(17) is patterned after Fed.R.Evid. 803(17). The predicate for admission under the federal rule of evidence is similar to other hearsay exceptions: necessity and reliability.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Exhibit No. 26 listed Scopolamine as an \"associated\" drug under the heading \"belladonna alkaloid allergy.\" That factual assertion has not been challenged as false or misleading. In fact, it may have been largely cumulative given the number of witnesses who agreed that Scopolamine was contraindicated for patients who were hypersensitive to Atrovent or other belladonna alkaloids. While the court may not have expressly indicated that it was allowing exhibit No. 26 into evidence under Evid.R. 803(17), it did indicate that the exhibit was \"an informational cite,\" a characterization consistent with it being a tabulation or list relied upon by medical professionals. The court did not err by allowing exhibit No. 26 into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II. Closing Argument\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The second assignment of error complains that the court erred by prohibiting Vasarhelyi and Koziy's counsel from referencing in closing argument a July 2004 emergency room treatment that predated the events leading to this case. This assigned error is rendered moot based on our decision to reverse and remand the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   III. FDA Adverse Event Reporting System\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Vasarhelyi and Koziy filed a motion in limine to bar Daniels from using at trial a Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") adverse event report, identified at trial as plaintiff's exhibit No. 12. They maintained that the FDA report, which reported 471 cases of adverse events caused by Scopolamine use, did not include Daniels's case as an \"event\" and was not probative on the issue of whether they breached the standard of care. The court denied the motion in limine subject to revision at trial. The court allowed questioning on the adverse event report over objection\n   by Vasarhelyi and Koziy, but it did not allow the report to be admitted into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 14} \"Courts have broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility of evidence, and the granting of a motion in limine rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.\"\n   <em>\n    Bennett v. Admr., Ohio Bur. of Workers' Comp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4124998\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/134/329/\">\n    134 Ohio St.3d 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012-Ohio-5639\">\n    2012-Ohio-5639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=982%20N.E.2d%20666\">\n    982 N.E.2d 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 52. In this context, admissibility is predicated on relevancy; that is, does the evidence have \"any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\" Evid.R. 401. Even if relevant, evidence must be excluded \"if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury.\" Evid.R. 403(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 15} \"Federal regulations require drug manufacturers to report '[a]ny adverse event associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related' to the FDA.\"\n   <em>\n    Utts v.

It was conceivable, in the pretrial motion stage, that Daniels could establish a basis for admission of the adverse event report at trial. As it happened, she did not-none of the factors that might have shown causation or significance were mentioned at trial. Daniels's expert testified that the FDA monitors the use of drugs to ensure that adverse drug reactions are reported. The expert said that the FDA collects the data to both inform drug manufacturers that the drug might pose a danger and \"to communicate to the healthcare providers not to administer that drug if they see a pattern of potentially danger [sic] with a drug.\" Daniels then asked the expert to identify the adverse event report, which the expert described as \"the first page of the FDA website for adverse event reporting.\" With respect to Scopolamine, the expert identified a section of the adverse effect report, \"which you can see is about an inch thick,\" listing adverse events from the drug.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 18} This testimony did not take into account how many of the 471 reported instances actually involved a direct reaction to Scopolamine as opposed to some\n   other cause. This tenuous connection created the possibility that the jury would give undue weight to the adverse event report, particularly when the report contained just one relevant instance of anaphylactic shock associated with the usage of Scopolamine. The report was properly excluded from evidence because its prejudicial effect substantially outweighed its probative value. That the report was later excluded from the evidence does not mean that the court erred by denying the motion in limine and allowing testimony on the report subject to exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   IV. Summary of Medical Records\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Daniels offered the report of a nurse who summarized Daniels's medical records. Vasarhelyi and Koziy filed a motion in limine to exclude the nurse from testifying on grounds that the summary of medical records went beyond what was allowed under Evid.R. 1006 and that the summary contained expert opinion that had not been disclosed as required by Loc.R. 21.1. The court denied the motion in limine (it ordered Daniels to strike a two-sentence paragraph at the end of the summary), allowed the nurse to testify to matters contained in her report, and later admitted both the summary and medical records into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 20} \"The contents of voluminous writings, recordings, or photographs which cannot conveniently be examined in court may be presented in the form of a chart, summary, or calculation.\" Evid.R. 1006. This is a rule of convenience based on practical necessity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Fed.R.Evid. 1006 (construing identical federal rule). Because the summary itself is admitted in lieu of the voluminous evidence, the jury is entitled to consider the summary in its deliberations and base a verdict on it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Fed.R.Evid. 1006, which is functionally identical to Evid.R. 1006, does not generally permit both a summary of the voluminous evidence and voluminous evidence to be admitted into evidence.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In fact, the summary was more in the nature of an annotation than a summary. The nurse provided explanations for medical terms, procedures and devices, and she included numerous \"exhibits\" not contained in the medical records that depicted body parts, medical equipment, and illustrations of medical procedures. These annotations went beyond what the documents themselves contained and were thus impermissible embellishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 29} At various points the nurse offered her own \"notes\" to highlight the content of certain records. For example, she made the following notation regarding a nursing note: \"(NOTE: this note was timed as 0800 [8:00 AM] although it was part of the note written at 1300 [1:00 PM].)\" By doing so, the nurse went beyond what the record stated. In another example, the nurse commented on the amount of Fentanyl administered to Daniels before her surgery:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   At 7:35 AM, Ms. Daniels received Ancef 1 gm IV (antibiotic), Versed 2 mg, and Fentanyl 100\n   <em>\n    mg\n   </em>\n   . (Fentanyl is a very potent narcotic analgesic. A dose of 100\n   <em>\n    mcg\n   </em>\n   [or 0.1 mg] of Fentanyl is the equivalent of about 10 mg of Morphine. 100\n   mg would be an enormous dose of Fentanyl.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 30} The nurse injected her own opinions into the summary. When summarizing a record that showed Daniels's oxygen saturation level as \"hovering in the 40s,\" the nurse included a parenthetical stating that \"[n]ormal oxygen saturation is usually 95% or above; 40% is extremely low.\" When summarizing a postoperative record showing the amount of urine drained from Daniels, the nurse parenthetically stated that \"This is a massive amount of urine.\" When summarizing a postoperative record of Daniels's weight, the nurse stated, \"(Ms. Daniels weighed 163 pounds on the day of her laparoscopy. This would mean that in two days, Ms. Daniels gained 88 pounds!)\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 31} In going beyond summarizing the medical records themselves, the nurse offered additional information that was prejudicial to Vasarhelyi and Koziy. The nurse italicized nearly every portion of the summary in which the records showed that Daniels disclosed an allergy to Atrovent prior to her surgery. When summarizing a record of postoperative care, the nurse stated: \"The nurses also suctioned Ms. Daniels; breathing tube multiple times. (This can be very uncomfortable. It can cause gagging and coughing, and a sensation of being unable to catch your breath.).\" When summarizing a record showing that Daniels was given pain medication and offered \"reassurance\" in the form of \"holding pt's hand,\" the nurse included a parenthetical stating, \"This must have been a very frightening time for Ms. Daniels.\" The nurse stated that \"Ms. Daniels' complex care went on all day, every day; throughout the night, every night. Her sleep was constantly interrupted.\" When describing a record showing that Daniels had been placed on an ECMO (extra corporeal membrane oxygenation) machine, the nurse wrote in bold type that \"\n   <strong>\n    Ms. Daniels' life was now literally dependent on the staff and a machine\n   </strong>\n   .\" (Emphasis sic.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 32} None of this was admissible under Evid.R. 1006 because the addition of the nurse's commentary went beyond summarizing the medical records. And the prejudicial effect was obvious: the nurse's commentary would no doubt engender sympathy for Daniels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Daniels implicitly concedes prejudice by stating that she offered the nurse as a witness on pain and suffering, presumably meaning that the commentary in the summary was designed to portray the medical records in a light most favorable to that end. But by doing so, the nurse went well beyond what is acceptable for a summary of voluminous evidence under Evid.R. 1006. And other parts of the summary-notably the numerous italicized portions that emphasized how Daniels disclosed an allergy to Atrovent -could only be viewed as attempting to assist Daniels in establishing liability on the medical malpractice claim. This was far outside what is permissible under the rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Daniels maintains that any error in admitting the summary was harmless because the court also sent the actual medical records for comparison purposes. Because the summary was allowed as substantive evidence in lieu of the actual medical records, the jury in all likelihood considered the summary to the exclusion of the actual medical records. Would there be any doubt that if the court admitted both the novel\n   <em>\n    War and Peace\n   </em>\n   and the Cliff Notes version of that novel into evidence, the jury would read the Cliff Notes? Daniels even conceded in arguing for the admission of the summary that the medical records consisted of \"thousands of pages of medical records\" and that \"[t]o ask a juror to examine and fully understand a set of such complicated medical records is virtually\n   an impossible task[.]\" We have no confidence that the jury, with a 30-page summary of the medical records and the actual medical records numbering in the \"thousands,\" actually compared the summary against the medical records. The court's error in admitting the summary of the medical records was prejudicial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   V. Jury Instructions\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 35} The court, over objection, gave the jury an \"eggshell skull\" instruction, telling the jury that \"if you find that Victoria Daniels had a predisposition that made her more susceptible to injury\" the defendants were nevertheless liable for her actual injuries and damages. Vasarhelyi and Koziy argue that the court gave this instruction in error because neither party suggested that Daniels suffered any greater injury due to her frailty or that a person of greater strength would have been injured less under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 36} The \"eggshell skull\" or \"thin skull\" doctrine evolved in the context of preexisting injuries to provide that if a defendant's wrongful act causes injury, the defendant is fully liable for the resulting damage even though the injured plaintiff had a preexisting condition that made the consequences of the wrongful act more severe than they would have been for a plaintiff without a preexisting condition or injuries.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Calandrillo &amp; Buehler,\n   <em>\n    Eggshell Economics: A Revolutionary Approach to the Eggshell Plaintiff Rule\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20Ohio%20St.%20L.J.%20375\">\n    74 Ohio St. L.J. 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 380 (2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 37} A tortfeasor is fully liable for any damages resulting from its wrongful act even if the victim had a preexisting condition that made the consequences of the wrongful act more severe for him than they would have been for a person without the condition.\n   <em>\n    Meyers v.

That video apparently showed Daniels, and Vasarhelyi and Koziy wished to introduce a clip of the video, without accompanying audio, to counter Daniels's use of photographs to depict the condition of her body in the weeks following her going into shock. Daniels filed a motion in limine to exclude the video on grounds that Vasarhelyi and Koziy did not timely produce the video in discovery, that the video was hearsay, and that it was unduly prejudicial because it made a nonparty doctor to the case look like \"a hero.\" The court found the motion in limine moot,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   excluded the video, and it was proffered into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Daniels argues that Vasarhelyi and Koziy did not properly authenticate or verify the trustworthiness of the video.

Mays wanted to introduce into evidence excerpts from a series of television news stories relating to welfare fraud that aired three years after his crimes were committed.

We found that video to be \"rank hearsay as well as irrelevant and confusing.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=671%20N.E.2d%20553\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=671%20N.E.2d%20553\">\n    at 568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 46} In this case, the newscast would be played with no audio, so it would not have contained any statements offered for the truth of the matter asserted.

We reject this assertion because the life care plan consisted of charts that were admitted into evidence after the nurse discussed the life care plan during her testimony. Vasarhelyi and Koziy did not offer their own cost estimate of a life care plan for Daniels, nor did they cross-examine the nurse on the substance of her calculations.

The ability to weigh the cumulative impact of multiple trial errors is independent of\n   whether the context is criminal or civil.\n   <em>\n    Richlin\n   </em>\n   , and to the extent that other cases can be traced back to it, is no longer persuasive. A 30-year, unbroken line of cases from this appellate district applying the cumulative error doctrine to civil cases indicates that we long ago rejected\n   <em>\n    Richlin\n   </em>\n   as binding authority on the matter.

However, I write separately to express my belief that appellants' fourth assignment of error, standing alone, supports reversal for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   {\u00b6 69} In this case, the trial court permitted counsel for Daniels to submit to the jury a medical history report prepared by Jane Heron, R.N. As stated by the majority, however, the medical history summary improperly contained annotations that expressed Heron's personal opinions and the various conclusions or inferences she made upon reviewing Daniels's medical records. Thus, the summary was not an accurate representation of Daniels's medical records, and the trial court erred by admitting the document under Evid.R. 1006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   {\u00b6 70} Furthermore, I cannot say the introduction of the medical history summary was harmless. Given the competing theories of the parties in this case, the prejudicial impact of the opinion-based commentary in the summary was significant. Without question, Daniels's medical history, including her previous interaction with belladonna alkaloids, was relevant to the jury's assessment of liability in this medical malpractice case. Because the summary was clearly designed to support Daniels's claims while simultaneously invoking sympathy, I am unable to conclude that the erroneous admission of the summary \"[did] not affect the substantial rights of the complaining party.\"\n   <em>\n    O'Brien v.

To be clear, resolution of the assignments of error is predicated solely on legal precedent, and should not be interpreted as a position on the merits of Daniels's allegations. Regardless of the facts before this court, however, protection of the fundamental and substantial right to a fair trial is paramount. Accordingly, I would sustain appellants' fourth assignment of error, vacate the judgment of the common pleas court, and remand this case for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   {\u00b6 73} I disagree that it is unnecessary to address the defendants' late disclosure of their intent to use the video in the sixth assignment of error, and would find the late disclosure to be a proper basis to exclude the newscast. If defendants had timely disclosed their intent to use the video, Daniels could have called the \"hero\" doctor as a witness to point out how egregious defendants' errors were. Furthermore, defendants apparently engaged in a pattern of late disclosure-their expert offered new opinions at trial without first disclosing those opinions to Daniels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   {\u00b6 74} Nevertheless, I concur that the cumulative effect of the other errors warrants a reversal and a new trial.
