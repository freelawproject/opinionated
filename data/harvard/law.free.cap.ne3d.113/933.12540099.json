L. c. 278A. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . Kines was previously convicted of rape, armed robbery, and three counts of kidnapping.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pursuant to Kines's first motion for forensic testing in 2014, a judge ordered that deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing be conducted on two cigarette butts that were located in the ashtray of the van where the rape occurred. The results indicated that the DNA from the cigarette butts came from an unknown male, excluding Kines as a possible contributor. Kines's current appeal concerns his second motion made under G. L. c. 278A where he asked for additional DNA testing on the same cigarette butts, specifically for a DNA phenotype snapshot report and composite profile, as well as an amended motion for postconviction discovery of numerous documents. In the second c. 278A motion, Kines claimed that additional DNA testing from the cigarette butts would result in evidence that is material to the perpetrator's identification due to the inconsistent descriptions of the suspect made by the victims. A different judge denied Kines's motions without a hearing as well as his motions for reconsideration, citing largely the reasons in the Commonwealth's opposition for the denials. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . 1.\n   <em>\n    Standard of review\n   </em>\n   .

In order to obtain a hearing under G. L. c. 278A, \u00a7 3, a defendant's motion must meet \"the preliminary criteria set forth in G.

See G. L. c. 278A, \u00a7 3 (\n   <em>\n    b\n   </em>\n   ) (1)-(5).

Kines argues that he has met the criteria through his motion and supporting documents.

Kines is not required to \"establish a 'reasonable probability of a more favorable result at trial' \" had the testing been conducted,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317973\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/467/496/#p506\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 507 ; rather, \"the critical inquiry is whether such testing has the 'potential' to result in material identification evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lyons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12456696\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/89/485/#p495\">\n    89 Mass.

Any test results from the cigarette butts, however, would not be material to the question of the identity of the person who committed the rape because there is no factual connection between these cigarette butts and the crime. There is nothing in the record that suggests that the perpetrator smoked cigarettes -- let alone on the night of the crime -- and none of the victims testified that the perpetrator was smoking in the van. Indeed, the evidence carried even less weight because the van was stolen, which could reasonably explain why another male's DNA was found on the cigarette butts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Kines also failed to provide an affidavit of \"someone with 'personal knowledge of the factual basis of the motion.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317973\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/467/496/#p506\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317973\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/467/496/#p506\">\n    at 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting G. L. c. 278A, \u00a7 3 (\n   <em>\n    b\n   </em>\n   ). Kines claims that the additional testing he is seeking will help identify the pigmentation of the complexion of a third-party perpetrator, but provides no expert affidavit that such testing will be able to determine this.

L. c. 278A, \u00a7 3 (\n   <em>\n    b\n   </em>\n   ) (4).
