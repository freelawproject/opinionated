I believe that\n   one of the propositions of law submitted by appellant, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., presents a matter of public or great general interest. Therefore, I would address the merits of the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 3}\n   </strong>\n   In September 2006, appellee, Christopher Burd, obtained a loan from Centennial Home Mortgage, L.L.C., and signed a note promising to repay the loan. The note was secured by a mortgage in favor of Centennial on property located in Blacklick, Ohio. The mortgage provided that the underlying loan was insured by the Federal Housing Administration (\"FHA\"). Subsequently, Centennial indorsed the note to Wells Fargo and assigned the mortgage to Wells Fargo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 4}\n   </strong>\n   In April 2009, Wells Fargo filed a complaint seeking judgment on the note and foreclosure of the mortgage. Thereafter, Wells Fargo and Burd entered into a loan-modification agreement, and Wells Fargo voluntarily dismissed the complaint with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 5}\n   </strong>\n   A second complaint was filed by Wells Fargo in February 2012 seeking judgment on the note and foreclosure of the mortgage. The date of default alleged in the complaint was October 1, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 6}\n   </strong>\n   The parties participated in court-sponsored mediation in August 2012 but were unsuccessful in resolving the dispute. Thereafter, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Burd, holding that Wells Fargo had failed to satisfy the requirements of 24 C.F.R. 203.604.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 7}\n   </strong>\n   In August 2014, Wells Fargo filed its third complaint seeking judgment on the note and foreclosure on the mortgage. Wells Fargo asserted that the date of default was October 1, 2011, the same date of default alleged in the second foreclosure complaint. The trial court again granted summary judgment in favor of Burd, holding that Wells Fargo had failed to comply with the face-to-face-meeting requirement set forth in 24 C.F.R. 203.604, which it concluded was a condition precedent to foreclosure of an FHA-insured mortgage loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 8}\n   </strong>\n   Wells Fargo appealed to the Tenth District Court of Appeals, arguing that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in Burd's favor. Specifically, it argued that the August 2012 court-sponsored mediation fulfilled the face-to-face meeting requirement of 24 C.F.R. 203.604.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 9}\n   </strong>\n   The Tenth District assumed for the sake of analysis that the court-sponsored mediation constituted a face-to-face meeting for purposes of 24 C.F.R. 203.604.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-7706\">\n    2016-Ohio-7706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206680386\">\n    2016 WL 6680386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14. Nevertheless, the Tenth District rejected Wells Fargo's assertion of compliance with the requirements of 24 C.F.R. 203.604.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-7706\">\n    2016-Ohio-7706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at \u00b6 14. The appellate court reasoned that by asserting that the note was due and owing from October 1, 2011, and the face-to-face meeting between Wells Fargo and Burd occurred on August 1, 2012, \"Wells Fargo effectively admits that it did not have a face-to-face meeting with Burd 'before three full monthly installments due on the mortgage [were] unpaid' as required by 24 C.F.R. 203.604(b).\" ( Brackets sic.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-7706\">\n    2016-Ohio-7706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at \u00b6 12. The Tenth District further held that the fact that court-sponsored mediation occurred before the third foreclosure proceeding had been initiated did not alter the result:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   It is true that this appeal arises from a new foreclosure complaint filed after the unsuccessful mediation session occurred, but that new complaint was based on the same alleged default as the second complaint. Thus, Burd had no opportunity\n   to avoid foreclosure arising from that alleged default.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 10}\n   </strong>\n   We accepted the following issues for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   In interpreting an administrative regulation, a court should adopt an interpretation that is consistent with the overall regulatory scheme in which the individual regulation is included.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   A mortgagee's failure to comply with the timelines provided in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20203.604\">\n    24 C.F.R. \u00a7 203.604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   does not bar an action to foreclose a mortgage insured by the Federal Housing Association as long as the mortgagee holds or makes a reasonable effort to hold a face-to-face meeting prior to initiating foreclosure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12285602,12285571,12285541,12285615,12285583,12285557\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/150/1451/\">\n    150 Ohio St.3d 1451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12285571,12285583,12285458,12285342,12285471,12285602,12285355,12285485,12285615,12285372,12285502,12285510,12285638,12285390,12285650,12285529,12285409,12285668,12285541,12285557,12285436\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio/2017/8136/\">\n    2017-Ohio-8136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20N.E.3d%20938\">\n    83 N.E.3d 938\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    Issue of Public or Great General Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 11}\n   </strong>\n   The FHA, which is a part of the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Housing, https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/housing/fhahistory (accessed Aug. 15, 2018), provides mortgage-loan insurance on loans made by FHA-approved lenders.

The determination whether the face-to-face-meeting\n   requirement set forth in 24 C.F.R. 203.604 is a condition precedent or an affirmative defense will affect the decision as to what actions a mortgagee must take, and when, in order to satisfy 24 C.F.R. 203.604's face-to-face-meeting requirement. Deciding these issues will have a widespread effect by providing guidance to litigants, counsel, and courts, and therefore, the issues personify the concept of \"public or great general interest.\" By dismissing this appeal, the majority is permitting the inconsistent outcomes in the appellate courts to continue and is denying the citizens of Ohio a uniform application of the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 15}\n   </strong>\n   The court has missed an opportunity today. The fact that the court accepted this case shows that it believed that this area of the law needed clarity, but by dismissing the case, the court permits 24 C.F.R. 203.604 to evade clarification. The issues were thoroughly briefed and well argued before the court; nonetheless, the legal and business communities and the public that are affected by Ohio foreclosure law and practice will have to continue to wait in silence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 16}\n   </strong>\n   Therefore, I must dissent from the judgment dismissing the appeal as having been improvidently accepted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Piper, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
