Cordell appeals the August 16, 2017 judgment entry of the Gallia County Court of Common Pleas, which found that Appellant failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that Appellee Anthony S. White was negligent in a motor vehicle/pedestrian accident in which Appellant sustained personal injuries. Having fully reviewed the record, we find the trial court's judgment is supported by some competent and credible evidence. Therefore, we find no merit to Appellant's sole assignment of error. As such, we overrule the sole assignment of error and affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} This lawsuit arises from an incident occurring on October 7, 2015 on County Road 43 in Gallia County.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On that date, Appellant was performing landscaping work in a grassy area bordering County Road 43. At the same time and place, around 10:15 a.m., Appellee was operating his motor vehicle on the roadway on his way to work. Appellee's vehicle struck Appellant, resulting in extreme personal injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On July 18, 2016, Appellant filed a complaint alleging personal injuries, pain and suffering, mental anguish, lost wages, loss of enjoyment of life, and medical expenses of over $80,000.00. Appellee filed a timely answer, acknowledging the incident but denying negligence in the matter. Appellee demanded a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The parties engaged in discovery and proceeded towards a jury trial date. However, the parties later stipulated that\n   they would try only the issue of liability in a bench trial, and that the trial court would determine the percentage of fault to be attributed to each party. The bench trial took place on July 20, 2017. Both parties testified. In addition, Appellant presented testimony from Danny Kipp and Harvey Brown. Kipp and Brown were also performing landscaping duties on the accident date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} In lieu of opening statements and closing arguments, the parties submitted post-trial briefs. On August 16, 2017, the trial court journalized its decision, finding that Appellant had failed in his burden of proof to show by a preponderance of the evidence that Appellee was negligent under the circumstances. Having found that Appellant failed to carry his burden of production, the trial court therefore determined it was not necessary to determine if Appellant was also negligent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} This timely appeal followed. Additional testimonial facts are set forth below where relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"I.

Relying on R.C. 4511.48(E), Mrs. Meyer argued that Rapacz had a duty to observe Mr. Meyer and to avoid colliding with him with his vehicle. She further argued that Rapacz failed to maintain an assured clear distance as required under R.C. 4511.21(A). The appellate court was not persuaded by her arguments. The court held at \u00b6 20:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \"Notably, the evidence, or lack of, negated all the elements to warrant any finding that Rapacz violated the assured clear distance statute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The undisputed evidence is that Rapacz was proceeding lawfully in his lane when he struck [Meyer]. * * * We find no evidence to suggest that Rapacz was speeding. The evidence is further undisputed\n   that the area where Roland was struck was not a marked crosswalk. Under R.C. 4511 .48(A), pedestrians crossing a road at any point other than within a marked crosswalk must yield to vehicles.

The evidence demonstrated Owens had taken 2 steps backward into the street and into Renacs' right-of-way. The appellate court affirmed, noting that the thirteen-year old was not within a cross-walk and Renacs' vehicle was within his right-of-way.

In appeal of a summary judgment decision, the plaintiff pointed out that other drivers were able to avoid Lewis. The appellate court observed at \u00b6 16 that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \"* * * Lewis was crossing Morse Road outside of the crosswalk and against the traffic light. * * * No evidence was presented that appellee did not exercise due care once the perilous situation, [Lewis] crossing the street, was discovered.

Appellant has not met his reciprocal burden on summary judgment to demonstrate a material issue of fact that appellee was negligent.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Here, there was competent credible evidence supporting the trial court's findings. Based upon our review, we cannot say the trial court erred in concluding that Appellant failed to carry the burden of proof to show by a preponderance of the evidence that Appellee was negligent. Appellee, an experienced driver, testified he was on his way to work on the day of the accident. He was familiar with\n   the route and not in a hurry. Appellee denied drinking alcohol or taking any prescription drugs on the accident date. He also denied talking or texting at the time of the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Appellee testified he had operated his vehicle on Hemlock Road, come to a complete stop, and then turned onto Green Valley Road. The road was a straight stretch until the area where the accident took place. As he approached the area where the accident occurred, he was driving approximately 30 miles an hour. Appellee could see Appellant and another worker, Harvey Brown, 20-30 yards in the distance to the right. There were no obstructions and no oncoming traffic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Appellee testified Appellant was approximately two-to-four feet off the right side of the roadway, in a grassy area, operating a weed-eater, as he approached. Appellee glanced over at the workers and waved. Within a few seconds, there was an impact and Appellee realized he had struck Appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Appellee saw nothing to indicate danger. No one was standing in the roadway as he approached. He did not move over to the left or swerve into the other lane because he had no reason to expect anyone would violate his right of way and he saw no other immediate reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Appellee denied taking his eyes off the road and losing sight of the men. He was in his lane of travel and never deviated from it. Appellee's testimony, and the fact that Appellee was not cited for his actions by the investigating authority, supports the conclusion that Appellee was operating his vehicle lawfully and with due care. His testimony further supports the conclusion that he had no reason to expect anyone would violate his right of way as he approached the area where the landscaping crew was working.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Appellant testified he was working for Harvey Brown, landscaping on Green Valley Drive that day. He and another worker, Danny Kipp, were weed-eating in a ditch area that ran parallel to the roadway. Appellant and Kipp were on opposites sides, working to the middle of the ditch. Appellant testified he was standing alongside the edge of the roadway, on grass, and reaching down to the ditch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Appellant also testified he did not see Appellee's car. He had just turned over his shoulder to look for Kipp when the accident occurred. The weed-eater prevented him from hearing a car on the road. Appellant denied backing onto the roadway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Danny Kipp corroborated much of Appellant's and Appellee's testimony. He recalled there was no other traffic. Kipp estimated Appellant's feet were approximately two feet into the grass. Even if he had stepped \"one step back,\" he would not have been on the roadway. Kipp testified that Appellee waved to acknowledge them, that he was not even sure it was a \"wave,\" and that Appellee could have been checking texts. Shortly afterwards, the accident happened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Brown testified Appellant and Danny Kipp worked for him in his lawn care business. He was riding a lawn mower while the others were weed-eating. Brown testified he last saw Appellant standing on the grass weed-eating down into the ditch. At the time of the accident, Brown had his back turned completely away from the others. Brown never saw Appellant stepping into the road as he worked that day. He did not see the actual impact, but turned around to see Appellant \"flying through the air.\" He also did not see where Appellee's car was at the moment of the impact. Brown also testified he never saw Appellee swerve off the road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 29} The trial court's decision, with which we agree, included the following pertinent findings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   \"In this case it is undisputed that the vehicle driven by White was in the right of way. * * * Cordell has offered no evidence that White operated his vehicle in violation of any law. It is undisputed that White was operating his vehicle within the legal speed limit at the time of the accident. The record is devoid of any traffic citations issued to White. * * * There was no reason for White to expect * * * that Cordell would go into the road. It is reasonable to determine that Cordell was in the roadway when he was struck there since there is absolutely no evidence that White was not in his lane of travel. * * * Here by all accounts, this situation arose in a matter of just a few seconds if not immediately. * * * There was no reaction time to allow White to take any evasive action. * * * Here, White had no time to discover Cordell within his right of way. In fact, he only knew that Cordell must have been in his right of way when the impact occurred. He had no time to react.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Appellee argues the trial court disregarded corroborative circumstantial evidence from his witnesses but the trial transcript does not support this contention. Appellant cites testimony from Kipp that Appellee may have been texting, but he was not 100% certain Appellee was texting. Kipp testified on cross-examination it was \"fair to say\" he had no idea what Appellee was doing as he drove. Given that Appellee denied phone use, Kipp's testimony was less than certain, and again, Appellee was not cited, we do not find Kipp's testimony to be of significance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 31} What Appellant characterizes as corroborative circumstantial evidence we view more in the nature of an improper inference.
