(\"AirNet\"), Thomas Schaner, and Quinn Hamon (collectively \"appellees\"), are entitled to recover attorney fees from appellants, pursuant to R.C. 2323.51(A)(2)(a)(ii), for the time period April 26 through December 10, 2012, and (2) October 19, 2016 decision and entry finding the amount of attorney fees owed to be $45,714.53.

On June 15, 2011, Vossman filed suit against appellees asserting a single cause of action for age discrimination under R.C. 4112.14. On July 12, 2011, appellees filed a motion to dismiss, pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6), asserting Vossman failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. On September 22, 2011, the trial court denied appellees' motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On October 19, 2012, upon appellees' motion, the trial court entered a decision granting summary judgment in favor of appellees. The trial court reasoned that: (1) there was no evidence age discrimination was the basis for Vossman's termination, and (2) Vossman admitted he does not believe age discrimination was the cause of the allegations and investigations into his conduct. Vossman appealed. On October 22, 2013, this court affirmed the trial court's granting of summary judgment in favor of appellees.\n   <em>\n    Vossman\n   </em>\n   . Vossman appealed to the Supreme Court of Ohio. On March 26, 2014, the Supreme Court declined to accept jurisdiction of the appeal.\n   <em>\n    Vossman v.

Motion for Attorney Fees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On November 7, 2012, appellees moved for an award of attorney fees against appellants in the trial court, alleging Vossman's claim was frivolous and Vossman's counsel vigorously continued to pursue the frivolous claim pursuant to\n   R.C. 2323.51 and Civ.R. 11. In the motion for attorney fees, appellees stated the allegations made by Vossman in his complaint and relied on to overcome appellees' motion to dismiss were ultimately revealed to be untruthful when appellees' counsel deposed Vossman. Appellees argued the following allegations made by Vossman were unsubstantiated: (1) his co-worker's allegations regarding his flying behavior was false and based on his age, (2) the investigation into his behavior revealed his co-worker's allegations were unsubstantiated, (3) he was never directed to keep the investigation confidential, and (4) he was pretextually terminated because of his age. In support of its argument, appellees pointed to Vossman's own admissions in his deposition testimony that: (1) there was truth to his co-worker's allegations of his flying behavior, (2) he was directed to keep the investigation confidential, (3) he violated the confidentiality directive, and (4) he never believed his co-worker's allegations against him were age based. Appellees argued Vossman's own admissions made the initial complaint lack evidentiary support and that his initial filing of the complaint and subsequent pursuit of the case through baseless arguments served only to harass and impose litigation costs on appellees. Appellees argued Vossman's pursuit of the case through baseless and untrue allegations was in violation of Civ.R. 11 and constituted frivolous conduct in violation of R.C. 2323.51. Therefore, appellees argued the case was frivolous as it could not be supported by a good-faith argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Entitlement Determination\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On May 22, 2013, the magistrate conducted a hearing on the motion for attorney fees. On June 3, 2014, the magistrate rendered a decision which granted appellees' motion for an award of attorney fees, in part. The magistrate found, pursuant to R.C. 2323.51(A)(2)(a)(ii), appellees were entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees they incurred from April 26 through December 10, 2012 from appellants. The magistrate reasoned: \"It was absolutely clear, under existing age-discrimination law, that no reasonable attorney would have continued to prosecute [Vossman's] age-discrimination cause of action after April 26, 2012,\" the date appellees' counsel deposed Vossman. (June 3, 2014 Mag. Decision at 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On June 17, 2014, appellants filed objections to the magistrate's decision. Along with the objections, appellants submitted three affidavits, one from Vossman's trial counsel, Kelm, one from attorney Paul Tobias of Cincinnati, and one from attorney Frederick Gittes of Columbus. All the affiants are employment law practitioners in Ohio. Appellees did not file a response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On February 12, 2015, the trial court overruled appellants' objections to the magistrate's decision and found the magistrate properly determined the factual issues and applied the law correctly. The court reasoned \"there is no evidence, direct or indirect, that [Vossman's] age actually motivated [appellees] to terminate him or that his age played any role in his termination.\" (Feb. 12, 2015 Decision at 8.) The court found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The record indicates that by April 26, 2012, [Vossman] and his counsel knew: (1) [appellees] had a legitimate reason to investigate and suspend [Vossman], (2) [Vossman] was the only employee under suspension, under investigation, and issued a confidentiality directive, and (3) [appellees'] stated reason for terminating [Vossman's] employment was true. Nevertheless, with no proof that age was a factor behind his termination, [Vossman] and his counsel continued to prosecute this action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (Feb. 12, 2015 Decision at 8-9.) Finally, the trial court held: \"Upon review, this Court finds that [Vossman] and his counsel definitively knew by April 26, 2012, that there was no evidence of similarly situated employees being treated more favorably than [Vossman]. [Vossman] and his counsel also knew, by April 26, 2012 at latest, that there was no evidence, circumstantial or direct, indicating that age actually motivated [appellees'] decision to terminate [Vossman's] employment.\" (Feb. 12, 2015 Decision at 9.) The trial court adopted the magistrate's decision and held appellees were entitled to recover attorney fees from appellants, pursuant to R.C. 2323.51(A)(2)(a)(ii), which were incurred from April 26 through December 10, 2012. The court referred the matter back to the magistrate to determine the reasonable amount of attorney fees due to appellees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Amount Determination\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On June 18, 2015, the magistrate conducted an evidentiary hearing to determine the amount of attorney fees owed to appellees. Appellees presented expert testimony as well as several exhibits which were admitted into evidence. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Deft.'s Ex. A through H.) Appellants presented the testimony of Schaner and Vossman's own trial counsel, Kelm. Appellants presented several exhibits, only some of which were admitted into evidence. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pltf.'s Ex. 8 through 15.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The magistrate found appellees incurred reasonable attorney fees in the amount of $45,714.53 from April 26 through December 10, 2012. The magistrate further found that AirNet is the real party in interest pursuant to the receiver (appointed by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division, in case N.D.Ga. No. 1:14-cv-00178-WSD), having authorized AirNet's counsel to prosecute AirNet's claim for attorney fees and conclude this litigation. The court found the receiver confirmed appellees' counsel's authority in an e-mail communication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On August 3, 2015, appellants submitted their objections to the magistrate's decision on grounds that the decision: (1) granted attorney fees for illegal activity by appellees and their counsel, (2) granted attorney fees to AirNet now in receivership, in violation of a federal court ordered stay of proceedings, and (3) granted attorney fees to appellees who are not the real party in interest, since these claims are owned by a federal court receiver. On August 31, 2015, appellees filed a memorandum contra appellants' objections to the magistrate's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On October 19, 2016, the trial court overruled appellants' objections and adopted the magistrate's decision in its entirety. The trial court found appellants' objections to be not well-taken. The court found appellees were entitled to recover attorney fees in the amount of $45,714.53, pursuant to R.C. 2323.51(A)(2)(a)(ii), from appellants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Final Appealable Order\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On November 7, 2016, the trial court filed a final judgment entry thereby making final and appealable the court's judgment entries filed February 12, 2015 and October 19, 2016. Appellants filed a notice of appeal to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Assignments of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Appellants appeal and assign the following three assignments of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   I. THERE WERE SUFFICIENT FACTS AVAILABLE TO PLAINTIFF AT TRIAL TO MAKE IT ERROR TO AWARD SANCTIONS FOR FRIVILOUS CONDUCT FOR PROCEEDING WITH THE CASE.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   II. DEFENDANTS AND COUNSEL ENGAGING IN ILLEGAL CONDUCT SHOULD NOT BE AWARDED SANCTIONS WHICH WOULD REWARD THEIR CONDUCT IN OBTAINING SUMMARY JUDGMENT THROUGH PERJURED TESTIMONY.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   III. OWNERSHIP OF A RECEIVERSHIP ASSET CANNOT BE PROVEN BY HEARSAY TESTIMONY AS TO WHAT THE RECEIVER TOLD THEM.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Before discussing appellants' assignments of error, it is important to consider what was actually appealed and what can be considered on appeal. In simplest terms, this case breaks down to three trial court determinations. First, the trial court determined to grant summary judgment on the complaint in favor of appellees. It made this determination in the October 19, 2012 decision granting appellees' motion for summary judgment. As noted previously, we affirmed this determination in\n   <em>\n    Vossman\n   </em>\n   , and the Supreme Court declined to review this determination. The appeal before us today will not address this first determination as it has already been reviewed and affirmed by this court. We will refer to this determination as the \"merits determination.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Second, the trial court determined appellees are entitled to recover attorney fees from appellants. The court made this determination in the February 12, 2015 decision overruling appellants' objections to the magistrate's June 3, 2014 decision. We will refer to this determination as the \"entitlement determination.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Third, the trial court determined the amount of attorney fees to which appellees were entitled from appellants. The court made this determination in the October 19, 2016 decision and entry adopting the magistrate's June 19, 2015 decision and overruling appellants' objections to the magistrate's decision. We will refer to this determination as the \"amount determination.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 16} On November 7, 2016, the trial court entered a final judgment entry making the entitlement determination and the amount determination final and appealable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Appellants' notice of appeal states they are appealing from: (1) the court's final judgment entry dated November 7, 2016 (which encompasses the entitlement and amount determinations), and (2) the October 19, 2016 decision adopting the magistrate's June 19, 2015 decision and overruling appellants' objections to the magistrate's decision (the amount determination).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Although appellants specifically state in the notice of appeal they are appealing the amount determination, the assignments of error address the entitlement determination only. Appellants do not challenge the amount determination. For that reason, we will focus our analysis on the trial court's second determination-that appellees are entitled to recover attorney fees from appellants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    A. First Assignment of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 19} In their first assignment of error, appellants argue the trial court erred by awarding sanctions for frivolous conduct because there were sufficient facts for them to proceed with the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Authority for Trial Court's Determination of Frivolous Conduct\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The trial court awarded attorney fees, pursuant to R.C. 2323.51(B), having found that appellants engaged in frivolous conduct as defined in R.C. 2323.51(A)(2)(a)(ii).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   R.C. 2323.51(A)(2)(a)(ii) defines frivolous conduct as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [Conduct which] is not warranted under existing law, cannot be supported by a good faith argument for an extension, modification, or reversal of existing law, or cannot be supported by a good faith argument for the establishment of new law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Here, we apply the standard of review as previously outlined in\n   <em>\n    Vossman\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Vossman\n   </em>\n   , we stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Pursuant to R.C. 2323.51, a court may \"award * * * court costs, reasonable attorney's fees, and other reasonable expenses incurred in connection with a civil action or appeal * * * to any party to the civil action or appeal who was adversely affected by frivolous conduct.\" R.C. 2323.51(B)(1). \"Conduct\" includes \"[t]he filing of a civil action, the assertion of a claim, defense, or other position in connection with a civil action, the filing of a pleading, motion, or other paper in a civil action, * * * or the taking of any other action in connection with a civil action.\" R.C. 2323.51(A)(1)(a). \"Frivolous conduct\" is conduct that (1) obviously serves merely to harass or maliciously injure another party to the civil action; (2) is not warranted under existing law and cannot be supported by a good-faith argument for an extension, modification, or reversal of existing law; or (3) consists of allegations or other factual contentions that have no evidentiary support or are not likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation.

Appellants point us in particular to Rule 3.1 and the official comment thereto, which read in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    RULE 3.1: MERITORIOUS CLAIMS AND CONTENTIONS\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   A lawyer shall not bring or defend a proceeding, or assert or controvert an issue in a proceeding, unless there is a basis in law and fact for doing so that is not frivolous, which includes a good faith argument for an extension, modification, or reversal of existing law. A lawyer for the defendant in a criminal proceeding, or the respondent in a proceeding that could result in incarceration, may nevertheless so defend the proceeding as to require that every element of the case be established.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    Comment\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   [1] The advocate has a duty to use legal procedure for the fullest benefit of the client's cause, but also a duty not to abuse legal procedure. The law, both procedural and substantive, establishes the limits within which an advocate may proceed. However, the law is not always clear and never is static. Accordingly, in determining the proper scope of advocacy, account must be taken of the law's ambiguities and potential for change.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   [2] The filing of an action or defense or similar action taken for a client is not frivolous merely because the facts have not first been fully substantiated or because the lawyer expects to develop vital evidence only by discovery. What is required of lawyers, however, is that they inform themselves about the facts of their clients' cases and the applicable law and determine that they can make good faith arguments in support of their clients' positions. Such action is not frivolous even though the lawyer believes\n   that the client's position ultimately will not prevail. The action is frivolous, however, if the lawyer is unable either to make a good faith argument on the merits of the action taken or to support the action taken by a good faith argument for an extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Finally, both parties agree that in order for a trial court to award attorney fees, pursuant to R.C. 2323.51(A)(2)(a)(ii), the court must find that \"no reasonable lawyer would have brought the action in light of the existing law.\" We have previously stated that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   R.C. 2323.51 employs an objective standard in determining whether sanctions may be imposed for frivolous conduct.\n   <em>\n    Stevenson v.

Specifically, appellants point to: (1) appellees' initial statements that Vossman was terminated pursuant to an official policy regarding investigations, although there was no evidence of such policy and appellees later claimed that Vossman was terminated for violating a verbal directive, and (2) appellees' statement that Vossman was twice told to refrain from speaking about the investigation, although the evidence reflected only one instance in which Vossman was verbally told to refrain from discussions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Appellants provided several evidentiary materials attached to their objections to the magistrate's entitlement decision to support these contentions. In response to an interrogatory seeking \"each and every reason Plaintiff's employment with AirNet was terminated, the factual basis for the reason(s), and identify all persons who made that decision on behalf of AirNet,\" appellees responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   Subject to and without waiving any objections, [appellees] state that as a result of complaints relating to his unsafe flying practices, [Vossman] was placed on paid leave while [AirNet] investigated the allegations against him. These allegations, if proven true through AirNet's investigation, warranted disciplinary action up to and including discharge.\n   <em>\n    Pursuant to Company policy\n   </em>\n   , AirNet requested [Vossman's] cooperation with the investigation and specifically asked that [Vossman] keep the fact of the investigation confidential\n   <em>\n    on no less than two occasions\n   </em>\n   . Nonetheless, [Vossman] repeatedly breached this confidentiality by openly discussing the ongoing investigation. [Vossman's] efforts made it impossible for AirNet to properly investigate the complaints made against [Vossman]. In addition, [Vossman's] efforts caused other AirNet employees to suffer retaliation. As a result, [Vossman] was terminated. Quinn Hamon, Kim Miller and Thomas Schaner were involved in the decision to terminate [Vossman]. Amy Blackburn, Mike Troy, and Keith McGeorge presented complaints to AirNet regarding [Vossman] failure to comply with AirNet's policies and procedures. Further answering, see documents produced herewith.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   (Emphasis added.) (Appellants' Objs. to Mag.'s Entitlement Determination, Ex. E at 4-5.) Appellants also pointed to a personnel action form purportedly authored by Schaner, which stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   During the course of the investigation, Dan spoke to individuals not directly associated with the investigating team. His actions compromised the investigation, may have subjected other parties associated with the investigation to attempts of retribution and his sharing of information was\n   <em>\n    indirect\n   </em>\n   [sic]\n   <em>\n    violation of company policy\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    The policy states\n   </em>\n   that such violations are grounds for termination of employment.

(Appellants' Objs. to Mag.'s Entitlement Determination, Ex. D.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   {\u00b6 39} In their motion for summary judgment, appellees made no mention of a policy or multiple directives but, instead, stated that \"[Vossman] admits that AirNet directed him to maintain the confidentiality of the investigation\" and that \"[Vossman] admits that he knowingly violated\n   <em>\n    the directive\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) (Mot. for Sum. Jgmt. at 12-13.) Schaner, in his affidavit filed in support of the motion for summary judgment, made no mention of the discussion being in violation of company policy or that Vossman violated more than one directive to maintain confidentiality:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   Unfortunately, [Vossman] did not permit me to continue the investigation. [Vossman] e-mailed, phoned and texted various AirNet pilots and solicited generic statements on his behalf. These solicitations were particularly harmful to the investigation because [Vossman] advised the potential witnesses of the complaint and underlying issues.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   At my request, Ms. Miller contacted [Vossman] on Friday, March 12, 2011,\n   <em>\n    to instruct him to discontinue all discussions\n   </em>\n   with AirNet employees regarding the investigation, the allegations made against him, or his response to the allegations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   Despite\n   <em>\n    this instruction\n   </em>\n   , I learned from two AirNet pilots, Keith McGeorge and Bill Ronk, that [Vossman] contacted them to discuss the ongoing investigation after [Vossman] spoke with Ms. Miller on March 12, 2011.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   As a result of Mr. Vossman's complete disregard of\n   <em>\n    a Company directive\n   </em>\n   , which hindered the Company's ability to conduct an investigation, * * * I decided to terminate [Vossman's] employment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   (Emphasis added.) (Mot. for Sum. Jgmt. Ex.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellants' Brief at 22, quoting\n   <em>\n    Thurman v.

Appellants attached to their objections to the magistrate's entitlement decision a copy of an e-mail exchange between Schaner and Miller. With respect to an e-mail he received from an AirNet employee in support of Vossman, Schaner wrote to Miller: \"In addition to this little beauty I have also taken a call from [two other AirNet employees] on this topic. This is lining up as a 'damned if we do, damned if we don't' scenario for us quickly.\" (Appellants' Objs. to Mag.'s Entitlement Determination, Ex. G.) Miller replied: \"Before I left I asked Quinn to make sure that he knows that he cannot retaliate against any pilot or talk to anyone about this. Did he tell [D]an that? I'm assuming these people know because Dan told them? Totally inappropriate of Dan and the others commenting.\" (Appellants' Objs to Mag.'s Entitlement Determination, Ex. G.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Although appellants, in the course of their representation, did not present these evidentiary materials in response to the motion for summary judgment, they did impliedly raise the issue of whether the stated reason actually motivated\n   the challenged employment action. In the memorandum in opposition to the motion for summary judgment, Vossman made the following argument:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   In this case, a co-worker complained about [Vossman's] safety on two flights and accused him of violating FAA regulations and company policies. [\n   <em>\n    Vossman\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    knew that he did not do what he was being accused of doing\n   </em>\n   . [Vossman] was placed on leave and told an investigation would be conducted.\n   <em>\n    Initially,\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Vossman\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    was not told the investigation was confidential\n   </em>\n   , so he spoke to other long-term employees who had flown with him many times over the years about the allegations. When [appellees] began receiving letters of support from [\n   <em>\n    Vossman's\n   </em>\n   ] co-workers, [appellees] told [Vossman] not to communicate with anyone during the investigation.\n   <em>\n    Knowing the allegations could not be proven with objective evidence,\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    appellees\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    then terminated\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Vossman's\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    employment for speaking to his co-workers during the investigation\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   (Emphasis added.) (Vossman's Memo. in Opp. to Mot. for Sum. Jgmt. at 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Appellants further support their argument with the affidavits of three experienced employment lawyers, Vossman's lawyer Kelm, Attorney Tobias, and Attorney Gittes, who averred that no competent employment lawyer would have dismissed this case after Vossman's deposition. Attorney Tobias averred that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   Based on [his 35 years of] experience [practicing employee-side employment law], frequently there is evidence and testimony concerning discrimination from sources other than the plaintiff victim of discrimination, both direct and circumstantial evidence and evidence of pretext, which if believed warrants a finding of discrimination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   In this case where the plaintiff established a prima facie case and presented substantial evidence of pretext in the reason given for discharge, no competent employment attorney would abandon his client and dismiss the case after the plaintiff testified that he knew of no direct evidence of age discrimination and that the employer was justified in investigating allegations of unsafe flying, particularly when substantial discovery was yet to be conducted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   (Tobias Aff. at \u00b6 6, 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Attorney Gittes averred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   With some exceptions, in employment discrimination cases, it is unusual for a plaintiff's deposition testimony to provide outcome-determinative discovery information. Most employee plaintiffs do not have nearly as much information (either documents or admissible testimony) about the employer's motivation for the challenged employment decision. The discovery process, in employment litigation, is typically an opportunity for the plaintiff employee to obtain documents and testimony from the defendant employer's managers and employees (such as internal emails and memos, personnel file information about the plaintiff and comparator employees, information about past disciplinary actions, investigations, or instances of potential discrimination, and the decision-makers' explanations for their actions, along with their reaction to contradictory evidence). Whether a case develops to the point that the plaintiff's case can survive summary judgment and proceed to a jury trial depends largely on what records the employer produces, whether the employer's decision-making was documented in potentially damaging emails and memos, whether other employees were treated equally under similar circumstances, and whether the employer \"gets\n   it story straight\" and avoids inconsistencies in key managers' testimony. The plaintiff employee's testimony generally has little impact on any of these areas.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   (Gittes Aff. at \u00b6 10.) Gittes further pointed the court to the second factor of\n   <em>\n    Manzer\n   </em>\n   and reiterated much of the evidence appellants pointed to as well as evidence suggesting that appellees attempted to suppress positive information about Vossman while collecting negative information. Finally, in reference to another experienced employment law attorney, appellants point to the fact that David Campbell, AirNet's counsel, conceded that appellants did not take too many depositions, but he thought they should have taken two more, or six in total.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Appellees did not address\n   <em>\n    Manzer\n   </em>\n   in their brief before this court; rather, as noted above, they relied on Vossman's own testimony in support of its argument that the trial court should be affirmed. Nor did the magistrate or the trial court\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   address the law of\n   <em>\n    Manzer\n   </em>\n   in its entitlement determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   {\u00b6 46} Although appellants, prior to summary judgment, may not have artfully or fully pursued Vossman's claim in light of existing law, based on the foregoing evidence in the record and under the law of\n   <em>\n    St. Mary's Honor\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Manzer\n   </em>\n   , we cannot find that \"no reasonable lawyer would have brought the action in light of the existing law.\"\n   <em>\n    Stafford\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6. Therefore, we find the trial court erred in awarding sanctions based on a finding that appellants' claims were not warranted under existing law, could not have been supported by a good-faith argument for an extension, modification, or reversal of existing law, or could not have been supported by a good-faith argument for the establishment of new law. Accordingly, we sustain appellants' first assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Second and Third Assignments of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   {\u00b6 47} Having sustained appellants' first assignment of error, appellants' second and third assignments of error are rendered moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusions of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   {\u00b6 48} Having sustained appellants' first assignment of error and rendered moot appellants' second and third assignments of error, we reverse the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. We remand for the trial court to vacate the judgment entry of November 7, 2016, as well as the decisions of February 12, 2015 and October 19, 2016, finding appellants' engaged in frivolous conduct and awarding attorney fees to appellees for the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment reversed and cause remanded with instructions.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   BROWN, P.J., concurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   HORTON, J., dissents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   {\u00b6 49} I respectfully dissent with the majority's finding any error in the trial court's adoption of the magistrate's June 3, 2014 decision, which rejects appellants' objections. In short, Vossman's own admission\n   elicited from his deposition caused irreparable injury to his case. Furthermore, in light of these facts, I do not believe that appellees or the trial court and magistrate had any obligation to address the\n   <em>\n    Manzer v. Diamond Shamrock Chems.
