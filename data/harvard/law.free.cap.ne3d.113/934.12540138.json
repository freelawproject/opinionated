The father argues that the judge failed to give proper effect to facts admitted as a result of the mother's untimely responses to the father's requests for admissions. See Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 36. Because the father fails to identify any particular finding of fact that does not give proper effect to, is contradicted by, or is clearly erroneous in light of the admissions, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . The mother and father had a relationship beginning in 2012 but never married. The minor child was born in 2013. In 2015, the father filed a complaint for custody, support, and parenting time. The mother filed a separate complaint seeking custody and child support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The father served on the mother six sets of requests for admissions. The mother failed to timely serve answers to four of the six sets, and the judge deemed them admitted. In 2017, after two days of trial, the judge issued findings of fact and ordered judgment awarding sole legal custody to the mother.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The father appealed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . The father argues that the judge abused her discretion by ignoring or excluding the facts established by the judicially admitted rule 36 requests, rendering the judge's findings clearly erroneous. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Under rule 36(b), a failure to timely respond to requests for admissions \"conclusively establishe[s] the truth of those admissions.\"\n   <em>\n    Reynolds Aluminum Bldg.

The judge stated that she would allow the mother to testify regarding facts admitted by default and that the father should be prepared to cross-examine. The judge noted that if she found the mother's testimony credible, it would be given \"more weight than a defaulted admission.\" \"The judge may ameliorate the effect of the rule when: (1) the presentation of the merits of the action will be advanced, and (2) the party obtaining the admission fails to satisfy the court that withdrawal or amendment will prejudice him in maintaining his action or defense on the merits.

The father has not identified any prejudice to him resulting from the judge's treatment of the admissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In particular, the father has not identified a single finding of fact that fails to give proper effect to, is contradicted by, or is clearly erroneous in light of the admissions. \"It is the appellant's burden to show that a finding is clearly erroneous.\"\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4238973\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/86/295/#p298\">\n    86 Mass. App. Ct. 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 298 (2014). The closest the father comes is to list, in an addendum to his brief, certain admissions that he claims were \"ignored\" by or \"excluded\" from the findings of fact. The list does not identify any particular finding of fact that is clearly erroneous in light of the listed admissions, nor does it identify any issue on which additional findings of fact should have been made that would call the judgment into question. In this respect, the father's brief does not rise to the level of appellate argument. See Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=367%20Mass.%20921\">\n    367 Mass. 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1975). Even if the judge had erred in her treatment of the admissions (and we do not imply that she did), the father has not shown that any such errors were prejudicial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Corrected judgment affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    Corrected findings and a corrected judgment entered on May 24, 2017, nunc pro tunc to the date of the original findings and judgment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    The notice of appeal was filed after the denial of the father's posttrial motion to amend the findings of fact and conclusions of law and for relief from judgment. The notice of appeal did not, however, identify the order denying that motion as a subject of the appeal. See Mass. R. A. P. 3 (c), as appearing in\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=442%20Mass.%201502\">\n     442 Mass. 1502\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2004) (notice of appeal \"shall, in civil cases, designate the judgment, decree, adjudication, order, or part thereof appealed from\"). Thus the propriety of the denial of the motion is not before us. In any event, the father's brief makes no argument regarding the motion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    The father was a party to this 2005 divorce case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
