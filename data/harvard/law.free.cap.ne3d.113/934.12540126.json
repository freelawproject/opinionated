The foster mother also appeals from an order of a single justice of this court denying a stay of the termination of the biological mother's parental rights. We affirm the orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . We summarize the facts of the case, relying on the factual findings by the Juvenile Court judge and the undisputed facts appearing in the record. Gemma was born in October, 2013. The next day, a Juvenile Court judge granted emergency custody of Gemma to the Department of Children and Families (DCF).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   DCF initially placed Gemma in the same foster home as her biological sister, but moved Gemma to the foster mother's home on November 18, 2013. After a hearing on the merits on October 30, 2014, both of Gemma's parents were found to be unfit and DCF was granted custody of the child. While the father's parental rights were terminated after the hearing, the mother's rights were not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Some two years later, although Gemma still resided with the foster mother, the foster mother's behavior as a foster parent was becoming a source of concern.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On October 14, 2016, Gemma filed a motion in the Juvenile Court seeking a finding that DCF had abused its discretion in keeping her foster placement separate from a foster home where two of her biological brothers were placed. In the motion, Gemma's counsel alleged that \"multiple [ G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51A, reports] have been filed on [Gemma's] current foster home, including allegations of physical abuse on [Gemma].\" The judge held a hearing on the matter at which the foster mother testified. On November 1, 2016, the judge allowed the motion, in part, and found that DCF had abused its discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Aware that this finding put Gemma's placement with her in serious jeopardy, the foster mother filed her first motion to intervene in the care and protection proceedings on November 10, 2016. She argued in the motion that Gemma would suffer \"measurable harm\" if their relationship was \"disrupted\" and also claimed to fill the role of Gemma's de facto parent. The judge denied the motion without prejudice on December 20, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Gemma then filed a motion on December 30, 2016, requesting an immediate transfer from the foster mother's home. The judge allowed the motion on January 3, 2017, relying on a DCF area clinic review team's determination that \"removal of the child from the present foster home and placement in a home with two of her siblings was in the child's best interest.\" The judge's order required DCF to begin transitioning Gemma to her brothers' foster home immediately. The foster mother attempted to stay the removal order, but her motions were denied both in the Juvenile Court and by a single justice of this court. Gemma was relocated to her new foster home on February 6, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 11, 2017, Gemma's biological mother stipulated to the termination of her parental rights and entered into a postadoption contact agreement with DCF. Gemma's new foster parents were listed as the adoptive parents. Once the foster mother became aware of this development, she filed another motion to intervene on April 24, 2017. This second motion to intervene, which is the subject of this appeal, asserted a failure of an opportunity to be meaningfully heard, in violation of her due process rights under the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, and a right to a fair hearing prior to the termination of the biological mother's parental rights. The foster mother argued that a positive result at the fair hearing could cause DCF to recommend her as Gemma's adoptive parent to the judge, which was an assertion supported by an earlier statement DCF made to this court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   A full hearing on the second motion to intervene occurred on September 7 and 12, 2017. The judge denied the motion. In her order dated October 31, 2017, the judge concluded that the foster mother had \"not presented her own 'direct, substantial, significantly protectable interest in the litigation,' \" and that the foster mother's intervention \"would only serve [the foster mother]'s interest and not those of the child.\" The foster mother filed a notice of appeal two days later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In preparation for the appeal, the foster mother filed a motion with the Juvenile Court requesting \"all transcripts and pleadings from October 1, 2016, through the present date [December 22, 2017,] in [Gemma]'s [c]are &amp; [p]rotection case.\" The judge denied the motion on January 8, 2018, as \"overly broad\" and \"request[ing] confidential, impounded information that [the foster mother] is not entitled to as a matter of law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The foster mother also petitioned a single justice of this court for a stay of the termination of the mother's parental rights. The single justice denied the motion for a failure \"to demonstrate ... a reasonable likelihood of success on appeal\" on December 22, 2017. The foster mother filed a notice of appeal from the order of the single justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In January, 2018, the foster mother filed a motion with this court to docket, consolidate, and expedite the three issues now before us on appeal: the order denying the second motion to intervene, the order denying a request for transcripts, and the order of the single justice denying a stay of the termination of parental rights. The portion of the motion seeking to consolidate the appeals was allowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . 1.\n   <em>\n    Motion to intervene\n   </em>\n   .

R. Civ. P. 24 (a) (2), we need not consider whether, in fact, the motion was timely. On appeal, the foster mother raises three separate bases for intervention: a right to notice and to be heard grounded in various Federal and Massachusetts statutes and regulations, a right to a preremoval hearing, and a liberty interest in the caretaking relationship with Gemma. None is sufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   While a foster parent generally has a right to notice and to be heard in certain Juvenile Court proceedings,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   these rights are oriented toward assisting the judge in determining the best interests of the child. See\n   <em>\n    Adoption of Sherry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"993899\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/435/331/#p338\">\n    435 Mass. 331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 338 (2001) (\"Because foster parents often possess the most detailed and the most current information available, the Legislature had good reason to permit them to be heard. The best interests of the child are served by ensuring that judges have all the relevant information about the child at their disposal ...\"). However, the statutes and regulations upon which the foster mother relies are followed by an explicit statement that the right to notice and to be heard should not be construed to allow a foster parent to join proceedings as a party. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20675\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5)(G) (2012) (\"this subparagraph shall not be construed to require that any foster parent, preadoptive parent, or relative providing care for the child be made a party to such a proceeding solely on the basis of such notice and right to be heard\"); G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 29D (\"Nothing in this provision shall be construed to provide that such foster parent, pre-adoptive parent or relative shall be made a party to the proceeding\"). Moreover, consistent with the spirit of\n   <em>\n    Adoption of Sherry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"993899\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/435/331/#p338\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"993899\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/435/331/#p338\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   the foster mother was heard at different stages of the proceedings in the Juvenile Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, there is no evidence that the judge failed to consider the foster mother's perspective in determining Gemma's best interests. See\n   <em>\n    Care &amp; Protection of Zelda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1157026\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/26/869/#p871\">\n    26 Mass.

Regs. \u00a7 7.116(2)(c) (2009), rather than prior to removal, cannot justify intervention. The judge, in moving toward a determination of the best interests of the child, has an interest in expediency and efficiency. See\n   <em>\n    Care &amp; Protection of Zelda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 872 (\"Indeed, the importance of a spare and speedy course of procedure in care and protection matters has been explained too often to require further statement here\"). Regardless of the status of any administrative hearing, a Juvenile Court judge has the authority to act if the child's well-being is at stake.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, the judge found that DCF abused its discretion by not placing Gemma with her siblings and found sufficient evidence to justify an order for expedited removal. Moreover, even if a preremoval hearing had been scheduled, the result of that hearing would not constrain the judge's decision-making authority. See\n   <em>\n    Adoption of Hugo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"651287\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/428/219/#p226\">\n    428 Mass. 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 226 (1998), cert. denied sub nom.\n   <em>\n    Hugo P\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    George P\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11145667,11145571,11145511,11145489,11145716,11145535\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/1034/\">\n    526 U.S. 1034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999) (judge has obligation to consider DCF's proposed plan but must make determination based on child's best interests). The foster mother's own interest in a preremoval hearing fails to justify intervention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Third, and finally, the foster mother does not have a liberty interest regarding the caretaking of the child that would justify intervention in this proceeding.

While we are sympathetic to the bond that may form between a child and a foster parent, Massachusetts law is clear that foster parentage is a limited status created by contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Kerins\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lima\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"274537\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/425/108/\">\n    425 Mass. 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 112 n.6 (1997) (foster parents are \"temporary contract service providers with a defined set of rights and responsibilities that clearly differs from those of a child's parents\"). That status does not give rise to a liberty interest. See\n   <em>\n    Care &amp; Protection of Zelda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . Because the foster mother has failed to state an interest sufficient to warrant intervention under Mass. R. Civ.

Here, the judge found the foster mother's motion \"overly broad\" and without \"a basis upon which the Court would provide the material requested to a non-party.\" We agree. The foster mother's request for \"all\" documents from the start of the abuse of discretion hearing indeed was overbroad and unwarranted. Rather than tailoring her request, the foster mother chose to appeal from the order directly. Since the foster mother was a nonparty, the judge was well within her discretion to deny the foster mother such broad access absent a valid justification for doing so.
