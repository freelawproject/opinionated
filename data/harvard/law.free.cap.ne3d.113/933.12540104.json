R. Civ. P. 41 (b) (2),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=365%20Mass.%20803\">\n    365 Mass. 803\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1974). We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . On March 7, 2017, the plaintiff filed a pro se complaint alleging that the correction officer defendants\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   violated her civil rights when they used excessive force in removing the plaintiff from her cell on February 22, 2014. After the incident, the plaintiff allegedly reported pain in her wrist, hand, ribs, and eye to defendant Alicia Cote-Levanti, a registered nurse employed by a private company with which the DOC contracts to provide medical services to inmates. According to the complaint, Cote-Levanti examined the plaintiff in cursory fashion and ignored her reports of injury. A subsequent X-ray showed the plaintiff had a fractured finger. The complaint sought damages for the defendants' violations of the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   On June 29, 2017, the correction officer defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground of improper venue. On July 24, 2017, Cote-Levanti moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Among other grounds, Cote-Levanti asserted that the case was time-barred under the applicable statute of limitations. On November 13, 2017, Cote-Levanti served the plaintiff with a motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute, because the plaintiff had not responded to her motion to dismiss. The motion was docketed on November 14, 2017, and allowed on November 21, 2017, by margin endorsement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On November 24, 2017, the remaining defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute, because the plaintiff had not responded to their motion to dismiss. On November 27, 2017, their motion was allowed by a similar margin endorsement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed the judgment of dismissal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . \"On motion of the defendant, with notice, the court may, in its discretion, dismiss any action for failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with these rules or any order of court.\" Mass. R. Civ. P. 41 (b) (2). We review a judge's decision to allow a rule 41 (b) (2) motion for an abuse of discretion,\n   <em>\n    Bucchiere\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    New England Tel. &amp; Tel.

Here, the judge's margin endorsements did not refer to these considerations. Rather, the orders simply stated that the motions were allowed \"for the good and sufficient reasons herein\" -- that is, because the plaintiff had taken no action on the case for over four months since the motions to dismiss were filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Even assuming, without deciding, that the judge's allowance of the rule 41 (b) (2) motions without explicit consideration of the\n   <em>\n    Monahan\n   </em>\n   factors constituted an abuse of discretion, we discern no error in the orders of dismissal because the plaintiff's claims were time-barred. See\n   <em>\n    Viriyahiranpaiboon\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Department of State Police\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1011081\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/52/843/#p847\">\n    52 Mass. App. Ct. 843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 847 (2001) (reversal on procedural grounds not required where plaintiff is not entitled to relief as matter of law). The plaintiff's personal injury and civil rights claims are subject to a three-year statute of limitations. See G. L. c. 260, \u00a7\u00a7 2A, 5B. As alleged in the complaint, the plaintiff was injured on February 22 and 23, 2014, when the defendants used excessive force to remove her from her cell and denied her proper medical care. Therefore, she was required to file her complaint by February 24, 2017, at the latest. Her complaint, filed on March 7, 2017, was too late.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Although the complaint states that it was placed in the prison's institutional mailbox on February 10, 2017, and cites to the so-called \"prison mailbox rule\" as it is explained in\n   <em>\n    Grady\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9471473\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/269/913/#p916\">\n    269 F.3d 913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 916 (8th Cir. 2001) (\"In its original form, the prison mailbox rule deemed a pro se prisoner's notice of appeal 'filed' at the moment he delivered it to the warden\"), the plaintiff made no argument in the Superior Court, or on appeal, that the prison mailbox rule makes her complaint timely.

We decline to address the issue here because it has not been argued in the plaintiff's brief, see Mass. R. A.

The possibility that no final judgment has yet entered for Cote-Levanti does not deter us from addressing the order of dismissal as to her, where the issues raised are virtually the same as with the other defendants. We anticipate that after receipt of the rescript for this appeal, the trial court will enter any additional judgment needed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
