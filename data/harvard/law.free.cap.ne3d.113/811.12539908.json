Dyson due to delinquent property taxes. Dyson filed a written objection to the tax sale. Following a hearing, which Dyson did not attend, the trial court entered its Order Overruling Objections and Defenses to Tax Sale (the Order). Dyson, pro se, appeals from the Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [2] We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts &amp; Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [3] On August 31, 2017, the Treasurer and the Auditor filed a Joint Application for Judgment and Order of Sale, along with a joint affidavit and a 2017 tax sale judgment listing of properties with delinquent uncollected taxes, special assessments, penalties, and costs. Included in this list were five properties owned by Dyson, with delinquency amounts totaling over $9000. That same day, the trial court issued a Judgment and Order of Sale, entering judgment against the listed tracts of real property in the amount of their delinquencies and ordering the properties sold at a tax sale. The advertised date of the tax sale was September 20, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [4] On or about September 5, 2017, Dyson filed with the trial court a self-styled \"Verified Notice of Defense in Opposition to Tax Sale(s), and Amotion [sic] of Possession\" (the Notice of Defense),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   which listed the following alleged defenses:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   LACK OF PRIVATE VENUE\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   LACK OF VERIFIED SIGNED CLAIM\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   LACK OF STANDING\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   LACK OF PERSONAL JURISDICTION\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   LACK OF SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   FAILURE TO STATE A CLAIM THAT RELIEF CAN BE GRANTED\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   LACK OF EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION AS REQUIRD BY PATENT LAWS\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Appellant's Appendix Vol. 2\n   </em>\n   at 6. In the Notice of Defense, Dyson set out thirty-six \"lawful reasons not to sign a judgment for tax sale on [his] private land under United States patent numbers 91 &amp; 137[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.

Dyson appended to the Notice of Defense an \"Affidavit of Truth For Registration of Memorial Upon Birth Certificate Number 113-1960-101193,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14, a \"Declaration to renounce and nullification of my Corporate US Citizenship, and my declaration of non-corporate franchise Indiana state citizenship,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-19, a \"GRANTEE/ASSIGNEE'S NOTICE OF UPDATE OF LAND PATENT,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 30-37, and, among other things, an \"AFFIDAVIT AND NOTICE OF REMOVAL OF PATENTED LAND FROM TAX ROLES,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 45-50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   [5] On September 6, 2017, the trial court entered an order in which the court observed that it could not hold a hearing within seven days of the advertised tax sale\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   due to court congestion. Accordingly, the court ordered the removal of Dyson's property from the list of tracts for sale at the upcoming tax sale. The court scheduled a hearing on Dyson's objections for January 9, 2018. The hearing was rescheduled twice and eventually held on March 29, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   [6] On September 12, 2017, Dyson filed with the trial court a document titled, \"Praecipe for judicial proceedings according to the course of the common law and trial by jury of my peers, with investigation\".\n   <em>\n    Appellees' Appendix Vol. 2\n   </em>\n   at 25. The court noted in the CCS that Dyson's filing was not clear as to what relief, if any, was being requested. The court indicated that \"all proceedings herein shall be in accordance with the laws and trial rules of the State of Indiana, as required.\"\n   <em>\n    Appellant's Appendix Vol. 2\n   </em>\n   at 3. This same day, the trial court also issued an order governing future filings in the case, which required all pleadings and documents to be \"in compliance with the statutes of the State of Indiana and the Indiana Trial Rules, as they exist on and after this date\" and include only information relevant to the proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54. Further, the order required that requests for relief clearly state the Indiana trial rule or statute on which the request is made and that requests for relief \"be for only such relief as may be lawfully had in the Wabash Circuit Court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The trial court concluded its order by noting that violations \"may be enforced by contempt if necessary\" and that \"any pleadings or documents not filed in accordance with this order shall be placed in a trash receptacle.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [7] At the hearing on March 29, 2018, the trial court noted that Dyson had notice of the hearing but had chosen not to appear. The trial court took judicial notice of the August 31, 2017 filings and order related to the tax sale. The attorney for the Treasurer and the Auditor then presented brief argument to the court. Counsel argued that the Notice of Defense filed by Dyson did not comply with the requirements of I.C. \u00a7 6-1.1-24-4.7(b) and that it was difficult to decipher the asserted defenses. The trial court agreed and noted at the hearing that the court had been \"generous by characterizing [the Notice] as an objection and supporting documentation.\"\n   <em>\n    Transcript Vol. 2\n   </em>\n   at 6. The court continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   I find nothing after reviewing [the Notice of Defense] that remotely addresses any reasonable ground for an objection, uh, or frankly, is anything other than nonsense. Um, based on the history the Court's had with similar nonsensical pleadings, I think that, uh, it clearly warrants, uh, a finding of bad faith, frivolous, and, um, without any basis, in fact, to support that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the trial court entered judgment in favor of the Treasurer and the Auditor and ordered Dyson to pay their attorney fees in the amount of $600 for the frivolous fillings. The court asked counsel to prepare a proposed order, which was filed and signed that same day.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   [8] On April 2, 2018, Dyson filed a Motion for Order to Certify Right of Subrogation. The motion, which is not contained in the record before us, was found by the trial court to be \"nonsensical in nature\" and noncompliant with the court's order of September 12, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Appellant's Appendix Vol. 2\n   </em>\n   at 4 (CCS entry). Accordingly, the trial court ordered that any further filings made on behalf of Dyson shall be filed in open court and in full compliance with the September order. On three additional dates in April 2018, Dyson unsuccessfully attempted to file a document or pleading without complying with the trial court's orders. Dyson now appeals the Order, pro se.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion &amp; Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   [9] We begin by observing that \"a pro se litigant is held to the same standards as a trained attorney and is afforded no inherent leniency simply by virtue of being self-represented.\"\n   <em>\n    Zavodnik v. Harper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6906229\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/17/259/#p266\">\n    17 N.E.3d 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 266 (Ind. 2014). Further, \"[t]here is no right to engage in abusive litigation, and the state has a legitimate interest in the preservation of valuable judicial and administrative resources.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6906229\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/17/259/#p266\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6906229\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/17/259/#p266\">\n    at 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Every resource that courts devote to an abusive litigant is a resource denied to other legitimate cases with good-faith litigants.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   [10] The trial court aptly identified Dyson's various filings as nonsensical and not based on applicable law. His lengthy appellate briefs similarly lack cogency and veer off on new topics not raised in the Notice of Defense. Dyson expressly presents four issues for appeal, which we attempt to decipher as follows: 1) whether he is a taxpayer as defined by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%206-5.5-1\">\n    Ind. Code \u00a7 6-5.5-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -17 ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   2) whether his property is exempt from taxation pursuant to I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6-1.1-11-9(b)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 6-1.1-2- 7\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and his alleged federal land patents; 3) whether the Auditor and the Treasurer failed to exhaust administrative remedies; and 4) whether the trial court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case. Dyson's summary of his appellate argument is representative of the clarity, or lack thereof, throughout his briefs:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   The facts of the laws herein are clear, when I Jeffrey Donald Dyson is not a tax payer defined under the law(s), and only a taxpayer's property is assessable, and my property is exempted by law, by patent, and the Auditor's and Treasurers [sic] failure to file a claim when advertised and complete the Administrative remedy required to collect a tax, and show the property was assessable, together with the Court's lack of venue, lack of standing, lack of personal jurisdiction &amp; subject matter jurisdiction, as a matter of law mandates a reversal of the lower court's order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    Appellant's Brief\n   </em>\n   at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   [11] In addition to his arguments generally lacking merit, sound reasoning, and citation to\n   <em>\n    relevant\n   </em>\n   authority, we observe that the precise issues presented by Dyson were not presented below. For example, a review of the Notice of Defense reveals that Dyson never directed the trial court to the Indiana statutes upon which he now relies ( I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6-5.5-1-17, 6-1.1-11-9, and 6-1.1-2-7 ), he did not mention exhaustion of administrative remedies, and he asserted entirely different, though equally vague, jurisdictional arguments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, we find the issues waived.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zavodnik\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6906229\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/17/259/#p266\">\n    17 N.E.3d at 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (issue waived where appellant - an abusive litigant - failed to present argument below and another issue waived where he failed, on appeal, to present cogent argument and citation to relevant authority).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   [12] Waiver notwithstanding, we observe that Dyson's objection to the application for judgment and order of sale was wholly improper. Dyson acknowledged that he owned and occupied the real property in question, which is all located in Wabash County, Indiana.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, Dyson did not dispute that the property taxes from the prior year's spring installment remained unpaid. His objection boiled down to the fact that he believed the property taxes were wrongfully assessed for various nebulous reasons. These issues should have been raised, if at all, in another forum,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   but they were not proper objections here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   [13] The tax sale process is a purely statutory creation.\n   <em>\n    Stump v.

App. 2015). Indiana Code Chapter 6-1.1-24 governs the sale of real property when taxes become delinquent. \"If a real estate owner fails to pay property taxes, the property may be sold to satisfy the outstanding tax obligation.\"\n   <em>\n    Stump\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6867585\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/33/360/#p363\">\n    33 N.E.3d at 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   [14] The statutory process begins with the county treasurer and auditor developing the list of real property with delinquencies and providing proper notices to the owners regarding the tax sale. Thereafter, the county treasurer and auditor \"make application for judgment and order for sale\" in a single cause of action \"to any court of competent jurisdiction\". I.C. \u00a7 6-1.1-24-4.6(b). Along with their joint application to the trial court, the county treasurer and auditor are required to file an affidavit attesting to the accuracy of the delinquency list as of that date. I.C. \u00a7 6-1.1-24-4.6(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   [15] I.C. \u00a7 6-1.1-24-4.7 addresses the action in the trial court and provides in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (a) No later than fifteen (15) days before the advertised date of the tax sale, the court shall examine the list of tracts and real property ....

Moreover, the written objection that he filed with the trial court was not accompanied by original or duplicate tax receipts (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , evidence that he had paid the delinquencies) or other supporting documentation, as required by statute. Rather, the Notice of Defense asserted a laundry list of nonsensical defenses (or \"reasons\") and included documents irrelevant to the question of whether the inclusion of Dyson's property on the delinquency list was in error.
