Because that chemist was no longer employed at the lab at the time of trial, Clark explained that she reviewed that chemist's bench notes, testing data, and certificate of analysis, along with the peer review notes of the chemist's conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   With respect to the specific testing of the substance, Clark explained that it was subjected to both an ultraviolet spectrophotometry test and a gas chromatography mass spectrometry test. She further explained that as part of this testing, the instruments produce graphs of the results. By examining such graphs and applying her training and experience, Clark testified that she could determine whether a particular substance is present. Over objection, Clark testified that in her opinion, the substance contained heroin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On appeal, the defendant argues that because Clark did not personally conduct the tests or examine the substance, and did not produce a certificate of analysis, her opinion is insufficient to establish that the substance contained heroin. But \"[o]ur law allows a [chemical analyst], who did not himself conduct the relevant tests, to testify to his own opinion based on the data generated by the nontestifying analyst.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Grady\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174030\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/474/715/#p723\">\n    474 Mass. 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 723-724 (2016), citing\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Greineder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275038\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/464/580/#p603\">\n    464 Mass. 580\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 603, cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12702912,12702913,12702914,12702915,12702916,12702917,12702918,12702919,12702920,12702921,12702922,12702908,12702909,12702910,12702911\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/571/865/\">\n    571 U.S. 865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Clark's testimony was therefore sufficient.
