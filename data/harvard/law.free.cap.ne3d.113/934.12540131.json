On appeal, Mack contends, as she did below, that there was error in the jury instructions. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Our review of this matter is hampered by the deficiencies in the record before us. Mack has included a transcript that contains only the jury charge conference, the jury charge, and the verdict. See Mass. R. A. P. 8 (a), as amended,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=378%20Mass.%20932\">\n    378 Mass. 932\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979) (composition of record on appeal shall include transcript of proceedings). With this in mind, \"we review [the] objections to [the] jury instructions to determine if there was any error, and, if so, whether the error affected the substantial rights of the objecting party.\"\n   <em>\n    Dos Santos\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Coleta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275373\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/465/148/#p153\">\n    465 Mass. 148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 153-154 (2013), quoting\n   <em>\n    Hopkins\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Medeiros\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1152942\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/48/600/#p611\">\n    48 Mass.

However, given Mack's failure to include a complete transcript of the trial, she is unable to meet her burden to demonstrate prejudicial error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
