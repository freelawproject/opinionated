The charge stemmed from abuse of the defendant's stepdaughter, Stephanie S. The incident at issue took place shortly after the family moved from Indiana to Illinois. Although the evidence at trial was focused on events that took place in Illinois on a specific date, there was also evidence that the defendant abused his stepdaughter in Indiana. The jury was instructed that the State did not have to prove that the abuse occurred on a specific date. The jury was not instructed that the State had to prove that the offense occurred in Illinois. The defendant contends that these instructions\n   allowed the jury to find him guilty based on conduct that occurred in Indiana, contrary to the rule of criminal jurisdiction. See\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1-5(a)(1) (providing that a criminal defendant is subject to prosecution in Illinois only for conduct that occurred at least partially within the state). He argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request an instruction on jurisdiction or to object to the instruction telling jurors that the State did not have to prove that the offense took place on the date specified in the charge. He also argues that the court did not comply with the requirements of Illinois Supreme Court Rule 431(b) (eff. July 1, 2012) and\n   <em>\n    People v.

We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b6 2 The defendant began a relationship with Stephanie's mother, Tonya, in 2012. At that time, Stephanie was seven years old. The defendant and Tonya married in December 2013. Throughout the relationship, the family moved numerous times, usually staying with relatives. They lived at various places in Indiana. Early in January 2014, they moved to Sumner, Illinois, where they shared a trailer with Tonya's cousin, Joseph A., his wife, Ashley, and their two children, one-year-old Joseph Jr. and three-month-old Jacob. In the early morning hours of January 30, Jacob was rushed to the hospital with life-threatening head injuries. The defendant stayed in the trailer with Stephanie while the other adults went to the hospital with the baby. That is when the events at issue took place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 3 The Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) became involved due to the severity of Jacob's injuries, which were determined to have been inflicted by Joseph. DCFS investigator Jay Reeves took Joseph Jr. into protective custody. He learned from the adults in the family that eight-year-old Stephanie also lived in the trailer. Reeves drove to Stephanie's elementary school to take her into protective custody as well. In the car, Stephanie told Reeves that she had a secret. She told him that the defendant touched her \"private part\" and made her touch his \"private part.\" She said that this happened more than once, and that the last time it happened was that morning. Reeves reported Stephanie's allegations to the police and scheduled a forensic interview for her the following day at the Healing Harbor Child Advocacy Center.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 4 This matter came for trial in November 2014. Jay Reeves testified that he received a call at approximately 4 a.m. on January 30, 2014, to investigate a case involving a three-month-old baby with life-threatening injuries. At the police station, he spoke with the adults who lived in the trailer with the baby. He learned from them that there were two other children living in the trailer-the baby's 15-month-old brother, Joseph Jr., and his 8-year-old cousin, Stephanie. When Stephanie's mother, Tonya Choate, indicated that she intended to continue living in the trailer, Reeves told her that he needed to take both Joseph Jr. and Stephanie into protective custody. At this time, Joseph Jr. was at the police station with the adults, the baby had been airlifted to a hospital in Indiana, and Stephanie was at school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 5 Reeves left the police station with Joseph Jr. and drove to Stephanie's school. He testified that after he explained to Stephanie why he was picking her up, he drove the two children to a doctor's office for an initial health screening. Reeves explained that this was standard DCFS procedure. He testified that he then drove the two children to their foster home, a drive of about 100 miles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 6 Reeves testified that during the drive, Stephanie asked if she could call him\n   \"Dad.\" She told him that this was what she called all of the men who took care of her. Stephanie referred to three different men as her dads-her biological father, Levi, her previous stepfather, Doc, and the defendant, whom she also called Jimmy. Reeves explained to Stephanie that although it was his job to make sure that she and her little cousin were safe, he would not take care of them the same way a dad would take care of them. He told her that she could call him either Jay or Mr. Reeves. He then asked her which of her daddies she liked best. According to Reeves, Stephanie told him that she did not like Doc, and she described instances of physical abuse by him. She told Reeves that her favorite daddy was either Levi or Jimmy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 7 Reeves testified that after a pause in the conversation, Stephanie told him that she had a secret, but she did not know if she should tell him her secret because her mother would be angry. Reeves assured her that it was his job to listen to her and that she would not get into trouble for telling him her secret. Reeves testified that Stephanie then told him that Jimmy touched her \"private part\" and made her hand touch his \"private part.\" She told Reeves that this happened more than once and that the last time was that morning. She explained that she woke up that morning because she felt the defendant rubbing her \"private part.\" She told Reeves that the defendant also held onto her hand and made her rub his \"private part.\" Reeves testified that Stephanie asked him, \"Why doesn't he do that with his own hand?\" Reeves told her he did not know why. He testified that Stephanie then told him that she was afraid she would get into trouble with her mother for telling him this. When he asked her why, Stephanie explained that her mother grounded her for two weeks just for talking to someone from DCFS in Indiana. She also told Reeves that she knew her mother loved Jimmy. She told him that she, too, liked Jimmy except when he was touching her \"private.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 8 Teresa Miller, the forensic interviewer who conducted an interview with Stephanie, also testified for the State. During her testimony, a video recording of the interview was played for the jury. As soon as Stephanie and Miller sat down at a table to begin the interview, Stephanie noticed the video camera and asked Miller, \"Is that a camera?\" Miller explained that the interview was being recorded so that Stephanie would not have to tell her story more than once. She assured Stephanie that her mother and father would never see the recording. She asked Stephanie, \"Does that make you feel better?\" Stephanie shook her head yes, but Miller apparently thought she continued to look apprehensive. She asked Stephanie, \"You look a little worried. What are you thinking?\" Stephanie replied, \"I'm thinking that it's just that most people lie to me.\" Miller reassured Stephanie and promised never to lie to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 9 Miller then began the interview by asking Stephanie to tell her about herself and her family. Stephanie told Miller that she was born in Washington, Indiana, and that her family moved around a lot. She told Miller that they recently moved into a trailer in Sumner, Illinois. The other people who lived in the trailer were Colby, Ashley, Jacob, Joseph, and Mom and Dad. Miller asked if any of the people she named were adults. Stephanie explained that Jacob and Joseph were babies and the other individuals were adults. (We note that although Stephanie does not clarify this, we presume that she refers to 15-month-old Joseph Jr. as \"Joseph\" and that \"Colby\" is a nickname for Joseph Sr.) When Miller asked if she knew what names other people called her mom and\n   dad, Stephanie was reluctant to answer. She told Miller that her mom got angry at her if she used their first names. After Miller assured her that her mother would not see the video recording, Stephanie told her that the names of her parents were Tonya and Jimmy. She clarified that Jimmy was her stepfather; her \"real dad\" was Levi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 10 Miller then turned Stephanie's attention to her allegation of abuse. She began by asking Stephanie what she told Jay Reeves the previous day. Stephanie said that she told Reeves that she woke up to Jimmy putting her hand on his \"private\" while her mom was at the hospital with the baby. She told Miller that this happened in the trailer in Sumner. She told her that the defendant was sitting on her bed when he did this. She said that he moved her hand to make her rub his \"private.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 11 Stephanie told Miller that the same thing happened when she lived in Vincennes and Hammond, but she did not describe any specific incidents. She thought that it happened 10 to 20 times. First she said that it happened only once at the trailer in Sumner, but she then said that she thought it happened one other time in Sumner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 12 Miller asked Stephanie if she ever told anyone about these incidents. Stephanie said that the first person she told was Jay Reeves, but she noted that she also told her new foster parents later that evening. Miller asked if she ever told her mother, to which Stephanie replied, \"No.\" When Miller asked why, Stephanie told her that she did not tell her mother because she was afraid her mother would get angry at her. She added, \"She usually gets mad.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 13 At first, Stephanie said that her stepfather did not touch any part of her body other than her hand. She said this even when Miller asked her if he touched her anywhere else. Approximately 20 minutes into the interview, Miller asked Stephanie about what, if anything, the defendant said to her while making her rub his \"private part.\" At this point, Stephanie told Miller, unprompted, that the defendant also put his hand inside her body. In response to questioning, she told Miller that these incidents only occurred when no one else was home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 14 At trial, Miller acknowledged that she asked Stephanie approximately seven times whether the defendant ever touched any other part of her body before Stephanie told her that he put his hand inside her vagina. Miller explained that it was common for children who have been abused to feel comfortable enough to tell some parts of their stories earlier than others. She testified that she believed that Stephanie had more to tell her based on her body language and her facial expressions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 15 Stephanie also testified at trial. She was nine years old at that time. She was first asked about the day she met Jay Reeves. She stated that she remembered him picking her up at school. Asked if she knew why Reeves picked her up, she replied, \"Because the baby got hurt.\" Stephanie testified that at the time the baby was hurt, she lived in a trailer in Sumner with her mother, her stepfather, the baby who was hurt, and Ashley, Colby, and Jacob. She testified that she could not remember the name of the baby. (We note that the baby was Jacob.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 16 Stephanie then testified in detail about the events of that morning. She testified that she was woken up by Jimmy touching her when it was still dark out. Jimmy was holding her hand on his penis and had his hand on her vagina, although she used the terms \"private\" or \"private part.\" She testified that she asked Jimmy\n   where the other adults were, and he told her that they were at the hospital. When she asked why, he told her that the baby was hurt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 17 Stephanie testified that it felt like two or three of the defendant's fingers were touching her and it felt like \"his hand went a little bit in [her] bad spot like that.\" She explained that he was rubbing inside \"the hole where [her] pee comes out.\" She testified that while this was happening, the defendant placed her hand on his \"private part\" and told her to \"wiggle\" it. She described the defendant's penis as feeling \"like bones\" with a \"heartbeat.\" She also stated that it \"felt like it was dripping down water.\" Stephanie testified that she asked the defendant if she could get up, but he told her, \"In just a little bit.\" She testified, however, that he later stopped when she told him she needed to get up to use the bathroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 18 Stephanie testified that the same thing happened other times in other places the family had lived, but she did not know how many times it had happened. She did not remember it happening any other times when they lived in the trailer in Sumner. She testified that it only happened when no one else was home. When asked if the abuse always followed the same pattern, Stephanie said, \"No.\" She noted that it did not always happen when she was in bed. She described an incident that occurred while the family was living in a different trailer in Hammond, Indiana. On that occasion, she went into the bedroom shared by her mother and the defendant when the defendant asked her if she wanted to feed the turtles. After feeding the turtles, she sat on the bed with the defendant, and they watched the turtles. She testified that the defendant then pulled her down on the bed and \"started to do the private thing.\" Stephanie testified that they no longer had turtles when they lived in the trailer in Sumner; their only pet in Sumner was a dog.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 19 Stephanie testified that Jay Reeves was the first person she told about the abuse. She explained that she never told her mother because she was afraid that her mother would be angry at her. She noted that her mother got angry at her often. Stephanie further testified that most of the time she liked her stepfather because he played games with her and was nice to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 20 The State did not call the investigating officer to testify. The parties stipulated that Dr. Rachel Winters performed a sexual abuse examination of Stephanie, and that if called to testify, Dr. Winters would state that she found no physical evidence of abuse. The defendant called three witnesses, all of whom were individuals the family had lived with at some point during their many moves. All three witnesses testified that the defendant had a good relationship with Stephanie and that they never witnessed any incidents of abuse. The defendant testified on his own behalf. He, too, testified that he had a good relationship with Stephanie. He denied that he ever sexually abused his stepdaughter. He testified that on the morning in question, Joseph Sr. stayed home in the trailer while Tonya and Ashley took the baby to the hospital. He further testified that he was rarely alone with Stephanie in any of the places they lived, although he also testified that he was able to stay home and care for her when he was laid off from a job. According to the defendant, the family did not live in a trailer when they lived in Hammond. Instead, they lived in a house with his aunt and her fianc\u00e9. The defendant confirmed, however, that there were turtles in the bedroom he shared with Tonya at the house in Hammond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 21 During deliberations, the jury asked to view the video recording of the\n   forensic interview again. The recording was sent to the jury with no objection. The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and the court subsequently sentenced the defendant to 12 years in prison. The defendant filed a motion to reconsider his sentence and a motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict or a new trial. The court denied both motions. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 22 The defendant's first argument concerns jury instructions. In relevant part, the jury was instructed that \"The information states that the offense charged was committed on or about January 30, 2014. If you find the offense charged was committed, the State is not required to prove that it was committed on the particular date charged.\" Defense counsel did not object to this instruction. She also did not request that the jury be instructed that it must find that the offense was committed within the State of Illinois. On appeal, the defendant argues that these instructions allowed jurors to find the defendant guilty based on the evidence of conduct that occurred in Indiana. He argues that, as such, the court erred in giving these instructions and that counsel was ineffective for failing to either object to the instruction concerning the timing of the offense or request an instruction on geographic jurisdiction. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 23 Jury instructions serve the important purpose of conveying to jurors \" 'the legal rules applicable to the evidence presented at trial.' \"\n   <em>\n    People v.

He argues that the problem was magnified by counsel's failure to object to an instruction telling jurors that they could find the defendant guilty if they found that the charged conduct did not occur on the date specified in the charge. He points out that there was no evidence of abuse occurring in Illinois on any other date.

He correctly notes that if the evidence is not sufficient to prove Illinois jurisdiction beyond a reasonable doubt, the jury instruction issue becomes irrelevant because the proper remedy is outright reversal. See\n   <em>\n    People v. Moreland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1725131\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-app-3d/292/616/#p619\">\n    292 Ill.

He argues that even in cases where the evidence is sufficient to prove jurisdiction beyond a reasonable doubt, the jury must be instructed on the issue if the evidence raises a question about the location of the conduct at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 30 We note that although the\n   <em>\n    Gilliam\n   </em>\n   court did focus most of its discussion on the sufficiency of the evidence, as the defendant points out (see\n   <em>\n    Gilliam\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20IL%20App%20%281st%29%20113104\">\n    2013 IL App (1st) 113104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 35-37, 43,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=377%20Ill.%20Dec.%2098\">\n    377 Ill.Dec. 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1%20N.E.3d%20985\">\n    1 N.E.3d 985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), the court also found that the element of location was not in question (see\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1%20N.E.3d%20985\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39 ). In addition, as the defendant himself acknowledges, the\n   <em>\n    Gilliam\n   </em>\n   court implicitly recognized that if the location of the conduct\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   in question, an instruction on geographic jurisdiction is needed. See\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39 (holding that a court is not required to provide an instruction on geographic jurisdiction\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   the location of the criminal conduct at issue is clear). We therefore do not read\n   <em>\n    Gilliam\n   </em>\n   as holding that an instruction on geographic jurisdiction is\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   required as long as there is sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense was committed at least partly in Illinois. We agree with the defendant that the question is whether, under the facts and circumstances of the case, an instruction on geographic jurisdiction is necessary to avoid the possibility of a conviction based on conduct that did not occur within the state. We turn now to that question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 31 Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Gilliam\n   </em>\n   , the charge was based on a specific incident. It specifically alleged that the defendant digitally penetrated Stephanie's vagina and forced her to touch his penis on or about January 30, 2014. As discussed previously, the evidence of abuse at trial consisted of Stephanie's statement to Jay Reeves, her video-recorded forensic interview with Teresa Miller, and her testimony at trial. In both her statement to Reeves and her interview with Miller, Stephanie gave detailed accounts of the specific incident described in the charge-an incident that occurred in Illinois. She told Reeves about the incident the day it happened, and she told Miller about the incident the following day. There was no reason for jurors to believe that Stephanie was confused about where this incident took place when she described it to Reeves and Miller.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 32 At trial, Stephanie likewise described the incident that occurred in Illinois in detail. Although the trial took place 10 months after the incident, the incident occurred on a day that likely stood out in her memory because it was the day her baby cousin suffered life-threatening injuries. In questioning Stephanie, both defense counsel and the State's attorney specifically called her attention to the day the baby was injured. In addition, as the State points out, Stephanie knew the difference between the places she lived (even though she described the Hammond residence as a trailer, rather than a house)-she testified that in Hammond, the family had pet turtles, while in Sumner, their only pet was a dog. Thus, there was no reason for jurors to find that the incident Stephanie described in her testimony took place anywhere other than Sumner, Illinois.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 33 Although there was some evidence of other conduct, under the circumstances of this case, there was no reason for jurors to have believed that any other conduct was at issue. Stephanie told both Reeves and Miller that similar incidents also took place in Indiana, but she did not discuss any particular incident with either of them. At trial, however, Stephanie did describe an additional incident that took place in Indiana. She gave specific details about the circumstances leading up to the abuse that took place that day, but all she said about the abuse itself was that the defendant \"did the private thing.\" Thus, the evidence at trial was clearly focused on the Illinois incident. It is also worth noting that both attorneys told jurors during their opening statements that the events of January 30, 2014, were the events at issue in the case. In light of this, we believe it was clear to jurors that the events at issue were the events that took place that morning in Sumner, Illinois. An instruction telling them so was not necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 34 We must also consider the potential impact of the instruction telling jurors that the offense was committed \"on or about January 30, 2014,\" but that the State was not required to prove that the offense took place on that date. As we have discussed, the defendant argues that this instruction could have led jurors to believe that they could find the defendant guilty if they believed Stephanie's account of the incident that took place in Hammond, Indiana, even if they did not believe her account of the incident in Sumner, Illinois.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 35 The State, by contrast, argues that the instruction was proper and that the \"on or about\" language actually helped clarify for jurors that the events at issue were those that took place in the trailer in Sumner. As the State points out, the incident took place overnight. Stephanie testified that she did not know what time it was when the defendant woke her up, and the defendant testified that he did not know what time it was when Ashley and Tonya left to take baby Jacob to the hospital. Thus, the State contends, the instruction was necessary and proper because without it, jurors could have found that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense occurred after midnight-on January 30-rather than before midnight-on January 29. See\n   <em>\n    People v. Whitaker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5365015\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-app-3d/263/92/#p100\">\n    263 Ill.

The State further contends that reasonable jurors, applying common sense, could conclude that conduct occurring before midnight on January 29 was included in a charge alleging that a crime was committed \"on or about January 30,\" but that common sense would preclude them from finding that conduct occurring at least several weeks earlier, when the family lived in Indiana, was likewise included. As such, the State contends, the phrase \"on\n   <em>\n    or about\n   </em>\n   \" provided additional clarity for jurors about which conduct was at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 36 We need not decide whether we would accept the State's assertion about the benefit of the \"on or about\" language if the location of the conduct at issue were not otherwise sufficiently clear. For the reasons we have already discussed, we believe the location of the conduct at issue in this case was not in doubt. Thus, we do not believe jurors were misled by the instruction. Moreover, we find that the instructions as a whole did not allow the jury to return a guilty verdict based on conduct that occurred in Indiana. We therefore conclude that counsel provided effective assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 37 The defendant's next argument concerns the court's handling of the\n   <em>\n    Zehr\n   </em>\n   principles during\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   . Illinois Supreme Court Rule 431(b) requires courts to question prospective jurors as to\n   their understanding and acceptance of four principles of law known as the\n   <em>\n    Zehr\n   </em>\n   principles. The four principles are as follows: (1) the defendant is presumed to be innocent of the charge against him; (2) the defendant is not required to offer any evidence on his behalf; (3) the State must prove the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt; and (4) jurors may not draw any negative inferences if the defendant chooses not to testify.\n   <em>\n    People v.

The court asked the first prospective juror if she understood that principle and then asked if she could follow that rule. The court questioned the second prospective juror in the same manner. The court called the next four jurors by name, stating to each of them, \"Same question.\" The court then repeated the proposition that the defendant is presumed to be innocent and asked the next juror if he understood that principle and if he could follow it.

The questioning we have just described gave jurors on the first panel that opportunity because it was clear that the court was asking them to answer the same question it asked the first two jurors-that is, whether they both understood and accepted the first principle.

The court asked the first juror on the panel, \"Do you understand and accept that the defendant is presumed innocent and does not have to offer any evidence in his own behalf, but must be proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt?\" The court then asked if she could follow that rule.

The court did, however, provide separate explanations of two of those principles, followed by questioning. As we have discussed, the court previously addressed the first\n   <em>\n    Zehr\n   </em>\n   principle-the presumption of innocence-on its own. The court also went on to discuss the third\n   <em>\n    Zehr\n   </em>\n   principle alone. Addressing the entire panel, the court asked as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   \"If, at the close of all the evidence and after you have heard the arguments of counsel, you believe that the State has failed to prove [the] defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, would you, under those circumstances, return a verdict of not guilty?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The court called on the first juror by name. After she replied, \"Yes,\" the court repeated the question and called on the remaining jurors by name only. Although the court's question might be construed as asking whether jurors\n   <em>\n    accepted\n   </em>\n   the principle, the court did not ask if jurors\n   <em>\n    understood\n   </em>\n   the principle. See\n   <em>\n    People v. Mueller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20IL%20App%20%285th%29%20130013\">\n    2015 IL App (5th) 130013\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 23,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=394%20Ill.%20Dec.%20868\">\n    394 Ill.Dec. 868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20N.E.3d%20347\">\n    37 N.E.3d 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In addition, because the court never separately addressed the principle that a defendant need not present evidence in his own defense, none of the jurors were questioned as to their understanding and acceptance of that principle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 46 The court then addressed the fourth\n   <em>\n    Zehr\n   </em>\n   principle, explaining to the panel that the defendant was not required to testify and that the jury may not hold it against him if he chose not to do so. The court asked the first juror if she understood that principle and whether she could apply the principle if chosen to serve on the jury. The court called on the remaining jurors by name only. One of the last jurors to be called indicated that he was not sure. The court asked the next juror if he could \"follow that\" and then called on the final juror on the panel by name only. Although most of the jurors on the first panel were given an opportunity to tell the court whether they both understood and accepted this principle, the last two jurors were only asked if they could \"follow\" the principle; they were not asked if they understood it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 47 The court's questioning of the second and third panels followed a similar pattern. There were a few differences worth noting, however. For example, after explaining to the second panel that a defendant is presumed innocent of the charges against him (the first\n   <em>\n    Zehr\n   </em>\n   principle), the court asked the first juror whether he understood and accepted this principle and whether he thought he could abide by it if chosen to serve on the jury. The court then addressed the next several jurors, either by stating \"Same question\" or simply by calling their names. The court asked one of the jurors, \"Do you understand the question?\" The court did not ask the juror whether he accepted the principle, however. The court called on the remaining jurors by name. Those jurors may reasonably have understood that they, too, were being asked only whether they understood\n   that the defendant was presumed innocent and not whether they also accepted this principle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 48 In addressing the second panel, the court once again commingled the first, second, and third principles. The court once again went on to ask the prospective jurors whether they would return a verdict of not guilty if they did not believe the State had proven the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt (the third\n   <em>\n    Zehr\n   </em>\n   principle). This time, the court also asked the first juror if he understood the question. However, the court repeated the original question to the next two jurors without also asking if they understood the question. The court went on to ask the remaining jurors to respond, either by saying \"Same question\" or by calling upon them by name. Thus, only the first panel member was clearly asked whether he understood that the defendant had to be proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 49 In discussing the fourth\n   <em>\n    Zehr\n   </em>\n   principle with the second panel, the court asked the first juror, \"If the defendant, James Choate, does not testify in his own behalf, would you hold that against him?\" The court called on the remaining jurors by name. Thus, the court did not ask any of the jurors whether they understood this principle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 50 The court's first question to the third panel commingled the first and third\n   <em>\n    Zehr\n   </em>\n   principles. The court asked the first juror if he understood and accepted that the defendant is \"presumed innocent unless the charge is proven against him beyond a reasonable doubt\" and then called on the remaining jurors by name. Jurors on this panel were never asked questions focused solely on the understanding and acceptance of the presumption of innocence. The court once again commingled the first, second, and third principles, explaining them to the third panel much the way it explained them to the first two panels. As it did with the first two panels, the court asked the third panel, as a group, if they would return a verdict of not guilty if they found that the State had not proven the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The court asked the first juror if he understood the question or had \"any questions about that\" and then called on the remaining jurors by name. The court asked if jurors on the third panel would hold it against the defendant if he did not testify (the fourth\n   <em>\n    Zehr\n   </em>\n   principle) but did not ask jurors whether they understood the principle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 51 Because not all jurors were clearly asked whether they both understood and accepted each of the\n   <em>\n    Zehr\n   </em>\n   principles, we agree that error occurred. The question, then, is whether we may consider this error under the plain error doctrine.

We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 55 Certain types of out-of-court statements by child witnesses in sexual abuse cases, such as the statements Stephanie made to Reeves and Miller in this case, are admissible at trial precisely because they constitute \"reliable, corroborating evidence.\" See\n   <em>\n    People v.

Stephanie's statement to Reeves was an unprompted spontaneous outcry.

Stephanie used age-appropriate language in describing the defendant's behavior, which is another indicator of reliability. See\n   <em>\n    Garcia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20IL%20App%20%281st%29%20103590\">\n    2012 IL App (1st) 103590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 97, 99,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=367%20Ill.%20Dec.%20297\">\n    367 Ill.Dec. 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=981%20N.E.2d%201025\">\n    981 N.E.2d 1025\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Stephanie's statement to Reeves was completely unprompted; it was Stephanie, not Reeves, who initiated the discussion. Contrary to the defendant's contention, Stephanie's statement to Miller alleging that the defendant put his fingers inside her vagina was also unprompted. Although Miller asked Stephanie earlier in the interview whether the defendant had touched parts of her body other than her hand, Miller never asked about penetration. Moreover, when Stephanie volunteered that information, it was not in response to a question about inappropriate touching; it was in response to a question about what the defendant said to her while he was making her touch his penis. The spontaneity of these statements is another indicator of reliability. See\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 99.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 57 One further indication of the reliability of Stephanie's statements is that she had no motive to lie. See\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 97. The defendant argues that Stephanie had a motive to make up a story about him so that she could be sent to live with her father instead of her mother. That way, she would no longer have to move around so much, something she testified she did not like doing. We do not find it plausible to believe that an eight-year-old child could think through the multiple layers of cause-and-effect necessary to contrive such a plan, however. Moreover, the evidence showed that Stephanie liked having the\n   defendant in her life; she just wanted the incidents of sexual abuse to stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 58 It is also worth noting that both statements were admitted into evidence only after the trial court held a hearing to determine whether they had sufficient indicia of reliability. See 725 ILCS 5/115-10(b)(1) (West 2012). We find that Stephanie's statements constituted strong corroborating evidence for her testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 59 In addition, when asked at trial to describe what the defendant's penis felt like, Stephanie used very child-like language to accurately describe an erection, masturbation, and ejaculations, things she clearly would have had no understanding of. This lent additional credence to her testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 60 This does not end our inquiry, and we emphasize that our holding should not be read to suggest that the evidence may\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   be closely balanced in cases where a child's allegations of abuse are corroborated by out-of-court statements that have been found to be reliable. As noted earlier, we must consider both the quantum and quality of the evidence as a whole in making that determination.

Here, most of the defendant's evidence did not contradict Stephanie's statements. The defendant and his witnesses confirmed that the family moved many times and that Stephanie had a good relationship with the defendant. Although the defense witnesses all stated that they never witnessed abuse, Stephanie stated that the abuse only occurred when no one else was present, something which makes sense in light of the nature of her allegations. The only evidence that directly contradicted Stephanie's account was the defendant's own assertion that he did not molest her.
