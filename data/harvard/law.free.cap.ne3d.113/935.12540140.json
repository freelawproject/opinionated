A neighbor heard the assault and came into the apartment, interrupting the assault. The two women held on to the defendant to prevent him from fleeing down the fire escape and called 911. The defense was that no such assault took place. Defense counsel requested a self-defense instruction, arguing that the women grabbed him without authority, and that he was injured in his struggle to leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The principal defect in the defendant's argument is one of timing. The girl friend testified that she grabbed his leg to prevent him from leaving the apartment after he assaulted her. The Commonwealth's assault and battery case was based entirely on actions the defendant took before the women restrained him. The evidence in this case, viewed most favorably to the defendant, was not sufficient to raise the issue of self-defense because the acts against which he claimed to have defended himself occurred after he was alleged to have initiated the attack.
