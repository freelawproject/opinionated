Finding no error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On January 7, 2016, appellant filed a three-count complaint against appellee, essentially asserting breach of agreement or breach of implied warranty for goods. Appellant's complaint states that he purchased materials from appellee, and that\n   the materials \"were approved by the plans but Menards delivered incorrect materials.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} More specifically, appellant had ordered materials from appellee for the building of a barn. Appellant based his order on building plans he submitted to appellee. However, he changed his plans several times before submitting the final order. He claims appellee delivered the incorrect materials. Appellee claims it delivered the materials as ordered by the plans submitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Appellant attempted to return the items, to no avail. In his complaint, he sought damages, requesting compensation for new materials, new trusses, storage costs, attorney fees, court costs, arbitration fees, and other costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Appellee moved to compel arbitration on January 25, 2016. Appellant responded, stipulating to the arbitration on February 8, 2016. The trial court granted appellee's motion on March 7, 2016, and the judgment entry was journalized March 17, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The matter proceeded to arbitration. A decision from the arbitrator was entered March 3, 2017. Appellant was awarded $0. The trial court confirmed the arbitration findings and award, and appellant appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Transferred in the record was a statement of the evidence, which in relevant part confirms that appellant requested and was granted arbitration, that he was in direct communication with the arbitrator and opposing counsel, that his counsel of choice communicated with the arbitrator, and that he participated in arbitration with his counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Appellant complied with App.R. 9(C) in providing this statement of the evidence, and there was no objection made by appellee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Appellant puts forth the following assignment of error on appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   A TRIAL COURT COMMITS REVERSIBLE ERROR WHEN IT NEGLECTS TO MODIFY AN UNREASONABLE ARBITRATION AWARD.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Under his assigned error, appellant asserts eight separate but interconnected arguments. In essence, appellant argues that the arbitrator engaged in misbehavior and that the $0 award is imperfect as there is no rational support for it. Appellant also argues that his due process rights to confront witnesses and to counsel were violated during arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Appellee contends the arbitrator did not commit reversible error where the $0 award was based on legitimate findings, and that there is no evidence to support that appellant was prejudiced by any of the alleged errors he raises on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Arbitration is governed by R.C.

It was further found that appellant received the correct order, and that he was therefore not entitled to damages for breach of contract or breach of implied warranty. Appellant's requests for new trusses (or a refund), storage costs, attorney fees, court costs, arbitration fees, and all other costs were denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Because the award was explicitly based on appellant receiving the correct order, we find there was a rational nexus between the agreement and the $0 award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 25} We proceed to determine whether appellant has articulated any arguments to support that the award was arbitrary, capricious, or unlawful under R.C. 2711.10 or 2711.11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Appellant first argues that the arbitrator misbehaved by allowing appellee to introduce evidence in closing arguments that reflected \"the contract terms, return terms, arbitration terms...etc.\" Appellant often refers to this evidence as \"receipts,\" and he secondly claims that this evidence was not authenticated and, thus, should not have been considered as per the rules of evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 27} For the following reasons, we reject these arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 28} First, \"[t]he misbehavior of an arbitrator may only serve as the basis for vacating an arbitration award under R.C. 2711.10(C) if it results in prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    Hoffbauer v.

More specifically, attached to the January 7, 2016 complaint are appellant's purchase receipts and \"special order contracts.\" Hence, we are not sure how appellant proved in arbitration that he was entitled to damages for breach without establishing the terms on which the agreement was made. The burden was on him, the claimant, to make the case based on the agreement terms. Therefore we find he could not have been prejudiced absent some other impropriety, of which he makes no mention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Second, we note that \"in arbitration proceedings, 'everything relevant is admitted and given value according to its reliability and significance.' \"\n   <em>\n    Bennett v.

Appellant does not\n   detail fraud or other impropriety. Thus we assume appellee submitted the \"receipts\" and contract terms that would govern this case, and those were in the record attached to appellant's complaint. Our review of these materials reveals they bear appellee's trade name and address and, thus, constitute \"trade inscriptions and the like\" for purposes of Evid.R. 902.

Furthermore, we cannot say the trial court issued an arbitrary, capricious, or unlawful judgment with regard to the contentions raised by appellant in his first two arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Appellant's third and fourth arguments are that the arbitrator misbehaved by being biased and allowing communication and information to be given to appellant directly (instead of to his counsel), and by allowing case law to be submitted during arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Appellant specifically asserts the arbitrator failed to include his trial counsel in the communications, and therefore that his counsel did not receive the proper information and was not prepared for defendant's \"claims\" in arbitration. The record, however, supports and appellant concedes that he received notification and had knowledge of the arbitration. Moreover, the record reveals appellant stipulated to arbitration, was the claimant in the arbitration, prepared for arbitration, was represented by chosen counsel in arbitration, and fully participated in the arbitration. We cannot say appellant was prejudiced in any sense related to notification of the arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Furthermore, assuming the case law submitted during arbitration was not fraudulently altered, and considering appellant does not claim fraud or other impropriety, we find no prejudice resulted from the submission of the case law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Accordingly, we find no merit to appellant's third and fourth arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Appellant next argues the arbitrator had no rational support for the $0 award, and that $0 is an imperfect award because it was ruled against the evidence. Appellant contends the award should be vacated and modified to properly reflect damages caused by appellee's alleged breach of the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 40} We note that we reject appellant's arguments to the extent he is attempting to challenge the manifest weight of the evidence used in reaching the $0 award.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Sparks v.
