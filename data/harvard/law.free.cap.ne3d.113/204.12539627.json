The trial court sentenced Roberson to serve 11 months in prison on the domestic violence count; 9 years in prison on each aggravated burglary count; 9 years in prison on the rape count; and 6 years in prison on the participating in a criminal gang count. The court ordered Roberson to serve his sentences for domestic violence, the two aggravated burglaries, and rape consecutively, and his sentence for participating in a criminal\n   gang concurrently with the other counts, for an aggregate prison sentence of 27 years and 11 months in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Roberson appealed his convictions, and we affirmed his rape, aggravated burglary, and domestic violence convictions, but reversed and vacated his conviction for participating in a criminal gang for insufficient evidence.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The only facts that are relevant to the assignment of error before us now are those relating to the August 27, 2015 incident, which supported two of Roberson's convictions: aggravated burglary and rape. The relevant facts are these:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Roberson met C.G. in August of 2015. He introduced himself as \"Gotti\" and asked for her phone number. The day after they met, Roberson called C.G. and asked to come to her house. She assented and the pair smoked marijuana until C.G. asked Roberson to leave. Later that week Roberson came to C.G.'s home with a friend. The three of them smoked marijuana and then Roberson and his friend left. This was the extent of C.G.'s interactions with Roberson prior to August 27, 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Roberson and C.G. both testified that late in the evening of August 26 or early in the morning of August 27 Roberson went to C.G's home and she voluntarily let him into her home. Beyond that, they presented different versions of the events that occurred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   C.G. testified that Roberson called her around midnight while she was sleeping. He told her that he was at a nearby gas station and asked to come over. She agreed. When Roberson knocked on the door, C.G. opened it and let him in. He immediately asked to use her bathroom, which was upstairs where her children were sleeping. She said he could, but he did not return after several minutes. She went up to check on her children and found Roberson in her bedroom, not the bathroom. He asked C.G. to sleep with him, but she told him they should take their time before making the relationship sexual. Roberson grabbed C.G.'s hand to pull her toward the bed, started kissing her, removed her underwear, and engaged in vaginal intercourse with her. Although C.G. was not interested in sleeping with Roberson, she did not tell him \"no\" when he initiated the sexual\n   activity. She claimed that she was scared to fight him because she did not know him well and did not know what he would do if she refused. C.G. did, however, reply \"no\" when Roberson asked her if she liked what he was doing and she testified that she also said \"no\" two other times during the encounter. She also scratched Roberson on his side or his back during sex.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   C.G. further testified that after Roberson finished he asked to use C.G.'s phone charger, which he retrieved from the first floor. He charged his phone in her bedroom for a brief time and then went back downstairs. C.G. testified that she was scared so she laid in her bed after Roberson went downstairs. C.G. heard voices downstairs, but could not identify how many people she heard or if one of them was Roberson. After the voices stopped, C.G. went downstairs and saw that her front door was open and her TVs, computer, and game system were missing. She later discovered that smaller items from upstairs, including her children's tablets, were also missing. C.G. then texted Roberson, telling him that he had 15 minutes to return her property or she was going to call police. She sent him 14 text messages over the course of approximately 30 minutes. One of the messages said, \"And you rapped [sic] me I told you no over and over again.\" Roberson did not respond to any of the messages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   C.G. testified that she called the police after texting Roberson. Officers responded and took C.G. to the Toledo Hospital to have a rape kit performed. At trial, C.G. read from a certified copy of her hospital records. Although C.G.'s testimony largely matched the information in the hospital records, the records contained some additional details. According to the medical records, C.G. told the SANE who examined her that she had asked Roberson to leave when she found him upstairs. The medical records also described her encounter with Roberson in the bedroom a bit differently. She claimed that Roberson said \"come here,\" grabbed her by both arms, and threw her on the bed. The defense did not object to the admission of the records or to C.G. reading from the records.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Roberson provided a different version of the evening's events. He testified that C.G. contacted him and asked him to come to her house. He walked over from a nearby gas station. When he arrived, the two of them smoked marijuana and engaged in some foreplay. He claimed that he never asked to use the bathroom. He also claimed that C.G. suggested they go upstairs to her bedroom where the two engaged in consensual sex. He testified that C.G. became uncomfortable after they had sex and asked him to leave, which he did. He did not lock the door when he left. He claimed he did not take any of C.G.'s property and it would have been impossible for him to take a television, a computer, and a game system with him because he walked to C.G.'s house.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The SANE who examined C.G. testified at trial. She said that C.G.'s demeanor when she arrived at the hospital was \"very distraught.\" She testified that C.G. did not have any physical injuries, which she said is not uncommon in rape victims. She also testified from the hospital records, which contained her notes of the evening's events as told to her by C.G. According to the SANE, C.G. had met a man named Gotti approximately a year before. He called C.G. in the middle of the night and asked to come over. She agreed. When Gotti came to the house he asked to use the restroom. C.G. followed him upstairs and found\n   him sitting on her bed. Gotti grabbed her by both arms, threw her on the bed, and raped her. C.G. did not want to make any noise because she did not want to wake her children. When Gotti finished, he asked to use her phone charger, which she gave him. When his phone was charged he went downstairs, but C.G. did not know what he did while he was downstairs. C.G. stayed in her room, but could hear noises and voices coming from downstairs. When the noises stopped she went downstairs, locked the door, noticed that some of her property was missing, and called the police.\n   <em>\n    Roberson I\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4-10.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Based on this evidence, a jury convicted Roberson of aggravated burglary and rape, and the trial court ordered Roberson to serve the sentences consecutively.

The issue is therefore whether C.G.'s children were separate \"victims\" of the aggravated burglary simply because they were home at the time, albeit asleep and completely unaware of Roberson's presence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 20} We first note that the indictment does not identify the victims of the aggravated burglary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Here, there was no evidence presented that C.G.'s children suffered any personal \"harm\" as a result of the aggravated burglary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Moreover, the relevant police report identifies C.G. as the only \"victim\" of both the aggravated burglary and rape. We therefore find that the aggravated burglary and rape did not involve separate victims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Next, we address whether the aggravated burglary and rape involved \"separate and identifiable\" harm. If so, the offenses are dissimilar in import and do not merge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 22} The state argues that the victim, C.G., suffered two distinct harms as a result of the aggravated burglary: \"the very personal and physical harm involved in the rape and the property crime involved in the theft of personal belongings.\" The state further argues that it is immaterial that Roberson was not charged with theft because \"uncharged criminal conduct\" can constitute separate harm as recognized in one of our prior cases,\n   <em>\n    State v. Greely\n   </em>\n   , 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-16-1161,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017-Ohio-4469\">\n    2017-Ohio-4469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202709810\">\n    2017 WL 2709810\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 23} In\n   <em>\n    Greely\n   </em>\n   , the defendant trespassed into the victim's home and raped her orally, anally, and vaginally in her bed, and then raped the victim again in the shower as he attempted to remove his DNA from her anal and vaginal areas. Like Roberson, the defendant was convicted of aggravated burglary in violation of R.C. 2911.11(A)(1) and one count of rape in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A). On appeal, we found that the aggravated burglary and rape offenses were not allied offenses of\n   similar import because one rape supported the rape conviction, and the other rapes-although not charged as separate crimes-were separate and identifiable harm that resulted from the aggravated burglary. Or, in other words, in\n   <em>\n    Greely\n   </em>\n   there was separate and identifiable\n   <em>\n    physical\n   </em>\n   harm that supported the aggravating element of the burglary charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 24} In contrast, while the uncharged theft of C.G.'s TVs, computer, and game system was separate and identifiable\n   <em>\n    harm\n   </em>\n   that resulted from the aggravated burglary offense, it was not separate and identifiable\n   <em>\n    physical harm\n   </em>\n   that could support the aggravating element of the burglary charge on its own. Thus, unlike\n   <em>\n    Greely\n   </em>\n   , this case involves a situation \"where one offense [i.e., aggravated burglary] involves multiple harms, and one offense [i.e., rape] constitutes an aggravating element [i.e., physical harm] of the other.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

After the Supreme Court of Ohio fashioned a new three-part test for determining whether convictions are subject to merger under R.C. 2941.25, it remanded the case back to the First District Court of Appeals to consider the import of the defendant's aggravated burglary and rape convictions-that is, whether the offenses resulted in \"separate and identifiable\" harm to each victim. On remand, the First District observed that the aggravated burglary offenses \"involve[d] two distinct harms: the intrusion into the sanctity of the home\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   [sic] the subsequent physical harm (here, the rapes). One harm-the intrusion in the dwelling-is separate and identifiable * * *, but the other harm-the physical harm-is not separate and identifiable.\"\n   <em>\n    Ruff II\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13. The court then stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   If there only needed to be one harm that was separate and identifiable, then rape and aggravated burglary could never merge because aggravated burglary will always involve the \"separate and identifiable\" harm caused by the intrusion into the dwelling. The same would be true of assault or any other crime constituting the aggravating element of physical harm for aggravated burglary. Thus, implicit in its rejection of a categorical rule and remand to this court is the idea that the offenses are of similar import when the harm caused by one crime is the same harm that is the aggravating circumstance of another crime.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Roberson argues that this case is indistinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Ruff II\n   </em>\n   because the harm caused by his rape conviction is the same harm that is the aggravating circumstance of the aggravated burglary conviction and, therefore, the two offenses are of similar import and should have merged. We, however, disagree with\n   <em>\n    Ruff II's\n   </em>\n   recognition of an \"implicit\" rule from the Supreme Court of Ohio that requires merger whenever one crime results in multiple \"separate and identifiable\" harms\n   <em>\n    but\n   </em>\n   one of those harms is the aggravating circumstance of the other crime. Indeed, this rule runs contrary to the Supreme Court of Ohio's explicit pronouncement that the defendant's conduct in each individual case should be the paramount consideration, and merger is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   warranted \"if the harm that results from each offense is separate and identifiable from the harm of the other offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Ruff\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 27} We do, however, recognize that under the Supreme Court of Ohio's decision\n   in\n   <em>\n    Ruff\n   </em>\n   , the mere \"intrusion into the sanctity of the home\" that results from aggravated burglary is not a separate harm that is sufficient to support a finding of dissimilar import on its own-otherwise, aggravated burglary would always be a crime of dissimilar import to another offense, and the Supreme Court of Ohio rejected the notion of such a categorical rule. But here, there was an additional harm that resulted from the aggravated burglary-theft of C.G.'s TVs, computer, and game system-and this harm is separate and identifiable from the physical harm that resulted from the rape. Under\n   <em>\n    Ruff\n   </em>\n   , separate convictions are permissible if \"the\n   <em>\n    harm\n   </em>\n   that results from each offense is separate and identifiable.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at paragraph two of the syllabus. Contrary to the First District's holding in\n   <em>\n    Ruff II\n   </em>\n   , separate convictions do not require separate and identifiable\n   <em>\n    physical\n   </em>\n   harm whenever physical harm is the aggravating element of one crime, nor is there an exception to the general rule, expressly pronounced by the Supreme Court of Ohio in\n   <em>\n    Ruff\n   </em>\n   , that requires merger when separate and identifiable harm exists but\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   of that harm overlaps with the aggravating element of another crime. We therefore find that the two offenses were dissimilar in import because the aggravated burglary resulted in harm to C.G. that was \"separate and identifiable\" from the harm that resulted from the rape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Given that we have answered the first prong of the\n   <em>\n    Ruff\n   </em>\n   test in the affirmative and determined that the aggravated burglary and rape convictions were offenses of dissimilar import, we need not address the remaining two elements of\n   <em>\n    Ruff\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Earley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4239378\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/145/281/\">\n    145 Ohio St.3d 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-4615\">\n    2015-Ohio-4615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20N.E.3d%20266\">\n    49 N.E.3d 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 12 (\"An affirmative answer to\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of the [required questions under\n   <em>\n    Ruff\n   </em>\n   ] will permit separate convictions.\" (Emphasis added.) ). We therefore find that the trial court did not commit plain error by failing to merge the aggravated burglary and rape offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Based on the foregoing, we find that the trial court did not commit plain error by failing to merge the aggravated burglary and rape convictions because they are offenses of dissimilar import.
