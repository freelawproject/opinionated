Desmond, pleaded guilty in the District Court to one count of assault by means of a dangerous weapon, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15B (\n   <em>\n    b\n   </em>\n   ), and one count of assault and battery, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A (\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ). The sentencing judge sentenced the defendant to thirty-five days time served while held awaiting trial in the house of correction for the assault by means of a dangerous weapon charge, and one year of administrative probation on the assault and battery charge. The conditions of probation required the defendant to remain drug and alcohol free. Following a probation violation hearing on March 21, 2016, the sentencing judge found that the defendant violated the conditions of his probation, and sentenced him to one year in the house of correction, suspended for one year. On March 1, 2017, the defendant was found in violation of probation by a different judge (hereinafter, judge) and sentenced to serve one year in jail. The defendant filed a motion to revise and revoke his sentence, which the judge denied after hearing. The defendant now appeals the judge's decision to revoke his probation, arguing that the judge deprived him of his due process rights by relying on alleged misconduct not set forth in the written notice of probation violation, and that he was prejudiced by this lack of written notice.

Although a probation revocation hearing is not a \"new criminal prosecution\" because the Commonwealth has already proven guilt beyond a reasonable doubt for the underlying offense, such a hearing still \"implicates due process rights because a finding of a probation violation may result in a loss of liberty.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pena\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4273325\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/462/183/#p190\">\n    462 Mass. 183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 190 (2012).

Where a judge finds a violation of a probation condition charged in the written notice to the defendant, \"reliable evidence of misconduct not charged as a ground of probation violation, where relevant to the judge's discretionary decision whether to revoke probation or modify conditions, may be considered without offending [due process] principles.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Herrera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1011138\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/52/294/#p295\">\n    52 Mass.

Given the adaptable nature of this process, we analyze a judge's decision to revoke probation on a case-by-case basis, and evaluate whether the defendant \"received 'fair treatment' \" during that process, rather than whether the judge followed a rigid procedure.\n   <em>\n    Morse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"235312\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/50/582/#p594\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 591 n.11, quoting\n   <em>\n    Durling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3886837\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/407/108/#p112\">\n    407 Mass. at 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Here, the defendant had either written or actual notice of the bases for his probation violations. The October 14, 2016, notice of probation violation and hearing specified that the defendant failed (1) \"to comply with a drug testing requirement\" by missing a drug test on October 6, 2016, (2) \"to make a required [fee] payment,\" (3) to report to the probation office for a visit on September 27, 2016, (4) to provide adequate proof of employment and residency, and (5) to remain drug and alcohol free, citing positive drug and alcohol tests on September 21 and September 28, 2016. The defendant stipulated to the two positive drug and alcohol screens, and his counsel stated her understanding that the judge would find a violation as a result of that stipulation. The judge made a finding, both from the bench at the revocation hearing, and in his written probation violation findings and disposition, that the positive screens were bases for the probation violation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The defendant contends that the \"actual bases\" for the judge's probation violation finding were his failure to appear at a previously scheduled October 28, 2016, revocation hearing, and his numerous failures thereafter to report to probation, and argues that he had no written notice that the judge would consider those issues at the violation hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   When the defendant testified at the hearing, however, he admitted he knew he missed the October 28 revocation hearing date, and said he did not attend because he \"had no ride\" to the court house and was \"on bedrest.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant also admitted that he failed to meet with his probation officer in the months following the October 28 hearing. Given that the defendant had the opportunity at the hearing to provide a defense to the missed October 28 revocation hearing and subsequent probation meetings, it was \"fair\" for the judge, having already found a violation of probation (by virtue of the defendant's admission), to consider those issues at the probation revocation hearing.
