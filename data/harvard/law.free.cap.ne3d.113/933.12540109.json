L. c. 265, \u00a7 18C ; carrying a dangerous weapon, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (\n   <em>\n    b\n   </em>\n   ) (second offense); stalking, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43 (\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ) ; witness intimidation, G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B ; annoying communications, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 14A ; and assault and battery, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A (\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ). The defendant appealed the judgments and also filed a motion for release from unlawful restraint pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (a), as appearing in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=435%20Mass.%201501\">\n    435 Mass. 1501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001). The trial judge denied the rule 30 (a) motion and a motion for reconsideration. In 2016, a different panel of this court affirmed the judgments in an unpublished memorandum and order issued pursuant to our rule 1:28. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Fox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=90%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%201108\">\n    90 Mass.

See Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (a), (b). As relevant here, he claimed that (1) his conviction of carrying a dangerous weapon violated his constitutional right to bear arms under the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, and (2) his trial counsel was ineffective. On appeal, the defendant claims error in the trial judge's denial of that motion.
