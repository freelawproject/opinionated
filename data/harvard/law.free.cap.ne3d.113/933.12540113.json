We conclude that the hearsay was substantially reliable, but we agree that the findings of violations based on the defendant committing an ADW and failing to verify his mental health treatment were in error. We shall therefore vacate the judge's order and remand for further proceedings consistent with this memorandum and order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of review\n   </em>\n   . Because the victim of the defendant's attack exercised her privilege against self-incrimination and did not testify at the probation violation hearing, the judge based her findings of new offenses on a transcript of the victim's testimony at an earlier dangerousness hearing pursuant to G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 58A, and other documents. Accordingly, we review the judge's findings without deference. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Tremblay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12536496\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/107/1121/#p654\">\n    480 Mass. 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 654-655 (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <em>\n    Reliability of hearsay\n   </em>\n   . The defendant argues that the \u00a7 58A hearing testimony was unreliable hearsay. When hearsay is the only evidence of a probation violation, it \"must be substantially reliable.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Durling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3886837\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/407/108/#p118\">\n    407 Mass. 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 118 (1990). To evaluate whether the \u00a7 58A testimony was substantially reliable, we turn to the factors listed in\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Patton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4270285\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/458/119/\">\n    458 Mass. 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010).

We agree. The victim testified at the \u00a7 58A hearing and named the defendant as her assailant only four days after her assault.\n   <footnotemark xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Her testimony was corroborated by her prior statements -- also naming the defendant as her assailant -- to hospital personnel, to a police officer at the hospital,\n   <footnotemark xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and in her own G.

We agree with the judge that, based on a preponderance of the evidence, see\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Holmgren\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"861434\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/421/224/#p227\">\n    421 Mass. 224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 227 (1995), the defendant violated his probation by committing an assault and battery. The defendant does not argue that any elements of assault and battery were not met here; he argues only that there is insufficient evidence that he was the perpetrator. Based on the victim's substantially reliable testimony, we conclude otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Mayhem\n   </em>\n   . We also agree that the defendant committed mayhem. The defendant's argument on this point is that there was no evidence that he possessed a \"malicious intent to maim or disfigure,\" as required by the mayhem statute, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 14. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Malicious intent may be shown by \"direct or inferential proof that the assault was intentional, unjustified, and made with the reasonable appreciation ... that a disabling or disfiguring injury would result.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3963205\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/10/190/#p196\">\n    10 Mass. App. Ct. 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 196 (1980). Intent can \"be inferred from the severity and extent of the injuries.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. Hap Lay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1582892\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/63/27/#p36\">\n    63 Mass. App. Ct. 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 36 (2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The evidence shows that the defendant entered into a physical altercation with the victim that resulted in tearing her earlobe. The defendant argues that because the victim's earlobe was already in a weakened state and was thus prone to injury from mere negligence, malice cannot be inferred. But the victim's earlobe was visibly vulnerable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   It was reasonably appreciable that a disfiguring injury would result if the defendant were to strike her ear. The victim testified that the defendant attacked her from behind, hit her in multiple places, and \"ripped\" her ear. From this evidence we can infer that the defandant inflicted the ear injury maliciously rather than negligently and thus committed mayhem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Assault with a dangerous weapon\n   </em>\n   . The defendant asserts that there is no evidence he committed an ADW. We agree. Although the Commonwealth alleged before the \u00a7 58A hearing that the defendant had kicked the victim with a shod foot and there was evidence that the victim was kicked, there was no evidence of a shod foot. Therefore it was error to find that the defendant violated his probation based on having committed an ADW.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Verification of mental health treatment\n   </em>\n   . The defendant argues that his alleged failure to verify his mental health treatment was not a valid basis to find him in violation of probation. Because verification was not a requirement of his probation, we agree. The probation conditions required the defendant to submit to \"evaluation and treatment for mental health issues,\" but they did not require him to submit verification of having done so. Although the Commonwealth is correct that a probation officer may adopt \"a reasonable means of enforcing a term of probation established by the sentencing judge,\" such means do not themselves constitute a \"condition of probation.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bynoe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4228926\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/85/13/\">\n    85 Mass. App. Ct. 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 23 n.12 (2014).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   A \"defendant is in violation of his probation only if he disobeys the conditions of probation imposed by the sentencing judge.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    MacDonald\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"993890,993861\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/435/1005/\">\n    435 Mass. 1005\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1007 (2001). Therefore it was error to find that the defendant violated his probation by failing to verify his mental health treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n   . Because we have upheld some but not all of the violations found by the judge, and because \"not every violation requires revocation,\" the matter must be remanded for the judge to consider the appropriate disposition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Arroyo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3788929,3789260\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/451/1010/\">\n    451 Mass. 1010\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1011 (2008).

However, the victim credibly addressed this inconsistency in her \u00a7 58A testimony, explaining that she and the defendant had agreed on this story so that he would call an ambulance and get her medical attention.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    The defendant asserts that the police officer's testimony at the \u00a7 58A hearing was insufficiently reliable because it merely recounted what the victim had told him.

Here, however, unlike in those cases, the officer's statement was not the primary evidence of probation violations, but instead served mainly to corroborate the victim's own testimony about the violations.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    We note that although the c. 209A complaint lists August 21, 2016, as the date of the incident, the victim in her supporting affidavit wrote July 21, 2016, for the date of the incident and July 22, 2016, for the date she signed the affidavit, rather than August 22, 2016; the Commonwealth explains that the victim made a mistake and the defendant does not argue otherwise.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    In 2015, the victim had told the defendant's probation officer that a past instance of abuse sparked by an argument over an iPad, based on which she obtained a G. L. c. 209A order, \"never happened.\" She also gave some inconsistent accounts regarding when that argument took place and what injuries she sustained.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    The victim told ambulance and hospital personnel that she had not lost consciousness during that assault, but she stated otherwise at the \u00a7 58A hearing. Considered in the context of the evidence as a whole, this does not raise a significant question of reliability as to her testimony identifying the defendant as the attacker. The defendant also makes much of the victim's statement to a defense investigator, shortly before the final probation violation hearing, that she had told police and medical personnel \"what [she thought] they wanted her to say,\" and that she \"might have lied, [she's] not even sure,\" in her c. 209A affidavit describing that attack. The victim's statement stopped well short, however, of withdrawing her repeated statements that the defendant had attacked her.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    Contrary to the defendant's suggestion, the admissibility of substantially reliable hearsay does not depend on whether or when a judge determines that the declarant is unavailable.
