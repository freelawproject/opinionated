Moreover, it does not comport w[ith] requirements of Rule 8 (a) of Dom. Rel. Procedure.\" The plaintiff's failure to provide this court with either proposed complaint is fatal to her appeal. The \"burden is on the appellant to provide [the appellate] court with an appendix sufficient to support its points on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Burda\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3999400\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/28/685/#p688\">\n    28 Mass.

Moreover, although Shine asserts that her due process, Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution rights were violated, she does not articulate a legal basis for her assertion. To the contrary, she acknowledges that her motions for leave to file the complaints were each denied after a hearing and apparently in view of the proposed complaints she has failed to provide to this court. Accordingly, her brief fails to rise to the level of appellate argument. See Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=367%20Mass.%20921\">\n    367 Mass. 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1975).
