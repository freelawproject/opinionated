Baccarin, appeals from an order denying his motion to withdraw guilty pleas. His motion advanced the claim that \"there was an insufficient factual basis to support\" his guilty pleas. We discern no abuse of discretion or error of law in the judge's decision. We therefore affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . In May, 2017, Baccarin pleaded guilty to assault and battery on a family or household member and vandalism. During the plea hearing, the prosecutor summarized the facts that supported the charges. The judge was informed that Baccarin punched his girl friend in the stomach, pushed her, and punched her in the back. The prosecutor also stated that Baccarin broke a door frame at the residence. Baccarin agreed that the facts recited by the prosecutor were true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Approximately six months after pleading guilty, Baccarin filed a motion seeking to withdraw his guilty pleas. He claimed that his guilty pleas were invalid because there was no factual basis that he had committed an assault and battery on a family or household member or that he injured property of another, contrary to the requirements of\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317426\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/467/322/#p325\">\n    467 Mass. 322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 325-326 (2014).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   After a hearing before the same judge who accepted the defendant's guilty pleas, the motion was denied.

A trial judge \"is not required to determine whether the defendant is or is not guilty of the offense charged, but [s]he need determine only whether the evidence which [s]he had heard, plus any information [s]he has obtained in the plea hearing, is sufficient, when considered with reasonable inferences which may be drawn therefrom, to support the charge to which the defendant is offering a plea of guilty.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jenner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3994786\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/24/763/#p773\">\n    24 Mass.

Here, the judge heard that the victim was Baccarin's girl friend.
