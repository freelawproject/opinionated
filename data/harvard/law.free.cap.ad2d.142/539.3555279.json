The issues raised on that portion of the cross appeal from the order are brought up for review and have been considered on the appeal from the judgment (CPLR 5501 [a] [1]).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">The Supreme Court, Nassau County, properly dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 claims predicated upon the theory of fraudulent inducement and awarded judgment in favor of the defendant on his first counterclaim. Assuming, arguendo, that the defendant made the alleged representations concerning potential sales, any purported reliance thereon by the plaintiffs was not reasonably justified under the circumstances of this case <em>(see, New York State Urban Dev. Corp. v Garvey Brownstone Houses, </em>98 AD2d 767). Moreover, the alleged representations constituted mere \"expressions of future expectations rather than statements of existing fact\u201d <em>(Country-Wide Leasing Corp. v Subaru of Am., </em>133 AD2d 735, 736, <em>lv denied </em>70 NY2d 615); hence, they do not provide a sufficient basis for the plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>claims of fraud <em>(see, Channel Master Corp. v Aluminum Ltd. Sales, 4 </em>NY2d 403).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">However, the court erred in denying that branch of the defendant\u2019s cross motion which was for summary judgment on his eighth counterclaim to recover payment in accordance with the terms of the noncompetition clause set forth in the parties\u2019 employment agreement. The record amply demonstrates that the defendant fully complied with the terms of this clause, and the plaintiffs failed to set forth any evidence sufficient to raise a triable issue of fact with respect to this claim. The defendant is therefore entitled to payment pursuant to that clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">We have considered the defendant\u2019s remaining contentions and find them to be without merit. Thompson, J. P., Spatt, Sullivan and Harwood, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
