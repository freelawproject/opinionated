Hence this suit.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-8\">The affidavit of defence was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>\u201c John Brooks, the defendant above named, doth depose and say: That by agreement of Dec. 15, 1891, he purchased from the bondholders of the Mantua Hall &amp; Market Company twenty-five bonds of $1,000 each, secured by mortgage upon property at northeast corner of Thirty-sixth and Haverford streets, for $18,750, paying to said bondholders $500 on account of said purchase. (C\u00f3py annexed, marked \u2018 Exhibit A.\u2019)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-5\">\u201c That subsequently the said bondholders proceeded by sci. fa. on the mortgage to collect said bonds from the premises described in the mortgage, and sold the same at sheriff\u2019s sale in July, 1892, receiving from the sheriff $19,952.85,.being$1,202.85 in excess of the 'whole purchase money, which sum is still retained by them although .the sum is,due and payable to this deponent as the equitable owner of said bonds, said bondholders never having returned to this deponent the $500 paid on account of the purchase money, or legally divested his -interest therein by a public sale of the same after due notice, as is customary and lawful.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-6\">\u201c That said bondholders had no legal right to forfeit this deponent\u2019s $500 paid on account of his purchase as aforesaid, and thus divest all his rights and equitable interest in said twenty-five bonds of $1,000 each in such a summary manner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-7\">\u201c That this deponent therefore claims that his interest has never been divested in said bonds, and all proceedings taken thereon subsequent to the sheriff\u2019s sale of the said premises are without his authority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-8\">\u201c The alleged judgment obtained subsequently by the bondholders against the stockholders, who are really identical as to parties interested, is fraudulent and collusive, and the whole proceeding unauthorized by this deponent who would, as equitable owner of said bonds, be entitled to receive from said bondholders all that they could in this manner obtain in excess of $18,750, being the sum for which he purchased the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-9\">\u201c That said bondholders, never having divested this deponent\u2019s equitable ownership of said bonds, he is informed and believes that he is entitled to all moneys received by said\u2019 bondholders in excess of $18,250, balance of purchase money due to them under his purchase, being said sum of $1,202.35 received by them from the sheriff, and that said judgment obtained by said bondholders for $2,299.68 also belongs to this deponent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>and is to his use in law and equity as owner of said bonds and should be marked to his use as profit on his purchase. That said judgment being the legal property of this deponent, he does not desire to collect the same from the defendants named therein, to wit, the Mantua Hall &amp; Market Company, the stockholders of which and the aforesaid bondholders being identical as to parties in interest. That said Mantua Hall &amp; Market Company were cognizant of this deponent\u2019s ownership of said bonds and failed to aver that fact in the proceedings against them. That this deponent, as owner of said bonds, never intended to make any claim against said Mantua Hall &amp;\u2022 Market Company in violation of his agreement of Feb. 8, 1892, this deponent being satisfied to restrict the lien of said bonds to said real estate at northeast corner of Thirty-sixth and Haverford streets. That he purchased bonds from the bondholders with the intention of canceling the same, said stockholders having, for $150, conveyed their equity in the mortgaged property to this deponent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-5\">\u201c This deponent therefore asks your honorable court not to enter judgment against him in favor of parties who were fully. cognizant that this deponent had purchased the bonds and was the equitable owner of the same at the time when they permitted the collusive judgment to be entered against them for $2,299.68, and which they hastily paid over to the plaintiffs therein, as the parties to the proceedings and beneficially interested were practically the same. This deponent being informed and believes that the owners of the bonds aforesaid and the owners of the stock in the said Market Company are practically the same..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-6\">' \u201c That no actual damages have resulted to the plaintiffs in this ease by any act of the defendant; that he is not indebted to them, but, on the contrary, this deponent has been thus far deprived of any advantage whatever received by the bond- . holders, either from the sheriff or from the- plaintiffs named in this suit, being the sums of $1,202.85 and $2,299.68; all of which this.deponent avers to be just and true and expects to be able to prove at the trial of this cause.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-7\">The contract Exhibit A was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-8\">\u201c This agreement made this 15th day of December, 1891, between George W.

Religious Press Co., 115 Pa. 310.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-5\">The act of 1887 was a considerable step in advance even of this, as will appear by Byrne v.

Until now it is held that every statement in assumpsit, drawn under the act of 1887, must be replied to by affidavit: Barr v.

Under such circumstances the judgment is conclusive upqn him: Borough v. Arthurs, 130 Pa. 501; Same v.

Presbyterian Congregation, 111 Pa. 106; Hiestand v.

Justice McCollum,</author>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">The Mantua Hall and Market Company entered into a contract with John Brooks on the 8th of February, 1892, in which he agreed within ninety days from the date thereof to pay off' and cancel $25,000 of bonds secured by a mortgage on property which the company conveyed to him, \u201cand have said mortgage satisfied of record.\u201d He also agreed therein to in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>demnify the company and the stockholders thereof, against \u201c all claims and demands of the holders of said bonds and mortgage.\u201d He did not pay off and cancel the bonds and have the mortgage satisfied, nor indemnify the company and its stockholders against the claims and demands of the holders of its bonds and mortgage. In consequence of his default, the trustees named in the mortgage brought suit upon it and recovered a judgment against the company on which the property covered by the mortgage was sold. A further consequence of his default was that a holder of $10,000 of the bonds brought suit thereon and.obtained a judgment against the company on which it was compelled to pay $2,299.68. This action was then brought to recover the money so paid, together with the reasonable expenses incurred in defending the suit upon the mortgage and the suit upon the bonds. In the statement of claim, the contract, the breaches of it and the loss resulting therefrom, were clearly and concisely set forth. A11 affidavit of defence was filed which was adjudged insufficient, and judgment was entei\u2019ed for the amount of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The contention of the appellant is twofold. It is (1) that the contract is executory and therefore, in an action for a breach of it, an affidavit of defence is not required, and (2) if an affidavit is deemed necessary he filed a sufficient one. The first contention is not sound. Prior to the act of 1887 in relation to procedure it was held that executory agreements were within the affidavit of defence law: Vulcanite Paving Co. v. City of Philadelphia, 115 Pa. 288, and cases cited therein. In Barr v. McGary et al., 131 Pa. 401, our brother Williams, speaking for this court, said:, \u201cThe act of 1887 was intended to shorten the road to judgment or issue by requiring the plaintiff, in all forms of action ex contractu, to state his cause of action, and the amounts which he believes to be due him, in a clear and concise form, and permitting him to move for judgment, unless the defendant shall, with like clearness and definiteness, state the nature and character of his defence under oath.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The Market Company, in the case at bar, complied with the act of 1887 by filing a clear, precise and specific statement of its claim. It was therefore entitled to judgment for the amount of the claim unless the defendant filed a definite answer to it. Did he file such an answer? We think not. In his affidavit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>of defence there was no denial of any material averment of fact made by the company. As he did not deny, he must be considered as admitting, that the contract, the breaches of it and the consequences of his default were correctly set forth in the statement. On the same principle he must be considered as admitting that the company notified him of the suits brought against it and requested him to defend them, and further, that the expenses it incurred in defending them, on his failure to intervene, were reasonable. These admissions appear to cover the entire ground on which the company based its claim, and to justif3r the judgment entered in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">We are unable to discover anj1- defence to this action, arising from or founded upon the agreement of December 15, 1891. By that agreement George W. Hancock on behalf of certain bondholders undertook to deliver the bonds mentioned therein to the defendant and J. M. Pullinger on their paying to him \u201c 75 per cent of the par value and interest thereon, on or before the 2nd day of January, 1892.\u201d It is not pretended that the defendant or his associate ever paid or tendered to Hancock or any bondholder represented by him 75 per cent of the par value of one of the twentj'-five bonds which the defendant claims were included in the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The allegation that the owners of the bonds and the owners of the stock of the Market Company \u201c are practically the same \u201d and that the judgments against the company were obtained through collusion between them, is too indefinite and vague to require special consideration. It is clearly not a sufficient answer to the compan3r\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The specifications of error are overruled and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
