In June, 1882, they moved to 700 North Twentieth street, where they resided with their children until April 30, 1888. At this last date their children were of age. Plaintiff\u2019s place of business at that time was 1730 Market street, and he had been there from November, 1884. On April 30,1888, plaintiff removed from the house 700 North Twentieth street to 1730 Market street, which was fitted up at that time for a residence. He testified that he was unable to support and maintain his family at 700 North Twentieth street after the death of his father; that his business had declined; his income had become reduced; that his earnings were insufficient to meet his expenses; that, to reduce his ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>penses within proper limits, he desired to give &lt;up the house on North Twentieth street and remove his family to Market street that at that time the building 1730 Market street was suitable for a residence; that the house was new and commodious, and suitably arranged for a dwelling, and had all the appointments necessary for housekeeping; that he in good faith desired to&gt; make this his home for the reason indicated; that his wife refused to accompany him, and persisted in that refusal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-5\">Defendant testified that she had not deserted her husband; that she had not been requested by him to go to 1730 Market-street; that she would have gone there if she had been asked by him to go.- She further testified that he left the house on North Twentieth street without cause; that he never subsequently asked her to come to the house 1730 Market street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-6\">Binding instruction for defendant was refused.

The testimony bearing on the questions of fact, involved in the issue, was sufficient to justify the learned trial judge in submitting the case to the jury. There was therefore-no error in refusing to charge as requested in appellant\u2019s tenth point, that under all the evidence the verdict must be in her favor. Nor do we think that upon the whole case there was any error in entering the decree complained of in the last specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-13\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid by appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
