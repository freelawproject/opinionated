Plaintiff proposed to purchase the lands, and had full knowledge of the extent of defendant\u2019s agency. After the negotiations had been begun, defendant told plaintiff that the owner had authorized him to sell the land, but he showed plaintiff no written authority. The sale was then concluded and plaintiff paid to defendant portions of the purchase money, but at very irregular intervals, and never tendered the balance due. <em>Held, </em>that there was no such fraud on plaintiff as prevented the running of the statute of limitations against his claim.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b252-11\">\n<em>Competency of witness.</em>\n</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b252-12\">' In the above case defendant was an entirely competent witness, as the thing in controversy was a transaction between the parties, both living, and the owner\u2019s representatives were not parties or privies to the action, and would not be affected in any way by the result of it.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b252-13\">Argued May 1, 1894.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"As5\">Appeal, No. 40, Jan.

Henderson, 12 Pa. 49; Pennock v. Freeman, 1 Watts, 410; Hughes v. Bank, 110 Pa. 428; Morgan v.

L. 81; Marr v. Marr, 103 Pa. 463; Van Syckle v. Stewart, 77 Pa. 124; Wallingford v. Dunlap, 14 Pa. 31; Butterfield v. Lathrop, 7 Pa. 225.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-14\">Hawkins was an attorney in fact, for he was an agent for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>transaction of an act specified in a sealed instrument, called a letter or power of attorney: Anderson and Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionaries.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-5\">If, when a man has been put in charge of land by the owner and directed, by parol, to make a sale of it, and has done so by parol, he is to be held guilty of a \u201c constructive fraud \u201d because he had no written authority, then men are daily committing crimes and incurring responsibilities which the courts have so far failed to punish or enforce. On the contrary, the courts have recognized these usual methods of men\u2019s business and the manner of proof necessary to sustain the transactions, in the following cases: Grayson v. Bannon, 8 Watts, 524; McDowell v. Simpson, 3 Watts, 135; Gilpin v. Howell, 5 Pa. 51.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-6\">A constructive fraud can exist only where s\u201eome act has been committed contrary to public policy, where there is a peculiar or confidential relation between the contracting parties, or where a contract is made between two persons for the purpose of, or with the effect'to injure or defraud a third person: Moens v. Hayworth, 10 M. &amp; W. 147; Kerr on Fraud and Mistake, 56; 1 Story\u2019s Eq. Jur. \u00a7 256.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-7\">The statute of limitations begins to run from the commission of the act complained of, where that act only amounts in law to acconstructiv\u00e9 fraud: Zacharias v. Zacharias, 23 Pa. 452; Musselman v. Eshleman, 10 Pa. 394; Hollinshead\u2019s Ap., 103 Pa. 158.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-8\">The objection to the competency of defendant as a witness must necessarily be based upon the ground that the contract with plaintiff is Mackey\u2019s contract. If it is, plaintiff cannot recover. He brings his action upon the ground that it is not Mackey\u2019s contract. If it is not, Mackey\u2019s heirs or legal repre'sentatives have no interest in this suit, direct or remote.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A3B\">July 12, 1894:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b256-9\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"Au4\">Mb. Justice Mitcheel,</author>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">The referee found only a constructive fraud by the defendant, and the action was therefore barred by the statute of limitations which in such cases begins to run from the date of-the act committed. Hollinshead\u2019s Appeal, 103 Pa. 158, 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">But the -learned judge below was entirely right in holding that there was no sufficient evidence of fraud at all. The plaintiff\u2019s whole cause of action hinges, on the narrow question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>of fact whether defendant represented that he had a \u201c power of attorney \u201d or merely an \u201c authority \u201d to sell. If the latter then' there was no fraud, for it is clear that he had verbal authority and that his arrangement with plaintiff was ratified by Mackey. But even if the defendant represented that he had a power, or a warrant of attorney, the weight of the evidence is that plaintiff knew the whole situation and was not in any way deceived. Defendant had a written letter of attorney from Mackey, duly recorded, giving him authority to lease and manag\u00e9 the property, collect the rents, etc., but not 'extending to a power to sell, and plaintiff himself testified that defendant told him \u201c he had no power of attorney to sell \u201d but was going to Philadelphia to see Mackey, and subsequently said \u201che had got it fixed all right.\u201d As well and tersely stated by the learned judge below, \u201c we have the undisputed fact that Davis knew it was Mackey\u2019s land, and also knew that Hawkins\u2019s power of attorney did not authorize him to sell and convey land, and when Hawkins told him Mackey authorized him to sell it, and produced no written authority, the inference is irresistible that Davis knew Hawkins\u2019s authority was by parol.\u201d The whole evidence shows that the transaction was conducted in a loose and informal waju By the contract as set forth in the receipt for the first payment, the rest of the purchase money was to be paid at stipulated times and amounts, the last being three hundred and fifty dollars due July 1,1878. There is no pretence that these terms were complied with by plaintiff. On the contrary his payments were irregular both as to time and as to amount, and the last one was never made in full at all, though nearly twelve years elapsed between the time it was due and the bringing of this suit. In the meantime Mackey had died, and his heirs for a time at least disclaimed any interest in the land. The whole matter was allowed to run on at the loosest possible ends. Whatever may be the rights of Mackey\u2019s heirs or representatives to an account from defendant for tlieSnoney paid him by plaintiff, it is entirely clear that there was no such fraud on the latter as prevented the running of the statute of limitations against his claim, even as to money paid after' Mackey\u2019s death, when defendant\u2019s authority, whatever it was, had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"A3l\">The defendant was an entirely competent witness. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>tiling in controversy was a transaction between the parties, both living. Mackey\u2019s representatives were not parties or privies to the action, and would not be affected in any way by the result of it. \u25a0 \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
