The act of June 8, 1893, P. L. 393, has for its title \u201c An act creating the office of county controller in counties containing 150,000 inhabitants and over, and prescribing his duties.\u201d The commissioners\u2019 clerk of Schuylkill county petitioned the attorney general to suggest a writ of quo warranto to oust the .auditors. The writ was suggested. The auditors filed their answer, and the case was heard on petition and answer.

Justice Mitchell,</author>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">The act of June 8, 1893, P. L. 393, while it does not in express terms abolish the office of county auditors in counties having more than one hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants, does so in effect by transferring their duties and powers to a county controller. This is the manifest intent of the act, as gathered from all its provisions, and as especially indicated in section one which directs the election of a controller \u201cin place of-county auditor,\u201d and section fifteen which expressly directs how the duties theretofore devolved on the county auditors shall thereafter be performed. Such moreover, even without an express legislative intent, would be the result of the act. The powers, authority and jurisdiction of an office are the essence of the office itself, and are inseparable from it. To take them away totally is to destroy the office: Com. v. Gamble, 62 Pa. 343; Reid v. Smoulter, 128 Pa. 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">The title of the act under consideration is, \u201cAn act creating the office of county controller in counties of this commonwealth containing one hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants and over, prescribing his duties.\u201d In this there is no indication of the purpose and effect of the act-to abolish the office of county auditors. So far as appears in the title, the act is merely cumulative, in providing an additional county officer. It is true that the constitution in enumerating county officers, art. 14, sect. 1, puts the two offices together in the disjunctive, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>\u201c auditors or controllers,\u201d and that those who are familiar with the duties of controllers as existing in Philadelphia and Allegheny, would know that they are mainly the same as those of auditors in other counties, and therefqre that the creation of the office of controller was likely to interfere with, if not to abolish, the other. But this is not the notice which the constitution requires the title of the act to give of its subject. The object of that requirement is that legislators, and others interested, shall receive direct notice in immediate connection with the act itself, of its subject, so that they may know or be put upon inquiry as to its provisions and their effect. Suggestions or inferences which may be drawn from knowledge dehors the language used, are not enough. The constitution requires that the notice shall be contained in the title itself: Ph\u0153nixville Road, 109 Pa. 44; Ridge Av. R. W. Co. v. Phila., 124 Pa. 219; Phila. v. Ridge Av. R. W. Co., 142 Pa. 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">As this defect in the title is decisive of the unconstitutionality of the entire act, it is not necessary to discuss the other objections raised to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">\u25a0Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
