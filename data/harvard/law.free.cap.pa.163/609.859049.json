Campbell, being the owner in fee simple of premises No. 1039 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, made and executed the letters of attorney of Dec. 26,1888, and June 10, 1889, as set out in the pleadings. The said William B. Robins claiming to act as attorney in fact of Mary W. Campbell, thereupon made and executed in her name bonds and mortgages of her said premises No. 1039 Walnut street, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b637-9\">\u201c 1. June 20,1889. Bond and mortgage to the Western Saving Fund for $6,000; reciting both letters of attorney; satisfied of record December 31, 1890. (This bond and mortgage were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>produced, and upon inspection the recital of the second letter of attorney appeared to have been inserted in both bond and mortgage, but was not noted as having been so inserted before execution.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b638-4\">\u201c 2. May 9, 1890. Bond and mortgage to the Western Saving Fund for $500 ; reciting the power as one of June 20, 1889, recorded in letter of attorney book No. 71, page 144 (the date of the second letter of attorney, but the record of the first letter of attorney of Dec. 26,1888) ; satisfied of record Dec. 31,1890.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b638-5\">\u201c 3. Dec. 23,1890. Bond and mortgage to defendant (being the subject of this suit), reciting the first letter of attorney.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b638-6\">\u201c4. July 25, 1891. Bond and mortgage to the No. 2 Assistance Building and Loan Association for $1,500. (This is still subsisting and is the subject of a similar proceeding before the master.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b638-7\">\u201c The. plaintiff, Mary W. Campbell, had no knowledge of the making of any mortgages in her name by William B. Robins, until she received the information from her counsel, Thomas Hart, Jr., Esq., in a letter from him dated June 20, 1892.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b638-8\">\u201c No part of the moneys obtained by Robins upon said bond and mortgage for $7,500 reached the hands of plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b638-9\">\u201c Of the $7,500, the amount of said mortgage, the sum of $6,000 was appropriated to the payment of 'the aforesaid mortgage of the Western Saving Fund (which is admitted to have been a valid incumbrance on said premises) ; $253.07 to the paj^ment of interest thereon and satisfaction fee; $500 to the payment of the other aforesaid mortgage of the Western Saving Fund; seventeen dollars and six cents to the payment of interest thereon and satisfaction fee; $230.88 to the payment of taxes for 1890 on said <em>premises; </em>three dollars and fifty cents to recording, and the balance, $494.99, was paid to William B. Robins, attorney, who appropriated the same to his own use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b638-10\">\u201cOPINION.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b638-11\">\u201c The following questions arise in this case: (1) Whether under the letter of attorney of Dec. 26, 1888, there was any power to mortgage. (2) Whether the giving of the special letter of attorney of June 10, 1889, revoked the former power, not only as to the property therein named, No. 1039 Spruce [sic] street, but also as to all the other properties. (3) Whethei <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>both the said letters of attorney were not exhausted by the making, with the knowledge of the present mortgagees, of the former mortgages of the several properties. (4) The applicability of the doctrine of subrogation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b639-3\">\u201c Upon the first and main point, we are confronted at\u2019the outset with a line of cases in Pennsylvania in which the general proposition that a \u2018 power to sell includes a power to mortgage \u2019 is affirmed and reaffirmed in the most positive terms. These cases are: Lancaster v. Dolan, 1 Rawle, 231;; \u00a1Gordon v. Preston, 1 Watts, 385; Duval\u2019s Ap., 38 Pa. 112; Penna. Co. for Ins. on Lives etc. v. Austin, 42 Pa. 257; Zane v. Kennedy, 73 Pa.182; Watts\u2019s Appeal, 78 Pa. 370 ; Maurer\u2019s Appeal, 86 Pa. 380; Wurfflein v. Haines, 14 W. N. 76, and 15 W. N. 28; Mc-Creaiy v. Bomberger, 151 Pa. 323.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b639-4\">After reviewing these cases the master continued:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b639-5\">\u201c The foregoing are all the cases in Pennsylvania on the subject ; a careful examination of them reveals- the fact that it is only under the existence of certain circumstances that the assertion \u2018 A power, to sell includes a power to mortgage \u2019 becomes a \u2018 rule of property \u2019 in Pennsylvania. Two of them are cases of corporations ; the Others are all cases of trusts, some testamentary, others created by deed; they are cases of ancillary powers, powers for the purpose of carrying out or aiding in the object for which the trust was established. The present case, on the other hand, is that of an agent, of course with no trust, with no right to hold this property or do anything with the purchase money in case of a sale, but to hand it over to his constituent. Can it be said that he has an implied power to mortgage because of the authority of cases based upon a trust, based upon a discretion in the donee of the power as to the means of raising money, when the object and purpose of the trust was to raise money, and who was also to be the hand which would devote the money subsequently to the purposes of the trust, either to pay debts or legacies or something of that nature.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b639-6\">\u201c While the cases in Pennsylvania, as will be shown, have gone further than any others upon the subject of an implied power to mortgage, they have not gone so far as to say that an agent authorized by letter of attorney to sell real estate has power to mortgage it, and it is submitted that their authority should not be extended by implication to cover such a proposition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b640-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>\u201cThe case of Mills v. Banks, 3 P. Wms. 9, decided in 1724, has been cited as authority for the general principle that a power to sell includes a power to mortgage. Lord Chancellor Mao glebield said in his opinion, \u2018 a power to sell implies a power to-, mortgage, which is a conditional sale,\u2019 (i. e., because it is a conditional sale ?) but gave no attendant authority for the'statement nor is any to be found. This case has been distinctly departed from in a line of cases, viz.: Ball v. Harris, 4 Myl. &amp; C. 264; Haldenby v. Spofforth, 1 Beav. 390; Stroughill v. Anstey, 1 De-G. M. &amp; G. 635; Page v. Cooper, 16 Beav. 396; DeVayne v. Robinson, 24 Beav. 86; Dimmoek\u2019s Case, 52 L. T., N. S. 494, covering a period from 1838 to 1885, which have settled the- law on the subject in England to be that, when the donee of a power to sell has imposed upon him other rights and duties, the performance of which involves the propriety or necessity of borrowing money, as in case of a trustee to create charges or raise portions, etc., equity will, in- aid of such other purposes, construe a power to sell as a power to mortgage, when exercised in support of the trust.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b640-4\">After citing Ferry v. Laible, 31 N. J. Eq. 56.6 ; Loebenthaler v. Raleigh, 36 N. J. Eq.. 169; Hoyt v. Jaques, 129 Mass. 286, and Kent v. Morrison, 153 Mass. 137, the master continues: \u201c I have referred-to the English cases and those of New Jersey and Massachusetts, not for the purpose of showing that the law of Lancaster v. Dolan should not be followed in kindred cases, but merely to show that that doctrine should not be extended to include a case like the present one, a case that has not yet arisen in Pennsylvania, because the original' authority cited for the decision in Lancaster v. Dolan [Mills v: Banks, supra] has since been departed from, and its doctrine limited and applied to a certain class of cases only.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b640-6\">\u201c The text-writers are unanimous in their statements of the law upon this point.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b640-7\">After quoting paragraphs from' the following text-writers : Hill on Trust, *475; 1 Sugden on Vendors, 591; Sugden on Powers, 425 ; lb., ch. 8, \u00a7 3, pi. 4; Chance on Powers, \u00a7 2563; 4 Kent, Com. *147, 331; 2 Washb.

Juris. 369; 1 Lewin on Trusts, *426, the master proceeds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>\u201c The law governing the construction of letters of attorney is properly a branch of the law of principal and agent, and the doctrine of Pennsylvania law upon the subject of the powers of agents is altogether opposed to' the proposition that a power to an agent to sell and convey real estate empowers the agent to mortgage the same. There is no analogy between the cases of powers under wills and deeds, and under letters of attorney. Letters of attorney should receive a strict interpretation, and the authority should not be extended by intendment beyond what is given in terms or is absolutely necessary for carrying the authority into effect, \u2022 and the authority must be strictly pursued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-3\">\u201c Rogers, J., in Devinney v. Reynolds, 1 W. &amp; S. 328, says: \u2018 An agent constituted for a particular purpose and under a limited power cannot bind his principal if he exceeds his power. A special power must be strictly pursued, and whoever deals with an agent constituted for a special purpose deals at his peril when the agent passes the precise limits of his power.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-4\">\u201c Directly in this line are the following Pennsylvania cases: Peck v. Harriott, 6 S. &amp; R. 145; Strohecker v. Farmers\u2019 Bank, 6 Watts, 96; Same v. Same, 8 Watts, 188; Heffernan v. Addams, 7 Watts, 116; Baring v. Peirce, 5 W. &amp; S. 548.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-5\">\u201c The distinction between powers under wills and deeds and under letters of attorney is recognized by Sugden, Powers, .chapter 6, 255.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-6\">\u201cThe power to mortgage can only be placed in the letter of attorney of December 26, 1888, by construction ; it is not there in terms; nor is it at all a necessary implication (Peck v. Harriott, supra) ; no one will say that the power to raise money on mortgage of a property is necessary in order to sell it. The application of the principles of law governing the interpretation of powers between a constituent and an agent strongly disfavors the contention of the defendant in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-7\">\u201c Although no case has arisen in Pennsylvania upon the question whether an attorney in fact with power to sell real estate may mortgage it, that precise point has been decided in other states, in each instance against the right to mortgage: [quoting Wood v. Goodridge, 6 Gush. 117; Morris v. Watson, 15 Minn. 212; Jeffrey v. Hursh, 49 Mich. 31, affirmed in Hursh v. Jeffrey, 58 Mich. 246; Hubbard v.

Cas. 561.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-4\">\u201c The text-books agree in the statement of law that a power to sell given to an agent does not confer upon him the power to mortgage or pledge: Mechem on Agency, \u00a7 323; Story on Agency, \u00a7 68; 1 Fisher\u2019s Law of Mortgages, page 260; 1 Jones on Mortgages, \u00a7 129; Wharton on Agency, \u00a7 193; Fitch, Law of Real Est. Agency, page 140.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-5\">\u201cThere is another distinction between this case and the Pennsylvania cases already referred to. In each of them the money raised or received by the trustee was properly received; he who made the mortgage had a right to give a bond accompanying the mortgage for the money given him. But how can it be said that there was any authority given to William B. Robins to borrow money for the plaintiff or to give any obligation binding her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-6\">\u201c A mortgage in Pennsylvania, while in form a conveyance, is nothing more \u00f1or less than a security for money loaned or for the performance of some other obligation: Presbyterian Corporation v. Wallace, 3 Rawle, 109.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-7\">\u201c If the bond which the mortgage secured is bad, if there is \u25a0no debt,-no legal obligation to be secured, how can the mortgage securing a worthless bond be good? And here it will be seen how little analogy there is between cases quoted supra and the present one. In the former the donee of the power was empowered to raise money and, of course, to give his obligation as a fiduciary. It was because he was empowered to sell in order to raise money to pay debts, legacies, or charges, that it was held he might raise the money by-way of mortgage. The power was to sell to raise money. The implicit power to mortgage was only the means of raising the money.

The question here is not the construction of a power given to a donee, devisee or grantee, or to a trustee fdr appointment, or for the purpose of defining the limitations of an estate, or regulating its future control or management. .It is, on the contrary, a question which relates simply to the construction of a written authority given by the owner of the property to a naked agent appointed for a specific purpose, with no interest in the subject of the power and no authority beyond it either expressed or implied. A, being desirous of changing an investment, employs B to sell his house. Would not any one in the place of A be justly astonished if he was informed the next day that B had not sold his house but mortgaged it; that he had not found a purchaser, but had placed an incumbrance upon the property, and that the owner was not to get the price of the property which he had directed to be sold, but would thereupon be bound by a solemn obligation to pay the interest upon a loan, which he had never authorized, and did not want, but which had been securely fastened upon his property, and that he was to be bound for its payment by a bond which he had never given any authority to any one to.sign or seal for him. This is the whole case so far as it relates to the construction of the letter of authority given by the plaintiff to William B. Robins, December 26,1888. That a naked agent who is authorized by a letter of attorney to sell for his constituent has no authority to mortgage, is plain alike upon principles of reason, and by all the authorities upon the subject. They have been diligently collected and clearly stated by the learned master in his very able and lucid printed report in this case. So that it is quite unnecessary for me to recapitulate them here. The text-writers are unanimous on the same points.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-3\">\u201c Indeed, no other rule could be tolerated without introducing the greatest confusion and injustice into business affairs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>It is entirely unnecessary, therefore, for me to go through the long lines of Pennsylvania cases, commencing with Lancaster v. Dolan, in 1 Rawle, and ending with McCreary v. Bomberger, in 151 Pa. State Reports. The master has analyzed and dissected each one of them with great skill and perspicuity in his report, for the purpose of showing the fundamental difference between those cases and the present case; but it was, in my opinion, an unnecessary labor, for these cases have no application to the case in hand. They relate to a totally different subject, viz., the construction of powers given to devisees, or trustees for devisees, to enable them to raise a fund for the accomplishment of a specific purpose contemplated by the donor of the power\u2014a purpose as readily effected by a mortgage as by a sale. They are not at all applicable to the case of a mere' agent employed by the owner for the sole purpose of making a sale, with no other purpose in view and no authority whatever beyond that specific purpose. The concise phrase, which has grown into a convenient legal apothegm, \u2018 a power to sell is a power to mortgage \u2019\u2014is applicable only to the doctrine of power as applied to cases of the kind which I have already mentioned, and even there has its exceptions and limitations, but it has no legitimate or proper application to the construction of a letter of attorney given to a mere agent employed for no other purpose than to sell a house for the owner, and not authorized, either by the words or intendment of the instrument, to do anything else. It might, with as much justice and propriety, be applied to a letter of attorney authorizing an agent to sell stocks, and for the purpose of justifying him in pledging the stocks, contrary to his orders, instead of selling them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-4\">\u201cWe are, therefore, of opinion that under the letter of attorney of December 26, 1888, from Mrs. Campbell to William B. Robins, he had no authority whatever to mortgage the Walnut street house. That Robius knew that he had no such authority is evident from the fact that when, subsequently to the execution of the letter of attorney, he conceived the idea of obtaining a loan by mortgage upon the property from the Western Saving Fund he procured from Mrs. Campbell another power of attorney (June 10,1889), which specifically authorized him to make and deliver a bond and mortgage to the Western Saving Fund for $6,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b649-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>\u201cIf the defendants in the present case had been equally careful with the Western Saving Fund in demanding of the agent before making the loan the production of an explicit power of attorney from Mrs. Campbell, authorizing it, there would have been no occasion for the present suit, and the defendants would have suffered no loss. They were very car\u00e9less in lending Robins the money without sufficient proof of his authority from Mrs. Campbell to borrow it. As it was, the defendants acquired no title to the property, and no rights against the plaintiff by the bond and mortgage executed by Robins to them December 23d, 1890, any more than if they had been forgeries, from which, indeed, they are not far removed, for it is clear that Robins had no right to execute them in her name.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b649-3\">\u201c Upon the second point argued, viz., the claim of the defendants to be subrogated to the former rights of lien claimants whose debts had been paid and satisfied out of the fund fraudulently raised by Robins, we are unable to see, after much consideration given to the subject and a careful examination of the authorities, that the claim has any legal foundations upon which to rest. The Real Estate Title Company who insured the defendant\u2019s title, and by whom the settlement was made, were, as the master reports, the agents of the defendants in paying off the preceding mortgage and taxes. They were virtually payments made by the defendants, who were mere volunteers paying off incumbrances upon a property to which they thought they had a good title as mortgagees, but to which they had none. There was no privity whatever between them and Mrs. Campbell, who did not receive a. cent of the money they loaned to Robins, and who was entirely ignorant of the whole transaction, the loan having been fraudulently concocted by Robins, who appropriated the net proceeds to his own use. The defendants occupy towards the plaintiff the attitude of a stranger interfering without her knowledge or consent with her property for what they supposed to be for their own best interests. In making these payments they were mere volunteers, for there was neither privity of estate,- privity of contract, nor privity of any kind between them and the plaintiff, and the law is well set-.tied that the principles of subrogation in equity do not apply in favor of volunteers. Voluntary payment of a mortgage-debt by one who sustains no legal relation to the property or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>the owner cannot operate to subrogate him to the rights of the former holder of a satisfied mortgage. It has been decided that even one who loans money to another to pay the mortgage has no claim to subrogation to the right of the mortgagee. A good illustration of the principle is the familiar case of a surety who pays the debt of his principal. and becomes thereby entitled to the securities of the creditor; a stranger, or one standing in no legal relation to the debtor, would have no such right. I have not been able to find any authority which would justify the claim of the defendants to be subrogated to the former rights of the owners of the satisfied mortgage and liens in this case. Maurer\u2019s Appeal, 86 Pa. 380, much relied on by the defendants, was a totally different case from the present. There the married woman herself received the money and herself applied it to the payment of the preceding mortgages. In the present case the plaintiff had nothing to do with the payment and no knowledge of it whatever. The present case is the case of a volunteer loaning money on a worthless security given by a third party in the perpetration of a fraud which he had planned for his own benefit, and-then, without the knowledge of the owner, paying off an incumbrance to increase its own security. It is unnecessary to go through the cases upon this subject.

It was held \"that the greater power included the less, and that a power to make a conveyance in fee simple included every conveyance in fee simple as well with, as without, a condition of defeasance.

The cases, however, do not sustain this distinction. In the last one we have cited there was no estate in the executrix. Nothing more than a power was conferred upon her.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-4\">It was also said that our cases have been decided in the past in adherence to the Lancaster v. Dolan rule, because the power was given for the purpose of raising money. We can see no warrant for this assertion. In McCreary v. Bomberger, and in Wurfflein\u2019s Appeal, the power was not conferred for the purppse of raising money, but for the purpose of making a change of investment. It can hardly be supposed that a power there given, as in this case, for the purpose of changing investments, was supposed by the' testatrix to confer a power to create an indebtedness and to secure the same by an incumbrance. This court, however, disregarded all considerations of the reason which moved the testatrix to confer the power, and interpreted the words by the light of its past decisions. It deemed it more important to sustain a rule of property than to make effectual a possible special intent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-5\">Where money is paid by mistake, not officiously nor by way of mere intermeddling, in liquidation of the debt of another, by one who takes as security therefor a mortgage believed to be executed on behalf of such other, a chancellor, when asked to order cancellation of the latter, will grant relief only on condition of subrogating the person thus paying such debt to the position of the original creditor: Peters v.

Justice Gbeen,</author>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">After a laborious study of this case, and a most serious con.sideration of the elaborate and exhaustive arguments of the learned counsel on both .sides, we are constrained to say that we think the case was correctly decided in the court below. On the question whether the letter of attorney from the plaintiff to her attorney in fact, Robins, dated Dec. 26, 1888, is to be construed as conferring a power to mortgage the premises in question, we are quite clear as to the correctness of the decision made both by the master and the court below. It is true <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>the precise question does not seem to have been before us heretofore, but we are convinced that the considerations which prevailed in Lancaster v. Dolan and its train of cases, resulting in the declaration- that a power to sell land includes a power to mortgage, are entirely inapplicable in the interpretation of a mere letter of attorney with a naked authority to sell, uncoup- \u2022 led with any interest in the land or the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-3\">The instrument now in question was essentially of this latter class. So far as this matter is concerned it is in the following words: \u201c Do make, constitute and appoint William B. Robins of said city, attorney at law, my true and lawful attorney, for me and in my name, to grant, bargain and sell in fee simple all real estate owned by me, including all ground rents, on such terms and for such prices as he may see fit, and to make, execute and deliver all necessary deeds and assurances to the purchasers and to assign all policies of insurance on said properties or with said ground rents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">It cannot be questioned that this is but an ordinary letter of attorney to sell real estate in fee simple. It is nothing but a naked authority to sell and make deeds to the purchasers, without any interest, whatever in the proceeds, without any power to invest the same or to exercise any kind of control over them. There was no power to raise money for any trust, or to pay debts or charges, or to provide a fund for any charitable or other purpose or for the support of any third person. In short there was no power of any kind whatever, to do more than simply to sell'the property and to make deeds to the purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Under this narrow, specially defined and closely limited authority, the agent executed a .bond in the name of his principal for the payment of $7;500, and, to secure the payment of the bond, he executed a mortgage of her real estate, also in her name, and thereby made her a debtor in a large sum, when his only authority to act for her was to sell her real estate and bring her the proceeds. Instead of being the seller of real estate in the enjoyment of the fruits of the sale, she was converted into a debtor with all the duties and obligations which that relation implies. We do not know of any doctrine in the law of principal and agent which will permit such a result to be accomplished in such a mode. The books abound with endless decisions which are in utter' hostility with such a transaction as a valid act.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>Being a debtor, the plaintiff would be subject to an obligation to pay, not only the principal sum of $7,500, but also annual sums of interest. For failure in her payments she would become personally liable for the moneys due, and be subject to a general judgment which would be a lien upon all her real estate, and\u00aeupon which process of execution might issue and be levied upon her personal property. In point of fact, a warrant of attorney for the entering of judgment against her for the debt, was contained in the bond executed in her name by her attorney, under an authority which gave him only a bare light to sell her lands. It is not credible that the citizen can be held subject to such consequences, so entirely inconsistent, unexpected and hostile to his express intent, in an instrument of such a character. Whatever else may be said of such a paper, it must be conceded that, in its terms, and in its legal substance, it is a plain, simple letter of attorney establishing the relation of principal and agent between the parties to it. It must therefore be regarded as subject to the rules and requirements of that branch of the law in any event, and if these will not permit it to be used for an ulterior purpose such as is claimed in the present case, then it cannot be so used.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Regarded simply as a letter of attorney establishing an agency, the law concerning it is very clear. Thus in Devinney v. Reynolds; 1 W. &amp; S. 328, Mr. Justice Rogers, delivering the opinion, said: \u201c An agent constituted for a particular purpose and under a limited power cannot bind his principal if he exceeds his power. A special power must be strictly pursued, and whoever deals with an agent constituted for a special purpose deals at his peril_when the agent passes the precise limits of his power.\u201d This was said of a deed made by an attorney in fact who was authorized to convey a tract of land after he had redeemed it, and he conveyed it without redemption, and it was held the purchaser took no title.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">In Story on Agency (ed. 1882), sec. 68, the author says: \u201c Indeed formal instruments of this sort (letters of attorney) are ordinarily subjected to a strict interpretation, and the authority is never extended beyond that which is given in terms or which is necessary and proper for carrying the authority so given into full effect. Thus a power of attorney to sell, assign and transfer stock will not include a power to pledge it for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>agent\u2019s own debt.\u201d 1 Jones on Mortgages, sed 129. A mortgage executed under a power of attorney, authorizing an attorney to sell and convey only is void. Said Mr. Justice Cooley in Jeffrey v. Hursh, 49 Mich. 31: \u201c J. M. Hursh had power to sell-the land but not to mortgage it. The power is not to be extended by construction. The principal determines for himself what authority he will confer upon his agent, and there can be no implication from his authorizing a sale of his lands that he intends that his agent may at discretion charge him with the responsibilities and duties of a mortgage: Wood v. Goodridge, 6 Cush. 117; Albany Fire Ins. Co. v. Bay, 4 N. Y. 9; Ferry v. Laible, 31 N. J. Eq. 566; Kinney v, Matthews, 69 Mo. 520; Patepsco &amp; Co. v. Morrison, 2 Woods, 395; Devaynes v. Robinson, 24 Beav. 86.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-3\">Deputron v. Young, 134 U. S. 241. In the case of a naked power, not coupled with an interest, every prerequisite to the exercise of that power should precede it. A. power to make and execute deeds to convey real estate, as the same may be sold to purchasers in tracts by a third party, is a naked power to convey as sales may be made, and a deed made otherwise is a fraud upon the power.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">Morris v. Watson, 15 Minn. 212. As a general rule a power to sell and convey real estate, does not confer a power to mortgage, and a mortgage executed under a power of attorney to-sell and convey is void. The court said: \u201c The power of attorney in this case by Mary C. Hargin to Charles S. Hargin is a power to sell and convey only; therefore the mortgage executed-by Charles S. Hargin to Moses Sherburn under this power of attorney is void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">In the case of Wood v. Goodridge, 6 Cush. 117, a power of attorney authorized the attorney, in the name and for' the benefit of the principal, to buy and sell reai and personal property and to execute and deliver deeds, to transfer the same, to- move and institute all necessary suits for the recovery and collection of his demands. . . . Especially to carry on his saw-mill and buy and sell logs and lumber .... and in general to make such contracts for the profitable improvement and use of such property and other means as he possessed for the enlargement of his estate. The attorney made a mortgage and note for a sum of money, and the question of his power to make them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>arose and' was'decided. The court said: \u201cLevi Goodridge, who made the mortgage and note, had no authority under his power of attorney from Benjamin Goodridge to do these acts, so that the mortgage and note are both invalid and without any legal effect. In accordance with the general and well-settled principles of law, the power of attorney to Levi must be so interpreted as not to extend the authority given to him beyond that which is given in terms, or which is necessary and proper for carrying the authority expressly given into full effect. Now the power of attorney in this case very clearly did not in terms give to Levi authority to mortgage the real estate of his principal; still less does it, in terms, give him the power to borrow money and to bind his principal by a promissory note. ... In the absence of all evidence that the money was in fact obtained for the principal or that it was \u2022 necessary for the execution of the authority given, there being no express authority to make a mortgage or negotiable note, there is an entire failure to show that Levi had any authority to make the note and mortgage, and the title of the plaintiff, being derived under that mortgage, wholly fails.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">It is not necessary to quote further authorities for a proposition so plain in its character and not opposed by any contrary decisions. As we have already said, the cases of Lancaster v. \u2022Dolan and those that follow it, are not pertinent to the discussion because they depend upon different principles and upon facts which have no existence here. We are therefore brought to the consideration of the remaining question whether the appellant is entitled to subrogation to the 16,000 prior mortgage which was.paid off with the proceeds of the mortgage in suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Upon that subject it is to be observed that the payment of the prior mortgage was the act of a mere volunteer. The plaintiff was not consulted about it and had no knowledge of it. There was no privity of any kind between the plaintiff and the defendant, and the latter was under no compulsion to make the payment for the protection of its interests. The payment was doubtless made so as to make its mortgage a first instead of a second mortgage. But that consideration would give no right of subrogation to the holder of the second mortgage. It seems to us that the case of McCleary\u2019s Appeal, 20 W. N. 547, covers every aspect of this. There the first mortgage was an un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>doubtedly valid lien upon tbe property for $925. The second mortgage was a forgery, and the holder, as here, desiring to have the first lien extinguished, paid $600 of the mortgage money, $1,400, to the agent of the owner of the.property, who, with $825 furnished by the owner, paid the $925 due on the first mortgage, had it satisfied, and surrendered the bond and the mortgage to the owner. When the forgery was discovered, the holder of the second .mortgage filed a bill praying a cancellation of the entry of satisfaction, and subrogation. Both the court below and this court held that this could not be done, and dismissed the bill upon the express ground that, although the first mortgage was an unquestioned lien, and the money, to the extent of $600, was paid by the holder of the second mortgage, he was a mere volunteer in making such payment and was not entitled to subrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-3\">The same doctrine was enforced in the case of Webster'and Goldsmith\u2019s Appeal, 86 Pa. 409, the syllabus of which is as follows, viz: While 'subrogation is founded on principles of equity and benevolence and may be. decreed where no contract exists, yet it will not be decreed in favor of a mere volunteer, who, without any duty, moral or otherwise, pays the 'debt of another. It will not arise in favor of a stranger, but only in favor of a party who, on some sort of compulsion, discharges a demand against a common debtor. There the maker of a promissory note for $700 gave a judgment for that amount to his indorser to protect him against liability on his indorsement. After-wards, at the maturity of the note, another person consented to indorse a new note to take up the first one upon the express assurance of the maker that the judgment should be assigned to the second indorser for his protection against liability for the same debt. The judgment was assigned shortly after to the second indorser, who was ultimately obliged to pay the note. The property of the maker being sold upon execution process, the holder of the assigned judgment claimed a share in the distribution of the proceeds as against -'udgments obtained subsequently to the assigned judgment. Priority in the distribution was allowed to the assigned judgment in the court below, but this court reversed the decree, holding that the second indorser was a mere volunteer, and that as the first judgment had served its purpose of protecting the first indorser, it could not be used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>to protect the second indorser although assigned to him for that purpose by the first indorser as a condition of the second indorsement. While we decided that if the judgment had been held by the bank which discounted the note, as a part of their security, subrogation would have been granted, even against intervening judgment creditors, we held also that it could not be granted-to one who came in as the indorser of a new note given to take up the first note, because he was a .stranger to the first contract, and was to be regarded as a mere volunteer. Woodward, J., said: \u201c While subrogation is founded on principles of equity and benevolence, and may be decreed where no contract exists, yet it will not be decreed in favor of a mere volunteer, who without any duty moral or otherwise pays the debt of another: Hoover v. Epler, 2 P. F. Smith, 522. It will not arise in favor of a stranger but only in favor of a party who, on some sort of compulsion, discharges a demand against a common debtor: Mosier\u2019s Appeal, 6 P. F. Smith, 76. . . . There was no privity of interest, and no contract relation, between Bauer and Banker. Bauer could create no duty to himself by a volunteered intervention for Banker\u2019s relief. He became Adam\u2019s indorser without being under any legal or moral compulsion, and he had no existing interest, ascertained or contingent, to protect. He had no equity to entitle him to subrogation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">So here the payment of the $6,000 due under the first mortgage was not made under any compulsion, or for the protection of any rights.or interests previously acquired. The defendant simply loaned the money, and, in order to remove a prior lien, paid it off without, the knowledge or consent of the plaintiff. If a right of subrogation is acquired in such a state of facts we see no reason why it may not exist in every case of officious payment of the debt of another. Yet it is perfectly clear under all the authorities that such payments do not give any right of subrogation to the debt discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">In -Beach on Modern Equity Jurisprudence, section 801, the writer says: \u201c But one who is only a volunteer cannot invoke the aid of subrogation, for such a person can establish no equity. He must have paid upon request or as surety, or under some compulsion made necessary by the adequate protection of his own right. In such a case instead of creating any right of subrogation, the payment operates as the absolute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>discharge of the debt so paid. Thus one who discharges an incumbrance upon property which he has no interest in having relieved, is not thereby subrogated to the rights of the holder of the incumbrance; and the loaning of money to discharge a lien does not subrogate the lender to the rights of the lien hold\u00e9r.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-3\">Sheldon in his work on Subrogation, sec. 240, says: \u201c The doctrine of subrogation is not applied for the mere stranger or vohrnteer who has paid the debt of another without any assignment or agreement for subrogation, being under no legal obligation to make the paj^ment and not being compelled to do so for the preservation of any lights or property of his own.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">There can be no question of the soundness of the foregoing propositions, and where the facts are such as to make them applicable, they are controlling. We think, for reasons already stated, they are directly applicable to the undoubted facts of the present case. It is not practicable, within the proper limits-of a judicial opinion, to engage in a critical review of the numerous decisions cited in the arguments of counsel on both sides. A great many of them furnish their own answer when, the facts which distinguish them are duly noted and considered. Others, which are apparently in point, are affected by the presence of exceptional circumstances which authorize the-introduction of different principles with a controlling effect-But a minute and patient attention to, and consideration of, the very able and exhaustive argument for the appellant has failed to convince us of any error in the treatment of the case by the learned master and the court below, and, substantially for the reasons stated by them, we think the decree should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at' the cost of the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
