'W. Searight died possessed of certain real estate (farms) and personal property, but he was heavily in debt. His estate is not sufficient to pay the debts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-14\">\u25a0 \u201cThe accountant, on Nov. 6, 1891, filed a.first account, which was made up of personalty and the income of the real estate. The -balance in his hands as shown by that account was distributed as personalty to all the creditors of the estate, by an auditor appointed by the court, without objection on the part of anybody. A dividend, however, of only .0472 per cen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>turn of the debts was thereby paid. The account now before the auditor is made up chiefly of income from the real estate and the proceeds of the sales of the real estate. The income is from the proceeds of the crops of the years 1891 and 1892. The sales of the real estate took place in the fall of 1892, and were confirmed by the court on Dec. 16, 1892.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-4\">\u201c The accountant in his capacity of executor collected the income from the real estate with the exception of $962.23, which was collected by his coexecutors. The real estate did not sell for enough to pay the judgments that were against it at the time of F. W. Searight\u2019s death. The debit side of the account shows charges to the amount of $43,130, and the credits claimed amount to $31,102.21. Exceptions to the account were filed by the coexecutors and by creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-5\">\u201c The widow.and heirs of F. W. Searight claim the proceeds of the sale of all the crops gathered from the real estate and charged on the debit side of the account. A suit has been brought by them against Joseph A. Stuart to No. 600 May Term, 1893, in the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland county, for the recovery of these crops. It was agreed before the auditor that he should pass upon this question and that the said suit should be merged in his determination and be ended thereby.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-6\">The auditor refused to allow the claim of the widow and children to the income from the real estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-7\">Exceptions to the auditor\u2019s report were dismissed by the court in an opinion by Stevvakt, P.

Justice Mitchell,</author>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">The widow and heirs are entitled to the income of the real estate between the death of testator and the sale, unless the will has taken it out of the usual course of devolution and put it in the hands of the executors for the payment of debts. It is not a question of conversion, as the learned judge below rightly held, but of intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">The testator had large assets, but also large liabilities,- and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>tbe will indicates that he knew that a settlement of his estate in the usual course of law would leave little or nothing to his family. He had therefore the choice of letting the family get along-for a few years without income, in order that they might then have something saved, or of letting them take the chances of the income from the farms for a few months and .then have nothing. He plainly chose the first alternative. His will empowers his executors, of whom the widow was one, to keep his estate intact and undistributed for a period of five years, and during that period, at their discretion to sell and convey, or to mortgage or pledge any of his real or personal estate for the purpose of raising money for the payment of debts! At the end of the five years, or upon the settlement of the estate by the executors, distribution was to be made. Nothing could be plainer than the general intent and guiding, purpose of the testator to take his estate out of the ordinary legal devolution, and to prevent a present distribution of any of it to the heirs, in the hope of ultimate advantage. The power expressly given over the whole estate, real and personal, to sell, mortgage or pledge for payment of debts, necessarily includes the power to manage, to collect and apply the income of the whole for the desired purpose. This the executors have done.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
