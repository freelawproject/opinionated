W. Wheaton </em>and <em>John T. </em>Lenahan, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AfG\">The offence is defined in the act of 1889 as \u201cembezzlement,\u201d which is the fraudulent appropriation of the goods of another by a person intrusted with the property of the same: 1 Whart. Cr. L. \u00a71009.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-11\">It is a well established rule that when the act itself is not necessarily unlawful but becomes so by particular circumstances and relations, all the matters of which the illegality consists must be set out in the indictment: 1 Chit. Cr. L. 227; Com. v. Beerbrower, 3 Clark, 404; Wilson v. Com., 10 S. &amp; R. 377; Whart. Cr. Pr. &amp; Pl. \u00a7 152; Bishop, Cr. Pro. \u00a7 627.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-12\">Legislation upon the subject of embezzlement by this and other states shows that the element of unlawful conversion is the distinguishing fact of that crime, and one which must therefore be pleaded: Com. v. Delamater, 2 Dist. R. 118; 1 Whart. Cr. L. \u00a7\u00a7 1059, 1061; Whart. Cr. Pr. &amp; Pl. 220, 231; U. S. v. Hess, 125 U. S. 488; Com. v. Miller, 2 Parsons, 480; Com. v. Schall, 2 Dist. R. 462; R.

L. 36.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-4\">Evidence of prior acts is competent only to show guilty intent: Com. v. Sawtelle, 141 Mass. 140; Com. v. Tuckerman, 10 Gray, 173; Com. v. Daniels, 2 Parsons, 332.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-5\">The act of 1889 does not apply to private bankers: Com. v. Ketner, 92 Pa. 372; Bank v. Hines, 3 Ohio St. 31.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-6\">If it does apply it is unconstitutional: Art. 14, \u00a7 1, U. S. Const.; art. 1, \u00a7 9, Pa. Const.; Craig v. Kline, 65 Pa. 399; Jacob\u2019s Application, 98 N. Y. 98.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b166-7\"><em>John M. </em>G-arman, district attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQe\">The mistake made by defendant\u2019s counsel in the first subdivision of their argument lies in an erroneous notion of the meaning of embezzlement: U. S. v. Conant, 9 Reporter, 36; Acts of Congress of June 14, 1886, c. 122, s. 3, v. 14, p. 65; July 8, 1870, c. 225, s. 4, v. 16, p. 194.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-8\">But, whatever the general definition may be, under the act of May 9, 1889, P. L. 145, embezzlement is the taking and receiving money by any banker, broker or-officer of any trust or savings institution, national, state or private bank, from a depositor, with the knowledge that he, they, or the bank is at the'time insolvent: Act of March 13, 1860, P. L. 433; Bank of Republic v. Millard, 10 Wal. 152; Edge v. Com., 7 Pa. 277.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-9\">The testimony was admissible to show general course of business: Com. v. Eastman, 1 Cush. 189.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-10\">A statute made for the good of the people should, although penal, receive an equitable construction: People v. Bartow, 6 Cow. 290.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Aq7d\">July 12, 1894:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b166-11\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AIC\">Mb. Justice Fell,</author>\n<p id=\"b166-12\">The only exceptions that require notice relate to the sufficiency of the indictment, which was drawn under the' act of May 9, 1889, P. L. 145. The act provides that any banker who-sball receive money from a depositor with the knowledge that he, the banker, is at the time insolvent, shall be guilty of embezzlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>The indictment charges that the defendant, being a banker and knowing that he was insolvent, received money from a depositor.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">The averment in the indictment follows the language of the act, and is in substantial compliance with the rules of criminal pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The offence clearly and distinctly defined is the fraudulent receipt of the money of a depositor. The act is not to be nullified because this is called embezzlement and by a construction which reads into its provisions the definition of that offence. The word was not well chosen, but the intention is clear. The case was carefully tried and properly submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
