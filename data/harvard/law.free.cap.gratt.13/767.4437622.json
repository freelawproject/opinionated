Issue was made up on the plea of not guilty; and a trial had, upon which the facts alleged in the presentment were proved, and the further fact that the members of the company are citizens of Connecticut. A verdict was found for the commonwealth assessing the fine at forty dollars. Several motions were made by the plaintiff in error for a new trial, and in arrest of judgment. These motions were severally overruled and judgment rendered on the verdict. The record was carried by writ of error to the Circuit court of Spotsylvania, by which court the judgment of the Corporation court was affirmed. The record is brought here by writ of error to the judgment of the Circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-19\">Whether the presentment should have been adjudged sufficient upon a demurrer, it is not material here to enquire, as the demurrer filed when the plaintiff in error first appeared, was afterwards withdrawn. After verdict a motion in arrest of judgment for defects in the presentment, can be sustained only in case it be so uncertain that judgment \u201caccording to the very right of the case,\u201d cannot be given thereon. Although there is no distinct averment in the presentment that Ihe Protection insurance company is an insurance company, and we are left to infer the fact that it is such from its name, yet the offense is \u201ccharged therein with sufficient certainty for judgment to be given thereon according to the very right of the case.\u201d The defect in the presentment, if it be a defect, is cured by the verdict; and the motion in arrest of judgment for this defect could not be sustained. Code of Virginia, ch. 207, \u00a7 12, p. 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-20\">The question made in the Circuit court and in this court in regard to the constitutionality of the statute, Code of Virginia, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>ch. 38, <em>\u00a7 25, </em>p. 210, under which this prosecution is had, is presented by the motion for a new trial, and that in arrest of judgment. It is insisted \u00aethat the judgment should be reversed, for that the plaintiff in error was merely an ag-ent for the Protection insurance company of Hartford, incorporated or authorized by the law of-the state of Connecticut; that the individual corporators of that company are citizens of that state; that as such citizens, under the constitution of the United States, article 4, <em>8 2, </em>clause 1, they are \u201centitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states;\u201d that in a case like this they have the privileges and immunities of citizens of Virginia; that as citizens of Virginia have the privilege to make contracts in Virginia for the insurance of others, with an immunity'from taxation for making such contracts, that these citizens of Connecticut have the same privilege and immunity; and that the statute above cited, imposing terms upon the agents and subagents of the company, which are not imposed upon citizens of Virginia, is a violation of that portion of the federal constitution above cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">It is somewhat difficult to perceive how the plaintiff in error can raise this question in his case. He points out no discrimination between his privileges and immunities and those of all other citizens of Virginia engaged in his pursuit. It is not shown that he is a citizen of a state other than Virginia; the restrictions prescribed by the statute are imposed alike upon all in his condition. The defense, however, is not founded upon any alleged violation of the plaintiff\u2019s personal privileges or immunities, nor upon any violation of privileges and immunities pertaining to his immediate principal, the Protection insurance company of Hartford; but upon an alleged violation of privileges and immunities guaranteed to those citizens of Connecticut, the corporators in that company.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">This defense has its basis upon an error in confounding things, which are essentially different, in holding these individual citizens, with, their privileges andimmunities *as such, to be identical with the company in which they are corporators. The privileges and immunities guaranteed to them are annexed to their status of citizenship. They are personal, and may not be assigned or imparted by them, or any of them, to any other person, natural or artificial. If it were otherwise, and these citizens could impart their right to others, the limitation of the guaranty to \u201ccitizens\u201d would be without practical effect; the right 'might be imparted to classes, and for purposes in \u25a0 contravention \u00f3f our policy' and laws; and thus our welfare or even our safety be endangered.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">It must be conceded by all, that these citizens of Connecticut can have no greater \u201cprivileges and immunities\u201d than those, which an equal number of our own citizens' might enjoy. It must be further conceded by every one in Virginia, that fifty or a hundred (whatever number) citizens of Virginia could not without a charter associate themselves together, and usurp the franchise of a corporation; adopt a corporate name or seal; nor establish a perpetual succession, nor exempt their members from personal liability' for contracts of the association ; nor to any extent affect or repeal the laws regulating the succession to property, real or personal. In fine, it must be conceded, that our citizens, in any number, of their own motion, and in virtue of their mere citizenship, could do no corporate act whatever. Regarding citizens of Connecticut and of Virginia respectively as having equal privileges and immunities in this respect, we must hold that mere citizenship in Connecticut confers no corporate franchise in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-13\">It is said however, in effect, that the charter in Connecticut confers the corporate existence, and also the faculty' of trading as a corporation; and that the federal constitution guarantees to the corporators the right to trade in Virginia as our own citizens may *trade. The reply is obvious, that we do not recognize the authority of Connecticut to confer on her own citizens privileges or immunities in Virginia, which we have not given to our own citizens within the state. Our own citizens, without a charter from our own authorities, can do no corporate act within the state. Those of Connecticut can be in no better position. The general assembly of Virginia alone has authority to say how far the general rules of property and the general law of liability for contracts shall be varied in favor of corporations. They have heretofore, by general laws \u2019 and by private acts of incorporation, exercised that power, and will, without doubt, continue to exercise it with reference to the welfare of our own people exclusively. They have not (if they could) conferred on another state unlimited discretion to charter companies to transact business in Virginia. It is a grave exercise of sovereign power to create artificial persons in. our midst not amenable to our laws; to vary' the general laws by conferring corporate existence, capacity and power. The authorities of Connecticut could not confer such faculties and functions on citizens of Virginia, to be exercised in Virginia; by' parity of reason, if no more, they cannot confer them on citizens of Connecticut, to be exercised here. The plaintiff\u2019s theory rests upon the assumption that because private individuals may engage in particular pursuits, that therefore artificial persons called corporations, created and existing elsewhere, may engage in the same pursuits.; that the right to exercise their natural faculties in lawful pursuits, is identical with the right to engage in the same pursuits with the aid of a new organization with other and different faculties from those pertaining to the same individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-16\">If we carry out the pretensions of the plaintiff to their legitimate results, we must hold that the authority '*of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>another state may create a corporation within that state, but to use its corporate power within this state in any pursuit permitted to our own citizens: and that the only mode by which we can expel the intruder will be to forbid our own citizens to engage in that pursuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">It seems to me that the chain of reasoning, by which corporate powers beyond the limits of the state conferring them are to be deduced from private individual rights of citizens, is utterly defective. I have no doubt of the power of the general assembly of Virginia to forbid foreign corporations from engaging in any pursuit within the state; and, of consequence, to grant x&gt;er\" mission to engage therein only upon terms ; and that the statute, Code of Virginia, ch. 38, $ 25, p. 210, is clearly within the scope of their legitimate powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The question as to the nature and extent of the privileges and immunities secured to citizens of the several states by the federal constitution, has from time to time been the subject of consideration in the federal and state courts. In several of the cases the claim to privilege and immunity was asserted under circumstances very like those of our case; but in no one of them was the claim allowed. In the cases of The Commonwealth v. Milton, and City of Lexington v. Same, 12 B. Monr. R. 212, the Court of appeals of Kentucky decided that a statute of that state imposing a tax upon insurance companies chartered in other states but doing business in Kentucky, was valid, although insurance companies chartered in Kentucky were not subjected to the same tax. In these cases the defendant relied upon the federal constitution, article 4, \u00a7 2, as does the plaintiff in our case; yet upon full consideration, it was held that the legislature have authority to enact the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"ANoE\">In Tatem v. Wright et al., 3 Zabriskie\u2019s R. 429, the x\u2019Sux)reme court of Sew Jersey affirmed the validity of a statute imposing a tax ux&gt;on the agents of foreign insurance companies from other states doing business in New Jersey. They overruled the claim of privilege and immunity founded on the section of the federal constitution above cited; and they decided that a corporation aggregate was not a citizen, or entitled to the privileges of a citizen, excex&gt;t perhaps for the purpose of giving jurisdiction to the federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">In Corfield v. Coryell, 4 Wash. C. C. R. 371, the subject was under consideration; and the opinion of the court, pronounced by Judge Washington, contains an enumeration of the privileges and immunities secured by the federal constitution, but the franchise of coloration is not embraced therein. In Virginia they may be regarded as set forth in our bill of rights and constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">In the Bank of Augusta v. Earle, 13 Peters\u2019 R. 519, the question was argued, and the right of the bank, a corporation chartered in Georgia, to make a contract in the line of its business, in Alabama, was affirmed. It was so held, because the comity of the state of Alabama x&gt;ermitted the contract to be made within her borders. If there had been a statute in that state forbidding the bank to do business within that state, or allowing it to do so only upon terms, the Supreme court would have given full effect to such statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">It is not necessary in the case before ns to express any opinion on the conflict between the decision of this court in Bank of Marietta v. Pindall, 2 Rand. 465, and that of the Supreme court in the Bank of Augusta v. Earle. The principle of either case seems to require the affirmance of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-12\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel, in the argument here, alleged that the statute is in violation of the constitution of Virginia; that as the constitution, article 4, clause 22, ^'prescribes that \u201ctaxation shall be equal and uniform throughout the commonwealth, and all property, other than slaves, shall be taxed in proportion to its value, which shall be ascertained in such manner as may be prescribed bylaw;\u201d and as clause 25 of the 4th article authorizes the general assembly to levy a tax on \u201cincomes, salaries and licenses,\u201d that such tax must also be \u201cequal and uniform.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-15\">The provisions of the 22d and 23d clauses were inserted with the intention of preventing onerous taxes upon slaves. As that species of property was chiefly held in the eastern portion of the commonwealth, and as the power of laying taxes would in a short time pass into the hands of the western portion, it was foreseen that the western portion, if the tax laying power should not be restricted, might discriminate in the levy of taxes to the prejudice of the owners of slaves. These clauses were therefore inserted in the constitution as a compromise, a guaranty for such equality of taxation as therein prescribed. A tax on the value of all property, other than slaves; as to slaves a tax equal to arid not exceeding the tax assessed on three hundred dollars worth of land was imposed on every one over the age of twelve years. The provisions of the clauses, taken in connection with the history of the times, leave no doubt that they were inserted as an adjustment of the supposed antagonism of eastern and western interests. The language, however, is broad enough to embrace all subjects of assessable value except slaves, and such is the construction put upon it by the general assembly. It is proposed, however, in the argument here, to extend the equality and uniformity prescribed by clause 22 to the subjects of taxation enumerated in clause 25. If it be conceded for the |&gt;urposes of this case, that the rule of uniformity and equality must apply to both classes of subjects, yet it can only be so applied as far as practicable; *property of assessable value may readily be brought under the rule; so of incomes and salaries ; but the very large class of licenses, whence is derived a large revenue, cannot be assessed; licenses are necessarily ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>tained before engaging in the licensed pursuit; it would be idle to speculate \u25a0 in advance as to the value of the privilege. To fix arbitrarily a specific tax for all licenses would be grossly unequal and far from uniform; to tax the merchant who may have fifty thousand dollars profitably invested in his business, and an inn keeper with a tenth part of that capital paying poorly in his business, the same specific sum, would be against the true meaning of the constitution. The requisitions of the constitution may be carried out by a uniform tax on licenses to persons following the same pursuit, under the same conditions and circumstances; a difference therein will justify a discrimination in the tax. The case before us is an apt instance of business pursued under a difference of circumstances, to justify such discrimination. Our domestic insurance companies are taxed upon their capital, or upon their dividends; a license tax cannot therefore be exacted of them. Constitution of Virginia, art. 4, clause 25. The Protection insurance company of Hartford is not and cannot be taxed upon its capital or dividends, they being beyond the reach of our laws. Our insurance companies are exempt from license tax because, and only because they pay a large tax in a different mode. The Protection insurance company of Hartford, insisting on equality and uniformity, claims an exemption from the license tax, although it does not pay that other tax in that other form, or any other tax whatever. Holding then that the general assembly of Virginia had authority to enact the statute, Code of Virginia, ch. 38, \u00a7 25, p. 210, I am of opinion that the defense founded upon its alleged unconstitutionality, is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"Akll\">*As I have said in regard to the other branch of the defense, I may say in regard to this, that it is difficult to perceive how the plaintiff can make it in his case ; there is no discrimination against him; he and all others in his business are subjected to precisely the same tax; he must be understood as maintaining the rights claimed for his principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">I am of opinion to affirm the judgment.</p>\n<judges id=\"b296-7\">The other judges concurred in the opinion of Samuels, J.</judges>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">CORPORATIONS (PRIVATE).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">I.

DEFINITIONS AND DISTINCTIONS.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-60\">A Corporation. \u2014 A corporation is \u201ca body composed of one or more individuals, and possessed of a franchise, by virtue of which it subsists as a body politic, under a special designation, and by .the policy of the law is vested with the capacity of perpetual succession, and of acting in several particulars however numerous the association, <em>as a single individual.\" </em>1 Minor\u2019s Inst. (3rd Ed.) 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-61\">\u201cA corporation is an artificial being, invisible, intangible, and existing only in contemplation of law. Being the mere creature of law, it possesses only those properties which the charter of its creation confers upon it, either expressly or as incidental to its very existence. Among the most important are immortality, and, if the expression may be allowed, individuality. By these means a perpetual succession of individuals is capable of acting for the promotion of the particular object like one immortal being.\u201d Marshall, O. J., in Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4 Wheat. 636, cited in Railroad Co. v. Transportation Co., 25 W.

Co , 11 Leigh 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">Public and Private Corporations Distinguished. -Corporations are generally divided into two classes, based on the character of their business. Corresponding to the private person is the private corporation, created for private purposes or ior the pecuniary gam of its members; and of course they do not cease to be private corporations, simply because the legislature supposed, as it always does, that their creation would indirectly promote the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">On the other hand public corporations correspond to public officers in the division of natural persons. They are created generally for governmental purposes; or they may be created for business purposes and will still be public corporations, if the whole interest in the corporation belongs to the state. Railroad Co. v. Transportation Co., 25 W. Va. 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Quasi-Public Corporations. \u2014 There is also a third class of corporations corresponding to <em>quasi </em>public officers, called <em>quart </em>public corporations, viz. owners of ferries, common carriers, innkeepers, etc., 3Vho are chartered to conduct a business in which the public hasran interest; and hence are subject to the control of the legislature as to their maximum charges, etc. Railroad Co. v.

Bon Aqua Imp. Co. v. Insurance Co., 34 W. Va. 764, 12 S. E. Rep. 771.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Liability, \u2014 The principle to be deduced from our statute and the authorities, is, that a private business corporation, acting, and carrying on its corporate business in its corporate name, after its legal existence has ended by the expiration of its charter, must be held to be a corporation defacto; and that as such, so long as it in fact so carries on its business, and contracts or incurs liabilities with, or to third persons dealing with it as a <em>de facto </em>corporation, it may sue and be sued-at law, either in actions <em>ex contracto </em>or <em>ex </em>delicto, and it cannot defeat such action by alleging that its charter had expired before the cause of action arose. Its directors and stockholders by failing to wind up its business when the charter expires, as it is their duty to do under our statute, cannot relieve the corporation from liability for acts done in its name,- and during its actual existence as a <em>defacto </em>corporation. In order to relieve it from liability the corporation must have ceased to exist both in law and in fact. And consequently, when- it is sued as a corporation, a plea averring simply that it has ceased to exist in law, or as a legal corporation, will be insufficient, but it must aver also that it had ceased to exist in fact at the time the alleged cause of action arose.

It may certainly repeal the charter of any bank, but it cannot compel a bank to accept an amendment or modification of its charter. Nor is any such amendment or modification of its charter binding npon the bank without \u2018its acceptance. Banks are private corporations, created by a charter, or act of incorporation from the government. which is in the nature of a contract, and therefore, in order to complete the creation of such corporations, something more than the mere grant of a charter is required ; that is, in order to give to the charter the full force and effect of an executed contract, it must be accepted. It is clear that the government cannot enforce the acceptance of a charter upon a private corporation without its consent. These well-settled principles are everywhere recog - nized as applicable to the original charters of incorporation ; and upon principle and authority they apply with equal force to any amendment or modification of the charter as well as to the original charter. Though the legislature may have the reserved power to amend or modify a charter of incorporation, it can no more force the corporation to accept such amendment or modification, than it could have forced upon them the acceptance of the original charter without their consent. Under the reservation they can repeal or destroy the charter, without any consent on the part of the corporators, but as long as they remain in existence as a corporate body, they necessarily have the power to reject an amendment or modification of their charter. The power reserved by the legislature gives the right certainly to repeal or destroy, but so far as the right to modify or alter is concerned, it is nothing more than the ordinary case of a stipulation that one of the parties to a contract may vaiy its terms with the consent of the other contracting party. These principles grow out of the nature of charters or acts of incorporation, which are regarded in the nature of contracts. The amendment or modification must be made by the parties' to the contract, the legislature on the one hand, and the corporation on the other, the former expressing its intention, by means of a legislative act, and the latter assenting thereto by a vote of the majority of the stockholders, according to the provisions of its charter, or by other acts showing its acceptance.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-16\">\u201cThe reservation of the right to alter, amend or repeal the act by which the corporation is created, maybe prudent and salutary; but it seems to be a necessary implication, that if the legislature should undertake to make what in their opinion is a legitimate alteration or amendment, the corporation has the power to reject or accept it, whatever may be the consequences. One consequence undoubtedly is, that the corporation cannot conduct its operations in defiance of the power that created it: and if it does not accept the modification or amendment proposed, must discontinue its operations as a corporate body. But such amendment or modification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>cannot be forced upon the corporation without its consent.\u201d Christian, J., in Yeaton v.

POWERS OP CORPORATIONS.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">Corporation Must Exercise Its Powers Collectively, Not Individually. \u2014 Where authority is conferred on a corporation aggregate by statute to make contracts, neither a majority of the members, nor all of them acting separately have the power to bind the corporation; one of the principal objects being'the concurrent counsel and deliberation of the members acting together; and of course, if they cannot <em>'jfiake </em>a binding' contract acting separately, they cannot, individually, ratify what has been done, so as to bind the corporation. A corporation can only act as a body or by its authorized agents. Penn. Lightning Rod Co. v. Board of Education, 20 W. Va. 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">Implied Powers.--\"Corporations aggregate are artificial beings created tor specific and limited objects, public or private, in order to conduct and continue in succession the interests pertaining to those objects. by the exercise collectively of appropriate, legitimate means, such as natural persons may employ individually. . The difference between the powers of corporations and individuals is to be found mainly in the limited objects of the former, and the necessity of their acting in a concrete character. It is essential to corporations, as well as individuals, that they should have the capacity to sue and be sued, to make contracts, to acquire and alienate property. Without these powers the purposes of their institution could <em>not </em>be accomplished. But they have not, like individuals, an unlimited discretion in the application of these powers. They may not exercise them ior purposes foreign to their creation. <em>A </em>bank of discount and deposit cannot engage in manufacturing or agricultural pursuits; an insurance or mining company cannot discount bills or notes, or circulate their paper an money: a road or navigation company cannot speculate in lands or stocks. But all such corporations have the right to secure and collect debts due to them, and consequently to obtain deeds of trust or mortgages therefor upon property real or personal, or to commute them by taking in payment assignments of <em>chases in </em>action, or conveyances of lands or goods. The <em>authority to use </em>such <em>means </em>is to be determined by the lawfulness of the end which they are employed to accomplish.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-12\">\u201cIt is true that the capacity of corporations at common law to purchase and hold lands and chattel\u00bb is laid down broadly in the books, though I am not aware of any case in which the question was made whether this power was unlimited. However this may be. I think it clear that our statutory corporations cannot take and hold real estate for purposes wholly foreign to their creation.\u201d Rivanna Nav. Co. v. Dawsons, 3 Gratt. 20; The Banks v. Poitiaux. 3 Rand. 136; Wroten v. Armat, 31 Gratt. 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-13\">Whilst no powers will be implied except those only which are incident to the very existence of the corporation or so necessary to the enjoyment of some special grant that without the implied power such right would fail, yet it is an established principle that corporations may exercise all the powers within the fair intent and purpose of their creation which are reasonably proper to give effect to powers expressly granted. Lewis v. Glenn, 84 Va. 947, 6 S. E. Rep. 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-14\">Implied Powers <em>flay </em>Be Curtailed <em>by the </em>Provisions of the Charter.--lt is, moreover, unquestionable that the general incidental power of a corporation, whether derived from the common or the statute law, may be curtailed by the provisions of its legislative charter, either expressly or by necessary implication. Thus the charter may in terms prohibit the corporation from purchasing lands or goods for any purpose whatever, or for any but a particular specified purpose; or the prohibition may be implied from an insertion, by way of enactment, of the general incidental power to purchase, with a proviso limiting it to a given purpose. But a general prohibition would not be inferred from a mere partial enactment of the incidental common-law power; as, for example, from a clause authorizing a bank, insurance or manufacturing company to purchase land <em>for the erection of its necessary </em>buildings. Such a clause, whether with or without limitation as to quantity or value, would not exclude the incidental power to take mortgages or other securities on real or personal estate, for debts due the corporation, or assignments or conveyances of chattels or lands in commutation therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-15\">The incidental capacity of a corporate body to acquire property for its chartered objects, is for the most part salutary, and the entire prohibition of it would often be productive of great inconvenience. Nothing is easier, whenever sound policy may require the denial of this otherwise inherent power, than a plain manifestation of such legislative intent in the charter of incorporation; and it ought not to be lightly inferred, but made manifest by express terms or necessary implication.

Under this police power a city ordinance forbidding a railroad to propel cars through certain crowded streets of'a city by steam, was upheld as not impairing the obligation of the contract of incorporation.

Charters Merely Directory.--\u201cit seems to me. that the charters limiting the amount of land that a corporation may acquire are merely directory. They impose no penalty in terms. They do not declare the purchase by or conveyance to the banks to be void, nor vest the title in the commonwealth or any other than the banks in consequence of such purchase and conveyance. The legal title passed to the banks by the conveyance to them, and their conveyance would effectually transfer that title to any other. If, in making the purchase of the land in question, the banks violated their charters, the corporation might, for that cause, be dissolved by a proceeding at the suit of the commonwealth: and even in that case, it seems the better opinion that the property, if not previously conveyed away would revert, upon the dissolution of the corporation, to the grantor and not to the commonwealth. But any conveyance made by the corporation, before its dissolution would be effectual to pass its title. The banks therefore have a title which they can convey to the appellee and which would, in his hands, be indefeasible.

A distinction was formerly made between acts of non-feasance, or failure to perform such duties, and acts of misfeasance by the agents of a corporation, in the former the corporation was held liable, m the latter, some courts held it not to beso; but this distinction is no longer recognized by the weight of authority, quern.

The very basis of an action of libel, or for a malicious prosecution, is the evil intent, the malice of the party against whom such a suit is brought; and I cannot now well see how it is possible to hold that a corporation may be sued for a libel, and punitive damages recovered, and at the same time hold that such corporation could not be indicted for such libel. The suits of libel and malicious prosecution are in their nature very like to criminal proceedings; and if they lie against a corporation, it would seem to follow, that there are cases for which indictments may lie against a corporation where the evil intention constitutes an element in the offence. And if a corporation is, as has been said, liable civilly for an assault and battery committed through its servants, it is perhaps going too far to say that a corporation esm in no case be liable criminally for any offence against the person under any circumstances.\" Green, P\u201e in State v.

The act of misfeasance may, in a particular case, be of such a character, that though done by an authorized agent within the scope of his general employment and for the benefit of the corporation, yet it may give rise to but a suspicion that it has been directed or approved by the corporation. And if the act be of such character, independent proof must in such case be produced of the approval of the corporation, before it can be found guilty in a criminal proceeding. In such case it would clearly not be necessary to prove that the corporation by a distinct act,,such as a vote of its directors, either directed the act to be done or subsequently approved of its being done. Nor if this was required, it would amount to an absolute exemption of a corporation from all liability criminally for the wrongs of its agents : for criminal acts are never so formally directed or approved. Still in such a case the approval of the corporation must be satisfactorily proven, but such approval may be shown satisfactorily otherwise than by proving such direct act of approval. The criminal act being in such a case done by an authorized agent acting within the scope of his authority, the mere doing of the act, even though done wilfully, sufficiently shows, we incline to think, the assent and approval of the corporation, to make them liable in a civil suit; and it gives rise to a suspicion in a criminal proceeding against the corporation, which, if corroborated by evidence that similar acts havebeen done by the agents of the corporation repeatedly, would be sufficient proof of their approval to justify a conviction. It is but a reasonable inference that acts which are habitually done by the authorized agents of a corporation are done with their approval ; and this is indeed almost the only manner in which the approval by the corporation of the ; acts of its agents can ever be proven. The tacit appropriation by a corporation of the benefits of the acts of its agents, repeatedly occurring, is lull and satisfactory proof of the assent of the corporation to the doing of such acts.\u201d Green, P., in State v.

RIGHT OF STOCKHOLDERS TO SHE OR DEFEND ON BEHALF OF CORPORATION.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">When Corporation Is a Going Concern. \u2014 Stockholders cannot sue in behalf o\u00ed a corporation in a court of law: but in a court of equity the rule is different. There, though redress should be obtained if possible through its regularly appointed agents, if it is shown that the directors or managing officers have refused to act and redress has been vainly sought within the corporation, a bill by the stockholders themselves wil] be entertained. Crumlish v. R. Co., 28 W. Va. 623; Moore v. Schoppert, 22 W. Va. 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-12\">In order to entitle a stockholder to institute and maintain a suit in equity to redress a corporate injury committed <em>infra viras, </em>against a solvent corporation in the full exercise of its franchises, and carrying on its corporate business, it must appear not only that the directors are either disabled by their misconduct to sue, or that they have wrongfully refused to do so upon a proper demand ; but where the matter will admit of the necessary delay, and it is practicable to call upon the stockholders to act, this must also be done. Until it is shown that every reasonable effort to obtain redress through the regularly constituted agents and controlling power of the corporation has proved un* availing, a stockholder cannot sue in his own name alone, nor on behalf of himself and other stockholders. Nor do sections 57 and 58, ch. 53, Code W. Va. have any application to such a suit. Rathbone v. Parkersburg Gas Co., 31 W.

The court distinguished this case from that of Nimick v. Iron Works, 25 W. Va. 184, where the object was to enforce a statutory liability imposed by the state of Ohio, on stockholders of an Ohio corporation resident in West Virginia. The court held that such liability being conditional on failure of assets could not be enforced by the West Virginia courts, since they had not jurisdiction over the Ohio corporation, to determine the amount of its assets. But in the principal case the liability ' of the domestic corporation is absolute and unconditional. Crumlish v. Railroad Co., 28 W.

Crumlish v. Railroad Co., 28 W. Va. 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">Barred by Laches. \u2014 While a minority of the stockholders of a corporation may maintain a bill in equity, in behalf of themselves and other stockholders, for fraud, conspiracy, or <em>ultra vires </em>acts, against a corporation, its officers, or others who participated therein, when the minority stockholders have been injured by said act, they must act promptly, and not wait an unreasonable time.

DIVIDENDS. \u2014 Th e board of directors may from time to time declare dividends of so much of the net profits as they may deem it prudent to divide. If any stockholder be indebted to the corporation, his dividend, or so much thereof as may be necessary, may be applied to the payment of the debt; if the same be then due and payable.

Rep. 646.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-13\">Stock Dividends. \u2014 A stock dividend is not in the ordinary sense of the word, a dividend, the latter being the distribution of profits to stockholders as income from their investment. A stock dividend is merely an increase in the number of shares, the increased number representing exactly the same property that was represented by the smaller number of shares. Hence where two parties agree to exchange shares in two corporations, retaining the dividends declared for a certain month, and one corporation declares a stock dividend, such dividend goes with the stock and cannot be retained as a true dividend.

From the fiduciary relation which the director of a corporation holds to the corporation itself and to its shareholders and creditors, and from the fact that they are held to strict good faith in the management of the corporate concerns, it follows that they are liable either to the corporation, or.\u2018 in a proper case, to the shareholders or creditors, for a fraudulent breach of trust or misappropriation of corporate fnnds. whereby a loss or injury results to the corporate assets.

Nor can one who is treasurer and secretary of the corporation, and a stockholder and director, recover on a <em>Quantum meruit </em>for his official services without such by-law or resolution. The law of that state raises no promise on the part of the corporation in such cases, and the question whether, in such cases, there is an implied promise, depends on the law of that state.

CONSOLIDATION OP CORPORATIONS \u2014 \u201cA consolidation not only renders the property and works of the old company, which pass to the company with which it is consolidated, subject to the liabilities of the old company, but also makes the new, or surviving company responsible for them. Where two railroad companies unite, or become consolidated under the authority of law, the presumption is, until the contrary appears, that the united or consolidated company has all the powers and privileges, and is subject to all tbe restrictions and liabilities, of those out of which it is created. The corporation which is created by such consolidation, or the surviving corporation, where another or others are merged into it or consolidated with it, is ordinarily deemed the same as each of the corporations which formed it for the purpose of answering for the liabilities of the old corporation, and may be sued under its new name, or under tbe name of the surviving company, for their debts as if no change had been made in the name, or in the organization of the original corporations. There has been some question whether the consolidated company could be sued in an action at law for the liabilities of the companies composing it, or whether the proceeding must be in equity. But the better view seems to be tbat when a consolidation has been authorized and made, it confers all tbe rights, property, and franchises of the old company upon the new or consolidated company, and subjects it to all the liabilities1 of the old companies; and an action at law may be brought against the new or consolidated company for the debts or torts of the old companies. The question is not whether the consolidation compels a creditor to accept the defendant corporation as a new debtor against bis will, or a person who has been injured to resort to a stranger for satisfaction, but whether it empowers the creditor or the person injured to resort, if he desires to do so, in the first instance, to the corporation which by the terms of the consolidation is made liable to him. The privity, some cases say, necessary to support this action, is created by the statute authorizing the consolidation and the purchase and conveyance made under it. Other authorities place the right to bring such action on the ground that the effect of the consolidation is, as to the liabilities of tbe old company, not to dissolve the corporation which is the immediate debtor, but to continue its existence in the consolidated corporation.\u201d Buchanan, J., in Langhorne v. Richmond R. Co., 91 Va. 369, 22 S. E.

Steenrod v. Railroad, 27 W. Va. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">Liable to the Extent of Property Received. \u2014 Where by authority of the legislature a corporation has accepted a transfer of the entire stock of another corporation and has taken possession and held the | property of the old corporation after the expiration of the time limit of its charter, itplaces itself in the position of a successor to the latter corporation, liable. to the extent of the property received, to the debts, and entitled to all the rights of the latter. Barksdale v.

Moore v. Schoppert, 22 W. Va. 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-19\">Quo Warranto the Proper Remedy. \u2014 An information in the nature of a <em>quo warranto </em>is the proper rented y by which to try and decide whether the charter of a corporation ought to be nullified and vacated, or to prevent the company from receiving tolls. The fact that the commonwealth is a stockholder is no bar to such a proceeding. The superior court of law for the county in which the president and directors reside has jurisdiction in such a proceeding, no matter where the acts of forfeiture complained of were committed. Com. v. Pres. &amp; Directors of James River Co., 2 Va. Gas. 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-20\">Causes of Forfeiture Cannot Be Taken Advantage of Collaterally. \u2014 Although a corporation by failure to perform its duties has made itself liable to forfeiture, of its franchises, such grounds of forfeiture cannot be taken advantage of by injunction or otherwise in a court of equity to resist the payment of tolls, etc., or for any other purpose, except where a public nuisance results and in the case of charitable trusts; the only remedy is in a court of law by the writ of <em>quo warranto </em>instituted by the state, the court saying, \u201cThe act of incorporation is not a contract between the corporate body on the one hand and individuals whose rights and interests may be affected by the exercise of its powers, on the other, but it is a con-pact between the corporation and the government from which they derive their powers. Individuals cannot therefore take it upon themselves, in the assertion of their private rights, to insist on breaches of the contract of the corporation, as a ground for resisting or denying the exercise of a corporate power.\u201d Pixley v. Roanoke Nav. Co., 75 Va. 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-21\">A cause of forfeiture cannot be taken advantage of, or enforced against a private corporation, collaterally or incidentally, or in any other mode than by a direct proceeding for that purpose, against the corporation, so that it may have an opportunity to answer; and the state can alone institute such a proceeding, since it may waive a broken condition of a compact with it as well as an individual.
