Plaintiffs allege that defendants engaged in a fraudulent scheme to market Neurontin for \u201coff-label\u201d uses not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Among other things, they allege that defendants\u2019 employees and sales representatives fraudulently misrepresented Neurontin\u2019s safety and effectiveness for off-label usage and failed to disclose studies indicating that Neurontin can cause behavioral disturbances, depression, and suicidal actions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">Pfizer has moved to dismiss the fraud claims pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b) and Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) on the ground that plaintiffs failed to allege that prescribing physicians actually received and relied on any fraudulent misrepresentations or omissions made during the course of improper off-label marketing.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">As background, this is the second round of motions to dismiss. In 2006, the Court ruled that the original complaints were \u201cclearly deficient\u201d because they failed to allege that any of plaintiffs\u2019 physicians met with a Pfizer liaison, attended a conference, or otherwise received the material misrepresentation upon which she then relied. <em>In re Neurontin Mktg. and Sales Practicing Litig., </em>No. 04-10981, 2007 WL 609875, at *2 (D.Mass. Feb. 28, 2007). However, because the information was exclusively within the control of the pharmaceutical companies and the doctors, the Court allowed plaintiffs the opportunity for additional discovery in fourteen \u201cpilot\u201d cases. The discovery was with respect to contacts between Pfizer\u2019s sales team and the doctors who prescribed the medication, including the ability to depose the doctors and evaluate relevant sales documentation. On April 7, 2008, based on this discovery,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the plaintiffs in twelve of the fourteen \u201cpilot\u201d cases filed amended complaints (Docket Nos. 1201-12) which are the subject of these renewed motions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-15\">After the hearing and a review of the briefs, the Court <em>ALLOWS in part </em>and <em>DENIES in part </em>the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-16\">II. <em>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-17\">Each of the pilot plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaints raise virtually identical claims regarding the off-label marketing campaign and the alleged fraudulent misrepresentations regarding the safety and efficacy of Neurontin. When all reasonable inferences are drawn in favor of the non-moving parties, the amended complaints allege the following facts, many of which defendants dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>A. <em>FDA Approval of Neurontin for Epilepsy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Parke-Davis is a division of Warner-Lambert Company which is now owned by Pfizer. On January 15, 1992, Parke-Davis submitted a New Drug Application (\u201cNDA\u201d) to the FDA seeking approval for Neurontin as an adjunctive therapy for epilepsy. As part of its submission, Parke-Davis submitted data documenting adverse events reported in its clinical trials. For example, seventy-eight individuals, or 5.3 percent of the total exposed patient population of the NDA, reported depression as an adverse event. Seven instances of depression were categorized as \u201cserious\u201d events, and nine patients withdrew from studies because of depression. There were also numerous mood and behavioral disturbances, or \u201cpsychobiologic\u201d adverse events, reported in the studies. In the FDA review of the data, an FDA medical reviewer, Dr. Cynthia McCormick, M.D., raised concerns about the relationship between Neurontin and the adverse events of depression and suicide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">Less common but more serious events may limit the drug\u2019s widespread usefulness .... [Depression, while it may not be an infrequent occurrence in the epileptic population, may become worse and require intervention or lead to suicide, as it has resulted in suicide attempts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">The FDA concluded its review of Neuron-tin\u2019s NDA by stating that Neurontin was \u201capprovable with appropriate and prominent labeling for use in a specific population.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">On or about December 15, 1992, the Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee to the Department of Health and Human Services voted to recommend Neurontin for a very specific use in a limited population, the adjunctive treatment for refractory epilepsy. Approximately one year later, on December 30, 1993, the company received FDA approval to market Neurontin for the adjunctive treatment of epilepsy in adults.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The FDA stated that the drug is only effective at 900 to 1800 milligrams per day.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">B. <em>Illegal Off-Label Marketing Campaign</em></p>\n<p id=\"b142-12\">Beginning in 1995, defendants engaged in a multi-faceted marketing campaign designed to increase off-label sales of Neurontin. Defendants began to illegally market and promote the sale of Neurontin for \u201coff-label uses\u201d which were not approved by the FDA, such as the treatment of pain, bipolar disorder and anxiety. Product liability plaintiffs allege the national campaign included: a) sales representatives detailing Neurontin to prescribing physicians for uses and at higher dosages than had been tested or approved; b) funded presentations by consultants and liaisons to encourage word-of-mouth recommendations for off-label uses within the medical community; c) increased clinical testing and development for new off-label usages; and d) affirmative promotional statements intended to conceal or misrepresent negative or contradictory data on the drug\u2019s safety or efficacy for off-label uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-13\">In 1995, sales representatives made presentations in details to doctors\u2019 offices<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>promoting Neurontin for pain and for reflex sympathetic dystrophy, a nerve damage syndrome. Defendants trained their sales representatives to promote off-label uses and motivated sales representatives to encourage prescription amounts for dosages higher than approved by the FDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">.Defendants made a concerted effort to disperse \u201cword-of-mouth\u201d recommendations throughout the medical community. Defendants hired physician consultants, provided them with payments or honorariums, and arranged promotional junkets and conferences in resorts for doctors (and their spouses) where the consultants gave presentations on off-label uses of Neuron-tin. Employees of the defendants\u2019 Medical and Scientific Affairs Department, whom defendants referred to as \u201cmedical liaisons,\u201d made presentations to doctors with company slides that promoted off-label usages of Neurontin for a variety of conditions including migraines, post-herpetic neuralgia, restless leg syndrome, bipolar disorder, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (also know as \u201cALS\u201d or \u201cLou Gehrig\u2019s Disease\u201d). Medical liaisons also falsely informed doctors that early results from clinical trials evaluating Neurontin for the treatment of bipolar disorder, peripheral and diabetic neuropathy, and other pain syndromes, indicated 90% response rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">While defendants were promoting Neurontin\u2019s efficacy for off-label uses, Pfizer was actively researching alternative uses for the drug. Defendants had a Drug Development Team and New Product Committee whose stated purpose was to explore new uses for. Neurontin beyond the epileptic population. Defendants also sought approval from the FDA for additional uses. Defendants\u2019 application to the FDA for approval of Neurontin as a monotherapy for partial seizures was denied on August 26, 1997. The FDA also refused to increase the approved dosage of Neurontin to amounts greater than 1800 mg per day.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">Clinical evidence emerged from the FDA trials and afterwards that did not support Pfizer\u2019s promotion of Neurontin as safe and effective for off-label uses. Defendants and their representatives nonetheless promoted off-label uses even where there was contradictory clinical evidence. For example, defendants sponsored a study conducted at the Harvard Bipolar Research Program in 1998, which concluded that patients receiving Neurontin did worse than those patients on placebo sugar pills. Although defendants were aware of the results of this study, they did not publish the study\u2019s results until 2000, after a significant number of physicians were induced to prescribe Neurontin.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">In their national marketing campaign, defendants failed to disclose or warn, that Neurontin may be associated with psycho-biologic events including depression and suicidality. Indeed, Pfizer representatives strategically compared Neurontin with competing drugs which already had a specific warning related to suicide. On January 16, 2003, defendants\u2019 Senior Medical Director, Dr. Catherine Clarey, flatly denied any association between Neurontin and depression or suicidality when, on National Public Radio (\u201cNPR\u201d), she stated, \u201c[TJhere is absolutely no evidence that Neurontin ... with all these prescriptions that it has been associated with suicidal behavior or that it can cause suicidal behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">Pfizer\u2019s marketing campaign for Neurontin correlates with a substantial rise in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Neurontin sales. Sales of Neurontin for non-FDA approved uses have skyrocketed steadily since 1998. From 2000 to the present, off-label usage constitutes 93 to 94 percent of all Neurontin sales. This sharply contrasts with sales for approved uses where sales have declined during the relevant period.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">C. <em>Convicted</em></p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Defendant Warner-Lambert Company LLC was charged in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts with improper off-label marketing in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 331(a), 331(d), 333(a)(2), 352(f)(1) and 355(a), and pled guilty to the charges on June 7, 2004.

No Direct Contacts between Pfizer and Prescribing Provider</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">All the of the plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaints seek to recover damages based on injuries related to suicide or attempted suicide, which plaintiffs claim was caused by Neurontin, prescribed off-label for indications not approved by the FDA. Seven of the complaints fail to allege any specific contact between Pfizer and the prescribing provider.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-9\">\u2022 Pamela Woolum, a citizen of Florida, suffered from anxiety.

Plaintiffs contend that Neurontin causes the reduction of certain monoamines, neurotransmitters in the brain, such as serotonin. A reduction in these monoamines is associated with mood and behavioral disturbances, including depression and suicidality. (Woolum Am. Compl. \u00b6 256; McGee Amended Complaint (\u201cMcGee Am. Compl.\u201d) \u00b6 260.) The treating physicians testified that when deciding whether to prescribe Neurontin, they would have wanted to know the link between Neurontin and psychobiologic adverse events, e.g., depression and suicidality, or the drug\u2019s effect on reducing serotonin and other monoamines. (Woolum Am. Compl. \u00b6 120) (prescriber did not know whether Neurontin reduced or decreased the production and release of dopamine, noradrenaline, or serotonin); McGee Am. Compl. \u00b6 120 (prescriber testified that she was never told by defendants that Neurontin decreases the flow of serotonin or norepinephrine and that if she had known that, she would like to have known the clinical data); Roberson Amended Complaint (\u201cRoberson Am. Compl.\u201d) \u00b6 120 (prescriber testified that he prescribed Paxil for plaintiffs decedent to increase serotonin amount and stated clinical evidence indicating that Neurontin decreases amount of serotonin in the brain would be important to know before making either prescription).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">2.

Dr. Arias testified that \u201cprobably a couple of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>times\u201d that more than one drug representative detailed Neurontin off-label uses to him \u201coff the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 127. Defendants never informed him that Neurontin was associated with suicidal behavior, mood or behavioral disturbances but that factual data on an association of the drug with suicidal behavior would have \u201cabsolutely\u201d affected his prescribing practices. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 1. Additionally, a sales representative promoted Neurontin for off-label, unapproved uses, to other healthcare providers in the same office practice as Valentine\u2019s psychiatrist. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 122-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">b.Shearer Amended Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Plaintiffs decedent, Hartley Parker Shearer, was a resident of Massachusetts. As prescribed by his physician, Shearer purchased and consumed Neurontin to control the effects of paralysis. (Docket No. 1208 (\u201cShearer Am. Compl.\u201d) at \u00b6 129.) Shearer committed suicide on February 7, 2002. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 3M.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Paresh Desai, a Sales Representative for the defendants, detailed Shearer\u2019s physician, Daniel Sullivan, on March 3, 1995 for uses not approved by the FDA. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 121. The sales representative did not inform Dr. Sullivan of the adverse effects of Neurontin and its association with suicidal behavior. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Defendants\u2019 sales representative also detailed another one of Shearer\u2019s doctors, Dr. Keith Edwards, on multiple occasions. Warner Lambert sponsored and provided funding to Dr. Edwards, and listed him as an investigator for defendants\u2019 research regarding the off-label use of Neurontin in \u201cDouble-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Trial of Gabapentin for the Treatment of Painful Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 120.

Owens Amended Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b146-12\">Joseph Frank Owens, a resident of Alabama, suffered from pain. (Docket No. 1212 (\u201cOwens Am. Compl.\u201d) \u00b6 2.) His physician, Dr. William Crotwell, an orthopaedist, prescribed Neurontin for the treatment of his pain. Owens committed suicide on November 9, 2002. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 33. Plaintiff alleges that Dr. Crotwell was \u201cdirectly influenced to prescribe Neuron-tin\u201d for off-label uses to patients by defendants\u2019 paid consultant Dr. William Shepherd Fleet. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 157-59. In addition, defendants\u2019 sales representative employee or Territory Manager John Sansom detailed Dr. Crotwell on Neuron-tin on approximately two dozen occasions. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 160.

On May 13, 2004, he committed suicide. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 149. Smith\u2019s doctors had prescribed Neurontin for his pain. Plaintiff alleges that the consumption of Neurontin contributed to his injuries and death. <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>\u00b6 150. Pfizer\u2019s sales representative detailed Smith\u2019s prescriber, Paul McCombs, III, M.D., a neurological surgeon, three times on the drug Neurontin. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 130. Sales representatives detailed Smith\u2019s doctors or the doctors in his medical practice on approximately 300 occasions regarding Neurontin. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 131. During those occasions, defendants\u2019 sales representative or \u201cTerritory Manager\u201d promoted unapproved uses for Neurontin to Dr. McCombs, the nurse and the other doctors. Sales representatives detailed Pamela Krancer, an Advanced Practice Nurse who prescribed Neurontin for Smith, on approximately twenty-seven occasions with respect to Neurontin. \u201cDr. McCombs and the members of his practice were not epileptogists or neurologists with patients for whom they would prescribe Neurontin for approved uses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 133. In addition, Pfizer detailed Smith\u2019s orthopedic doctor or the doctors in his practice 69 times. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">III. <em>DISCUSSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">A.

In considering a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), courts must take as true the allegations in the plaintiffs pleadings and must make all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff. <em>Rivera v. Rhode Island, </em>402 F.3d 27, 33 (1st Cir. 2005). Nevertheless, conclusory allegations are not sufficient. <em>Doyle v. Hasbro, </em>103 F.3d 186, 194-95 (1st Cir.1996). \u201cThe court need not accept a plaintiffs assertion that a factual allegation satisfies an element of a claim, however, nor must a court infer from the assertion of a legal conclusion that factual allegations could be made that would justify drawing such a conclusion.\u201d Cord<em>ero-Hernandez v.

The purpose of this requirement is to \u2018give notice to defendants of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, to protect defendants whose reputation may be harmed by meritless claims of fraud, to discourage \u2018strike suits,\u2019 and to prevent the filing of suits that simply hope to uncover relevant information during discovery.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-14\"><em>United States ex rel.

The heightened pleading standard of Rule 9(b) also applies to state law fraud claims that are brought in federal court. <em>Id. </em>at 226 n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-15\">Subject to Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b) pleading particularity requirements, plaintiffs may be allowed to plead fraud claims on information and belief. <em>Id. </em>at 228-229. Plaintiffs may plead upon information and belief where facts of alleged fraud \u201care peculiarly within the perpetrator\u2019s knowledge.\u201d <em>Gublo v.

Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 199-204. They also contend that Pfizer should have disclosed the \u201cmechanism of action\u201d of the drug so that the prescribing physicians could perform a risk-benefit analysis for prescribing Neurontin and monitoring its results. <em>See </em>Woolum Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 254-60. Plaintiffs allege that Pfizer had specific knowledge that Neurontin may contribute to depression and suicidality from clinical studies and trials conducted as part of its New Drug Application in 1992. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 218. Plaintiffs assert their prescribing physicians and they, or their decedents, relied on defendants\u2019 fraudulent misrepresentations which suppressed, omitted, and concealed information about the safety and efficacy of Neurontin. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 261, 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">In multi-district litigation, the court must apply the law of the transferor forum, the law of the state in which the action was filed, including the transferor forum\u2019s choice-of-law rules. <em>See Ferens v. John Deere Co., </em>494 U.S. 516, 523, 110 S.Ct. 1274, 108 L.Ed.2d 443 (1990). The plaintiffs in the pilot cases brought their actions in Florida, Texas, New York, Washington, North Carolina, California, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, and Alabama. Neither party contends that there are material differences in the laws of these states for purposes of resolving this dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">To assert a claim of common law fraud, plaintiffs must allege injury resulting from a justifiable reliance on defendants\u2019 misrepresentation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-10\">One who fraudulently makes a misrepresentation of fact, opinion, intention or law for the purpose of inducing another to act or to refrain from action in reliance upon it, is subject to liability to the other in deceit for pecuniary loss caused to him by his justifiable reliance upon the misrepresentation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-11\"><em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 525 (1977). \u201cAt common law, misrepresentation made for the purpose of inducing reliance by one party upon the false statement is fraudulent.\u201d <em>Chiarella v.

Hacker, </em>83 N.Y.2d 1, 8, 607 N.Y.S.2d 598, 628 N.E.2d 1308, 1311 (N.Y.1993) (\u201cThe manufacturer\u2019s duty is to warn of all potential dangers in its prescription drugs that it knew, or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known to exist ... \u201d); <em>MacDonald v.

R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., </em>397 F.3d 906, 912 (10th Cir.2005) (holding, under Kansas state law, that ethical drug and device manufacturers, such as pharmaceutical companies, \u201cowe a continuing, post-sale duty to warn of product dangers, whereas manufacturers of other products generally owe a duty to warn of product dangers only at the time of sale\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">Pharmaceutical drug consumers who are injured by a manufacturer\u2019s fraudulent misrepresentation or omission may have an actionable claim of fraud under some state laws. <em>See e.g., MacDonald, </em>394 Mass. at 138-39, 475 N.E.2d at 70 (drug manufacturer had duty to provide consumer written warnings). Moreover, a consumer injured by a fraudulent misrepresentation to his doctor has a claim based on third party reliance. \u201c[T]here is no general common-law principle holding that a fraudulent misrepresentation can cause legal injury only to those who rely on it.\u201d <em>Bridge v.

Co., </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 2131, 2143, 170 L.Ed.2d 1012 (2008) (relying on a long line of cases \u201cwhere courts have permitted a plaintiff directly injured by a fraudulent misrepresentation to recover even though it was a third party, and not the plaintiff, who relied on the defendant\u2019s misrepresentation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-12\">Based on the reasoning of this caselaw, the Court concludes that a manufacturer of a pharmaceutical has a duty to disclose to physicians and patients material facts about the risks of the drug, particularly when it is engaged in off-label marketing for uses not approved by the FDA, if it knows that the plaintiff and/or his prescriber does not know or cannot reasonably discover the undisclosed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-13\">C. <em>The Contentions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-14\">Plaintiffs contend that defendants had a duty to disclose that the drug had an association with adverse psyehobiologic effects, such as depression and suicidality.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In their view, Pfizer fraudulently breached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>its duty to disclose in three respects: (1) in its national advertising campaign; (2) in its details to doctors\u2019 offices; and (3) in its labeling and package inserts.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">1. The National Advertising Campaign</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">In seven complaints (Woolum, McGee, Vereillo, Pursey, Roberson, Bentley, Dixon), plaintiffs fail to allege the connection, if any, between the physician\u2019s decision to use Neurontin as a treatment for an off-label use with the extensive marketing or advertising campaigns alleged in the common allegations section (i.e., the conferences, consulting fees, publications).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> For instance, these seven plaintiffs do not claim that their prescribing physicians attended a conference where off-label uses were discussed, were detailed by defendants\u2019 sales representatives, or read a scientific article that influenced their prescription of the drug. Despite the opportunity for discovery, no doctor in these seven complaints testified she heard any misrepresentations from the Pfizer sales team or Dr. Clarey on NPR.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">In an attempt to salvage these claims, plaintiffs argue that defendants\u2019 off-label marketing efforts were so pervasive that even doctors who were not contacted directly by defendants were influenced in their prescription habits by the marketing campaign\u2019s misrepresentations about Neurontin\u2019s safety and effectiveness for off-label uses. They state, \u201cThe inability to prove that Warner-Lambert or Pfizer contacted a doctor directly does not mean that that doctor was not influenced by Warner-Lambert and Pfizer marketing efforts.\u201d Woolum Am. Compl. \u00b6 235. Plaintiffs allege that any doctor who prescribed Neurontin, even without direct contact with defendants was \u201cmost likely influenced\u201d in her prescribing habits by a doctor who was in contact with defendants: \u201cDoctors work in an environment where informal communications among fellow doctors, or \u2018word-of-mouth,\u2019 play an important role in the dissemination of information about drugs and treatments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">Defendants contend that in making this argument, the plaintiffs are essentially advocating a \u201cfraud on the market theory\u201d as a proxy for the proof of actual reliance required under common law. In securities fraud litigation, the fraud on the market theory creates \u201ca rebuttable presumption of reliance\u201d because an \u201cinvestor who buys or sells stock at the price set by the market does so in reliance on the integrity of that price.\u201d <em>Basic Inc. v. Levinson, </em>485 U.S. 224, 249, 247, 108 S.Ct. 978, 99 L.Ed.2d 194 (1988). The Supreme Court reasoned that the rebuttable presumption is also \u201csupported by common sense and probability\u201d because \u201cempirical studies have tended to confirm Congress\u2019 premise that the market price of shares traded on well-developed markets reflects all publicly available information, and, hence, any material misrepresentations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 246, 108 S.Ct. 978.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">However, \u201cno court has ever adopted a \u2018fraud on the market\u2019 type theory outside the securities fraud context, and the majority of courts which have had occasion to extend the theory to common law fraud cases have expressly declined to do so.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Danek Med., Inc., </em>43 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>F.Supp.2d 629, 635 n. 4 (S.D.Miss.1998); <em>see also In re Ford Motor Co. Vehicle Paint Litig., </em>182 F.R.D. 214, 221 (E.D.La. 1998) (\u201c[T]he vast majority of states have never adopted a rule allowing reliance to be presumed in common law fraud cases, and some states have expressly rejected such a proposition\u201d). In <em>McLaughlin v. American Tobacco Co., </em>522 F.3d 215, 223 (2d Cir.2008), the Second Circuit recently rejected a similar argument that defendants\u2019 marketing campaign created a rebuttable presumption that class members purchased defendants\u2019 cigarette products in reliance on misrepresentations in the campaign. It held that the court could not assume that the cigarette market \u201cinternalized the misrepresentation to such an extent that all plaintiffs can be said to have relied on it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 224. <em>See also Chudasama v. Mazda Motor Corp., </em>123 F.3d 1353, 1369, n. 39 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201cThe fraud on the market theory of securities law, however, is based on concepts and policies that simply do not apply in a products liability case.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\">Undoubtedly, word-of-mouth plays an important role in the dissemination of drug information. Notwithstanding the alleged pervasive promotions, the prescription drug industry is too dissimilar from the securities market to support applying a \u201cfraud on the market\u201d theory to establish a rebuttable presumption that physicians relied on a national drug marketing campaign. <em>See Prohias v. Pfizer, Inc., </em>485 F.Supp.2d 1329, 1337 (S.D.Fla.2007) (\u201c[T]here is no prescription drug \u2018market\u2019 at least as that term is understood in the securities context\u201d). Accordingly, the Court allows the motion to dismiss all fraud claims alleging affirmative misrepresentations or a suppression of information as part of a national marketing campaign because there is no allegation of reliance on specific statements or misrepresentations.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">2. Details, Details</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">A different question arises with respect to those complaints where plaintiffs allege that Pfizer actively detailed the doctors or the doctors\u2019 offices. The Valentine complaint alleges that on multiple occasions, the sales representative promoted Neurontin as \u201cgood\u201d for off-label uses. (Docket No. 1205 at \u00b6 127.) This complaint meets the strictures of Rule 9(b) by alleging the affirmative misrepresentation with particularity. None of the remaining complaints, however, contain comparable allegations of specific affirmative misrepresentations made by sales representatives to prescribing physicians upon which the doctors relied. Since plaintiffs had the opportunity to conduct discovery, amended complaint allegations about affirmative misrepresentations based solely on information and belief are inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Raising a theory of fraudulent suppression, plaintiffs respond that defendants had a duty to disclose the depressive and suicidal side effects of Neurontin when they knew that over 90 percent of the use would be off-label. Plaintiffs\u2019 argument is persuasive. Not only did the sales people allegedly detail the offices and provide samples without disclosure of the risks, but defendants allegedly failed to disclose the risks of its drugs in the product labeling itself. <em>See e.g., </em>Woolum Am. Comp, at \u00b6 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">Pfizer argues that the fraudulent concealment claims should be dismissed as duplicative of plaintiffs\u2019 failure to warn claims. They argue that the only \u201cduty to disclose\u201d alluded to by the amended complaints is \u201cthe duty of a manufacturer to warn of a non-obvious risk associated with the normal use of its product about which the manufacturer knows or has reason to know \u2014 i.e., the same duty that underpins <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>plaintiffs strict liability claims.\u201d (Docket No. 1233 at 6 n. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Under some state laws, claims based on a manufacturer\u2019s failure to warn may be brought as either strict liability or negligence actions, or both. <em>Anderson v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., </em>53 Cal.3d 987, 1003, 281 Cal.Rptr. 528, 810 P.2d 549, 559 (1991) (manufacturer may escape negligence liability if it reasonably decided risk of harm was such as to not require a warning but may be strictly liable if it \u201cfailed to give warning of dangers that were known to the scientific community at the time it manufactured or distributed the product\u201d); <em>Bukowski v. CooperVision Inc., </em>185 A.D.2d 31, 33, 592 N.Y.S.2d 807, 808 (N.Y.A.D.3d 1993)(\u201cIt is well settled that a plaintiff may recover in strict products liability or negligence for a manufacturer\u2019s failure to warn of the risks and dangers associated with the use of its product\u201d). In other states, failure to warn claims based on pharmaceutical drugs may only be brought as negligence actions. <em>See Hahn v. Richter, </em>543 Pa. 558, 563, 673 A.2d 888, 891 (1996) (\u201c[W]here the adequacy of warnings associated with prescription drugs is at issue, the failure of the manufacturer to exercise reasonable care to warn of dangers, i.e., the manufacturer\u2019s negligence, is the only recognized basis of liability.\u201d) <em>See generally </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 388 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">In contrast to failure to warn claims, though, claims based on a fraudulent concealment or misrepresentation require scienter. A fraud claim generally requires plaintiff to establish that defendant made a false representation which was knowingly \u201cfalse or was recklessly indifferent to its truth or falsity,\u201d with the intention to defraud, upon which plaintiff justifiably relied and incurred damages. <em>Pinney v. Nokia, Inc., </em>402 F.3d 430, 444 (4th Cir.2005). \u201cConcealment of a material fact, with intent to deceive, satisfies the false representation element of fraud.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">It is true that in some circumstances and under some state laws, courts have concluded that \u201cfailure to warn\u201d and fraudulent concealment claims are duplicative. <em>See e.g., Waterhouse v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., </em>270 F.Supp.2d 678, 684-85 (D.Md.2003) (holding the plaintiffs claim for fraudulent concealment was \u201cin large part nothing more than a failure-to-warn claim in different dress\u201d and dismissing it as duplicative); <em>Hamner v. BMY Combat Sys., </em>869 F.Supp. 888, 893 (D.Kan.l994)(dismissing plaintiffs fraudulent concealment theory, the basis of which is \u201cproperly stated as a claim for a breach of defendants\u2019 duty to warn\u201d); <em>Spangler v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>759 F.Supp. 1337, 1338 (S.D.Ind.1991) (holding fraudulent concealment and failure to warn claims are duplicative where plaintiff alleges drug manufacturer fraudulently misrepresented that smoking cessation drug was safe and fraudulently concealed knowledge of the drug\u2019s dangers); <em>Kline v. Pfizer, Inc., </em>No. 08-3238, 2009 WL 32477, at *4 (E.D.Pa. Jan. 6, 2009) (\u201cvery crux of [fraudulent concealment] claims rests on a failure to warn theory of liability\u201d). Nonetheless, other courts have concluded that the claims were not duplicative. <em>See e.g., Burton v. RJ Reynolds Tobacco Co., </em>916 F.Supp. 1102, 1104-05 (D.Kan.1996) (distinguishing <em>Hamner, </em>and holding that a fraudulent concealment claim is not duplicative where defendants allegedly withheld medical and scientific data indicating product hazards from the public by concealing the information from the medical community and consumers). The caselaw does not always draw clear lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">In the circumstances of this case, plaintiffs allege the elements necessary to establish a claim of fraudulent concealment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>namely that defendants intentionally withheld material information about the side effects of Neurontin from both consumers and their prescribing physicians, with the intent to deceive.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">For the above reasons, the motions to dismiss the fraudulent concealment claims ar <em>&amp; DENIED.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">IV. <em>ORDER</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The motions to dismiss the fraud claims are <em>ALLOWED </em>with respect to all claims of affirmative fraudulent misrepresentations with the exception of claim of fraud in the Valentine Complaint. The motions to dismiss the fraudulent concealment claims are <em>DENIED </em>in all the complaints except to the extent they are premised on the claim of fraudulent omissions in the national advertising and marketing campaign.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b141-12\">.
