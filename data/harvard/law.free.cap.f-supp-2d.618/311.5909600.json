CONNER, Senior District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Plaintiffs Peter T. Loftin, Norman H. Hunter and Joseph Coughlin (\u201cplaintiffs\u201d) bring this class action raising claims under the federal securities laws against Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. f/k/a Salomon Smith Barney, Inc. (\u201cCitigroup\u201d) and individual defendants,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> namely, Andres Bande, Edward McCormack, Daniel Petri, Edward McQuaid, Philip Seskin and Dr. Lim Lek Suan (collectively, the \u201cindividual defendants,\u201d and together with Citigroup, \u201cdefendants\u201d) in connection with plaintiffs\u2019 purchase of common stock of Flag Telecom Holdings, Ltd. (\u201cFlag\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiffs allege that the registration statement and prospectus filed in connection with the IPO contained materially false and misleading information in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the \u201c'33 Act\u201d or the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) and that, subsequent to the IPO, defendants made materially false and misleading statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>regarding Flag\u2019s financial condition, thereby causing Flag securities to trade at artificially inflated prices in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201c'34 Act\u201d or the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Defendants now move for summary judgment on the claims asserted under \u00a7\u00a7 11, 12 and 15 of the Securities Act. For the reasons set forth below, defendants\u2019 motion is denied in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The facts of this case are set forth extensively in our previous opinions, familiarity with which is presumed. <em>See Flag I; Flag II; </em>the <em>Class Certification Decision; </em>and <em>Flag III. </em>The instant motion for summary judgment raises the issue of whether disclosure in the registration statement regarding Flag\u2019s \u201cpresales\u201d gave rise to material misrepresentations or omissions in violation of the Securities Act. Accordingly, we recite only the facts relevant to our resolution of this issue and background facts that may be helpful in providing context.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Flag offered its shares to the general public in the IPO, pursuant to a registration statement (the \u201cRegistration Statement\u201d) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), which became effective on February 11, 2000, and a prospectus (the \u201cProspectus\u201d) describing the offering. (Defs. R. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">Among other things, the Prospectus disclosed that Flag was in the process of expanding its network, which included a fiberoptic connection between London and Paris, through construction of the Flag-Atlantic 1 cable system (the \u201cFA-1 System\u201d) to reach across the Atlantic Ocean. <em>Flag I, </em>308 F.Supp.2d at 253. The estimated construction cost for the FA-1 System was $1.1 billion and the Prospectus disclosed that Flag intended to finance this cost through $600 million in bank financing, $100 million in capital contributions from existing shareholders and presales in excess of $750 million. (Defs. R. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 12-13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">About two years after the IPO, on February 13, 2002, Flag issued a press release announcing its financial results for the fiscal year 2001. <em>Flag II, </em>352 F.Supp.2d at 442. The press release disclosed that Flag was \u201creviewing [its] business in the light of deteriorating market conditions\u201d and that, unless sufficient funds were raised, \u201cat some point in 2003 [Flag] will not have sufficient liquidity to continue [its] operations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Flag indicated that, given then-existing market conditions, it would be unlikely that Flag would raise the needed funds. <em>Id. </em>Subsequent to this announcement, Flag\u2019s stock price fell 46% to $0.36 per share. <em>Id. </em>Flag filed a petition for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1110, <em>et </em>seg.) (\u201cChapter 11\u201d) on April 12, 2002. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">I. <em>Flag\u2019s Relationship with GTS and the Formation ofFAL</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">GTS TransAtlantic Holdings Limited (\u201cGTS\u201d) was a pan-European provider of broadband, internet, data and voice services to high-usage customers. (Defs. R. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 17.) In September 1998, GTS committed to purchase $200 million of capacity on the FA-1 System. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 18 (citing McCormack Deck, Ex. 1).) At some point after that commitment, GTS and Flag discussed an equity investment by GTS in the FA-1 System. (Pis. R. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 19 (citing McCormack Deck, Ex. 2).) Pursuant to a Shareholders Agreement dated November 27, 1998 (as subsequently amended and restated, the \u201cFAL Shareholders Agreement\u201d), GTS and Flag <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>became equity partners in FLAG Atlantic Limited (\u201cFAL\u201d), which was a joint venture formed for the purpose of constructing the FA1 System. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20-21; Defs. R. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">II. <em>FAL\u2019s Relationship with Alcatel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">FAL entered into a construction contract on January 12, 1999 with Alcatel Submarines Network (\u201cAlcatel\u201d) for the construction of the sub-sea portion of the FA-1 System. (Defs. R. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 27.) Under the terms of the construction contract, FAL was to pay Alcatel $646 million. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 29.) Pursuant to a subsequent revision of the construction contract in September of 1999, the parties increased the price to $747 million. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 30-32.) Under the revised construction contract, Alcatel undertook to begin construction of the sub-sea portion of the project by March 31, 2001 and to have the system fully operational by June 30,2001. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 33.)</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">III. <em>The Barclays Credit Agreement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">On October 8, 1999, FAL entered into a credit agreement with Barclays Bank pic (\u201cBarclays\u201d) that provided a credit facility consisting of $575 million in construction loans and $25 million in \u201crevolving loans\u201d for the funding of the construction of the FA-1 System (the \u201cBarclays Credit Agreement\u201d). <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 34.) A copy of the Barclays Credit Agreement was appended to the Registration Statement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Defs. R. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 35.) \u201cThe credit facility was provided subject to a commitment by each of [Flag] and GTS to provide a $100 million capital contribution no later than October 31, 2000, and a commitment by [Flag] and GTS to purchase or arrange for the purchase of $300 million in FA-1 capacity on a presale basis.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 37.) Pursuant to the Barclays Credit Agreement, the required $300 million in presales consisted of a $200 million presale commitment from GTS and a $100 million presale commitment from, or arranged by, Flag. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 38.)</p>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">The Barclays Credit Agreement made it possible for Flag to achieve \u201cfinancial closure\u201d; defendants define \u201cfinancial closure\u201d as \u201cconfirmation that all the financing necessary to build the FA-1 was legally committed.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 39.) Flag designated a \u201cdate certain\u201d by which pre-conditions to financial closure, including required capital contributions and presales, must be complete. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b640-41.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendants contend that customers were reluctant to enter into presale agreements before it was certain that the preconditions to financial closure would be satisfied and that project funding for the FA-1 System would be provided. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 42.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-13\">\n<em>IV.Presales of FA-1 Capacity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b355-14\">The Prospectus included a section titled \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources,\u201d which disclosed that \u201c[FAL] has financed the $1.1 billion in construction costs for the [FA-1 System] through a $600 million bank financing, $100 million in capital contributions from each of its shareholders and presales in excess of $750 million.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>(Pis. R. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 13.) The Prospectus also included a section titled \u201cEmploying a Flexible and Comprehensive Finance Plan,\u201d which contained the statement that \u201c[Flag] also [is] financing the construction of [the FA-1 System] on a project finance basis, in collaboration with our joint venture partner, through borrowings under [FAL]\u2019s existing credit facility, equity contributions to be made by us and our joint venture partner and advance capacity sales, in excess of $750 million ... which have already [been] committed.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 14.) These statements concerning FAL\u2019s presales form the basis of plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that the Prospectus and Registration Statement contained materially misleading statements and material omissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">As of December 31, 1999, FAL had entered into nine presale agreements. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 43.) Defendants describe the presales as the selling of \u201clarge tranches, of capacity on the [FA-1 System] to companies that knew they would need substantial capacity and [Flag] gave them price discounts ... in return for making a commitment before the cable had been built.\u201d (Defs. R. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 44 (citing Fortinsky Deck, Ex. 20 at 35).) The total value of the presales was approximately $774 million. (Fortinsky Deck, Ex. 20 at 153.)</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">A. <em>Presales with Related Entities</em></p>\n<p id=\"AZH\">1. <em>GTS Presale Contract</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Pursuant to the FAL Shareholders Agreement, GTS was obligated to make a presale purchase of capacity on the FA-1 System \u201cat cost, for an.aggregate amount of US$200 million.\u201d (Defs. R. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 23-24; Pis. R. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 23.) On October 8, 1999, GTS purchased capacity on the FA-1 System in accordance with its obligation under the FAL Shareholders Agreement. (Defs. R. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 46-47.) A copy of the GTS presale capacity purchase agreement was appended to the Barclay\u2019s Credit Agreement, a copy of which was appended to the Registration Statement. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 47-48.) On October 13, 1999, Flag and GTS issued a joint press release regarding the GTS presale capacity purchase agreement and GTS stated in its 1999 10-K annual report that the supply of capacity from the FA-1 System would allow it to \u201caccommodate the growing volume of transatlantic traffic at a competitive low cost base.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 49-51.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In January 2000, Gerard Caccappolo of GTS stated in a news article that GTS \u201cthink[s] [the FA-1 System] is hopefully sufficient to carry us through that period until the next cable comes out.\u201d (Defs. R. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 52.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">In October 2000, Flag purchased GTS\u2019s shares in FAL and GTS agreed to maintain its commitment to purchase capacity on the FA-1 System under the terms of the presale capacity purchase agreement. (Pis. R. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 53.) Defendants contend that, between November 1999 and July 2001, GTS made payments under the presale capacity purchase agreement totaling $200 million and that, as of March 28, 2002, GTS was utilizing capacity that it had purchased under this agreement. (Defs. R. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 54-55.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>2. <em>Bell Atlantic Presale Contract</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">The Registration Statement disclosed that, just before the IPO, Bell Atlantic Corporation (along with its affiliates or its successor, Verizon Global Solutions, as applicable, \u201cBell Atlantic\u201d) was a 37 percent shareholder in Flag. (Defs. R. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 62.) On February 8, 1999 and August 4, 1999, Bell Atlantic contracted with Flag (the \u201cAugust Bell Atlantic Agreement\u201d) for the purchase of $15 million of capacity on the FA-1 System, with a first installment payment of $5.5 million to occur on January 31, 2000. (Pis. R. 56.1 \u00b6 63; Defs. R. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 64-65.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Defendants aver that the $5.5 million installment payment under the August Bell Atlantic Agreement was intended for use as security for Flag\u2019s obligations under the Barclays Credit Agreement. (Defs. R. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 66, (citing McCormack Deck, Ex. 29 <em>and </em>Fortinsky Deck, Ex. 18 at 44-46).)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, Bell Atlantic never paid the $5.5 million first installment because the August Bell Atlantic Agreement was terminated at financial closure on October 8, 1999, in accordance with its terms. (Defs. R. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 67.)</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">On October 7, 1999, Bell Atlantic entered into a new agreement to purchase $15 million of FA-1 System capacity from FAL (the \u201cOctober Bell Atlantic Agreement\u201d). <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 68.) The Registration Statement disclosed that \u201cBell Atlantic has agreed to purchase $15 million of capacity on the [FA-1 System] under a Capacity Purchase Agreement\u201d and a copy of the October Bell Atlantic Agreement was appended to the Registration Statement. (Pls. R. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 69.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Defendants aver that Bell Atlantic (through its successor, Verizon) made payments totaling $15,019,703.10 between November 1999 and August 2001. (Defs. R. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 70.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">Until December 22, 1999, Bell Atlantic was prohibited, under \u00a7 271 of the Communications Act, from providing or marketing long distance telecommunications services originating in a state in which Bell Atlantic was an incumbent provider of local telephone service until the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) approved its application to provide such services. (Pls. R. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 71 (citing Fortinsky Deck, Ex. 15 at 55).) Defendants aver that Bell Atlantic had anticipated that the FCC would grant approval for Bell Atlantic to provide long distance services and, accordingly, purchased capacity on the FA-1 System prior to FCC approval. (Defs. R. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 73.) Plaintiffs dispute the fact that the FCC\u2019s approval was \u201canticipated\u201d by Bell Atlantic. (Pls. R. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 73, 76.) On December 22, 1999, Bell Atlantic obtained the necessary regulatory approval from the FCC and began providing long distance services originating in New York beginning January 5, 2000. (Defs. R. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 76-77.) Invoices from Flag to Bell Atlantic reflect that Bell Atlantic activated the purchased capacity between June of 2001 and February of 2002. (Defs. R. 56.1 Stmt. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>\u00b6 78 (citing McCormack Deck, Ex. 20).)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A_Q\">3. <em>GTE Presale Contract</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">On October 8, 1999, GTE Global Networks Incorporated (\u201cGTE\u201d) entered into an agreement to purchase $7.5 million of capacity on the FA-1 System. (Defs. R. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 56.) The Registration Statement disclosed this agreement. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 57.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Registration Statement also disclosed that Bell Atlantic and GTE entered into an \u201cAgreement\u201d and \u201cPlan of Merger\u201d on June 27, 1998. (Defs. R. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 59.) Defendants aver that GTE (through its successor) made payments to FAL totaling $7.5 million between December 1999 and November 2001, pursuant to the FA-1 capacity purchase agreement. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 60-61.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">4. <em>Alcatel Presale Contract</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">On October 8, 1999, Alcatel entered into an agreement with FAL (the \u201cAlcatel Agreement\u201d) whereby Alcatel committed to purchase $50 million of capacity on the FA-1 System. (Defs. R. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 99.)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Alcatel Agreement provided that Alcatel\u2019s $50 million commitment would be reduced by the amount of any cash that FAL received from capacity sales made after October 8, 1999 and the amount of any capacity commitments made after October 8, 1999 by creditworthy purchasers. (Defs. R. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 100.)</p>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">On October 26, 1999, Alcatel\u2019s commitment under the Alcatel Agreement was reduced by $7.5 million to $42.5 million and on January 11, 2000, Alcatel\u2019s commitment under the Alcatel Agreement was reduced to zero. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 101-02.) Defendants aver that the Alcatel commitment was not counted in the \u201cpresales in excess of $750 million\u201d disclosed in the Prospectus. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 103.)</p>\n<p id=\"b358-13\">B. <em>Other Presales</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-14\">On November 17, 1999, PSINetworks Company (\u201cPSINet\u201d) entered into an agreement to purchase $274.8 million of capacity on the FA-1 System. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 79.) Defendants aver that PSINet made payments totaling $139,140,000 pursuant to its capacity purchases between October 8, 1999 and March 20, 2001. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b680.)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> PSINet filed a petition for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 on May 31, 2001.

In deciding whether summary judgment is appropriate, the court resolves all ambiguities and draws all permissible factual inferences against the movant. <em>See Anderson, </em>477 U.S. at 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505. To defeat summary judgment, the nonmovant must go beyond the pleadings and \u201cdo more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\u201d <em>Matsushita Elec.

Nevertheless, as one court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-4\">[Sjummary judgment must be granted against a party in instances when such party fails to adequately establish an essential element on which it bears the burden of proof....

A claim under this section may be asserted against every person who signed the registration statement, the directors of the issuer and the underwriters of the securities. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77k(a). The test for determining whether the prospectus contained a material misstatement or omission is \u201cwhether the defendants\u2019 representations [in the prospectus], taken together and in context, would have misled a reasonable investor.\u201d <em>Olkey v. Hyperion 1999 Term Trust, Inc., </em>98 F.3d 2, 5 (2d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">A. <em>Materiality of the Presales</em></p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Our preliminary inquiry is whether the allegedly untrue, misleading or omitted statements in the Prospectus and Registration Statement were material. Materiality is found where there is a \u201csubstantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.\u201d <em>Caiola v. Citibank, NA, </em>295 F.3d 312, 329 (2d Cir.2002), quoting <em>Basic, Inc. v. Levinson, </em>485 U.S. 224, 231-32, 108 S.Ct. 978, 99 L.Ed.2d 194 (1988) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cMateriality is a mixed question of law and fact,\u201d and only if an omission or misstatement is \u201cso obviously important or unimportant to a reasonable investor that reasonable minds cannot differ on the question of materiality is the issue appropriately resolved as a matter of law by summary judgment.\u201d <em>In re Alliance Pharm. Corp. Sec. Litig., </em>279 F.Supp.2d 171, 188 (S.D.N.Y.2003), quoting <em>TSC Indus., Inc. v. Northway, Inc,, </em>426 U.S. 438, 450, 96 S.Ct. 2126, 48 L.Ed.2d 757 (1976) (internal quotation marks omitted). .</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">Plaintiffs aver that the challenged statements,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and alleged omissions related thereto, were material because they implied profitability and demand for the FA-1 System, implications that were important to a reasonable investor.. Defendants counter that the disclosures were not material because they could not have been interpreted by a reasonable investor as indications of profitability or demand as, contextually, such disclosures related to the securing of project financing and appeared in sections titled, \u201cEmploying a Flexible and Comprehensive Financing Plan\u201d and \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d Yet Evans, former Vice President of Strategy and Marketing at Flag, testified that Flag used presales not only to reduce the \u201cfinancial risk of the project,\u201d but also to \u201cvalidate[ ] demand.\u201d (Fortinsky Deck, Ex. 20 (Evans Dep.) at 35.) Whether a reasonable investor could have gleaned Evans\u2019s insight with respect to the use of presales by reading the Prospectus and Registration Statement is not a question with so obvious an answer that we can resolve it as a matter of law. Therefore, this Court leaves open the possibility that a reasonable investor could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>have understood presales to reflect market demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Market demand is material to a reasonable investor. <em>See In re Alstom, SA Sec. Litig., </em>406 F.Supp.2d 433, 453-54 (S.D.N.Y.2005). Consequently, a reasonable investor who believed that presales reflected market demand for the FA-1 System would have found presales, and the extent to which they were an accurate reflection of market demand, to be material to his or her investment. <em>See, e.g., Castellano v. Young &amp; Rubicam, Inc., </em>257 F.3d 171, 180 (2d Cir.2001). In other words, facts regarding the circumstances underlying the presales could \u201csignificantly alter[ ] the total mix of information available,\u201d thereby rendering those facts material. <em>Caiola, </em>295 F.3d at 329 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). At the very least, the materiality of the presales is not \u201cso obviously ... unimportant to a reasonable investor that reasonable minds cannot differ.\u201d <em>In re Alliance Pharm., </em>279 F.Supp.2d at 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">1. <em>\u201cBespeaks Caution\u201d Doctrine</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ai0\">Under the \u201cBespeaks Caution\u201d doctrine, \u201c[c]ertain alleged misrepresentations in a stock offering are immaterial as a matter of law because it cannot be said that any reasonable investor could consider them important in light of adequate cautionary language set out in the same offering.\u201d <em>Halperin v. eBanker USA.com, Inc., </em>295 F.3d 352, 357 (2d Cir.2002); <em>DeMaria v. Andersen, </em>318 F.3d 170, 182 (2d Cir.2003); <em>Miller v. Lazard, Ltd., </em>473 F.Supp.2d 571, 579 (S.D.N.Y.2007). The cautionary language must be specific, prominent and must directly address the risk that plaintiffs claim was not disclosed. <em>Olkey, </em>98 F.3d at 5-6. The requirement that the cautionary language match the specific risk is particularly important, considering that most, if not all security offerings contain cautionary language. <em>Miller, </em>473 F.Supp.2d at 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">Defendants aver that the \u201crisk factors disclosed in the Registration Statement\u201d and the \u201cexplicit[ ] discuss[ion][of] competition faced by [Flag] in the trans-Atlantic services market covered by the FA-1 cable\u201d warrant a grant of summary judgment in their favor. (Defs. Mem. Supp. Partial Summ. J. at <em>29-31.)</em><footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark><em> </em>However, the risk that plaintiffs claim was not disclosed is not merely competition for demand, but rather the risk that the presales were inadequate measures of demand. Because \u201cpresales\u201d appear nowhere in the cautionary language, this Court cannot rule as a matter of law that the cautionary language in the Prospectus and Registration Statement was sufficient to inform investors of the risks of relying on presales as a measure of demand. <em>See Hunt v. Alliance N. Am. Gov\u2019t Income Trust, Inc., </em>159 F.3d 723, 729 (2d Cir.1998) (\u201cThe cautionary language ... must relate directly to that by which plaintiffs claim to have been misled.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">B. <em>Untrue Statements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">In highly distilled form, defendants argue that this Court should grant their motion for summary judgment in full because \u201cthe evidence shows that Flag had approximately $774 million in FA-1 presales at the time the Registration Statement became effective\u201d (Defs. Mem. Supp. Partial Summ. J. at 5) and, therefore, the statements regarding presales in the Pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>spectus and Registration Statement were not untrue.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The Court declines to decide the truth or untruth of the statements regarding presales because, even assuming that the presales were supported by valid and binding contracts in the amount stated in the Prospectus, this would not preclude a finding by a trier of fact that those presales were disclosed to investors in a materially misleading way. <em>See, e.g., Halperin, </em>295 F.3d at 357 (\u201c[t]he touchstone of the inquiry is not whether isolated statements within a document were true, but whether defendants\u2019 representations or omissions ... [would] mislead a reasonable investor\u201d); <em>McMahan &amp; Co. v. Wherehouse Entm\u2019t Inc., </em>900 F.2d 576, 579 (2d Cir. 1990) (\u201cdisclosure required by the securities laws is measured not by literal truth, but by the ability of the material to accurately inform rather than mislead prospective buyers\u201d). The Court, having established that the presale statements need not be factually untrue to be materially misleading, and, therefore, the truth of the statements is not outcome-determinative, turns now to the question of whether a reasonable investor could have been misled by the presale statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">C. <em>Misleading Statements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">Assuming, without deciding, that the statements regarding presales were factually true, they may nevertheless be misleading. On page 42 of the Prospectus, defendants stated that \u201c[w]e also are financing the construction of the [FA-1] on a project finance basis, in collaboration with our joint venture partner, through borrowings under [FAL\u2019s] existing credit facility, equity contributions to be made by us and our joint venture partner <em>and </em>advance capacity sales, in excess of $750 million of which have already been committed.\u201d (Fortinsky Deck, Ex. 15 at 42) (emphasis added.) This language appears to separate \u201cadvance capacity sales, in excess of $750 million\u201d from \u201cequity contributions ... by us and our joint venture partner.\u201d However, it appears from the record that the $750 million in presales may have <em>included </em>$200 million from GTS, in which case the contributions from Flag\u2019s joint venture partner would not be a distinct source of financing from the presales and should not be separated from presales <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>in the Prospectus. <em>(See </em>Defs. Mem. Supp. Partial Summ. J. at 15, noting that GTS, Flag\u2019s joint venture partner, purchased presale capacity of $200 million.) A finder of fact may determine that the- wording of this statement is materially misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Similarly, the statement regarding presales found on page 34 of the Prospectus could, by its wording, be misleading to a reasonable investor. (Fortinsky Deck, Ex. 15 at 34.) There, defendants stated that \u201c[Flag] has financed the $1.1 billion in construction costs for the [FA-1] through a $600 million bank financing, $100 million in capital contributions from each of its shareholders and presales in excess of $750 million.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This statement appears to list three <em>separate </em>sources of financing: (1) \u201cbank financing;\u201d (2) \u201ccapital contributions from shareholders;\u201d and (3) \u201cpresales.\u201d However, it is clear, based on the record, that these were not three distinct sources, but rather were interrelated sources. Indeed, defendants admit that the \u201cpresales were used to finance the construction of the FA-1 cable <em>and </em>that the bank financing was contingent on obtaining $300 million in presales of capacity.\u201d (Defs. Mem. Supp. Partial Summ. J. at 32 (emphasis in original).) While defendants contend that the Prospectus was clear in its disclosure on these points, a reasonable investor may disagree. This Court cannot substitute its own reasoning for that of a jury and hold, as a matter of law, that this wording was not misleading to a reasonable investor.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">D. <em>Omissions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The Court, having established earlier in this Opinion that a reasonable investor could have considered the - circumstances underlying the presales to be material, turns now to the question of whether defendants adequately disclosed those circumstances in the Prospectus and Registration Statement. It is well settled that the principle of <em>caveat emptor </em>does not apply to a public offering of stock and, therefore, investors need not cobble together information from various parts of the Registration Statement to uncover material information. <em>Cent. Bank of Denver, N.A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N.A., </em>511 U.S. 164, 171, 114 S.Ct. 1439, 128 L.Ed.2d 119 (1994); <em>United Paperworkers Int\u2019l Union v. Int\u2019l Paper Co., </em>985 F.2d 1190, 1199 (2d Cir.1993); <em>Kennedy v. Tallant, </em>710 F.2d 711, 720 (11th Cir.1983) (\u201cFull and fair disclosure cannot be achieved through piecemeal release of subsidiary facts which[,] if stated together!,] might provide a sufficient statement of the ultimate fact.\u201d) (alteration added).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Defendants direct the Court to various portions of the Prospectus and Registration Statement, including its exhibits and amendments, that disclose Flag\u2019s relationships with GTS and Bell Atlantic, that the Barclays Credit Agreement was conditioned on a GTS presale and that some of the presales were made \u201cat cost.\u201d (Defs. Mem. Supp. Partial Summ. J. at 33-34 (citing Registration Statement, Amendments 3, 4, Annex 6 and Ex. 10.4).) However, such disclosures should have appeared, but did not appear, in several key sections of the Prospectus or in sections of the Prospectus that contained statements regarding presales. Specifically, pages 34 and 42 of the Prospectus contain statements regarding presales and there is no disclosure in close proximity to those pages regarding the material facts surrounding those presales. Further, page 63 of the Prospectus contains a section entitled \u201cCertain Transactions,\u201d which discusses \u201cvarious agreements between [Flag\u2019s] subsidiaries and [Flag\u2019s] shareholders (or their affiliates) for the development, construction, operation, financing and marketing of [FA-1].\u201d There is no reference in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>that section to the presale agreements with those subsidiaries and shareholders, though a finder of fact may determine that it was misleading to omit such information. <em>See In re Alstom, </em>406 F.Supp.2d at 453 (\u201caffirmative statements regarding [defendant\u2019s] robust [ ] sales ... indicated strong demand ... without disclosing that this demand was in fact bolstered by [defendant\u2019s] own financing ... [and this] omission ... created an impression of a state of affairs that differed in a material way from the one that actually existed\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">To the extent defendants rely on amendments, annexes and exhibits as a means of supplementing those areas so as to fully disclose material facts, such reliance is misplaced. <em>See United Paperworkers, </em>985 F.2d at 1199 (\u201cburied\u201d disclosures are inadequate); <em>see also In re Alstom, </em>406 F.Supp.2d at 453 n. 11 (\u201c[a]n investor should not be called upon to piece together buried information from distinct parts of financial statements\u201d). This Court cannot rule that the scattered disclosures in various amendments, annexes and exhibits to the Prospectus and Registration Statement were sufficient as a matter of law to disclose the material facts to reasonable investors.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Defendants direct the Court to a number of cases in this Circuit that have granted summary judgment for the defendants where the plaintiffs\u2019 claims rely on the defendants\u2019 failure to adequately disclose investment or accounting principles. <em>Olkey, </em>98 F.3d 2; <em>Greenapple v. Detroit Edison Co., </em>618 F.2d 198 (2d Cir.1980); <em>Miller, </em>473 F.Supp.2d 571. Each of these cases, however, is distinguishable from the instant case. In <em>Olkey, </em>the court found that adequate disclosure of investment risk was \u201cpositioned on the second page of each prospectus such that no reasonable investor could miss it\u201d and that \u201cthe juxtaposition of [ ] two sentences creates an unmistakable inference [of the relevant investment risk].\u201d 98 F.3d at 6-7. The dismissal of the claim in <em>Olkey </em>was thus premised on the court\u2019s finding that consecutive disclosures made in a single paragraph adequately disclosed investment risk. The proximity of the cautionary disclosures to the potentially misleading statement is an important factor that distinguishes <em>Olkey </em>from this case. Here the alleged cautionary disclosures are found much farther from the allegedly misleading statements. At issue in <em>Greenapple </em>was the adequacy of the company\u2019s disclosure of its accounting methods in its prospectus. There, the court found that the prospectus\u2019s \u201cinitial explanatory note concisely yet accurately defines ... [and explains the accounting strategy, which] is again called to the reader\u2019s attention in the passage found in the text dealing with [one of the relevant assets].\u201d 618 F.2d at 210. The prominence of the disclosure within the prospectus in <em>Greenapple </em>distinguishes <em>Greenapple </em>from this case. Here, the alleged cautionary disclosures are found not in a place that attracts the reader\u2019s attention, but rather are found in the annexes, amendments and exhibits to the Registration Statement. The court in <em>Miller </em>dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 11 claim for failure to state a claim based on the complaint\u2019s lack of specificity as to the allegedly misleading statements. 473 F.Supp.2d at 586. As we held in <em>Flag III, </em>plaintiffs have sufficiently stated a claim against defendants and, therefore, <em>Miller </em>is not relevant to the current motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Defendants also claim that it would be unreasonable to hold them liable for failing to disclose the underlying facts relevant to the presales because such disclosure would be unnecessarily detailed. We recognize that compliance with the Se<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>curities Act does not require issuers to bury investors \u201cin an avalanche of trivial information,\u201d <em>Basic, Inc., </em>485 U.S. at 231, 108 S.Ct. 978 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), however, \u201c[w]here a company chooses to make a disclosure, it has a duty to make it complete and accurate.\u201d <em>Nanopierce Technologies, Inc. v.

The salient quotes from the Prospectus are: \u201c[Flag] has financed the $1.1 billion in construction costs for the [FA-1] through a $600 million bank financing, $100 million in capital contributions from each of its shareholders and presales in excess of $750 million\u201d and \u201c[w]e also are financing the construction of the [FA-1] on a project finance basis, in collaboration with our joint venture partner, through borrowings under [FAL\u2019s] existing credit facility, equity contributions to be made by us and our joint venture partner and advance capacity sales, in excess of $750 million of which have already been committed.\u201d (Fortinsky Deck, Ex. 15 at 34, 42.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b362-7\">. The risk disclosures to which defendants direct the Court are: (1) \"[w]e believe our key competitors in the trans-Atlantic services market are as follows ...\u201d and (2) \"because our product offerings are expanding and the telecommunications industry is changing significantly, we face competition and pricing pressure from a wide variety of sources....\" (Defs. Mem. Supp. Partial Summ. J. at 29-30 (quoting Amendment 3 at 53, 11).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b363-6\">. In support of this claim, defendants direct the Court to <em>Flag III, </em>wherein we stated that \"if the so-called presales were in fact nothing more than financing facilities,\u201d it would be \"misleading to state that the $750 million figure consists of proceeds from presales of capacity on the FA-1 system.\u201d (Defs. Mem. Supp. Partial Summ. J. at 28, <em>construing Flag III, </em>slip op. at 14 (emphasis omitted).) Defendants assert that Flag's presales were not mere \"financing facilities\u201d and, therefore, the statements regarding those presales were not untrue. <em>Id. </em>In construing our language, defendants presume that we intended \"financing facilities\u201d to mean \"essentially a loan.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 28.) We did not, however, intend our words to be assigned so narrow a definition. Rather, \"financing facilities\u201d may refer to any number of transactions, including those memorialized by valid and binding contracts, to the extent such transactions are employed to facilitate a financial transaction. Moreover, defendants fail to recognize that we did not <em>limit </em>the circumstances under which the disclosure regarding presales could be misleading and we did not state that such disclosure could be misleading <em>only if </em>the presales were mere financing facilities. As we noted in the same paragraph in <em>Flag III </em>as the sentence to which defendants now direct us, \u201cimplicit in the disclosure of presales was a representation as to the buyers\u2019 actual demand for capacity on the system,\u201d <em>Flag III, </em>slip op. at 14, and the potential for that representation to be misleading does not depend on whether the presales were financing facilities. Thus, while plaintiffs and defendants each set forth articulate, extensive and well-reasoned arguments as to whether Flag\u2019s presales were \u201cfinancing facilities\u201d or \"valid and binding contracts,\u201d we find that this issue is not outcome-determinative.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
