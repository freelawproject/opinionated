The plaintiff having obtained a judgment, issued a <em>fi. fa. </em>and a <em>Uberari, </em>which the sheriff returned, that he had given possession of the premises. The plaintiff then brought an action for a false return, and proved that the premises were held, at the date of the return, by a tenant, under a demise for five years from the defendant in the execution, commencing before the date of plaintiff\u2019s judgment. The sheriff did not put plaintiff into actual possession, but gave notice to the tenant to pay him the rent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-13\">Parsons, J., instructed the jury, that actual possession, under the circumstances, could not have been given; and, therefore, the. sheriff should have made a special return of the facts. If, then, the return was not according to the facts, and possession was not delivered, the sheriff was liable.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b143-14\"><em>W.
