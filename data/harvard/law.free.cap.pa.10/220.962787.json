Tyson, by her will, proved in 1845, bequeathed to <em>\u201c </em>my sister, Hannah Tyson, intermarried with Charles Tyson, the interest of the sum of five thousand dollars (now secured, &amp;c.), to be paid to her in equal half-yearly payments, yearly and every year during the term of all her natural life; the said principal sum of $5,000 to be kept at interest on satisfactory security, by my executors, during all said term. And, at the decease of my sister, Hannah Tyson, I give and bequeath the said principal sum of $5,000 to the children of said Hannah Tyson, equally to be divided between them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-6\">\u201c Whereas, my brother-in-law, Charles Tyson, is indebted to me on bond the sum of $3,800, and interest thereon, my will is, in case he shall make no charge or demand against my estate for boarding or services rendered me, then I give and bequeath the said Charles Tyson the said principal debt or sum of $3,800, with interest accrued, and which may accrue thereon, and I direct the said bond shall be cancelled by my executors and delivered him.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-7\">Two questions were made before the auditor: 1. Whether Charles Tyson was entitled to the interest on the legacy? <em>2. </em>Whether he was liable to pay the collateral inheritance tax on the $3,800 b\u00e9queathed to him on condition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-8\">Both these.questions were decided against him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-9\">Pending this appeal, depositions were taken on the part of the appellee, the wife of -Tyson. Her son proved, that, in April, 1847, (subsequent to the date of the report), Tyson left his residence, and -removed all the furniture belonging to him, and that they understood he moved near to Germantown. Since that time, the witness, who resided with the mother, did not know that he had ever been to the house, or contributed towards the support of his wife. She was between sixty and seventy years of age, and was supported by-the exertions of the witness. Before that time, his conduct had -been sometimes kind and sometimes otherwise. In cross-examination,.he stated, that about half the furniture was left in the house belonging to witness\u2019s sister; that he supposed the reason why his mother did- not go with his father to the farm near, Germantown, was, that she was afraid to live with him; and that he did not know that she was even asked to go there to live with him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-10\">The daughter gave the same testimony in substance, and also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>stated that his departure was sudden, and without notice; and that his conduct was rude and unkind most of the time; and that he had driven her from his bed two or three weeks before he left.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-4\">It was also proved, that Tyson had received of his wife\u2019s other property above $8,000 since their marriage. Their youngest child Was twenty-three years old.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-5\">The appellee produced two letters from the appellant. One of these was dated a month after his leaving their residence. They contained nothing hut a request that she would come out and live with him, and a description of his mode of living.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b222-6\">Mellvaine, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQ5\">There are no words creating a separate use \u2014 plain words are necessary to bar the marital right: 4 R. 66. The interposition .of trustees is immaterial: 1 Y. 432. 6 S. &amp; R. 466 is the strongest case, but there it was to her <em>own </em>use, which was relied on there and in the comment on that case in 4 R. 66.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-7\">The alleged desertion, &amp;c., is immaterial \u2014 it occurred after the interest accrued. Nor was there in fact any desertion, but an unlawful refusal by the wife to reside with the husband. No sufficient grounds for this are laid; the cruelty must be such as would sustain her petition for divorce.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-8\">The legacy is not subject to the tax. That is laid on legacies to be paid \u2014 this is but the payment of a debt.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b222-9\"><em>St. Geo. T. Campbell </em>and <em>Todd, </em>contr\u00e1.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJA\">The intent is as plain as in 6 S. &amp; R. 466. Clearly the executors could not retain the interest to make up the deficiency of the husband\u2019s debt, supposing he refused to accept the legacy in satisfaction. The words \u201c to pay it to,\u201d in the creation of a trust, have been held sufficient to make a separate use. But whether so or not, the case is clearly within the equity jurisdiction of this court to compel the husband' to make a settlement: 9 W. 94; for he has received and retained a large estate from his wife, and has refused to maintain her: 2 Stor. Eq. \u00a7\u00a7 1402-8. We refer also to the act of 1848, \u00a7 6, p. 536. Here the husband had no property in the legacy until a reduction into possession (4 R. 468); and that the court may prevent.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b222-10\">Coulter, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aif\">The evidence establishes that Charles Tyson deserted his wife in April, 184T. That previously to that time, he treated her with extreme personal indignity, and stripped the house in which they resided at the time of his desertion, of all furniture, leaving her nothing with which to keep house. That he went to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>places, or a place unknown to her, and has' never made any provision for her support. But she has been maintained by the labour of her son, a youth of about twenty-two, and the assistance of her friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">Under this state of facts, he seeks to recover the interest\u2019 of $5,000, bequeathed to Mrs. Tyson by a relative, during her life, and afterwards over, on the ground of the unity of interest and relation between man and wife, and the consequent dominion he has over her chattels or <em>ehoses in action. </em>It is true that the ancieht power of the baron over the feme, by the rules of the common law, was very great. She was more his slave, or, at least, his servant, than a help-mate for him. The civil or ecclesiastical law was different; perhaps because it originated in a more genial and less obdurate climate. By that law, the wife, even in the rude ages, had individuality of right as to personal goods, and individuality of protection concerning them. And in this respect, the Court of Equity in England adopted, from the ecclesiastical courts, much of the humane and natural doctrine of the civil law. And what equity has obliterated from the rigour of the common law, our law will maintain for the protection of the wife. The truth is, that the hour and the power of the doctrines on which the erring husband leans in this case, have passed away. Every wise administrator of justice must seize the thoughts, habits, and customs of the people as they rise, and adapt principles to the existing state of society. Woman is neither considered nor treated now as she was by our Saxon ancestors before the Norman conquest: and the statute of .1848, referred to in the argument, is pregnant proof of her actual and legal <em>\u201c </em>status\u201d in this commonwealth. She is susceptible of individual injury, suffering, and sorrow, and capable of the most heroic individual devotion, even in trouble, to the object of duty. Why, then, should not the law secure to her individual protection and individual justice, when her husband, who has deserted and wronged her, would take the very means of support and life bestowed upon her by her kindred ?</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Let the husband perform his marital duties, by affording protection, support, and kindness to his wife, according to his means, and then he may hold up his head and claim his marital right, as head of the family, to her <em>ehoses </em>and chattels, just as the law allows.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Neither the courts nor the law will ever disturb the social ties, duties, and relations. It is only when they are sundered, broken, and disregarded, that the law steps in to afford redress to the injured party; and as the Court of Chancery in England will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>enjoin a husband, until he has made provision for his. wife out of her personality (Stor. Eq. \u00a7 1402), so here, the law will not give its aid in assisting him to appropriate her estate, until he has made suitable provision. The case of Krupp <em>v. </em>Scholl, decided at this term, is full up to this-point. I make no remark on the letters written hy Tyson and directed to his wife, with a view, as it would seem, to show that he was willing to provide for her, except this, that they evince a flimsy contrivance, without either sincerity or heart, and are a mere mockery of the duty of a husband. They afford pregnant proof of cold, meditated, and selfish wrong, which, instead of relieving, does hut exacerbate the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\">It was clearly the intent of the testator, from the whole legacy, that it should he for the separate use of the wife, and this places the right of the wife on another ground. Thus the legacy is, to \u201c my sister, Hannah Tyson, intermarried with Charles Tyson, the interest, &amp;c., to he paid to her in- equal half-yearly payments, yearly and every year during her natural life.\u201d Why direct it to he paid to her, half-yearly, if he did- not intend to exclude her husband from control oyer it ? It was to <em>be kept </em>at interest by the executors during her life, for the purpose of making this payment to her. In support of this view, the ease of Jamison <em>v. </em>Brady, 6 S. &amp; R. 466, is referred to. It appears from the evidence, that all Charles Tyson was ever worth, came from the relatives of his wife; and we see enough in the will to satisfy ns that the intent was to give this interest to the wife for her support and use. This court is of opinion that the interest of the $5,000 is payable to Hannah Tyson alone, for her use, and that her receipt will discharge the executors, and the receipt of the husband will not. We are also of opinion that the legacy of $3,800 to Charles Tyson is subject to the collateral inheritance tax.
