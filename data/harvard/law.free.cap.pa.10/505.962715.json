On the 21st May he obtained an award, and issued a <em>fi. fa. </em>Upon this, he moved for the appointment of a sequestrator. The defendant\u2019s wife appeared to the rule, and set forth, that she was the devisee of certain lands from her father, under a will dated in 1835. And she objected to the appointment, on the ground] that, by the act of April 11th, 1848, she was entitled to hold the property to her separate use. But the court appointed a sequestrator, and this appeal was taken.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b505-11\"><em>Ford, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AhD\">There was no lien divested by the act, and it was therefore constitutional: 13 S. &amp; R. 133; 2 Pet. 412; 4 W. &amp; S. 218.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b505-12\"><em>S.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_o\">It may be that the legislature has not constitutional power to divest a husband\u2019s freehold in his wife\u2019s inheritance, without his consent; but it has certainly power to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>divest it with his consent, so as to free it from the claim of creditors who have not obtained a lien on it. The act in this case was, therefore, constitutional. But are we at liberty so to interpret it as to give it a retroactive operation against a creditor who had brought an action and incurred costs, at the time of the enactment, when there was no law to forbid the pursuit, with a view to obtain a lien and satisfaction out of the husband\u2019s curtesy ? The rule has been, to give a retroactive operation to statutes which operate, notion the right, but the remedy; and here it would operate on both. According to the principle of the Lancaster County Bank <em>v. </em>Stouffer, just now decided <em>(ant\u00e9, </em>398), the husband had an indefeasible freehold in his wife\u2019s land, which was open to action by his creditors; and, by the opposite principle, them right to seek satisfaction from the land, by actions previously commenced, would be taken away. But a more stringent principle still, is that which has governed us in refusing a retroactive operation to statutes which would bar an action pending, where we are not compelled to do otherwise by direct and positive words; as in Bedford <em>v. </em>Shilling, 4 S. &amp; R. 401, and subsequent cases. These embrace the principle of the case before us; and, so far, the opinion of the judge was incontrovertible; and, as has been said in the Lancaster Bank <em>v. </em>Stouffer, there was no right of appeal. The case must, therefore, take the course of its predecessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Appeal quashed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
