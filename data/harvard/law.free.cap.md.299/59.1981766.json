The case is now before us on the State\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">The relevant facts are as follows. Arnold Brookins and Clarence Howard were charged with armed robbery and other offenses by criminal information filed in the Criminal Court of Baltimore (now the Circuit Court for Baltimore City). On August 14, 1981, they were arraigned and their counsel\u2019s appearance was entered. Thus the 180-day period for trial, under \u00a7 591 and Rule 746, would expire on February 10, 1982, unless extended in accordance with the statute and rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">Trial was scheduled for November 12,1981, and both sides were ready for trial on that date. Nevertheless the case could not be reached because of the unavailability of a court. The designated administrative judge on November 12th postponed the case, stating that good cause existed \u201cdue to an excess buildup of cases awaiting trial with no courtroom available\u201d and \u201ccurrently 25 cases already pending on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>list to be moved to the first available court.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A new trial date of February 24,1982, was assigned. This was fourteen days beyond the 180-day period prescribed by \u00a7 591 and Rule 746.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">Again on February 24, 1982, the case could not be reached because of the unavailability of a court, and Administrative Judge Karwacki determined that a postponement was again required. This time, however, the case was placed on the \u201cmove list\u201d and thus given priority status. A judge was available on March 8, 1982, and the case was called for trial on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Prior to trial the defendant Brookins had filed a written motion to dismiss, asserting both a denial of his constitutional right to speedy trial and a violation of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746. On the day of trial the defendant Howard orally joined the motion. Following argument on March 8th, the trial judge granted the motion to dismiss, relying upon one of the trial court decisions which was subsequently reversed by us in <em>State v. Frazier, </em>298 Md. 422, 470 A.2d 1269 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed in an unreported opinion. The intermediate appellate court assumed that there was good cause for the postponement from November 12, 1981, to February 24, 1982. The appellate court, however, held that \u201cgood cause was not shown\u201d for the postponement on February 24, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">The state then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari. We have granted the petition and shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">The Court of Special Appeals\u2019 holding, that dismissal was appropriate because the February 24th postponement was unsupported by good cause, cannot be squared with our recent opinion in <em>State </em>v. <em>Frazier, supra, </em>and our opinion filed today in <em>Farinholt v. State, </em>299 Md. 32, 472 A.2d 452 (1984). As those opinions hold, the \u201ccritical order by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>the administrative judge, for purposes of the dismissal sanction, is the order having the effect of extending the trial date beyond 180 days.\u201d <em>Frazier, </em>298 Md. at 428, 470 A.2d 1269. As stated in the <em>Farinholt </em>case, 299 Md. at 40, 472 A.2d at 456, \u201cafter a case has already been postponed beyond the 180-day period, either in accordance with \u00a7 591 and Rule 746, or upon the defendant\u2019s motion, or with the defendant\u2019s express consent, the dismissal sanction has no relevance to subsequent postponements of the trial date unless the defendant\u2019s constitutional speedy trial right has been denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">In the case at bar, the 180-day period for trying the case, prescribed by \u00a7 591 and Rule 746, expired on February 10, 1982. The order of November 12, 1981, postponing the trial date from November 12th to February 24th, was the critical postponement order for purposes of the dismissal sanction. The subsequent postponement order of February 24th, occurring after the case had already been postponed beyond the 180-day deadline, does not implicate the dismissal sanction under the <em>Frazier </em>and <em>Farinholt </em>opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">The trial court\u2019s dismissal of the charges, for an alleged violation of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746, can be sustained only if the postponement of the trial from November 12, 1981, to February 24, 1982, was in violation of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746. In our view, no such violation was shown. The postponement was effected by the designated administrative judge, as required by \u00a7 591 and Rule 746. With regard to the presence or absence of good cause, the defendants did not meet their burden of demonstrating that the change of trial date, or the period of time until a new trial date, represented a clear abuse of discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Frazier, supra, </em>298 Md. at 461-462, 470 A.2d 1269.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">The trial court, therefore, erred in dismissing the charges under \u00a7 591 and Rule 746. Upon remand, however, the defendants\u2019 argument based on their constitutional right to speedy trial, as well as other pre-trial motions, must be ruled upon. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b99-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED, AND CASE REMANDED TO THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS WITH DIRECTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENTS OF THE CRIMINAL COURT OF BALTIMORE (NOW THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY) AND REMAND THE CASE FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.
