The appearance of his counsel was entered on August 3,1981; therefore the 180-day period for bringing the case to trial, prescribed by Maryland Code (1957, 1982 Rep.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 591, and Rule 746, expired on January 30, 1982. Following an earlier postponement, the trial was scheduled for January 18, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">On January 18, 1982, the designated administrative judge found good cause to postpone the case and granted a postponement. The underlying reasons for the postponement, as set forth in the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 opinion in this case <em>(State v. Green, </em>54 Md.App. 260, 262, 458 A.2d 487 (1983)), were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-8\">\u201cOn January 10, 1982, just over a week before the scheduled trial, a law clerk from the Public Defender\u2019s Office contacted the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney assigned to the case. She informed him that the appellee would consider accepting a guilty plea in the instant case upon the following two conditions: (1) he did not want to testify against anyone; and (2) he did not want to have to admit to the murder. The Assistant State\u2019s Attorney acquiesced and indicated that he would proceed on the guilty plea. He then contacted the witnesses summoned for the January 18, 1982 trial and informed them that there was no necessity for their appearance at trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-9\">\u201cOn January 18, 1982, in open court, appellee stated that he did not want to plead guilty; that he wanted a jury trial and \u2018wanted it today.\u2019 The designated administrative judge found good cause to postpone the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Trial was ultimately rescheduled for May 24, 1982. On that day, however, the trial judge, finding a violation of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746, granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. The trial judge held that the designated administrative judge had erred in deciding that there was good cause for the postponement on January 18, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">The Court of Special Appeals reversed, holding that the trial judge was not authorized to make a de novo determination of good cause for a postponement, that the designated administrative judge\u2019s determination of good cause should not be overturned by the trial judge unless the designated administrative judge had clearly abused his discretion, and that in this case there had been no clear abuse of discretion. The rulings set forth by Judge Alpert for the Court of Special Appeals, in 54 Md.App. at 264-267,458 A.2d 487, are in accord with this Court\u2019s later opinion in <em>State </em>v. <em>Frazier, </em>298 Md. 422, 470 A.2d 1269 (1984). Thus we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED. PETITIONER TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">DAVIDSON, J., concurs in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
