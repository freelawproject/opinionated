It is a segment of the national air pollution control scheme provided for by the federal Clean Air Act, codified as 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7401-7642. Under the authority conferred by that legislation, the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has established uniform national ambient air quality standards for six pollutants.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These standards set limits on the amount of each pollutant in the air at levels which \u201callowing an adequate margin of safety, are requisite to protect the public health.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7409(b)(1). Under the federal statute, ambient air quality standards must be attained in each \u201cair quality control region.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7407. These regions are designated by the EPA and may include portions of two or more states. <em>Id. </em>There are six control regions in Maryland, two of which are involved in this case: the Maryland portion of the National Capital Interstate Air Quality Control Region (compromised of Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s Counties, the District of Columbia, and its Northern Virginia Suburbs), 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 81.12 (1983), and the Metropolitan Baltimore Intrastate Air Quality Control Region (consisting of Baltimore City and Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Carroll, Harford and Howard Counties), 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 81.28 (1983).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Each state is made responsible for ensuring that the ambient standards are met by the deadlines prescribed in the Clean Air Act in each air quality control region within its borders. Each state must prepare a State Implementation Plan (SIP) for achieving these standards. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410. Any region failing to meet the standards by the end of 1975 is classified as a \u201cnon-attainment area.\u201d The 1977 amendments to the Clean Air Act required states with nonattainment areas to submit SIPs by January 1, 1979 and mandated that all ambient air quality standards be achieved by the beginning of 1983. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7502(a)(1). However, states may obtain a five-year extension of the deadline for attainment of the ozone and carbon monoxide standards. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7502(b)(11). The principal source for both pollutants is vehicle exhaust. 1 F. Grad, <em>Treatise on Environmental Law </em>\u00a7 2.01[2] at 2-6 \u2014 2-7 (1983). Therefore, as a condition for receiving an extension, the state\u2019s SIP must establish a specific schedule for implementation of a vehicle emission control inspection and maintenance program. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7502(b)(ll)(B). Through annual inspection and maintenance of federally mandated pollution control equipment, it is possible to limit vehicle emissions to the levels required of all new vehicles sold in the United States.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">Both the State and the EPA have identified the Baltimore and National Capital Air Quality Control Regions as nonattainment areas for ozone and carbon monoxide. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 81.321. Therefore, Maryland was required to submit a SIP in January, 1979 calculated to achieve the ambient standards by the 1988 deadline and to implement a vehicle emissions inspection program, as required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7502(b). Failure to comply with the SIP requirements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>could lead to severe federal sanctions. Specifically, continued nonattainment could precipitate the loss of sewage treatment plant construction grants, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7616 and federal highway construction funds, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7506(a). The annual loss to the State has been conservatively estimated to be as much as $123 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Accordingly, the Maryland legislature authorized the Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA) of the Department of Transportation to adopt rules and regulations establishing an emissions inspection program. Maryland Code (1984 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7\u00a7 23-201 \u2014 23-208 of the Transportation Article. Pursuant to \u00a7 23-207(b) of the Transportation Article, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene adopted the exhaust emission standards necessary to help bring the State\u2019s nonattainment areas into compliance with the national ambient air quality standards set by the EPA. COMAR \u00a7 10.18.22.03.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Limits were set for carbon monoxide, as well as for hydrocarbons, because the latter, when combined with other chemicals in the air and subjected to sunlight, produce the pollutant ozone. Ozone, together with other photochemical oxidants, create smog. 1 F. Grad, <em>Treatise on Environmental Law, supra, </em>at \u00a7 2.01[2]. The regulations of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene also govern the procedures for inspecting vehicle exhaust emissions, provide specifications for the inspection testing equipment and prescribe methods for calibrating the devices. COMAR \u00a7\u00a7 10.18.22.01-.06.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Regulations setting forth the administration of the VEIP are found at COMAR \u00a7\u00a7 11.14.06.01-.16. With the exception of the classes of vehicles exempted by \u00a7 11.14.06.05, all motor vehicles registered to residents of counties in the Baltimore and National Capital Air Quality Control Regions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>must be inspected annually. Each vehicle is assigned a month in 1984 when it must be submitted for inspection. Upon receiving notification from the MV A, the owner must take the vehicle to one of ten official inspection stations located in the area. COMAR \u00a7 11.14.06.06B. These stations are operated by a private firm under contract with the MVA and are subject to the MVA\u2019s direct supervision. The initial inspection costs nine dollars. Transportation Article \u00a7 23-205(a)(l). If the vehicle passes, it receives a Certificate of Compliance. Vehicles that fail receive a Certificate of Noncompliance and the owner is given thirty days to make necessary repairs. COMAR \u00a7 11.14.06.080(4). The vehicle must be reinspected within that period; there is no charge for the second inspection.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> COMAR \u00a7\u00a7 11.14.06.-08C(4) and .15A(3). If the vehicle fails upon retesting, the owner must either bring its emissions within the prescribed limits or obtain a waiver. COMAR \u00a7 11.14.06.080(5). To obtain a Waiver Certificate, the owner must present proof that up to $50 was spent on a \u201clow emissions tune-up\u201d as defined in COMAR \u00a7 11.14.06.08D(4). The cost of a low emissions tune-up allegedly ranges from $26 to $35. Failure to comply with VEIP can result in suspension of the registration of the noncomplying vehicle. COMAR \u00a7 11.14.-06.16B.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">The inspection program was scheduled to begin on January 1, 1983, but its commencement was delayed by the legislature for one year. <em>See </em>ch. 492 of the Acts of 1982; ch. 312 of the Acts of 1983. In response, the EPA threatened to withhold federal funds. 48 Fed.Reg. 5049 (Feb. 3, 1983). Though no final action was taken on the EPA proposal, federal pressure has continued. <em>See </em>48 Fed.Reg. 35318 (Aug. 3, 1983). Delays involved in constructing the inspection stations required postponement of the program until February 1, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">On January 11, 1984, the County Commissioners of Carroll County, in their individual and official capacities, the Town of Mt. Airy, its mayor, and a resident of Carroll County (the appellees) filed a petition for a declaratory judgment and an interlocutory injunction in the Circuit Court for Carroll County; they sought to have the VEIP declared unconstitutional, as applied to Carroll County, and to enjoin its implementation. Named as defendants were the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, the Department of Transportation and the MVA (the State). A hearing was held on January 23, 1984 before Judge Donald J. Gilmore at which evidence was introduced by both sides. On January 31, 1984, the court, following an oral opinion, granted an interlocutory injunction enjoining enforcement of the VEIP in Carroll County. The State noted its appeal on the same day and sought a stay of the injunction. We granted certiorari prior to consideration of the appeal by the Court of Special Appeals. After a hearing, we stayed the interlocutory injunction pending resolution of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">The scope of our review in this case is limited since we do not now finally determine the merits of appellees\u2019 arguments. Instead, we merely review whether the lower court\u2019s decision granting the interlocutory injunction should be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">As a general rule, the appropriateness of granting an interlocutory injunction is determined by examining four factors: (1) the likelihood that the plaintiff will succeed on the merits; (2) the \u201cbalance of convenience\u201d determined by whether greater injury would be done to the defendant by granting the injunction than would result from its refusal;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>(3) whether the plaintiff will suffer irreparable injury unless the injunction is granted; and (4) the public interest. <em>State Dep\u2019t v. Baltimore County, </em>281 Md. 548, 554-57, 383 A.2d 51 (1977).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-4\">\u201c[I]f the facts as stated in the bill of complaint or, when appropriate, as shown by the evidence, are not \u2018full and sufficiently definite and clear, in support of the right asserted, and that such right has been violated,\u2019 the court will not order preliminary relief.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 554, 383 A.2d 51 <em>quoting from Baltimore v. Warren Manuf. Co., </em>59 Md. 96, 105 (1882). It is well accepted that an interlocutory injunction should not be granted unless the party seeking it demonstrates a likelihood of success on the merits. 1 <em>High on Injunctions </em>\u00a7 5 (3d ed. 1905); 43 C.J.S. <em>Injunctions </em>\u00a7\u00a7 17 and 20 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Viewing all the evidence in a light most favorable to the appellees, <em>see Rose v. Bevan, </em>10 Md. 466, 470 (1857), we nevertheless conclude that the appellees have little chance of prevailing on the merits of their various claims. We need not, therefore, address the other test factors set forth in the <em>Baltimore County </em>case. Accordingly, we shall vacate the interlocutory injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">A. Fourth Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">The lower court found that the VEIP raised a \u201cserious Fourth Amendment question,\u201d because it provides the MVA with authority to conduct warrantless searches of the vehicles tested. The court appears to have been concerned about the tailpipe tests as well as the examination of federally mandated pollution control equipment for evidence of tampering.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">The heart of VEIP resides in the analysis of exhaust gasses emitted from the tailpipe of each car tested. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>testing procedures call for inserting the testing probe at least ten inches into the tailpipe of the vehicle while it is idling. COMAR \u00a7 10.18.22.04B(l)(b). Readings are taken over a period lasting about two minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">We find no fourth amendment violations in these procedures. It is well accepted that an individual has no expectation of privacy in items that he knowingly exposes to the public. <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967); <em>Venner v. State, </em>279 Md. 47, 367 A.2d 949, <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 932, 97 S.Ct. 2638, 53 L.Ed.2d 248 (1977). Examination of the exterior of an automobile does not infringe any privacy interest protected by the fourth amendment. <em>Cardwell v. Lewis, </em>417 U.S. 583, 94 S.Ct. 2464, 41 L.Ed.2d 325 (1974). In <em>State v. Burns, </em>121 Ariz. 471, 591 P.2d 563 (Ct.App.1979), the Court of Appeals of Arizona held that that state\u2019s vehicle emission testing program did not violate the fourth amendment. <em>See also Conner v. State, </em>34 Md.App. 124, 366 A.2d 385 (1976) (individual has no expectation of privacy in the serial numbers stamped on the outside of a motorcycle and visible upon cursory inspection). We think it unlikely that vehicle owners have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the exhaust gases located ten inches from the end of their exhaust systems. We conclude that insertion of the analyzer probe into the vehicle\u2019s tailpipe does not constitute a \u201csearch and seizure\u201d within the meaning of the fourth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">The lower court also indicated that \u00a7 23-202(d)(2) of the Transportation Article violated the fourth amendment by permitting warrantless searches of vehicles in connection with granting a waiver. That provision states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">\u201c[Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, [the MVA] may not grant a waiver if it is found in the testing process that a factory-installed emissions device has been tampered with or removed, or that the vehicle has been misfueled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>No evidence is presented in the record to indicate that this section is enforced through physical inspections of vehicles. To the contrary, there is uncontroverted evidence that the MVA does not intend to examine the pollution control equipment on the vehicles tested. Therefore, nothing in the record or in \u00a7 23-202(d)(2) raises the specter of an unreasonable fourth amendment search.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">But even if the State did conduct a superficial inspection of these devices, our conclusion would not be different. Assuming, without deciding, that getting under the vehicle to examine the catalytic converter or looking under the hood at other pollution control devices would constitute a fourth amendment search, it would not necessarily invalidate the VEIP. On its face, the fourth amendment does not prohibit all searches and seizures; it only forbids those which are unreasonable. Its essential purpose is to safeguard the privacy and security of individuals against arbitrary invasions by limiting the discretionary authority of government officials. <em>Delaware v. Prouse, </em>440 U.S. 648, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\">\"Thus, the permissibility of a particular law enforcement practice is judged by balancing its intrusion on the individual\u2019s Fourth Amendment interests against its promotion of legitimate governmental interests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 654, 99 S.Ct. at 1396 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Obviously, the purported invasion of privacy caused by looking under the hood, beneath the car or behind the gas cap is far outweighed by the overwhelming and overriding governmental interest in providing cleaner air. <em>State v. Burns, supra, </em>121 Ariz. 471, 591 P.2d at 566-67. Furthermore, any search of this nature would likely be deemed consensual. No Maryland resident is forced to have his vehicle inspected; the penalty for noncompliance is a loss of the right to drive that vehicle. The VEIP does not affect a citizen\u2019s right to drive any other vehicle or to seek alternative means of transportation. It is well accepted, as stated in <em>Burns, </em>121 Ariz. 471, 591 P.2d at 566, that \u201cconsent to minimal intrusions may be required by the state as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>prerequisite to use of regulated means of travel.\u201d See also <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>498 F.2d 496 (2d Cir.1974), and Annot., 14 A.L.R.Fed. 286 (1973), and cases there cited, upholding the constitutionality of requiring airline passengers to submit to preflight searches of their persons and baggage as a condition to boarding the aircraft.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">In conclusion, nothing in the VEIP appears likely to violate the fourth amendment. Therefore, the trial court erred in finding that appellees would likely prevail at trial on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">B. Equal Protection</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Appellees contend that certain classifications contained in the statutes and regulations at issue violate the equal protection principles embodied in the state and federal constitutions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> First, appellees argue that inclusion of Carroll County in the Metropolitan Baltimore Intrastate Air Quality Control Region is arbitrary and without rational basis. They reason that Carroll County is principally a rural area with no major pollution problems. They argue that other similarly situated rural counties such as Frederick and Cecil Counties are not part of the YEIP. Therefore, the appeh lees contend, there is no rational reason for subjecting Carroll County residents to the program. The lower court found, and we agree, that appellees enjoy little possibility of success on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Uniformity of treatment throughout the State is not a prerequisite to satisfying the requirements of the equal protection clause. <em>Washabaugh v. Washabaugh, </em>285 Md. 393, 407, 404 A.2d 1027 (1979). A statute enacted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>pursuant to the State\u2019s police power is not invalid merely because it affects counties unequally. <em>E.g., McGowan v. Maryland, </em>366 U.S. 420, 427, 81 S.Ct. 1101, 1105, 6 L.Ed.2d 393 (1961); <em>Supermarkets Gen. Corp. v. State, </em>286 Md. 611, 621, 409 A.2d 250 (1979), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>449 U.S. 801, 101 S.Ct. 45, 66 L.Ed.2d 5 (1980); <em>Matter of Trader, </em>272 Md. 364, 383, 325 A.2d 398 (1974). In reviewing statutory distinctions based on territory, the rational basis test applies because no fundamental right or suspect class is affected. <em>Washabaugh, supra, </em>285 Md. at 407, 404 A.2d 1027; <em>Donnelly Adv. Corp. v. City of Balto., </em>279 Md. 660, 370 A.2d 1127 (1977). Under the rational basis test, a statutory classification enjoys a strong presumption of constitutionality; the party attacking it must show by clear and convincing evidence that it does not rest upon any rational basis but is essentially arbitrary. <em>E.g., Hornbeck v. Somerset Co. Bd. of Educ., </em>295 Md. 597, 656-57, 458 A.2d 758 (1983). Viewing all of the evidence in a light most favorable to the appellees, we find that a rational basis for the territorial distinctions drawn here exists. Carroll County is a nonattainment area for ozone. Therefore, the State clearly had a rational reason for including the County in the VEIP, <em>i.e., </em>to bring it within the federally prescribed limits for that pollutant. That other \u201crural\u201d counties in the area have been excluded is completely irrelevant. Underinclusiveness does not create an equal protection violation under the rational basis test. Equal protection principles do not require the State to attack all of the various aspects of a problem at once; the government may legislate to remedy one phase of a problem and leave other phases to be resolved later. <em>Bowie Inn v. City of Bowie, </em>274 Md. 230, 241, 335 A.2d 679 (1975). <em>See also Dandridge v. Williams, </em>397 U.S. 471, 486-87, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 1162-1163, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 (1970); <em>Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., </em>348 U.S. 483, 489, 75 S.Ct. 461, 465, 99 L.Ed. 563 (1955); <em>Montgomery Co. v. Fields Road, </em>282 Md. 575, 386 A.2d 344 (1978) (a legislative body may weigh relative needs and restrict the application of a legislative policy to less than the entire field). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>When the State moves to correct an evil, it need not correct all of the evil at once; rather, it may proceed step by step. <em>Montgomery Co. v. Fields Road, supra, </em>282 Md. at 581, 386 A.2d 344.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-4\">\u201cIf the classification made by the Legislature is otherwise justified, there can be no sound complaint that the legislative purpose might be better or more fully achieved by other or more expansive and inclusive classification.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AP3\"><em>Harden v. Mass Transit Adm., </em>277 Md. 399, 414, 354 A.2d 817 (1976), <em>quoting Allied American Co. v. Comm\u2019r., </em>219 Md. 607, 624, 150 A.2d 421 (1959). Consequently, the VEIP is not constitutionally infirm because it does not require emissions testing in other rural counties.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Appellees\u2019 second line of attack is directed at the exemptions provided in COMAR \u00a7 11.14.06.05. This provision grants exemptions to nine classes of vehicles otherwise covered by the VEIP. Appellees contend that the creation of these distinctions violates the equal protection clause. They suggest that the appropriate standard for reviewing these exemptions is the \u201cheightened scrutiny\u201d test set forth in <em>Attorney General v. Waldron, </em>289 Md. 683, 426 A.2d 929 (1981). There, we held that where a statute creates a \u201csensitive,\u201d though not \u201csuspect\u201d criteria of classification, affects \u201cimportant,\" though not fundamental personal rights or works a \u201csignificant interference\u201d with a liberty or benefit vital to the individual, the courts will apply a standard more exacting than the rational basis test but less rigorous than the strict scrutiny analysis. <em>Id. </em>at 711-714, 426 A.2d 929. <em>See also Hornbeck, supra, </em>295 Md. at 641-42, 458 A.2d 758. We think it plain that the impact of the VEIP does not implicate the <em>Waldron </em>standard of review. Clearly, none of the classifications created by the regulations are based on \u201csensitive\u201d criteria like gender. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number><em>Waldron, supra, </em>289 Md. at 711, 426 A.2d 929; <em>Hornbeck, supra, </em>295 Md. at 641, 458 A.2d 758. Nor does the VEIP affect an \u201cimportant\u201d personal right or \u201csignificantly interfere\u201d with a vital liberty. It is true that the Supreme Court has recognized the importance of a citizen\u2019s right to travel between states. <em>E.g., Dunn v. Blumstein, </em>405 U.S. 330, 92 S.Ct. 995, 31 L.Ed.2d 274 (1972); <em>Shapiro v. Thompson, </em>394 U.S. 618, 89 S.Ct. 1322, 22 L.Ed.2d 600 (1969); L. Tribe, <em>American Constitutional Law, </em>\u00a7 16-8 (1978). However, the VEIP does not significantly impair that right. It does not prohibit or penalize interstate travel. Nor does it take away an individual\u2019s right to drive. Instead, it merely precludes an owner from driving a particular vehicle if that vehicle does not comply with emissions standards and if the owner refuses to repair it. This is not the type of deprivation to which the <em>Waldron </em>heightened scrutiny standard applies; rather, it is the type of regulation to which the rational basis test is applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">As we indicated earlier, regulations which do not make distinctions based on suspect classifications or impair the exercise of fundamental rights are presumed to be constitutional. They will be upheld unless the party challenging them proves they have no rational basis. They will be sustained if any state of facts reasonably may be conceived to sustain them. <em>See, e.g., Hornbeck, supra, </em>295 Md. at 642, 458 A.2d 758.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The State has demonstrated in the record a rational basis for each of the exemptions provided for in the VEIP. We consider them seriatim. Farm vehicles are exempt, COMAR \u00a7 11.14.06.05B(1), because they travel very few miles and add little to the pollution problem. Historic and antique vehicles receive an exemption, COMAR \u00a7 11.14.06.-05B(2), because they are only driven on weekends and thus are responsible for only a minor portion of the total vehicle emissions. Gasoline powered trucks and buses with a gross vehicle weight greater than ten thousand pounds are not covered by the VEIP, COMAR \u00a7 11.14.06.05B(3), because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>the unquantified emissions reduction potential of these heavy duty trucks and buses as well as anticipated \u201cstart-up problems\u201d associated with the commencement of inspections. With this in mind, the EPA suggested that heavy duty vehicles be exempt from the program initially. Maryland inspection stations have been constructed with at least one inspection bay large enough to accommodate these larger vehicles; thus, they may be added to the program later if it becomes feasible. Motorcycles are excused from the program, COMAR \u00a7 11.14.06.05B(4), because special equipment is needed to test them and because they travel relatively few vehicle miles; thus it would not be cost-effective to include them in the program. The program also exempts specially registered vehicles owned temporarily by vehicle dealers, finance companies and others. COMAR \u00a7 11.14.06.05B(5). These vehicles are specially registered for limited transportation purposes and will be subject to inspection once they are transferred permanently. Section 11.14.06.05B(6) excepts vehicles registered in Maryland but not driven within the State. It is designed to cover vehicles owned by members of the armed services. Obviously, these vehicles do not emit pollutants in Maryland and thus there is no reason to force owners to have them inspected. If a vehicle covered by subsection B(6) is returned to the State, however, it is subject to inspection. All diesel and alternate fuel powered vehicles are exempt, COMAR \u00a7 11.14.06.-05B(7). The record shows that diesel engines do not deteriorate over time and therefore inspection and maintenance would not reduce emissions. Furthermore, special equipment would be needed to test diesel powered vehicles, increasing the cost of the program significantly without an appreciable reduction in emissions. Vehicles that run on electricity, propane, compressed natural gas, or other alternative fuels emit very small amounts of each pollutant and some are pollution free. Vehicles more than twelve years old are exempt under COMAR \u00a7 11.14.06.05B(9). The State found that these older vehicles are driven less than others and that the percentage reduction in emissions to be gained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>by inspection and maintenance was minor compared with the cost to the owner, most of whom are from low income groups. Finally, vehicles less than twelve months old are exempt. COMAR \u00a7 11.14.06.05B(10). States are prohibited by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(a) from requiring inspections as a condition of initial registration. For the twelve months after initial registration, the MYA could reasonably have determined that noncompliance was unlikely because a new engine will not deteriorate significantly below federal new vehicle emissions standards during that time. We conclude, therefore, that a rational basis for each of these exemptions appears to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">Appellees argue that \u00a7 11.14.06.05 exempts major emissions sources and that inclusion of these vehicles in the program would achieve additional reductions. As we said earlier, however, underinclusiveness does not render an otherwise valid law unconstitutional. The legislature may direct that pollution from vehicle emissions be reduced incrementally, as long as a rational reason exists for excluding the vehicles that it does not choose to regulate. We need not be convinced that the reasons for the distinctions are good ones; that is a question for the legislature. Rather, we need only find that there is some rational relationship between the legislature\u2019s goal and the means chosen to achieve it. In <em>Hornbeck, supra, </em>295 Md. at 658, 458 A.2d 758, we said, in another context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\">\u201c[W]e approach these issues with 'a disciplined perception of the proper role of the courts____\u2019 <em>[Quoting Board of Educ., Levittown, Etc. v. Nyquist, </em>57 N.Y.2d 27, 439 N.E.2d 359, 369 n. 9, 453 N.Y.S.2d 643 (654 n. 9) (1982).] The expostulations of those urging alleviation of the existing disparities are properly to be addressed to the legislature for its consideration and weighing____ Otherwise stated, it is not within the power or province of members of the Judiciary to advance their own personal wishes or to implement their own personal notions of fairness under the guise of constitutional interpretation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Accordingly, we find that appellees\u2019 factual allegations, even if true, are not likely to present a violation of the equal protection clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">C. Procedural Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">The lower court found that a number of the VEIP procedures, as prescribed by the governing statutes and regulations, raised substantial due process questions. Specifically, the court was concerned about the procedure for appealing a finding that a vehicle had failed the inspection, the procedure for appealing a revocation of vehicle registration, and the perceived failure to preserve a record of the inspection results for each vehicle tested. No allegation was made by any of the appellees that any of their vehicles had failed the test or that their vehicle registrations were revoked. Therefore, our review of the VEIP is limited to its facial validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">We note at the outset that the court erroneously interpreted \u00a7 11.14.06.16B of the regulations to preclude an owner from driving his vehicle \u201cfrom day one of the regulation\u201d unless he had passed the emissions inspection. In other words, the court found that on February 1, 1984, the sanctions of the VEIP applied automatically to all vehicle owners, even those who had not yet received a notice from the MVA to submit their vehicles for inspection. Section 11.14.06.16B provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">\u201cB. A person may not operate a Maryland registered motor vehicle that is required to be inspected under these regulations on the highways of this State unless the vehicle has a valid inspection certificate. The Administration may suspend, revoke or refuse to renew registration of any vehicle whose owner fails to comply with the requirements of this chapter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">This provision must be interpreted in light of \u00a7 11.14.06.06B which establishes the schedule for implementing the VEIP. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-9\">\u201c(1) Before the beginning of the mandatory program, each vehicle required to be inspected shall be assigned a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>specific month, during which the vehicle is to be inspected during the first year. No vehicle may be tested prior to December 31, 1983.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-4\">(2) A vehicle may not be presented for inspection more than 30 days before the assigned month of inspection. Vehicles tested before the assigned month shall be issued a certificate containing an expiration designation for the assigned month in the succeeding year.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Thus, the regulations implementing the VEIP clearly provide for annual inspections to be conducted in the month assigned to a driver. The enforcement mechanisms established in \u00a7 11.14.06.07 do not apply to an individual who has not yet been assigned a month in which to have his vehicle inspected.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The lower court found no \u201crequirement that any record be made of ... a vehicle emissions inspector\u2019s findings.\u201d In fact, however, the regulations explicitly require that all emissions test results be set forth on the certificate, whether it be \u201ccompliance,\u201d \u201cnoncompliance\u201d or \u201cwaiver.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> There is nothing in the record to suggest that these requirements will not be obeyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">The lower court also found that the procedures provided by the VEIP for appealing an adverse inspection result, or a revocation or nonrenewal of registration, violated due process. The standards for determining whether a particular procedure comports with due process are well known. The due process clauses of Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and the fourteenth amendment to the federal constitution have the same meaning; and we have said that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Supreme Court interpretations of the federal provision are authority for interpretation of Article 24. <em>Pitsenberger v. Pitsenberger, </em>287 Md. 20, 27, 410 A.2d 1052 (1980), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>449 U.S. 807, 101 S.Ct. 52, 66 L.Ed.2d 10 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">To establish a violation of procedural due process of law in this case, the aggrieved party must show that state action has resulted in a deprivation of a property interest within the meaning of the due process clause. Once deprivation of a property interest is demonstrated, the court must ascertain what procedures are constitutionally required before an individual may be deprived of a protected property interest. <em>E.g., Pitsenberger, supra, </em>287 Md. at 27-28, 410 A.2d 1052; <em>Riger v. L &amp; B Ltd. Partnership, </em>278 Md. 281, 288-89, 363 A.2d 481 (1976). Due process does not require adherence to any particular procedure. On the contrary, due process is flexible and calls only for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands. <em>E.g., Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 334, 96 S.Ct. 893, 902, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Reamer, </em>281 Md. 323, 333, 379 A.2d 171 (1977). Procedures adequate under one set of facts may not be sufficient in a different situation. <em>Arnett v. Kennedy, </em>416 U.S. 134, 155, 94 S.Ct. 1633, 1645, 40 L.Ed.2d 15 (1974). Therefore, determination of what is required must be made by balancing the private and government interests affected. <em>Mathews, supra, </em>424 U.S. at 334, 96 S.Ct. at 902. In that case, the Supreme Court set forth the appropriate factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-5\">\u201c[0]ur prior decisions indicate that identification of the specific dictates of due process generally requires consideration of three distinct factors: First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.\u201d 424 U.S. at 334-35, 96 S.Ct. at 903.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-5\"><em>Accord Reamer, supra, </em>281 Md. at 333, 379 A.2d 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The lower court indicated that the VEIP provides inadequate procedures for appealing a negative determination of compliance made at the testing station. We disagree. If a vehicle fails the inspection, a noncompliance certificate is issued. No penalty or sanction is then imposed on the owner of a vehicle that fails. Since there is no sanction, the owner is not deprived of any property interest and thus the due process clause is not implicated.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">The lower court also found that the procedures to be followed prior to revocation of vehicle registration for noncompliance were inadequate. The requirements of the VEIP are enforced by suspension of vehicle registration or denial of registration renewal. COMAR \u00a7 11.14.06.07A. The MVA is given such authority by \u00a7 13-705 of the Transportation Article. A vehicle owner may have his registration suspended if (1) he fails to submit his vehicle for testing upon receiving notice to do so, COMAR \u00a7 11.14.-06.16B; (2) the vehicle fails the first inspection and is not submitted for a retest within the required time, COMAR \u00a7 11.14.06.080(4); or (3) the vehicle fails both inspections and is not granted a waiver, COMAR \u00a7 11.14.06.080(5). The undisputed testimony in the record indicates that a vehicle owner who fails to comply with the VEIP requirements will be sent a notice that the vehicle\u2019s registration will be suspended unless, within thirty days, evidence is submitted to the MVA that (1) the vehicle has complied or received a waiver or exemption; (2) the vehicle has been sold; or (3) the owner no longer resides in an area subject to regulation under the program. If the owner does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>comply with the first notice, another notice is sent that the vehicle\u2019s registration has been suspended and ordering that the license tags be surrendered. The owner has a right to appeal the suspension or revocation of registration to the circuit court pursuant to \u00a7 13-705(b)(l) of the Transportation Article which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">\u201c(b) <em>Right of appeal. </em>\u2014 A suspension or revocation under this section is subject to the right of appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">(1) By a resident to the circuit court for the county in which the individual resides or has a principal place of business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The appeal must be filed within thirty days, as provided by Maryland Rule B4.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">A driver\u2019s license is a property interest protected by the fourteenth amendment. <em>Illinois v. Batchelder, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 103 S.Ct. 3513, 3515, 77 L.Ed.2d 1267 (1983); <em>Mackey v. Montrym, </em>443 U.S. 1, 10, 99 S.Ct. 2612, 2617, 61 L.Ed.2d 321 (1979); <em>Dixon v. Love, </em>431 U.S. 105, 112, 97 S.Ct. 1723, 1727, 52 L.Ed.2d 172 (1977); <em>Bell v. Burson, </em>402 U.S. 535, 539, 91 S.Ct. 1586, 1589, 29 L.Ed.2d 90 (1971). We assume, without deciding, that a vehicle registration is also a property interest within the meaning of that provision. <em>See Rentals Unlimited v. Administrator, </em>286 Md. 104, 111-12, 405 A.2d 744 (1979) (the right to drive and to register vehicles involves important interests which cannot be taken away without procedural due process). Revocation or denial of registration renewal would appear to constitute a deprivation of that interest within the contemplation of traditional due process analysis. Under the standard enunciated in <em>Mathews, supra, </em>however, we think adequate procedural safeguards are provided. Therefore, on its face, the VEIP does not violate due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">Under the <em>Mathews </em>standard, we must first examine the nature of the private interest affected. The driver\u2019s interest in continued possession of his driver\u2019s license is a substantial one. <em>Mackey, supra, </em>443 U.S. at 11, 99 S.Ct. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>2617. Without it he is not permitted to operate any vehicle. A driver\u2019s interest in registration of a vehicle, however, is less significant. The suspension of registration merely precludes the driver from operating <em>that </em>vehicle; he is free to use any other vehicle that he might buy, rent or borrow. Owners are given ample notice of noncompliance and sufficient opportunity to remedy the situation prior to suspension of registration. Furthermore, though not required to, <em>Mackey, supra, </em>443 U.S. at 12, 99 S.Ct. at 2618, the MYA is authorized to grant extensions of time to waiver applicants who can show hardship. COMAR \u00a7 11.14.06.08D(7) and (8). Therefore, since the interests involved here are less significant than those addressed in <em>Batchelder, Mackey </em>and <em>Love, </em>all <em>supra, </em>it is clear that no presuspension appeal procedure would be warranted on this factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">The second <em>Mathews </em>consideration is addressed to the risk of an erroneous determination under the procedures provided and the benefits to be gained from the substitution of alternative procedures. Where, as here, suspension decisions are largely automatic as based upon scientifically accepted objective criteria, and prompt post-suspension judicial review is available, the likelihood of erroneous administrative determinations is minimal. <em>See Love, supra, </em>431 U.S. at 113-14, 97 S.Ct. at 1727-1728. Consequently, little is to be gained from provision of additional procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Finally, we consider the government\u2019s interest and the administrative and fiscal burdens created by additional procedures. Of course, the State\u2019s interest in eliminating pollution to protect the health of its citizens is of obvious importance. Suspension of registration provides the most effective means of achieving this purpose by removing the polluting vehicles from the roads. <em>See Mackey, supra, </em>433 U.S. at 18, 99 S.Ct. at 2621; <em>Love, supra, </em>431 U.S. at 114-15, 97 S.Ct. at 1728-1729. Additionally, presuspension procedures would increase substantially the cost and administrative burden \u2014 which is borne by all taxpayers \u2014 while providing little more than a dilatory tactic in this scientific area for those who do not wish to have their vehicles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>inspected. <em>See Mackey, supra, </em>443 U.S. at 18, 99 S.Ct. at 2621.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">We conclude that on its face, the VEIP provides adequate procedures to safeguard the interests of vehicle owners. Accordingly, appellees\u2019 chances of prevailing on their procedural due process claims are slim at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">D. Substantive Due Process and Unlawful Taking</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The lower court found that the suspension or revocation of registration and removal of the license tags from a noncomplying vehicle constituted a taking of property without just compensation. As there is no evidence that any driver has had his registration revoked or his tags confiscated, our inquiry is limited to the facial validity of the VEIP.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Both the fifth amendment to the United States Constitution and Article III, \u00a7 40 of the Constitution of Maryland prohibit the taking of private property for public use unless just compensation is paid to the owner. The fifth amendment applies to the states through the fourteenth amendment. We have said that Supreme Court decisions interpreting the fifth amendment\u2019s just compensation requirement are practically direct authority for our interpretation of the parallel provision in the Constitution of Maryland. <em>King v. State Roads Comm\u2019n of St. Hwy. Admin., </em>298 Md. 80, 83-84, 467 A.2d 1032 (1983). The standard for determining when a government regulation affecting the use of private property becomes a \u201ctaking\u201d in the constitutional sense is well accepted.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">\u201c \u2018If the owner affirmatively demonstrates that the legislature or administrative determination deprives him of all beneficial use of the property, the action will be held unconstitutional. But the restrictions imposed must be such that the property cannot be used for any reasonable purpose. It is not enough for the property owners to show that the ... action results in substantial loss or hardship.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number><em>Governor v.

Eader, </em>287 Md. 571, 580, 414 A.2d 1246 (1980); <em>Pitsenberger v. Pitsenberger, </em>287 Md. 20, 34, 410 A.2d 1052 (1980), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>449 U.S. 807, 101 S.Ct. 52, 66 L.Ed.2d 10 (1980); <em>Rockville v. Stone, </em>271 Md. 655, 663-64, 319 A.2d 536 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">If the registration of a vehicle is suspended or revoked because it has not acquired a Certificate of Compliance or Waiver, the owner is required to return the registration plates and card to the MVA. Transportation Article, \u00a7 13-708. This is not an unlawful taking of property in the constitutional sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Nor does suspension, revocation or refusal to renew vehicle registration constitute a taking of the vehicle. Section 13-709 of the Transportation Article makes clear that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-8\">\u201c[t]he cancellation, suspension, or revocation of the registration of a vehicle does not affect the status of the title to or any property rights in the vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">If the registration is invalid, the owner may not drive the vehicle. But the owner is not thereby deprived of \u201call beneficial use\u201d of the vehicle; it may be sold. It is true that the MVA may require an emissions inspection certificate as a condition for transferring title to the vehicle, COMAR \u00a7 11.14.06.07F, or furnishing registration to the new owner, COMAR \u00a7 11.14.06.07D. Presumably this might reduce the value of the automobile to the new owner who would be required to make the expenditures necessary to bring the vehicle into compliance with the emissions standards. As it is, the purchaser of a used vehicle is also required to obtain a safety inspection certificate, Transportation Article \u00a7 23-107. These requirements may reduce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>the price that the seller can obtain for the vehicle. A reduction in value, however, does not per se constitute a taking. <em>E.g., Andrus v. Allard, </em>444 U.S. 51, 64-66, 100 S.Ct. 318, 326-327, 62 L.Ed.2d 210 (1979); <em>Md.-Nat\u2019l Cap. P. &amp; P. Comm\u2019n v. Chadwick, </em>286 Md. 1, 405 A.2d 241 (1979). Therefore, we find that suspension or revocation of vehicle registration under the VEIP does not effect a taking in violation of either the state or the federal constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Appellees also urged the court below to find that the VEIP regulations exceeded the State\u2019s police power in violation of other substantive due process considerations. It appears from the lower court\u2019s oral opinion that it may have believed that the VEIP did not, as to the citizens of Carroll County, bear a real and substantial relation to the public end sought to be accomplished and was therefore arbitrary and unreasonable. Of course, where, as here, legislation is sustainable under the equal protection rational basis standard, a substantive due process challenge to the same law is unlikely to succeed. The standards are the same. As we said in <em>Supermarkets Gen. Corp. v. State, </em>286 Md. 611, 618, 409 A.2d 250 (1970), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>449 U.S. 801, 101 S.Ct. 45, 66 L.Ed.2d 5 (1980):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\">\u201c[T]he companion contentions of equal protection and due process mesh. There is no practical distinction between the grounds on which the two contentions are argued, and d\u00e9termination of one will resolve the other.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ae\">Moreover, it would not appear unreasonable to include Carroll County under VEIP simply because that county\u2019s relative contribution to emission reduction may constitute but a small fraction of the total air pollutants within the State. As the State pointed out in its brief, the plan is comprised of many measures, which individually may contribute only a little to the overall emission reductions. But it is the total plan which is important and each piece is vital to its effectiveness. The record discloses that in the Baltimore Region, even with VEIP in place, Maryland will have a nine ton per day shortfall in the emission reduction required to be achieved by 1987. At present, Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>does not have any proposed regulations that will achieve this reduction. Thus, it is hard to fault the State\u2019s contention that when it is searching for new ways to obtain additional emission reductions, it would be irresponsible to eliminate the potential reductions gained by including Carroll County under the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">E. Administrative Law</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The lower court expressed \u201cconstitutional concern\u201d that the MVA had no power to amend its original VEIP regulations and, as a consequence, all subsequent amendments to the rules were adopted without legislative authority. From this, the appellees urge us to find that all amendments to the original VEIP regulations are void.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The procedure for adopting the regulations establishing the VEIP is set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 23-202 and 23-207 of the Transportation Article. The MVA was ordered to publish proposed rules and regulations by October 1, 1979 and submit them to the General Assembly for consideration during the 1980 regular session. The proposed regulations were to take effect as provided, together with any amendments approved by joint resolution of the General Assembly. Transportation Article \u00a7 23-202(a). It is not alleged that there was failure of compliance with any of the procedures mandated by this section or by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol.) Article 41, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 244-256A. The MVA\u2019s authority to implement, administer and enforce the VEIP is set forth in \u00a7 23-207(a) of the Transportation Article.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Though none of these provisions explicitly grant authority to the MVA to amend its regulations, we think it implicit that the authority to adopt rules carries with it the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>power to amend the rules so adopted. In other words, an agency with expressly granted rulemaking power has implied authority to alter, amend and repeal the regulations it has adopted. <em>See </em>1 Am.Jur.2d <em>Administrative Law </em>\u00a7 131 (1962); 73 C.J.S. <em>Public Administrative Law and Procedure </em>\u00a7 99 (1983); APA, \u00a7\u00a7 244 and 245. Manifestly, to deny an agency the authority to amend its regulations, absent express statutory inhibition, would severely impair its effectiveness, and the legislature could not have intended such an absurd result. Since we do not read the legislation providing for the VEIP to preclude amendment of regulations adopted pursuant to its authority, appellees\u2019 likelihood of success on the merits of this argument is insubstantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">We therefore conclude that the granting of the interlocutory injunction in this case constituted an improvident exercise of judicial discretion on the part of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">INTERLOCUTORY INJUNCTION VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CARROLL COUNTY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS; COSTS TO ABIDE THE FINAL RESULT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b436-7\">.
