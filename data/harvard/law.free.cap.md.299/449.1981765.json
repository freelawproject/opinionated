Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 591, implemented by Maryland Rule 746, the trial in a circuit court criminal prosecution must commence within 180 days of arraignment or the initial appearance of defense counsel, whichever occurs earlier, unless the time is extended beyond 180 days upon a showing of good cause and by order of the county administrative judge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See generally Farinholt v. State, </em>299 Md. 32, 472 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>A.2d 452 (1984); <em>Calhoun v. State, </em>299 Md. 1, 472 A.2d 436 (1984); <em>State v. Frazier, </em>298 Md. 422, 470 A.2d 1269 (1984), and cases there discussed. The question presented by the instant case concerns the application of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746 where the prosecuting attorney files a nol pros prior to the expiration of the 180-day period and thereafter causes the same charge or charges to be refiled against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Emerson Paul Curley, Jr., was charged by information with automobile manslaughter, homicide by motor vehicle while intoxicated, reckless driving, and other, related offenses, all arising out of an accident in Anne Arundel County on July 19, 1980. On September 22, 1980, counsel for Curley entered his appearance in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. Consequently, the 180-day time period for trial, under \u00a7 591 and Rule 746, expired on March 23, 1981. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">Trial was initially scheduled for November 20, 1980. By letter of November 12, 1980, Curley\u2019s counsel requested a postponement of the November 20th trial date because of a scheduling conflict and requested that someone from the circuit court clerk\u2019s office contact him regarding a new trial date.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In accordance with the request, the November 20th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>trial date was postponed. Nevertheless, a new trial date was never assigned.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Next, on March 23, 1981, which was the last day for a trial of the case under \u00a7 591 and Rule 746, the prosecuting attorney entered a nol pros with respect to all of the charges against Curley. In a letter to defense counsel dated March 23rd, the prosecuting attorney informed defense counsel of the nol pros, stating that \u201c[t]his disposition was made based on the combined factors of the apparent inadmissibility of the blood alcohol content test as performed in this case and upon the request made of the State by the family of the victim.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">On June 26, 1981, the State filed a second criminal information charging Curley with the same offenses as had been charged under the prior information.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Curley\u2019s attorney entered an appearance in this second case on July 8, 1981, and shortly thereafter he filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds (1) that Curley had been denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial and (2) that Art. 27, \u00a7 591, and Rule 746 were violated.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>The motion to dismiss was heard on August 28, 1981. The circuit judge stated that the State has an \u201cabsolute right\u201d to enter a nol pros and an \u201cabsolute right\u201d to file charges a second time. The judge went on to note that, notwithstanding the latter \u201cright,\u201d prosecution may be barred because of double jeopardy or, in this case, a delay of time. But, according to the judge, a delay in recharging will only bar prosecution where the State entered a nol pros with the purpose of avoiding the mandate of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746. Because no evidence of such purpose was shown, the motion to dismiss was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">On October 1, 1981, counsel for Curley filed a second motion to dismiss, again asserting that \u00a7 591 and Rule 746 were violated. After a hearing, the circuit court filed on October 30, 1981, a memorandum opinion and order, again denying the motion. A third motion to dismiss was filed on November 13, 1981, and denied on December 11, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Trial commenced on December 15, 1981. This was 449 days after the initial appearance of counsel under the first information, 172 days after the filing of the second information, and 160 days after the formal appearance of counsel under the second information. The trial concluded on December 18th, and the jury returned guilty verdicts as to automobile manslaughter, driving while impaired, reckless driving, negligent driving, driving at a speed greater than reasonable and failing to drive in a single lane. The jury acquitted Curley of homicide by motor vehicle while intoxicated and driving while intoxicated. The trial court imposed a three year sentence on Curley for the automobile manslaughter conviction, with all but three months of weekends at the County Detention Center suspended, and a $1,000 fine. On the count of driving while impaired, the court imposed a two month suspended sentence, to run concurrently with the first sentence, and a $100 fine. On the remaining three counts the court imposed $100 fines.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Curley appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. Pursuant to Maryland Rule 1015, the Court of Special Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>certified the case to this Court on May 4, 1983. We accepted the certification application and issued a writ of certiorari bringing the entire matter here. <em>See </em>Rule 815.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The broad issue presented in this case is not addressed by either the language of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746 or by any prior opinions of this Court. An examination of cases in other jurisdictions which have considered the interaction of a nol pros, or its functional equivalent, with a statute or rule setting a time limit for the trial of criminal cases, reveals no uniformity in approach.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This may sometimes be due, at least in part, to factors which vary among the states, factors which include the language of the state statute or rule, the supervisory control (or lack thereof) which the court may exert over the entry of a nol pros, whether a dismissal for violation of the state speedy trial statute or rule is with prejudice, and the principal purpose of the state statute or rule prescribing a time limit for criminal trials. Despite these variables, however, the approaches taken in other jurisdictions can be divided into three broad, if not always clearly bounded, categories.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">The first category is comprised of cases in which the running of the statutory period for trial begins on the date of the original charging document (or arraignment or first appearance of counsel), is neither tolled nor ended by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>entry of a nol pros, and the same period continues to run when the defendant is re-indicted for the same charge. <em>See, e.g., Wright v. State, </em>387 So.2d 1060, 1062 (Fla.App. 1980);<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Hurt v. State, </em>62 Ga.App. 878, 10 S.E.2d 136, 137 (1940);<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>State ex rel. Back v. Starke Circuit Court, </em>271 Ind. 82, 390 N.E.2d 643, 644 (1979).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The holding of the Maryland Court of Special Appeals in <em>State v. Glenn, 53 </em>Md.App. 717, 456 A.2d 1300 (1983) (in which we have rendered a decision today, <em>State v. Glenn, </em>299 Md. 464, 474 A.2d 509 (1984)), falls into this category. <em>See also People v. Scott, </em>200 Colo. 365, 615 P.2d 680 (1980).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The rationale for this approach appears to be that the state should not be permitted to avoid the effect of the running of the speedy trial period through the entry of a nolle prosequi. These cases take the view that where the identical charge is refiled, \u201c \u2018it must be regarded as if there had been no dismissal of the first [complaint] ..., or as if the second ... had been filed on the date of the first.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Back v. Starke Circuit Court, supra, </em>390 N.E.2d at 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The second category consists of jurisdictions which look to the date of the first charge, but toll the running of the statutory time for the period during which no indictment is outstanding. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Dennis, </em>625 F.2d 782, 793 (8th Cir.1980); <em>United States v. Sebastian, </em>428 F.Supp. 967, 973 (W.D.N.Y.1977), <em>aff'd, </em>562 F.2d 211 (2d Cir.1977), <em>aff'd, </em>578 F.2d 1372 (1978);<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>State v. Washington, </em>273 Ark. 82, 617 S.W.2d 3 (1981);<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>People v. Sanders, </em>86 Ill.App.3d 457, 459, 41 Ill.Dec. 453, 407 N.E.2d 951 (1980); <em>State v. Ransom, </em>233 Kan. 185, 661 P.2d 392 (1983);<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>State v. Stephens, </em>52 Ohio App.2d 361, 370 N.E.2d 759, 766 (1977);<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth v. Leatherbury, </em>499 Pa. 450, 453 A.2d 957, 958 (1982); <em>Cole v. State, </em>650 S.W.2d 818 (Tex.Cr.App.1983).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Courts adopting the tolling approach have reasoned that it \u201cwould undercut the implementation of the speedy trial statute unless, in computing time under ... [the statute], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>the defendant\u2019s time pending trial under the original indictment is included with time pending trial under the reindictment.\u201d <em>State v. Stephens, supra, 52 </em>Ohio App.2d at 371 [370 N.E.2d 759]. It has been said that refusing to include the the time under the earlier indictment \u201cwould subvert the. policy of the speedy trial statutes by automatically providing prosecutors a new ... period in which to bring an accused to trial, irrespective of the amount of ... delay involved in the prior ... proceedings.\u201d <em>State v. Bonarrigo, </em>62 Ohio St.2d 7, 10, 402 N.E.2d 530 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">On the other hand, the cases taking the tolling approach hold that the period of time between the two indictments should not be counted because, \u201c[w]hen a charge is nolle prossed ..., there is no charge pending against\u201d the defendant, and that \u201cthe speedy trial statute runs only when a charge is pending against a defendant,\u201d <em>People v. Sanders, supra, </em>86 Ill.App.3d at 469 [41 Ill.Dec. 453, 407 N.E.2d 951].</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">(c)</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Cases in the third category take the position that when criminal charges are nol prossed and later refiled, the time period for commencing trial ordinarily begins to run anew after the refiling. <em>See, e.g., State v. Rose, </em>121 Ariz. 131, 589 P.2d 5, 11 (1978); <em>People v. Allen, </em>220 Cal.App.2d 796, 34 Cal.Rptr. 106 (1963);<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>State v. Goodmiller, </em>86 Idaho 233, 386 P.2d 365, 367-368 (1963); <em>State v. Allen, </em>641 S.W.2d 471, 475 (Mo.App.1982); <em>State ex rel. Delgado v. Stanley, </em>83 N.M. 626, 495 P.2d 1073, 1074 (1972); <em>State v. Mills, </em>307 N.C. 504, 299 S.E.2d 203 (1983); <em>Miller v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 929, 234 S.E.2d 269, 273 (1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1016, 98 S.Ct. 735, 54 L.Ed.2d 762 (1978). These holdings appear to be based upon the nature and effect of a nol pros.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">The jurisdictions in this third category, as well as the jurisdictions which toll the running of the statutory trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>period for the time between charging documents, generally recognize an exception where the prosecution\u2019s action is intended or clearly operates to circumvent the statute or rule prescribing a time limit for trial. As the cases put it, the prosecution must be acting in \u201cgood faith\u201d or so as to not \u201cevade\u201d or \u201ccircumvent\u201d the requirements of the statute or rule setting a deadline for trial. <em>See, e.g., State v. Rose, supra, </em>589 P.2d at 11 (1978); <em>State v. Taylor, </em>27 Ariz.App. 330, 554 P.2d 926, 932 (1976); <em>Carter v. State, </em>280 Ark. 34, 655 S.W.2d 379 (1983); <em>Abernathy v. State, </em>278 Ark. 250, 644 S.W.2d 590, 591 (1983); <em>People v. Sanders, supra, </em>86 Ill.App. at 470 [41 Ill.Dec. 453, 407 N.E.2d 951]; <em>State v. Mask, </em>655 S.W.2d 832, 833 n. 1 (Mo.App. 1983); <em>State v. Aragon, </em>99 N.M. 190, 656 P.2d 240, 242 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>99 N.M. 226, 656 P.2d 889 (1983); <em>State v. Ericksen, </em>94 N.M. 128, 607 P.2d 666, 668-669 (1980); <em>State ex rel. Delgado v. Stanley, supra, </em>495 P.2d at 1074-1075; <em>State v. Mills, supra, </em>299 S.E.2d at 205; <em>State v. Moore, </em>51 N.C.App. 26, 275 S.E.2d 257, 260 (1981); <em>Commonwealth v. Johnson, </em>487 Pa. 197, 204, 409 A.2d 308, 311 (1979); <em>Commonwealth v. Whitaker, </em>467 Pa. 436, 359 A.2d 174 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">We believe that the approach taken by cases in the third category is preferable. Ordinarily, treating the 180-day period as beginning to run anew after the refiling of the charges is in accord with Maryland law.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The courts which consider the time during the initial prosecution which has been nol prossed, whether or not the time between prosecutions is regarded as tolled, are to some extent treating the second prosecution as a continuation of the first prosecution. This, however, is inconsistent with the Maryland law regarding a nol pros. Under our decisions, when an indictment or other charging document is nol prossed, ordinarily \u201cthe case [is] terminated,\u201d <em>Ward v. State, </em>290 Md. 76, 84, 427 A.2d 1008 (1981), quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number><em>Barrett v. State, </em>155 Md. 636, 638, 142 A. 96 (1928). As summarized in <em>State v. Moulden, </em>292 Md. 666, 673, 441 A.2d 699 (1982):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-5\">\u201cThe nol pros of a charging document or of a count is \u2018a final disposition\u2019 of the charging document or count; \u2018there can be no further prosecution under\u2019 the nol prossed charging document or count; the matter is \u2018terminated\u2019 at that time; and the accused may be proceeded against for the same offense only under a new or different charging document or count. <em>Barrett v. State, supra, </em>155 Md. at 637-638 [142 A. 96.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-6\"><em>See Hooper v. State, </em>293 Md. 162, 167-168, 443 A.2d 86 (1982). Normally the effect of a nol pros, is as if the charge had never been brought in the first place. <em>State v. Moulden, supra, </em>292 Md. at 673 [441 A.2d 699]; <em>Ward v. State, supra, </em>290 Md. at 84 [427 A.2d 1008].<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In light of this, the only existing prosecution or case is that begun by the new charging document. It is the trial under that prosecution which must be timely commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Moreover, applying the 180-day time period for trial only to the second prosecution, except where the nol pros was intended to or did circumvent the 180-day deadline, is consistent with the principal purpose of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746. We have pointed out that \u00a7 591 and Rule 746 were not intended to be codifications of the constitutional speedy trial right. <em>State v. Frazier, supra, </em>298 Md. at 428 [470 A.2d 1269]. Instead, their chief purpose was to operate as a prophylactic measure \u201cto further society\u2019s interest in the prompt disposition of criminal trials by providing an impetus to remedy court congestion----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 456 [470 A.2d 1269]. This purpose is ordinarily not violated when a prior prosecution against the defendant has been nol prossed and thus is removed from the court\u2019s docket, and when the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>under the new prosecution is commenced within the time period prescribed by \u00a7 591 and Rule 746.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">Nevertheless we do adhere to the exception set forth in the previously cited cases, namely that the time period will begin to run anew with the second prosecution only where the earlier nol pros was not intended to or did not circumvent the requirements of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746. Otherwise the state could regularly evade \u00a7 591 and Rule 746. If, whenever the state desired a trial postponement beyond 180 days, it could nol pros the case, refile the same charges, and thereby cause the time period to start running anew, the requirements of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746 would largely be rendered meaningless. By such method the state could regularly escape the necessity, mandated by the statute and rule, of showing good cause for a postponement and obtaining an order of the administrative judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The trial court in the present case recognized that the time period set forth in \u00a7 591 and Rule 746 should not begin to run anew with the second prosecution where it was shown that the purpose of the nol pros was to evade the requirements of the statute and rule. The exception recognized by the trial court, however, is too limited. Where the state\u2019s action necessarily circumvents the statute and rule prescribing a deadline for trial, this should be sufficient to continue the time period running with the initial prosecution. <em>See, e.g., Carter v. State, </em>280 Ark. 34, 655 S.W.2d 379 (1983); <em>State v. Lucero, </em>91 N.M. 26, 569 P.2d 952, 956-957 (1977); <em>State ex rel. Delgado v. Stanley, supra, </em>495 P.2d at 1074-1075; <em>Commonwealth v. Whitaker, supra, </em>359 A.2d at 176-177. In the last cited case, the prosecuting attorney nol prossed charges only two days prior to the deadline for trial, giving as the reason an insufficiency of admissible evidence; nevertheless the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that this amounted to evasion of the speedy trial rule, causing the time period to run from the initial prosecution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>with no tolling. <em>See also Com. v. Lowe, 255 </em>Pa.Super. 78, 386 A.2d 144, 146 (1978), pointing out that a \u201csalient\u201d factor in <em>Whitaker </em>was \u201cthat the time for trial under Rule 1100 was so close to expiring____\u201d In fact, no case has been brought to our attention in which a court has clung to the view that the running of the speedy trial period begins with the second indictment when confronted with facts indicating that the necessary effect of the \u25a0 earlier nol pros was to defeat the time limitation imposed by the statute or rule. Adoption of such a view might open the door to widespread evasion of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">We hold, therefore, that when a circuit court criminal case is nol prossed, and the state later has the same charges refiled, the 180-day period for trial prescribed by \u00a7 591 and Rule 746 ordinarily begins to run with the arraignment or first appearance of defense counsel under the second prosecution. If, however, it is shown that the nol pros had the purpose or the effect of circumventing the requirements of \u00a7591 and Rule 746, the 180-day period will commence to run with the arraignment or first appearance of counsel under the first prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">In the instant case, the nol pros clearly circumvented the requirements of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746. When the nol pros was entered on March 23, 1981, which was the final day for trial, it was too late for compliance with \u00a7 591 and Rule 746. At the time a trial date had not even been assigned. The case could not have been tried on March 23rd, as the defendant, his counsel, and witnesses were not present. There was no reason for them to have been present, as March 23rd was not the assigned trial date. As of the close of business on March 23rd, the case would have had to have been dismissed for violation of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746. In reality, the prosecution had already lost this case under \u00a7 591 and Rule 746 when the nol pros was filed. Regardless of the prosecuting attorney\u2019s motives, the necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>effect of the nol pros was an attempt to evade the dismissal resulting from the failure to try the case within 180 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">CASE REMANDED TO THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS WITH DIRECTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY, AND TO REMAND THE CASE TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO DISMISS.

The date established for the trial of the matter shall not be postponed except for good cause shown by the moving party and only with the permission of the administrative judge of the court where the matter is pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">(b) The judges of the Court of Appeals of Maryland are authorized to establish additional rules of practice and procedure for the implementation of this section in the various circuit courts throughout the State of Maryland.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-13\">Rule 746 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b489-14\">\"Rule 746.

Actually the 180th day was March 21, 1981. Because that date fell on a Saturday, however, Monday, March 23, is considered to be the 180th day for the purpose of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746. <em>See </em>Rule 8 a.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b490-11\">. The State has never claimed that Curley, by requesting a postponer ment of the November 20th trial date, either sought or expressly consented to a trial date in violation of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746. Moreover, any such contention would be inconsistent with our cases. <em>See, e.g., Pennington v.

Curley had been a friend of the victim, who was a passenger in the automobile that Curley had been driving.

In a June 26th letter to Curley\u2019s lawyer, the prosecuting attorney outlined the reason for refiling the charges as follows: \"Upon an appeal to this office by the Anne Arundel County Police Department, the Case Screening and Evaluation Unit of the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office has decided to re-charge Emerson Paul Curley, Jr., with automobile manslaughter and related offenses.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b491-10\">. Curley\u2019s attorney also alleged that Curley\u2019s right to \"due process of law under the Constitution\u201d had been denied because \u201cundue pressure [had] been placed upon [the State\u2019s Attorney] by the police department\u201d which resulted in improper motivation on the part of the prosecution in reopening the nol pros.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b493-9\">.

State, </em>293 Md. 162, 168, 443 A.2d 86 (1982). Also, some jurisdictions may call a motion a \u201cnolle prosequi\u201d when, in fact, it is something different than a nolle prosequi under Maryland law. <em>See, e.g., Klopfer v.

For statutory speedy trial purposes Colorado will look to the trigger date from the first case. If, however, the second complaint charges \"any new, different or additional offense\u201d and the prosecution was not \"attempting to circumvent the speedy trial rule,\u201d Colorado will apparently use the trigger date from the second charges. <em>People v.

My reasons were set forth in my dissent in <em>Calhoun v. State, </em>299 Md. 1, 472 A.2d 436 (1984). One of those reasons pointed to the recommendation by this Court\u2019s Standing Committee on Rules that a rule should prohibit dismissal of a charging document as a sanction for any violation of any rule which was not of constitutional dimension. <em>See </em>proposed Rule 1-201(a), relating to the construction of rules generally and published at 10:10 Md.R.S-7 (May 13, 1983). A majority of this Court rejected that recommendation at a public meeting on June 23, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">Despite that rejection the Rules Committee submitted the same recommendation, as a proposed criminal rule, in its Eighty-seventh Report. <em>See </em>proposed Rule 4-102 published at 10:25 Md.R. S-8 (December 9, 1983). This Court by a vote of 4-3-rejected the resubmitted recommendation at a public meeting on March 21, 1984. I would accept our Rules Committee\u2019s advice and abrogate, either by rulemaking or by judicial overruling, that part of the holding in <em>State v. Hicks, </em>285 Md. 310, 403 A.2d 356 (1979) which adopts the dismissal sanction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
