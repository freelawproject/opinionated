(2) Was the commission required to deny Sheets surgical authorization by its then-current policy concerning Steffee plating procedures? and (3) Should this cause be returned to the commission for further review? For the reasons that follow, we hold that (1) the commission is authorized to approve or disapprove of claimants\u2019 medical costs, (2) the BWC\u2019s Steffee plating policy was merely a guideline and not absolutely binding, and (3) the commission\u2019s order is supported by evidence of record and needs no further review. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals and deny the writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">\n<em>Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">Sugardale did not object or appeal when the court of appeals initially returned this cause to the commission to review the effect of its policy of refusing to authorize Steffee plating; however, it now contends that the commission lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate disputes over medical cost authorization. We consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>this argument because it attacks the commission\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction, and subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived. <em>In re Byard </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 294, 296, 658 N.E.2d 735, 737. But we are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Based on a variety of statutes, we have consistently held that the BWC and the commission share the power to oversee and determine the reasonableness and necessity of health care expenditures. <em>State ex rel. Miller v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 229, 231-232, 643 N.E.2d 113, 115; <em>State ex rel. Campbell v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1971), 28 Ohio St.2d 154, 57 O.O.2d 397, 277 N.E.2d 219. And as the commission points out, its district hearing officers continue to have original jurisdiction under R.C. 4121.34(B)(3) in all \u201ccontested claims matters\u201d (other than those belonging to staff hearing officers) arising under R.C. Chapter 4123, which must include claims for medical costs under R.C. 4123.66. Correspondingly, R.C. 4123.511(C) specifically requires the commission to refer to district hearing officers contested claims against self-insured employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Sugardale\u2019s claimed authority for challenging the commission\u2019s jurisdiction to review medical cost claims is R.C. 4121.121(B)(16)(a) and (17), formerly 4121.121(P)(1) and (Q). Section (B)(16)(a) empowers the BWC administrator to establish a medical section to help standardize medical fees, approve medical procedures, determine eligibility and reasonableness of medical costs, and produce guidelines for payment policies that recognize the usual, customary, and reasonable methods of payment for covered services. Section (B)(17) enables the administrator to appoint panels to review and advise in disputes arising when a health care service has been determined not to be covered or to be medically unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Sugardale claims that these statutes have dispensed with all commission review in medical cost claims because, in describing the peer review panels for such matters, Ohio Adm.Code 4123-7-27(K) specifies that \u201c[t]he panel may conduct an informal hearing, and shall advise the administrator, whose decision shall be final.\u201d However, we are not convinced that by authorizing panels to assist the administrator, the General Assembly empowered the BWC to pass a rule superseding, by a single line, the statutory and common law that has for years recognized the commission\u2019s power to review medical cost claims. Instead, we consider Sheets\u2019s explanation the more likely representation of legislative intent \u2014 that Ohio Adm.Code 4123-7-27(K) refers to the administrator\u2019s decision being final, but only relative to the peer review panel\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Accordingly, we reject Sugardale\u2019s proposition that the commission lacked jurisdiction over Sheets\u2019s request for surgical authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">\n<em>The Commission\u2019s Policy and Order</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">Sugardale also insists that the commission could not authorize a self-insured employer to pay for Sheets\u2019s procedure in the face of the BWC\u2019s former policy to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>deny State Fund claims for Steffee plating surgery and the uniform processing requirements of R.C. 4121.31(A)(3). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The BWC\u2019s policy of denying authorization for procedures that are experimental or not FDA-approved, which generated the policy to deny Steffee plating procedures, was implemented pursuant to R.C. 4123.32(D). That statute describes such policies as \u201cguidelines\u201d and specifies that they are not administrative rules as defined by R.C. 119.01. Thus, the policy of denying payment for Steffee plating surgery is not so legally binding that it cannot be set aside. Rather, the policy could reasonably be disregarded when medical evidence removes the usual justification for rejecting these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Thus, as long as the BWC does not discriminate against self-insured employers by always requiring them to pay for surgeries such as the Steffee plating procedure, but refusing to authorize such surgeries in State Fund claims, the BWC is within its rights to lift its policy whenever it sees fit. And here, there is no compelling evidence of discrimination. As the court of appeals\u2019 magistrate observed, the BWC\u2019s peer review committee authorized payment of this procedure in the case of Alan Wagner\u2019s State Fund claim, and that evidence undercuts Sugardale\u2019s conspiracy theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">The question remaining is whether we should give this cause back to the commission again to see if the misimpression that Sheets\u2019s claim was subjected to peer review made a difference in authorizing his surgery. We agree with the court of appeals that further review is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">The commission may have been mistaken about who received peer review approval for a Steffee plating procedure; however, the fact that the approval was given to <em>someone </em>is still some evidence of its medical legitimacy, as well as a basis for authorizing it, the usual policy notwithstanding. Moreover, the policy of denying Steffee plating authorization was abandoned in 1996, shortly after Sheets\u2019s surgery, and the commission has already determined that \u201call medical evidence on file supports the claimant\u2019s request for surgery with Steffee plating.\u201d Based on this evidence, the conclusion that Sheets\u2019s surgery was reasonable and necessary is all but inevitable. We simply cannot countenance adding yet another layer of review to stave off this foregone conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">The court of appeals\u2019 judgment, therefore, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed and writ denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b539-11\">Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AMx\">Moyer, C.J., and Cook, J., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Cook, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ai49\">dissenting. I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s holding to the extent that it denies a'writ of mandamus granting further commission review in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">In complying with the court of appeals\u2019 order to determine the effect of the policy to deny authorization for Steffee plating surgery, the commission found that the policy was in effect when it approved Sheets\u2019s surgery, but also that the policy could be overcome on a case-by-case basis with sufficient medical evidence. The commission then seemed to find such evidence in the expert peer review opinion it mistakenly ascribed to Sheets\u2019s claim. This is why the court of appeals\u2019 magistrate found the commission\u2019s mistake so significant. Apparently, the magistrate was concerned that the commission had relied on the peer review evidence as necessary to overcome the general rule against authorizing Steffee plating procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">I agree with the magistrate\u2019s assessment of the commission\u2019s order. The order suggests that the commission authorized Sheets\u2019s surgery based on an erroneous conclusion that the surgery was supported by expert opinion in addition to that of Dr. Krell. Thus, at best, the majority\u2019s denial of any relief ignores our tradition of returning ambiguous or confusing orders to the commission for clarification. <em>State ex rel. Buttolph v. Gen. Motors Corp., Terex Div. </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 73, 75, 679 N.E.2d 702, 704. And at worst, the majority opinion runs afoul of the fundamental principle that the commission\u2019s orders must be based on some evidence with adequate explanation. <em>State ex rel. Noll v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 203, 567 N.E.2d 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Accordingly, I would grant a writ of mandamus for the limited purpose of ordering the commission to review the effect of considering the wrong peer review on its decision to authorize Sheets\u2019s surgery.</p>\n<judges id=\"b540-7\">Moyer, C.J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
