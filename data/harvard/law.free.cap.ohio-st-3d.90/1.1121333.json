The complaint must allege the specific misconduct that violates the Disciplinary Rules and <em>relator must prove such misconduct by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Ohio State Bar Assn. v. Reid </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 327, 708 N.E.2d 193, at paragraph two of the syllabus. While the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline makes recommendations to this court, it is this court that renders the final determination of the facts and conclusions of law in disciplinary proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">This is a difficult case to decide because it relies solely on the credibility of the witnesses for proof. Upon independent review of all the evidence in this case, we agree with the board that there is insufficient evidence to prove (1) that respondent violated DR 7-102(A)(3) and (5) (he lied or concealed information), and (2) that respondent violated DR 7-102(A)(4) and (8) (he used signals to influence his client\u2019s testimony). However, contrary to the board\u2019s findings, we find that relator did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that (1) respondent violated DR 7-102(A)(6) and (7) (he instructed his client to lie) or (2) that respondent violated DR 4 \u2014 101(B)(2) (he used client confidences to the disadvantage of the client).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">We find that there is evidence in the record that undermines the credibility of Traci Mackey\u2019s testimony. In addition, we find that there is no evidence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>corroborate her testimony, while there are multiple credible witnesses whose testimony supports respondent. We do not lightly disregard the findings of the panel. They are conscientious and dedicated individuals who had an opportunity to see and hear the witnesses and to judge their credibility. However, we also recognize that we must make the final determination using the clear-and-convincing-evidence standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">DR Y \u2014 102(A)(6) and (7)</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The board found that respondent violated DR 7 \u2014 102(A)(6) and (7) when' he instructed Traci Mackey not to disclose relevant and truthful information in an effort to prevail in the Chontay custody motion. DR 7-102(A)(6) and (7) state that an attorney shall not \u201c[participate in the creation or preservation of evidence when he knows * * * that the evidence is false\u201d and shall not \u201c[cjounsel * * * his client in conduct that the lawyer knows to be * * * fraudulent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">a. Summary of Relator\u2019s Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">In her testimony before the panel, Traci Mackey alleged that in 1992, just prior to the psychological evaluation ordered in the Chontay custody case, she disclosed to respondent that she, Chontay, and Aaron had been abused by her husband, Russell Crow. The allegations included sexual abuse of Traci Mackey and Chontay and physical abuse of Traci Mackey, Chontay, and Aaron, including attacks against Traci Mackey with a knife and a chair. She alleged that Russell Crow\u2019s abuse was documented in written police reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">Traci Mackey testified that she disclosed the abuse allegations to respondent at his office and her home. She testified that she discussed the abuse with respondent \u201cmany times.\u201d \u201cUsually they [the conversations] took place over the phone and then I would go see him.\u201d Traci Mackey admitted that she did not have a driver\u2019s license but claimed that friends drove her to respondent\u2019s office on those occasions when she went to discuss Russell Crow\u2019s abusive nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">Despite the alleged disclosure of Russell Crow\u2019s abuse to respondent, Traci Mackey alleged that respondent instructed her to lie to the doctor and tell him that Russell Crow was a \u201cwonderful father, that he had a wonderful relationship with the kids.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">Finally, Traci Mackey testified that she also described Russell Crow\u2019s abusive nature to Robroy Crow, the attorney who represented her in her divorce from Russell Crow.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">b. Summary of Respondent\u2019s Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">In support of respondent, Russell Crow, Traci Mackey\u2019s ex-husband, testified that respondent never instructed him or Traci Mackey to lie to the doctor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>conducting the psychiatric evaluation. In fact, Russell Crow testified that respondent instructed him and Traci Mackey \u201cto be honest with the doctor, tell him the truth.\u201d Russell Crow also testified that respondent never came to their (Russell and Traci Crow\u2019s) house for a meeting. He also testified that he was the only person to drive Traci to respondent\u2019s office because she had no friends in the area to give her rides to respondent\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">Respondent testified on his own behalf. Respondent stated that Traci Mackey \u201cnever\u201d indicated to him that Russell Crow was abusive. He also testified that he never counseled Traci Mackey to lie in the psychological evaluation.' Respondent testified that he never met with Traci Mackey alone before the divorce action. Finally, he testified that 'he had never met Traci Mackey at her residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Robroy Crow testified that contrary to Traci Mackey\u2019s assertion, she never disclosed to him that Russell Crow had abused her. He also testified that had he been aware of any abuse, he would have attempted to introduce it in the divorce case.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">c. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Traci Mackey\u2019s testimony is the sole evidence in support of the DR 7-102(A)(6) and (7) violations. The board found that \u201c[h]er testimony was too detailed and specific not to be found to be credible.\u201d However, we find that the record reveals information that we believe erodes the credibility of her testimony. This, in conjunction with the testimony of three witnesses that directly contradicts Traci Mackey\u2019s testimony, leads us to determine that the evidence is not clear and convincing that respondent violated DR 7-\u00cd02(A)(6) or (7).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Traci Mackey admitted to the panel that she lied to the examining psychologist in the Chontay custody case about Russell Crow\u2019s alleged abuse, even though she knew that a lie would keep Chontay with this allegedly abusive man. Relator\u2019s counsel asked Traci Mackey, \u201cdid you, in fact, lie in those psychological evaluations?\u201d She answered, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">Traci Mackey also admitted to the panel that she had lied under oath in a court of law. Specifically, a member of the panel posed the following question: \u201cThe signals, were those signals ever intended for you to lie on the witness stand?\u201d She answered, \u201cI did lie.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">Traci Mackey admitted that she lied on several other occasions. She admitted that she lied to her husband about an affair that she was having with Dwayne Mackey. It is apparent from the record that she lied to Deborah Mackey, Dwayne Mackey\u2019s wife, about her affair with Dwayne Mackey. In fact, Traci Mackey persuaded Deborah Mackey to let her move in with Deborah and Dwayne, claiming that Russell Crow had assaulted her, even though Traci <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>Mackey had been having an affair for several months with Deborah Mackey\u2019s husband. She engaged in further deception by having Deborah Mackey baby-sit her children while she and Deborah Mackey\u2019s husband would go to a motel and engage in sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Traci Mackey\u2019s admission of the aforementioned lies erodes her credibility with regard to her allegations against respondent. The lies she admitted to in her divorce case were of a particularly deceptive nature. Yet even more detrimental to her credibility were her admitted lies that occurred in court, where a person is sworn to tell the truth, and in the court-related psychiatric examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">We also find that the record reveals that Traci Mackey has a propensity for making unsubstantiated allegations. She alleged that Russell Crow abused her, Chontay, and Reid, as well as her son Aaron. However, to date, nothing in the record indicates that any of these claims have been substantiated. In fact, at one point, Children\u2019s Services directed her to stop bringing Chontay into the hospital for exams based on these unsubstantiated allegations because doing so was abusive in and of itself to Chontay.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Finally, Traci Mackey accused Rochelle Baumline of being racist and of threatening to run someone over with a car. Again these allegations are unsubstantiated by the record. We find that Traci Mackey\u2019s propensity for making unsubstantiated allegations further erodes her credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">Traci Mackey filed her grievance against respondent on October 17,1997. The relator filed the initial complaint on April 6, 1998. It alleged that respondent used confidences gained by him to Traci Mackey\u2019s disadvantage in violation of DR 4 \u2014 101(B)(2). It was not until eight months after the initial complaint, and fourteen months after the filing of the grievance, on December 10, 1998, that relator filed an amended complaint with the additional allegations that respondent had instructed Traci Mackey to lie.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">The allegation that respondent instructed Mackey to lie arose from respondent\u2019s representation of Traci Mackey in the early 1990s. We find it suspect that Traci Mackey apparently failed to disclose or remember this allegation until eight months after the initial complaint was filed and some fourteen months after the grievance was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">An allegation of counseling a client to lie is not an insignificant charge that the accuser would disregard or forget. Yet the claim was not asserted until fourteen months after the initial grievance was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>A divorce strains emotions, especially where a parent loses custody of a child. Traci Mackey had just been through a divorce and lost custody of her son, Reid, to her ex-husband, Russell Crow. Such emotions could have motivated Traci Mackey to seek retribution. Thus, Traci Mackey had a motive to fabricate the allegations against respondent. This could explain why Traci Mackey did not file the allegation that respondent lied until some fourteen months after she filed her initial grievance. It would also explain the malpractice action she filed against respondent because much as a criminal verdict may support a civil action for damages, a successful disciplinary action may support a malpractice action for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">We find that the fourteen-month delay in asserting these additional allegations, with no justification for the delay, further erodes Traci Mackey\u2019s credibility with regard to the allegations that respondent instructed her to lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Finally, Traci Mackey\u2019s testimony made reference to two separate instances that we believe provided the relator with a prime opportunity to bolster her testimony with probative, corroborative evidence. The first instance pertained to her testimony that she first divulged and subsequently discussed Russell Crow\u2019s abusive nature to respondent at his office. Traci Mackey admitted that she had to rely on friends to give her a ride to respondent\u2019s office because her driver\u2019s license was expired. However, Russell Crow testified that he was her only ride to respondent\u2019s office. And respondent testified that he never met with Traci Mackey alone. Relator had a prime opportunity to impeach the testimony of respondent\u2019s witnesses\u2019 testimony by presenting a witness who would testify that he or she chauffeured Traci Mackey to respondent\u2019s office as she claimed. However, relator provided no such witness(es).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Traci Mackey also testified that written police reports were made pertaining to Russell Crow\u2019s abusive episodes. Yet the relator failed to submit a single copy of a police report in this regard or provide any explanation as to why such documentation was unavailable. Copies of police reports would have verified Russell Crow\u2019s abusive nature and in turn supported Traci Mackey\u2019s testimony that she divulged this critical information to respondent and Robroy Crow.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Contrary to relator\u2019s case, we find the witnesses testifying in support of respondent to be credible. These witnesses included respondent, Russell Crow, and Robroy Crow.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">Respondent presented his own case to this court and emphatically denied that he had counseled Traci Mackey to lie. In addition to these assertions, respondent presented several witnesses that testified favorably to respondent\u2019s credibility and reputation. Attorney R. Edward Marks of Advocates for Basic Legal Equality, Inc. (\u201cABLE\u201d) testified as to respondent\u2019s reputation. Marks, who operated ABLE\u2019s legal aid program, made numerous referrals to respondent and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>had received positive evaluations. Marks testified that he found respondent to have a \u201chigh reputation for personal integrity and professional competence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Doug Bonnoront, a personal friend and client of respondent, testified that respondent was trustworthy and \u201cvery ethical.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Bruce Brimley, acting municipal court judge and respondent\u2019s current employer, testified: \u201cI guess in sum, if I didn\u2019t believe in John\u2019s integrity and John\u2019s honesty, I would not be here testifying on his behalf and he would not be working for me and I think the fact that he works for me testifies as to my opinion as to his integrity, his candor and his honesty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Finally, respondent submitted several letters from peers, from a common pleas judge, and a former employer that praise respondent\u2019s honesty, integrity, and high moral ethics.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">In an apparent attempt to discredit respondent, the relator presented the testimony of attorney Patti Baumgartner-Novak. She testified that respondent can be difficult at times and will fight in cases where others would settle. She stated that not many attorneys litigate cases to trial in Hancock County but admitted that respondent had a duty to go to trial if his client did not want to settle. She also testified about an incident where she suspected that respondent had advised two of his clients not to return a child to Ohio even though he was under a court order to do so. However, she admitted that respondent, on record, denied giving that advice. No proof or evidence was ever presented that respondent had not been truthful and Baumgartner-Novak conceded that she had never heard anyone say that respondent was dishonest.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">Barbara Larick also testified to another incident where she felt that respondent acted in a case with a possible conflict of interest. But she admitted that respondent withdrew after she challenged him on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">While Baumgartner-Novak and other witnesses challenged respondent\u2019s style of practice, neither she nor any of relator\u2019s witnesses presented any evidence to attack respondent\u2019s credibility, the issue at stake here.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">Having observed his demeanor in presenting his case before this court, we find respondent\u2019s testimony credible. Respondent\u2019s credibility is bolstered by the testimony and letters of his employers, friends, and colleagues and by relator\u2019s failure to successfully attack respondent\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">Russell Crow testified that respondent told him and Traci to tell the truth to the doctor conducting the psychological examination in the Chontay case. His testimony corroborates respondent\u2019s testimony in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">However, perhaps the most persuasive testimony was that of attorney Robroy Crow. In our view, he provided key testimony, because it corroborates respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>dent\u2019s testimony that Traci Mackey never disclosed Russell Crow\u2019s abuse. Yet the panel never addressed why they disregarded Robroy Crow\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Traci Mackey alleged that during her divorce case, she disclosed Russell Crow\u2019s abuse to Robroy Crow, but that Robroy Crow told her that \u201cit was irrelevant * * * because of the circumstances surrounding the divorce, that I would lose anyway.\u201d However, Robroy Crow testified that Traci Mackey never told him that Russell Crow was abusive. He indicated that had he known of the abuse, he would have used the evidence in the divorce proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Robroy Crow is an attorney experienced in domestic law. Thus, he knew the value of this information in winning Traci Mackey custody of her son and bis obligation as an attorney to use it. There is no credible evidence in the record as to why Robroy Crow would advise Traci Mackey that Russell Crow\u2019s abusive nature was irrelevant to determination of the custody of their son, which would have been a blatant violation of his obligation to her. In fact, upon direct examination of Traci Mackey in the divorce proceeding, Robroy Crow made a detailed inquiry as to Russell Crow\u2019s fitness as a father, giving Traci Mackey a golden opportunity to expose the abuse. Yet, the only faults as a father that she testified to were that he slept too much and occasionally failed to put shoes or socks on their child.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because Traci Mackey failed to testify as to Russell Crow\u2019s abuse, especially when the custody of her son was at stake, we are inclined to believe that she either did not tell Robroy Crow of Russell Crow\u2019s abuse or that in fact Russell Crow was not abusive. Under either scenario, Robroy Crow was unaware of any abuse inflicted by Russell Crow. Such a conclusion only corroborates respondent\u2019s position that Traci Mackey never disclosed Russell Crow\u2019s alleged abusive nature to him either.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Accordingly, we find that Robroy Crow\u2019s testimony that Traci Mackey never informed him of Russell Crow\u2019s alleged abuse was credible. This conclusion tends to discount the allegation that Russell Crow was abusive and strikes another blow against Traci Mackey\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">Finally, and perhaps more persuasive than our individual analysis of each witness\u2019s credibility, is the collective effect of the testimony presented by respondent compared to the relator\u2019s case, which relied almost solely on the testimony of Traci Mackey. Respondent and Robroy Crow testified that Traci Mackey never informed them of the alleged abuse. Neither recalled having seen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>any abuse marks on Traci Mackey\u2019s body, which she alleged were visible when she spoke to both of them. Both respondent and Robroy Crow would have known the importance of the abuse and their obligation to disclose it in their respective cases, but each failed to do so despite the fact that they could have disclosed it easily.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">In weighing the evidence, we note that respondent presented three witnesses who testified that respondent did not violate DR 7-102(A)(6) or (7). The credibility of these witnesses was never effectively impeached. Their testimony was consistent and appealed to logic and common sense. Conversely, relator relied primarily upon a single witness to prove that respondent violated DR 7-102(A)(6) and (7). There are many questions pertaining to the credibility, logic, and common sense of her testimony, as well as a failure to corroborate several key portions of her testimony. Thus, we are compelled to find that relator failed to present clear and convincing evidence that respondent violated DR 7-102(A)(6) or (7).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">DR 4-101(B)(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">The board also found that \u201cRespondent violated DR 4-101(B)(2) when he used confidential information that he knew regarding Traci Mackey, especially her relationship with her children, and other relationships, in seeking to obtain custody of the child born of her marriage with Russell Crow.\u201d DR 4-101(B)(2) prohibits an attorney from \u201c[using] a confidence or secret of his client to the disadvantage of the client.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">a. Summary of Relator\u2019s Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">In her testimony before the panel, referring to the period of time prior to the divorce, Traci Mackey stated that \u201cMr. Filkins [respondent] and Rusty [Russell Crow] and I, we, all of the, well, a lot of meetings we had, it wasn\u2019t just attorney-client go ins, do your business and leave. I mean, we talked about friends, we talked about his wife, she was going to have a baby at that time.\u201d Traci Mackey confirmed that many of the conversations with respondent were social in nature, pertaining to their children, soccer, and the birth of respondent\u2019s child.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">In answering a question about what confidences imparted to respondent were used by him in representing Russell Crow in the divorce, Traci Mackey stated, \u201cWell, everything, I think, was used against me in the divorce. Mr. Filkins knew about, like I said, everything about me. He knew everything about my children. He knew, you know, if I would lose one of my children I would be devastated. He knew everything and I believe he used everything he had against me, every ounce of me.\u201d When asked by a member of the panel to be more specific, she stated, \u201cI\u2019m going to have to say it would be, again, that my children are very important to me because during recess of that case there was a threat made from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>John Filkins to Robroy Crow stating that if I didn\u2019t stop with trying to get custody away from Rusty that I would pay and that I would lose my son and that was my threat, so that he knew how to threaten me by using my children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">b. Summary of Respondent\u2019s Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">When asked what confidences he used against Traci Mackey, respondent testified, \u201c[A]s I sit here today, I can\u2019t tell you of any.\u201d Robroy Crow also indicated that he did not believe that respondent used any confidences.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">c. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">The vague allegation that \u201che used everything he had against me\u201d is unsupported by any specifics in the record. Although there is no definition of \u201cconfidence\u201d as the term is used in DR 4 \u2014 101(B)(2), the following two cases provide some guidance as to its meaning. In <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Osborne </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 140, 1 OBR 175, 438 N.E.2d 114, the court held that the respondent used a confidence to his own advantage in violation of DR 4-101(B)(3). In <em>Osborne, </em>the respondent and his client transacted several business deals between them. The respondent in effect represented himself as well as his client in these deals, and the client lost money. Although the court never identified a specific confidence that respondent used to his advantage, the violation was evident. It is virtually axiomatic that where an attorney represents himself and his client in a business deal, and the client loses money on the deal, a presumption arises that the attorney used client confidences to his client\u2019s disadvantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">In <em>Greater Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Watkins </em>(1981), 68 Ohio St.2d 11, 22 O.O.3d 125, 427 N.E.2d 516, the respondent attorney used his client\u2019s confidence to his own advantage in violation of DR 4-101(B)(3). In <em>Watkins, </em>a fee disagreement prompted respondent\u2019s client to file a grievance with the bar association. During the investigation of the grievance, respondent called the client\u2019s' employer, told him that he knew of the employer\u2019s \u201cunder the table\u201d payments to the client, and threatened to go to the authorities unless the grievance was dropped. The information that the client had been paid under the table had been imparted to the respondent in his role as attorney and was used against the client. Thus, respondent was found to have violated DR 4-101(B)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">Unlike <em>Osborne </em>and <em>Watkins, </em>the \u201cconfidences\u201d Traci Mackey identifies in her testimony are merely generic statements of her love for her children, which could apply to virtually any parent. Further, the fact that a client cherishes his or her child is hardly the sort of information that can be used in a custody case to the disadvantage of the client. Therefore, we decline to define the broad statements identified by Mackey as \u201cconfidences\u201d for purposes of DR 4-101(B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>During her divorce with Russell Crow, Traci Mackey petitioned the court to issue a shared-parenting plan for Reid. A review of the transcript of the divorce proceeding reveals that respondent never used any of the \u201cconfidences\u201d identified by Mackey in the divorce proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">In sum, we can find no specific fact or information that would have come from respondent\u2019s prior representation of Traci Mackey that was used as the basis for Reid Crow\u2019s custody determination. No references were made to the custody battle for Chontay. No information, history, doctor or psychology reports from the prior three matters were ever mentioned; all of the questioning by respondent dealt with Traci Mackey\u2019s then-current lifestyle and plans for work and child care.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">In addition, attorney Robroy Crow, who represented Traci Mackey, presented an affidavit, which stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">\u201c4. That Affiant did not regard any prior and terminated representation by [respondent] as an issue to be raised in the case <em>Traci Lynn Crow vs Russell Alan Crow.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\"><em>\u201c5. </em>That Affiant never saw, believed, or concluded that [respondent] had any confidential information about Traci Lynn Crow which could be considered detrimental to Traci Lynn Crow in the case, <em>Traci Lynn Crow vs Russell Alan Crow.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">\u201c6. To the best of Affiant\u2019s knowledge and belief, [respondent] did not use any confidential information about Traci Lynn Crow to the disadvantage or prejudice of Traci Lynn Crow in the case, <em>Traci Lynn Crow vs Russell Alan Crow.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">Robroy Crow, Traci Mackey\u2019s attorney in her divorce proceeding, was in the best position to evaluate the evidence and determine whether his opponent had used confidential information. Respondent testified that he disclosed his prior representation of Traci Mackey to Robroy Crow and that Traci Mackey had no issue with respondent representing Russell Crow. Relator never refuted this. However, the panel seemed to totally ignore this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">Instead, the panel apparently relied in part on the testimony of attorney Barbara Larick as corroborating Traci Mackey\u2019s testimony. However, an examination of Barbara Larick\u2019s testimony is not persuasive on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-12\">On direct examination, Larick stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b164-13\">\u201cI said something to John about, how can you do this? Don\u2019t you have an obligation to zealously represent your client and use everything that you could possibly use and he said, I did use everything. He said, why do you think we won in the prior divorce case, he got custody, meaning that Mr. Crow had gotten custody of the couple\u2019s son, Reed [sic] Allen Crow, in the divorce matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-14\">However, on cross-examination, Barbara Larick backtracked:</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>\u201cA. He didn\u2019t say I had used, that he had used everything. He just said, I did use \u2014 I said, how can you use the information and he said, I did use it, why do you think we won, he got custody, didn\u2019t he?</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\"><em>(( % </em># *</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">\u201cQ. I think you\u2019ve already said this, I want to make sure I heard. Mr. Filkins did not detail this information to you <em>[ie., </em>the information he knew as a result of representing Traci]?</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">\u201cA. No. Mr. Filkins did not detail the information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">Larick interprets respondent\u2019s remark to mean that he used confidential information. Yet it is clear from her testimony that Larick does not have any personal knowledge that respondent used any confidences against Traci Mackey. The respondent could just as easily have been referring to the evidence in the divorce case.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">In fact, in awarding custody of Reid to Russell Crow, the magistrate in his decision stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">\u201cThe parties have, at times, demonstrated the ability to work together on parenting issues. This is evidenced by the parties trying different parenting arrangements on their own. Ultimately, however, this proved to be unsuccessful and resulted in conflict. The Plaintiff [Traci Mackey] will be moving in the next couple of weeks. Although she will be less than an hour and one-half from Defendant [Russell Crow], this will also make shared parenting difficult.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">\u201cThe child has lived most of his young life in Findlay, most recently in the marital home where the Defendant continues to reside. He attends day care in Findlay. His extended family is in the Findlay area. The Plaintiff is moving to Port Clinton, Ohio, to get a new start. This move would require the child to move to a new city, away from his day care, away from his father, and away from extended family.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-12\">\u201cThe Plaintiff stated she is moving to get a fresh start. She plans at some time to be residing with her boyfriend. The Plaintiff did not explain how this could be construed to be in Reid\u2019s best interests. She, herself, stated that Reid will be harmed by such a move. She also admitted putting her own interests ahead of those of her children. It also appears that the Plaintiff will have limited time available to parent Reid. She plans on working at a day care, starting in the early morning, and she also has a restaurant job in the evening. The Plaintiff stated she was not sure how she was going to combine this employment. The Plaintiff will be doing all this while pursuing a new relationship with another man. Although the Plaintiff will be at the day care center when Reid is there as a cook [sic], she will have limited contact with him during the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>\u201cThe Plaintiffs shared parenting plan is found not to be in Reid\u2019s best interests. The Defendant should be designated as the residential parent for Reid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">None of the reasons delineated in the magistrate's decision in awarding custody of Reid to Russell Crow corresponds with the \u201cconfidences\u201d that Traci Mackey identified in her testimony. Further, the reasons cited by the magistrate (Traci Mackey\u2019s move, her affair, her employment plans) were not known to respondent before he represented Russell Crow in his divorce from Traci Mackey.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">In addition, respondent testified that he revealed his prior representation of Traci Mackey to Robroy Crow and received clearance for him to represent Russell Crow in the divorce proceeding. Robroy Crow testified that respondent did not disclose any of Traci Mackey\u2019s \u201cconfidences\u201d in the divorce proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Barbara Larick\u2019s conclusory statement, standing alone, does not rise to the level of clear and convincing evidence that respondent violated any client confidences when compared to the testimony of Robroy Crow, who was in the best position to know the facts. While the better practice would have been to decline to further represent Russell Crow in the subsequent divorce, these facts simply do not rise to the level of a Disciplinary Rule violation. And in fact, once Barbara Larick did raise the issue when Traci Mackey moved for a change of custody, respondent promptly withdrew. As he explained in his testimony:</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">\u201cThere was also a Motion filed by Traci\u2019s counsel at that point, Barbara Larick, to have me withdrawn as counsel on Russ\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">\u201cI would have spoken with Russ and would have indicated to him, in essence, I don\u2019t want this to be a distraction from your issue. I don\u2019t want my representation to detract from your seeking to continue as residential parent and the best way to do that at this point is for you to obtain other counsel. I don\u2019t want this to become an issue about me versus an issue about you being residential parent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">For all the aforementioned reasons, we find that relator has failed to prove that respondent violated DR 4-101(B)(2) by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">Accordingly, because we find that relator has failed to prove the alleged disciplinary violations by clear and convincing evidence, we decline to accept the recommendation of the board and dismiss the charges against respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-12\">\n<em>Cause dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b166-13\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer and Cook, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b166-14\">Douglas, J., concurs in judgment.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b158-11\">. The amended complaint also alleged that respondent used signals to instruct Mackey how to testify, a violation of DR 7-102(A)(4), (6), and (7). However, because we have affirmed the board\u2019s finding that there was insufficient evidence to prove this charge and because we are addressing the allegations that respondent counseled Mackey to lie, we find no reason to further discuss this allegation here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b161-9\">. Deborah Mackey relates one incident that occurred after Traci Mackey started her affair with Dwayne Mackey in which Traci alleged that her husband, Russell Crow, \u201cbeat her up.\u201d However, Russell Crow conveys a much different account of that event. Moreover, if all the alleged abuse did indeed occur it makes no sense that Deborah Mackey would relate this single incident to the exclusion of arguably more grave alleged previous incidents of sexual and physical abuse against Traci Mackey and her children, including the alleged attack with a knife.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
