The court of appeals did say, to be sure, that \u201cwe hold that R.C. 2151.031(D) is constitutionally applicable to a child born alive with post-birth symptoms of the exposure of illegal drugs by the child\u2019s mother to the viable fetus.\u201d This would seem to be something less than an affirmance of the trial court\u2019s finding that a fetus is a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>The issue arises because Kimbrough contends that the trial court and the court \u2022of appeals have assumed authority that the General Assembly did not provide when the courts permitted SCDHS to take custody of Lorenzo to the exclusion of Kimbrough. The statute in question, R.C. 2151.031, and specifically subsection (D), provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">\u201cAs used in this chapter, an \u2018abused child\u2019 includes any child who:</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\"><em>U </em>* :\u00a1: :\u00a1;</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">\u201c(D) Because of the acts of his parents, * * * suffers physical or mental injury that harms or threatens to harm the child\u2019s health or welfare.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">R.C. 2151.011(B) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">\u201cAs used in this chapter:</p>\n<p id=\"b351-11\"><em>(i </em>* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b351-12\">\u201c(6)(a) \u2018Child\u2019 means a person who is under eighteen years of age * * \u201cPerson\u201d is not defined in R.C. 2151.011.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-13\">Kimbrough contends that since the definition of \u201cchild\u201d does not include a fetus, the General Assembly meant to exclude a fetus from the definition of \u201cchild\u201d and since, Kimbrough contends, her action of using cocaine, which caused the injury to Lorenzo, occurred while Lorenzo was a fetus \u2014 and not while Lorenzo was a fully born child \u2014 R.C. 2151.031(D), the section defining who is an abused child, cannot be used to remove Lorenzo from her custody or control. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-14\">We do not agree with Kimbrough in either how she has framed the issue or her interpretation of the statute. Accordingly, we find that the issue is not whether a fetus is a child but rather whether the plain language of R.C. 2151.031(D) applies to Lorenzo and the facts of this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Again, R.C. 2151.031(D) provides that, as used in R.C. Chapter 2151, an \u201cabused child\u201d includes any child who, \u201c[b]ecause of the acts of his parents, * * * suffers physical or mental injury that harms or threatens to harm the child\u2019s health or welfare.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>It is clear that the action causing the injury to Lorenzo Was taken by one of his parents, Kimbrough. It is clear that the action taken by Kimbrough caused Lorenzo injury \u2014 both before and after birth. It is clear that after his birth, Lorenzo was a \u201cchild\u201d as defined in R.C. 2151.011(B)(6)(a). It is clear, as the court of appeals ably noted, that the discovery of cocaine in Lorenzo\u2019s system was by a postbirth test rather than by a prenatal test. It is clear, and there can be no doubt, that an alleged abused child, once born, falls under the jurisdiction of the appropriate juvenile court. R.C. 2151.23. It is clear that a child has legal and constitutional rights and that juvenile courts were created, in part, to protect those rights and to empower the state to provide for the care and protection of Ohio\u2019s children. It is clear that there can be no more sacred or precious right of a newborn infant than the right to life and to begin that life, where medically possible, healthy, and uninjured. And it is clear that to ignore these facts, these rights, and the numerous problems presented in these cases is to place our collective heads in the proverbial sand and hope that the vexing questions will somehow just disappear. Well, they will not!</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Thus we apply the statute as written and to the facts of this case. Accordingly, we hold that when a newborn child\u2019s toxicology screen yields a positive result for an illegal drug due to prenatal maternal drug abuse, the newborn is, for purposes of R.C. 2151.031(D), <em>per se </em>an abused child.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.

The appellant, <em>amici, </em>and appellee have all cited a number of cases for our consideration. The cases cited are not on point when the issue is framed as we have framed it and when the specific statute involved and the clear facts of the case at bar are considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-16\">For examples, and the list is not meant to be all-inclusive, appellant, <em>amici, </em>and appellee all cite <em>Werling v. Sandy </em>(1985), 17 Ohio St.3d 45, 17 OBR 37, 476 N.E.2d 1053, and <em>State v. Gray </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 514, 584 N.E.2d 710. Appellant and appellee each cite <em>Jasinsky v. Potts </em>(1950), 153 Ohio St. 529, 42 O.O. 9, 92 N.E.2d 809, and <em>Williams v. Marion Rapid Transit, Inc. </em>(1949), 152 Ohio St. 114, 39 O.O. 433, 87 N.E.2d 334. Appellant cites <em>In re Ruiz </em>(1986), 27 Ohio Misc.2d 31, 27 OBR 350, 500 N.E.2d 935.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-17\">The <em>Williams, Jasinsky, </em>and <em>Werling </em>cases all hinged on the <em>rights </em>of <em>children, </em>born alive or stillborn, to bring, or to have brought on their behalf, an action for injuries sustained because of the negligence of another, while they were still in their mother\u2019s womb. The case now before us <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>involves the <em>rights </em>of a <em>mother </em>with regard to whether her parental rights can be terminated or curtailed. Accordingly, the cited cases are not on point.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">The <em>Gray </em>case was a criminal case and involved whether a mother could be prosecuted for child endangerment where substance abuse occurred during pregnancy. As this was a criminal case, the court was mandated by R.C. 2901.04(A) to strictly construe the criminal statute against the state and liberally construe the statute in favor of the accused. <em>Id., </em>62 Ohio St.3d at 515, 584 N.E.2d at 711. The case at bar is a civil proceeding and involves R.C. Chapter 2151, whose terms are not subject to the strict construction rule. In fact, in this case the opposite is true because R.C. 2151.01 mandates the court to liberally construe and interpret the sections of R.C. Chapter 2151, so as to provide for the care and protection of children and their constitutional and legal rights. Thus, <em>Gray </em>has no application to the case now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">Distinguishing <em>Ruiz </em>presents a more difficult problem but, in any event, the ultimate holding of <em>Ruiz </em>is in accordance with our decision today. Judge Pollex of the Court of Common Pleas of Wood County, Juvenile Division, felt \u201ccompelled to hold that a viable fetus is a child under the existing child abuse statute.\u201d <em>Ruiz, </em>27 Ohio Misc.2d at 35, 27 OBR at 355, 500 N.E.2d at 939. This conclusion was reached after a review of a number of cases including <em>Williams, Jasinsky, </em>and <em>Werling. </em>We have already shown how those cases do not apply in the context of the case now before us. Thus, a child born alive who tests positive at birth for addiction to cocaine suffers from abuse and continued abuse no matter when the original abuse occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b353-5\">Alice Robie Resnick, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aht\">concurring. I concur with the syllabus and the judgment of the majority. I write separately to emphasize the limited scope of the majority\u2019s holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">As the majority correctly concludes, the relevant issue presented for our determination is whether the plain language of R.C. 2151.031(D) is applicable to Lorenzo Blackshear and the specific facts of this case. Accordingly, we need not reach the issue of whether a fetus is a child for purposes of this civil child-abuse statute. Thus, the law announced today is limited to factual scenarios akin to the case at .bar, where a newborn tests positive for an illegal drug, as the result of prenatal maternal substance abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">This is a disturbing issue, especially in light of the fact that a child who is exposed to an illegal drug following its birth and possesses traces of the drug in its system would, without a doubt, be considered an abused child.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">The consequences of prenatal maternal substance abuse are tragic and cannot not be ignored. According to one study, more than five hundred thousand \u201ccocaine-exposed infants\u201d are born in the United States each year. Schueller, The Use of Cocaine by Pregnant Women: Child Abuse or Choice? (1999), 25 J. Legis. 163, 165, citing Spencer, Prosecutorial Immunity: The Response to Prenatal Drug Use (1993), 25 Conn.L.Rev. 393, 394, citing a study by the National Association of Perinatal Addiction Research and Education.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">Accounts of drug-addicted newborns elicit intense emotional responses, such as anger and disbelief. We question how mothers can inflict this type of harm on their innocent children. Moreover, the full-extent of harm done is often not known and, therefore, these children face uncertain futures.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">While the number of drug-addicted newborns reaches epidemic proportions, and society searches for methods to deal with this crisis, this court must adhere to its duty to interpret the laws in accordance with the General Assembly\u2019s intent. To do otherwise would yield consequences reaching far beyond those either \u2022intended or anticipated by the General Assembly. The majority must be commended for exercising restraint.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-11\">\u201c \u2018 \u201cA court should not place a tenuous construction on [a] statute to address a problem to which the legislative attention is readily directed and which it can readily resolve if in its judgment it is an appropriate subject of legislation.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Gray </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 514, 518, 584 N.E.2d 710, 713, quoting <em>People </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number><em>v. Hardy </em>(1991), 188 Mich.App. 305, 310, 469 N.W.2d 50, 53, and <em>People v. Gilbert </em>(1982), 414 Mich. 191, 212-213, 324 N.W.2d 834, 844. The courts are neither authorized nor properly equipped to make public policy determinations. If the General Assembly wants to include a fetus within the definition of a \u201cchild\u201d for purposes of R.C. 2151.031, it certainly knows how to do so.</p>\n<judges id=\"b354-5\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in the foregoing concurring opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b354-6\">Cook, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ALE\">dissenting. Appellant\u2019s sole proposition of law asks this court to decide that R.C. 2151.031(D) excludes unborn fetuses from the definition of \u201cabused child.\u201d But as the majority notes, even if fetuses were excluded from the definition, a reasonable construction of the statute could support the adjudication of a <em>newborn </em>as an abused child for injuries inflicted prebirth. Division (D) does not require that the parents <em>inflict injury after birth. </em>It merely requires that the child <em>suffer injury, </em>due to an act by the parents, that harms or threatens to harm the child\u2019s health or welfare. The statute focuses on the status of the child \u2014 not the timing of the injury\u2019s infliction. Despite my agreement with the majority on this point, I cannot join today\u2019s opinion and syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">The syllabus equates a positive drug screen, in every case, with \u201cinjury that harms or threatens to harm\u201d a newborn. The majority\u2019s <em>per se </em>rule assumes that harm to a child\u2019s health or welfare \u2014 or the threat of such harm \u2014 necessarily follows from <em>in \u00fatero </em>exposure to an illegal drug. The magistrate and trial court likewise assumed that \u201c[a] newborn who tests positive for an illegal narcotic is abuse[d] per se.\u201d Rather than determining by clear and convincing evidence that Lorenzo\u2019s exposure to cocaine caused or could have caused him harm, the court below (like the majority today) apparently proceeded from a generally accepted view that cocaine is harmful to its users.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">A positive result on a newborn\u2019s drug screen is probative evidence of <em>in \u00fatero </em>exposure to illegal drugs. Whether a newborn\u2019s <em>in \u00fatero </em>exposure to an illegal substance actually harms or threatens to harm the child is, however, a separate question that can only be answered by considering appropriate medical evidence. Such consideration is lacking in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">Though there was evidence that Lorenzo was \u201cjittery\u201d soon after birth, the record contains no medical testimony linking this symptom to the positive drug screen. The agency\u2019s only witness at the adjudicatory hearing was a social worker who observed Lorenzo shake briefly twice during a five- to fifteen-minute period. The day after birth, Lorenzo\u2019s physician noted \u201cnot much jittering\u201d and decided that he would \u201cjust observe.\u201d The following day, Lorenzo\u2019s physician indicated that Lorenzo was \u201cdoing fine \u2014 no jitteriness.\u201d Three days after birth, Lorenzo was discharged. Though Lorenzo\u2019s physician noted a \u201cpositive drug screen\u201d on the discharge summary, he identified no symptoms of injury that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>harmed or threatened to harm the child. Nor did the physician specify the need for any medication or special care for Lorenzo.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">I would remand this cause for a determination of whether Lorenzo\u2019s exposure to cocaine either harmed or threatened to harm him, as the plain language of R.C. 2151.031(D) requires. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b355-7\">Pfeifer, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
