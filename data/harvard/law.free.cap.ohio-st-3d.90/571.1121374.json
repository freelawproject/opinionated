He was also sentenced to prison for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>kidnapping and aggravated burglary. The court of appeals affirmed the convictions and sentence. <em>State v. Hill </em>(Dec. 21, 1994), Hamilton App. Nos. C-910916 and C-940487, unreported, 1994 WL 721580. On direct appeal as of right, we also affirmed. <em>State v. Hill </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 195, 661 N.E.2d 1068, certiorari denied, <em>Hill v. Ohio </em>(1996), 519 U.S. 895, 117 S.Ct. 241, 136 L.Ed.2d 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Subsequently, the trial court denied Hill\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief, and the court of appeals affirmed that denial of relief. <em>State v. Hill </em>(Nov. 21, 1997), Hamilton App. No. C-961052, unreported, 1997 WL 727587, and we declined to accept Hill\u2019s appeal. <em>State v. Hill </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 1468, 690 N.E.2d 1288. On April 1, 1998, we revoked a stay of execution previously granted. <em>State v. Hill </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 1498, 691 N.E.2d 1059. Hill also filed a petition for habeas corpus in the United States District Court, which is pending. See <em>Hill v. Mitchell </em>(S.D.Ohio 1998), 30 F.Supp.2d 997.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">On October 1, 1999, Hill filed an application for reopening with the court of appeals pursuant to App.R. 26(B) and <em>State v. Murnahan </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 60, 584 N.E.2d 1204, alleging ineffective assistance of appellate counsel before that court. The court of appeals found that Hill had \u201cfailed to show good cause for filing his application more than ninety days after this Court\u2019s judgment was journalized, as required by App.R. 26(B)(2)(b).\u201d <em>State v. Hill </em>(June 8, 2000), Hamilton App. No. C-910916, unreported. Hence, that court denied Hill\u2019s application to reopen his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals, albeit for different reasons. The two-pronged analysis found in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, is the appropriate standard to assess whether Hill has raised a \u201cgenuine issue,\u201d as to the ineffectiveness of appellate counsel, in his request to reopen under App.R. 26(B)(5). <em>State v. Spivey </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 24, 25, 701 N.E.2d 696, 697; <em>State v. Reed </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 534, 535, 660 N.E.2d 456, 458. See, also, <em>Walker v. Gibson </em>(C.A.10, 2000), 228 F.3d 1217, 1237; <em>United States v. Cook </em>(C.A.10, 1995), 45 F.3d 388, 395; <em>Boyd v. Ward </em>(C.A.10, 1999), 179 F.3d 904, 914. To show ineffective assistance, Hill must prove that his counsel were deficient for failing to raise the issues he now presents and that there was a reasonable probability of success had he presented those claims on appeal. <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">Moreover, to justify reopening his appeal, Hill \u201cbears the burden of establishing that there was a \u2018genuine issue\u2019 as to whether he has a \u2018colorable claim\u2019 of ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Spivey, </em>84 Ohio St.3d at 25, 701 N.E.2d at 697. We find that Hill has failed to do so.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b725-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number><em>Michael K. Allen, </em>Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney, and <em>Ronald W. Springman, Jr., </em>Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b725-11\"><em>David H. Bodiker, </em>Ohio. Public Defender, and <em>Angela Miller, </em>Assistant Public Defender, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">In his initial appeal to the court of appeals, Hill\u2019s allegedly ineffective appellate counsel raised twenty-nine assignments of error on appeal. \u201cCounsel could have reasonably decided they could not add * * * more issues without \u2018burying good arguments * * * in a verbal mound made up of strong and weak contentions.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Campbell </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 38, 53, 630 N.E.2d 339, 353, quoting <em>Jones v. Barnes </em>(1983), 463 U.S. 745, 753, 103 S.Ct. 3308, 3313, 77 L.Ed.2d 987, 994. Hill also relies in part upon evidence outside the trial record to support his claim of ineffective appellate assistance. Yet appellate counsel cannot properly refer to facts outside the record. \u201cA reviewing court cannot add matter to the record before it, which was not a part of the trial court\u2019s proceedings, and then decide the appeal on the basis of the new matter.\u201d <em>State v. Ishmail </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 402, 8 O.O.3d 405, 377 N.E.2d 500, paragraph one of the syllabus. Accord <em>State v. Coleman </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 129, 133, 707 N.E.2d 476, 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Finally, many issues on Hill\u2019s list were waived at trial, and some were precluded by settled law. Other issues \u201cmay have had arguable merit, but are \u2018sufficiently problematical that the refusal to raise them cannot be assailed as an unreasonable professional judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Campbell, </em>69 Ohio St.3d at 53, 630 N.E.2d at 353, quoting <em>Cunningham v. Henderson </em>(C.A.2, 1984), 725 F.2d 32, 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b725-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
