X(6)(A)(l)(b) and (A)(2)(d). The commission recommended the imposition of sanctions against certain attorneys, including the above-named respondent, for failure to comply with the provisions of Gov.Bar R.

X(6)(B)(3) and Gov.Bar R. X(5)(A)(4). The court further ordered that respondent shall not be reinstated to the practice of law in Ohio until respondent complies with the requirements for reinstatement set forth in Gov.Bar R. X(7).</p>\n<p id=\"AcK\">On June 27, 2000, the commission filed a recommendation pursuant to Gov.Bar R. X(7)(B)(2), finding that the respondent has paid all fees assessed for noncompliance, has made up all deficiencies, and is now in full compliance with all requirements of Gov.Bar R. X, and recommending that the respondent be reinstated to the practice of law in Ohio. On June 27, 2000, the commission certified that respondent had completed the credit hours of continuing legal education required during his suspension by this court\u2019s order of suspension. Upon consideration thereof,</p>\n<p id=\"A-Tq\">IT IS ORDERED by the court that the recommendation of the commission is adopted and respondent, Dean Raymond Steigerwald, is hereby reinstated to the practice of law.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
