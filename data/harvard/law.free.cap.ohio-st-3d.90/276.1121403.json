For the reasons that follow, we hold that dependency issues do not invoke the basic right to participate in the workers\u2019 compensation system and, therefore, are not appealable. We further hold that a decedent\u2019s estate can be entitled to R.C. 4123.60 compensation that accrued but was not paid to the decedent. Accordingly, we reverse the dismissal of the Liposchak complaint and remand to the court of appeals for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">Right to Participate</p>\n<p id=\"b430-11\">Under R.C. 4123.512, claimants and employers can appeal Industrial Commission orders to a common pleas court only when the order grants or denies the claimant\u2019s right to participate. Determinations as to the extent of a claimant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>disability, on the other hand, are not appealable and must be challenged in mandamus. <em>Thomas v. Conrad </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 475, 477, 692 N.E.2d 205, 207; <em>Felty v. AT&amp;T Technologies, Inc. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 234, 237, 602 N.E.2d 1141, 1144; <em>Zavatsky v. Stringer </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 386, 10 O.O.3d 503, 384 N.E.2d 693, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">These principles seem simple enough, but distinguishing between appealable right-to-participate orders and nonappealable extent-of-disability orders, as we must do in this case, has never been easy. <em>Cook v. Mayfield </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 200, 202, 543 N.E.2d 787, 790. The task is even more difficult in this appeal because (1) Edith\u2019s estate has not argued in favor of her R.C. 4123.59 death benefit claim,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (2) R.C. 4123.59 specifically provides for appeal under R.C. 4123.512, whereas R.C. 4123.60 explicitly forbids this appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The court of appeals relied mainly on <em>State ex rel. Ross v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 411, 696 N.E.2d 585 <em>(\u201cRoss I </em>\u201d), from which the appellate court inferred that dependency represents \u201ca\u201d most basic right-to-participate issue. This suggests that the appeals court considered dependency just one of several issues appealable under R.C. 4123.512. But the discussion in <em>Ross I </em>actually referred to \u201cthe\u201d basic right to participate. <em>Id. </em>at 414, 696 N.E.2d at 588. Though <em>Ross I </em>was reversed on reconsideration in <em>State ex rel. Ross v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 364, 703 N.E.2d 1276 <em>(\u201cRoss II\u201d), Ross II </em>reiterated that \u201conly decisions involving a claimant\u2019s right to participate in the fund could be appealed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 367, 703 N.E.2d at 1278.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">The only right-to-participate question that is appealable is whether an employee\u2019s injury, disease, or death occurred in the course of and arising out of his or her employment. <em>Felty, </em>65 Ohio St.3d 234, 602 N.E.2d 1141, at paragraph two of the syllabus; <em>Afrates v. Lorain </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 22, 584 N.E.2d 1175, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>State ex rel. Evans v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 236, 594 N.E.2d 609; and <em>Zavatsky, </em>56 Ohio St.2d 386, 10 O.O.3d 503, 384 N.E.2d 693, paragraph one of the syllabus. When the answer to this question is \u201cno,\u201d all compensation, expenses, and awards of every kind must be denied because the commission has no jurisdiction in such cases. <em>Lewis v. Trimble </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 231, 244, 680 N.E.2d 1207, 1217, citing 3 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law (1996) 15-959 to 15-961, Section 80.41. When the answer is \u201cyes,\u201d the claimant has cleared the first hurdle, and then may attempt to establish his or her extent of disability. It follows that these claimants may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>qualify based either on the extent of their own disability or the extent to which they were legally dependent on the injured employee. But either way, the issue is no longer whether the commission has jurisdiction to award benefits in the employee\u2019s case; the question instead becomes how much the system must pay. <em>Zavatsky, </em>56 Ohio St.2d at 396, 10 O.O.3d at 509, 384 N.E.2d at 699.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\"><em>Ross I </em>and <em>Ross II </em>applied the rule that the right to participate is invoked when it is determined that an employee has sustained an injury, disease, or death in the course of and arising out of employment. <em>Ross I </em>at 414-415, 696 N.E.2d at 588; <em>Ross II, </em>84 Ohio St.3d at 367-368, 703 N.E.2d at 1278. <em>Ross II </em>went further, holding that when the commission finds merely that a particular type of employment caused an employee\u2019s injury, disease, or death, the employee\u2019s baseline right to participate has already been established and an order finding the wrong employer responsible is not appealable. <em>Id. </em>at 368-369, 703 N.E.2d at 1279. According to <em>Ross II, </em>the identity of the responsible employer\u2019s identity can only be challenged in mandamus. <em>Id. </em>at 369, 703 N.E.2d at 1279.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Thus, under our most recent precedent, any issue other than whether the injury, disease, or death resulted from employment does not constitute a right-to-participate issue. From a logical standpoint, the rule is the same whether the claim is for accrued but unpaid compensation under R.C. 4123.60 or for death benefits under R.C. 4123.59.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Unfortunately, the dispute in this case is not so easily settled because of the differing appeal provisions in R.C. 4123.60 and 4123.59. While R.C. 4123.60 is consistent with the rule that only the causal connection between an employee\u2019s condition and employment is appealable, R.C. 4123.59, which defines dependency, is not. Regarding claims for accrued but unpaid compensation,' the last paragraph of R.C. 4123.60 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">\u201cAn order issued by the administrator under this section is appealable pursuant to section 4123.511 of the Revised Code [administrative appeal to the commission] but is <em>not </em>appealable to court under section 4123.512 of the Revised Code.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">Regarding death benefits, R.C. 4123.59 specifies in its last paragraph:</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">\u201c(E) An order issued by the administrator under this section <em>is </em>appealable pursuant to sections 4123.511 to 4123.512 of the Revised Code.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">The court of appeals dismissed the last paragraph of R.C. 4123.60 as irrelevant to the question of appealability in this case because it precluded R.C. 4123.512 appeals from the <em>administrator, </em>but not from the <em>commission. </em>But as the Liposchaks argue, the <em>administrator\u2019s </em>allowance or disallowance of a claim is never appealable to common pleas court; R.C. 4123.512 authorizes appeal only for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>final <em>commission </em>orders. Furthermore, the similarity of these two closing paragraphs suggests legislative intent to distinguish the applicable appeal procedures. In fact, the General Assembly enacted these provisions in 1993, the year after the <em>Felty, Evans, </em>and <em>Afrates </em>decisions in an apparent attempt to settle the matter. See 145 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2990, 3170-3171.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">In <em>State ex rel. Nicholson v. Copperweld Steel Co. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 193, 672 N.E.2d 657, and <em>State ex rel. Yancey v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 367, 673 N.E.2d 1374, we recently recognized mandamus as the sole means to enforce a claimant\u2019s right to accrued but unpaid compensation. The court of appeals distinguished <em>Nicholson </em>and <em>Yancey </em>because neither turned on dependency. Each case involved a widow whose dependency was unquestioned, seeking to establish her husband\u2019s eligibility for permanent total disability benefits, which is an accepted extent-of-disability issue. That aspect of the claims in <em>Nicholson </em>and <em>Yancey </em>differs from Edith\u2019s R.C. 4123.60 claim. However, the only appealable right-to-participate issue is whether an employee has contracted a disease or been injured or killed as a result of his or her employment; the extent to which a claimant is a dependent of that injured, sick, or deceased employee does not invoke the right to appeal under R.C. 4123.512.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The determination that issues of dependency arising in an R.C. 4123.60 claim are not appealable does not resolve the related question that pervades this appeal \u2014 whether these same issues may be appealed in an R.C. 4123.59 claim. In the interest of consistency, we hold that they cannot. While these issues arguably fall under the broad heading of what may be appealed under R.C. 4123.59, we refuse to obscure the rule that R.C. 4123.512 permits only those appeals that concern whether the employee\u2019s injury, disease, or death occurred in the course of and arising out of his or her employment. We read R.C. 4123.59 <em>in pari materia </em>with R.C. 4123.512 and find that the latter statute restricts the appeals authorized by R.C. 4123.59. Accordingly, we hold that although death benefits may be granted or denied based on dependent status as defined in R.C. 4123.59, the denial or grant of such benefits is not appealable unless it concerns the causal connection between injury, disease, or death and employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">Our decision, therefore, does more than simply overturn the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Appeals; it also undermines the Jefferson County Common Pleas \u2019 Court\u2019s recognition of dependency as an appealable issue in Edith\u2019s death benefit claim. Under R.C. 4123.66(A), funeral expenses can be paid only \u201cin case death ensues from the [employment-related] injury or occupational disease.\u201d By granting funeral expenses to Edith,'the commission has effectively already determined the basic right to participate. Indeed, had the commission not concluded that Robert died as a result of his occupational disease, it would not have had jurisdiction to order any benefits at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Accrued Compensation</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Having found that R.C. 4123.60 dependency issues are not appealable under R.C. 4123.512, we turn to whether Robert\u2019s estate can collect the permanent partial and permanent total disability compensation that accrued but had not been paid to him before his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">In <em>State ex rel. Nossal v. Terex Div. of I.B.H. </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 175, 712 N.E.2d 747, syllabus, we held that the estates of deceased dependents can recover R.C. 4123.60 compensation to which the dependent was entitled from the State Insurance Fund. Thus, Walter, as executor of Robert\u2019s estate, reasonably asks why estates of workers should not be able to collect accrued compensation when the estates of dependents are able to collect. We see no reason for such an inequity. Accordingly, we follow <em>Nossal, </em>and hold that Robert\u2019s estate is entitled under R.C. 4123.60 to compensation that accrued to Robert, but had not been paid to him at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">The court of appeals\u2019 judgment dismissing the underlying complaint is reversed, and this cause is remanded to that court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b434-9\">Resnick, F.E.

At first, the majority states that only <em>two </em>issues are before us in this case \u2014 whether a claimant who was denied R.C. 4123.60 compensation for failure to show dependency may appeal under R.C. 4123.512, and whether Robert\u2019s estate may collect Robert\u2019s accrued R.C. 4123.60 compensation. But in addition to resolving these two questions, the majority also decides that issues of dependency arising under R.C. 4123.59 may not be appealed under R.C. 4123.512. I discuss these three distinct issues separately below.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b434-13\">I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion, in the first part of its opinion, that whether a claimant is an injured, sick, or deceased employee\u2019s dependent for purposes of R.C. 4123.60 is not an issue that is appealable to the common pleas court under R.C. 4123.512. But because R.C. 4123.60 expressly provides that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>orders issued thereunder are not appealable pursuant to R.C. 4123.512, there is no need for this court to justify this conclusion by distinguishing the nature of the order issued here from the types of orders that this court has previously deemed appealable under R.C. 4123.512. Orders issued by the administrator under R.C. 4123.60 <em>are </em>appealable under R.C. 4123.511. R.C. 4123.60. R.C. 4123.511 would, then, permit an appeal of the administrator\u2019s order to the district hearing officer (Division [C]), the staff hearing officer (Division [D]), and, finally, the commission (Division [E]). R.C. 4123.511(E) permits appeals from orders of the commission under Division (E) to be taken under R.C. 4123.512 <em>\u201c[ejxcept as otherwise provided in this chapter.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>R.C. 4123.60 expressly provides otherwise. </em>Accordingly, though I concur with the majority\u2019s conclusion that an order denying benefits under R.C. 4123.60 is not appealable under 4123.512, the majority\u2019s discussion concerning whether dependency issues invoke the basic right to participate is gratuitous.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s holding that appeals under R.C. 4123.59 must be treated the same as appeals under R.C. 4123.60. First, as the majority concedes, whether the denial of death benefits under R.C. 4123.59 is appealable under R.C. 4123.512 is not one of the two issues before the court in this case. Assuming, for the sake of argument, that the issue is properly before us, I am not persuaded by the majority\u2019s analysis. The majority ignores the express language of R.C. 4123.59 \u2014 which <em>permits </em>appeals from R.C. 4123.59 orders to occur (eventually) under R.C. 4123.512 \u2014 and concludes that such appeals are precluded solely in the \u201cinterest of consistency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">As I noted, <em>supra, </em>the General Assembly knew how to expressly permit administrative appeals to occur under R.C. 4123.511, but then to preclude the appeal of commission orders resulting therefrom to the common pleas court under R.C. 4123.512. It did precisely that in R.C. 4123.60. In R.C. 4123.59, however, the General Assembly apparently intended to permit orders issued by the administrator under that section to be appealed administratively under R.C. 4123.511, <em>and then to the common pleas court under R.C. 4123.512. </em>R.C. 4123.59(E) provides that \u201c[a]n order issued by the administrator under this section is appealable pursuant to sections 4123.511 to 4123.512 of the Revised Code.\u201d So, once the administrator issues an order under R.C. 4123.59, that order may be appealed administratively under R.C. 4123.511 to the district hearing officer (Division [C]), the staff hearing officer (Division [D]), and, finally, to the commission (Division [E]). The commission\u2019s order could, then, be appealed under R.C. 4123.512 \u2014 for unlike R.C. 4123.60, 4123.59 does not \u201cotherwise provide\u201d that an appeal under R.C. 4123.512 is precluded. The majority asserts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>no legal basis for its conclusion that the appellate procedures under R.C. 4123.59 and 4123.60 must be entirely consistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">I must also respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s reliance on our <em>Nossal </em>case, in the second part of its opinion, to justify its holding that Robert\u2019s estate may recover Robert\u2019s accrued but unpaid compensation under R.C. 4123.60. Our <em>Nossal </em>syllabus provides only that <em>\u201c[w]here the commission awards death benefits to the surviving spouse of a deceased employee, </em>but the spouse dies <em>before the funds are disbursed, </em>accrued benefits <em>for the period between the deceased employee\u2019s death and the spouse\u2019s death </em>shall be paid to the spouse\u2019s estate.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State ex rel. Nossal v. Terex Div. of I.B.H. </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 175, 712 N.E.2d 747, syllabus. In <em>Nossal, </em>the worker\u2019s sole dependent <em>had actually been awarded </em>$298 per week in benefits, but died before those funds were disbursed. Because the award had already vested in the worker\u2019s dependent, we permitted the dependent\u2019s estate to recover the benefits that the dependent would have received \u2014 but for administrative delays' \u2014 during the limited period between the worker\u2019s death and her own. <em>Nossal </em>thus only permits a dependent\u2019s estate to recover where an award to the worker\u2019s dependent has actually vested in that dependent prior to the dependent\u2019s death. <em>Nossal </em>does not support the majority\u2019s much broader holding that a worker\u2019s estate can actually collect accrued/unpaid benefits itself under R.C. 4123.60.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Here, unlike the situation we confronted in <em>Nossal, </em>no dependent of Robert has been deemed eligible to receive accrued/unpaid benefits. No R.C. 4123.60 award has vested yet been administratively delayed. Moreover, any right to the receipt of accrued/unpaid benefits under R.C. 4123.60 is the right of a \u201cdependent,\u201d and Robert\u2019s estate cannot itself qualify as a \u201cdependent\u201d under R.C. 4123.60. Dependents are \u201cperson[s]\u201d such as surviving spouses and children who either partly, wholly, or prospectively relied on the deceased worker for maintenance and support. See R.C. 4123.59(C) and (D). A deceased worker\u2019s estate is no such \u201cperson.\u201d A deceased worker\u2019s estate is an aggregate comprising the assets and liabilities of the decedent. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7 Ed.1999) 567. <em>Individual beneficiaries </em>of a deceased worker\u2019s estate could seek to recover accrued/unpaid benefits as dependents, upon satisfactory proof to the administrator of their status as dependents under R.C. 4123.60. But a worker\u2019s <em>estate </em>cannot be said to have relied on the worker for maintenance and support \u2014 even prospectively \u2014 for the estate does not even exist as a legal construct until the worker is deceased. We have recognized this distinction before. Seventy years ago, this court held that a dependent (or personal representative thereof) could maintain an action for the unpaid balance of an award, but \u201cnot * * * the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>administrator of the decedent.\u201d <em>Bozzelli v.

If the, dependent spouse remarries, an amount equal to two years of compensation benefits at the weekly amount determined to be applicable to and being paid to the dependent spouse shall be paid in a lump sum to such spouse and no further compensation shall be paid to such spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-11\">\u201c(2) That portion of the payment provided in division (B) of this section applicable to wholly dependent persons other than a spouse shall continue from the date of death of an injured or disabled employee to a dependent as of the date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>of death, other than a spouse, at the weekly amount determined to be applicable and being paid to such dependent other than a spouse, until he:</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">\u201c(a) Reaches eighteen years of age;</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">\u201c(b) If pursuing a full time educational program while enrolled in an accredited educational institution and program, reaches twenty-five years of age;</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">\u201c(c) If mentally or physically incapacitated from having any earnings, is no longer so incapacitated.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">\u201c(C) If there are partly dependent persons at the time of the death the weekly payment is sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the employee\u2019s average weekly wage, not to exceed sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the statewide average weekly wage as defined in division (C) of section 4123.62 of the Revised Code, and shall continue for such time as the administrator in each case determines.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">\u201c(D) The following persons are presumed to be wholly dependent for their support upon a deceased employee:</p>\n<p id=\"b438-11\">\u201c(1) A surviving spouse who was living with the employee at the time of death or a surviving spouse who was separated from the employee at the time of death because of the aggression of the employee;</p>\n<p id=\"b438-12\">\u201c(2) A child under the age of eighteen years, or twenty-five years if pursuing a full-time educational program while enrolled in an accredited educational institution and program, or over said age if physically or mentally incapacitated from earning, upon only the one parent who is contributing more than one-half of the support for such child and with whom he is living at the time of the death of such parent, or for whose maintenance such parent was legally liable at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-13\">\u201cIt is presumed that there is sufficient dependency to entitle a surviving natural parent or surviving natural parents, share and share alike, with whom the decedent was living at the time of his death, to a total minimum award of three thousand dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-14\">\u201cThe administrator may take into consideration any circumstances which, at the time of the death of the decedent, clearly indicate prospective dependency on the part of the claimant and potential support on the part of the decedent. No person shall be considered a prospective dependent unless such person is a member of the family of the deceased employee and bears to him the relation of surviving spouse, lineal descendant, ancestor, or brother or sister. The total award for any or all prospective dependency to all such claimants, except to a natural parent or natural parents of the deceased, shall not exceed three thousand dollars to be apportioned among them as the administrator orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-15\">\u201cIn all other cases, the question of dependency, in whole or in part, shall be determined in accordance with the facts in each particular case existing at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>time of the injury resulting in the death of such employee, but no person shall be considered as dependent unless such person is a member of the family of the deceased employee, or bears to him the relation of surviving spouse, lineal descendant, ancestor, or brother or sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">\u201c(E) An order issued by the administrator under this section is appealable pursuant to sections 4123.511 to 4123.512 of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">R.C. 4123.60 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">\u201cBenefits in case of death shall be paid to such one or more of the dependents of the decedent, for the benefit of all the dependents as the administrator of workers\u2019 compensation determines. The administrator may apportion the benefits among the dependents in such manner as he deems just and equitable. Payment to a dependent subsequent in right may be made, if the administrator deems it proper, and operates to discharge all other claims therefor. The dependents or person to whom benefits are paid shall apply the same to the use of the several beneficiaries thereof according to their respective claims upon the decedent for support, in compliance with the finding and direction of the administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">\u201cIn all cases of death where the dependents are a surviving spouse and one or more children, it is sufficient for the surviving spouse to apply to the administrator on behalf of the spouse and minor children. In cases where all the dependents are minors, a guardian or next friend of such minor dependents shall apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">\u201cIn all cases where an award had been made on account of temporary, or permanent partial, or total disability, in which there remains an unpaid balance, representing payments accrued and due to the decedent at the time of his death, the administrator may, after satisfactory proof has been made warranting such action, award or pay any unpaid balance of such award to such of the dependents of the decedent, or for services rendered on account of the last illness or death of such decedent, as the administrator determines in accordance with the circumstances in each such case. If the decedent would have been lawfully entitled to have applied for an award at the time of his death the administrator may, after satisfactory proof to warrant an award and payment, award and pay an amount, not exceeding the compensation which the decedent might have received, but for his death, for the period prior to the date of his death, to such of the dependents of the decedent, or for services rendered on account of the last illness or death of such decedent, as the administrator determines in accordance with the circumstances in each such case, but such payments may be made only in cases in which application for compensation was made in the manner required by this chapter, during the lifetime of such injured or disabled person, or within one year after the death of such injured or disabled person.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>\u201cAn order issued by the administrator under this section is appealable pursuant to section 4123.511 of the Revised Code but is not appealable to court under section 4123.512 of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
