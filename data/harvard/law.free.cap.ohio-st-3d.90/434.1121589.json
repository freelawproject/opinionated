Under R.C. 4123.57(B),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the loss of a body part requires compensation for a designated number of weeks. \u201cLoss\u201d is not confined to amputation. <em>State ex rel. Walker v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 402, 12 O.O.3d 347, 390 N.E.2d 1190. A claimant may also recover for the total loss of use of an enumerated body member. Toward this end, the statute has specific provisions for fingers, which state:</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">\u201cFor ankylosis (total stiffness of) or contractures (due to scars or injuries) which makes [sic ] any of the fingers, thumbs, or parts of either useless, the same number of weeks apply [sic ] to the members or parts thereof as given for the loss thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Toes, rather than fingers, are at issue currently, yet this provision anchors our controversy via our earlier decision in <em>Osborne. </em>Claimant argues that under <em>Osborne, </em>a claimant with ankylosed toes is neither automatically guaranteed nor automatically disqualified from an award. According to claimant, entitlement instead hinges on a total loss of use of the affected toe. The commission, on the other hand, interprets <em>Osborne </em>as excluding claimants with ankylosed toes from eligibility for compensation. We find claimant\u2019s position to be more persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">In <em>Osborne, </em>the claimant sought a scheduled-loss award for four toes, arguing that \u201cankylosis, <em>as a matter of law, </em>constitutes \u2018loss of use\u2019 and entitles her to R.C. 4123.57(B) compensation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id., </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 106, 647 N.E.2d at 799. Claimant premised her position on the previously quoted language from R.C. 4123.57(B). We rejected her argument, writing:</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">\u201cClaimant\u2019s theory disregards the express parameters of the cited paragraph. The provision speaks exclusively to fingers and thumbs, not toes \u2014 the body part currently at issue. No equivalent directive accompanies R.C. 4123.57(B)\u2019s discussion of toe loss. This led the appellate court to properly conclude:</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">\u201c \u2018It is clear that the legislature intended to treat ankylosis of the toes differently from ankylosis of the fingers. The same, moreover, is a reasonable distinction given the different functions of the referenced digits.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 105-106, 647 N.E.2d at 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">The court of appeals in the present case focused on the phrase \u201cas a matter of law.\u201d The majority, through the magistrate, equated the phrase with \u201cautomatically\u201d and concluded that <em>Osborne </em>prohibited only an <em>automatic </em>award to claimants with ankylosed toes. The dissent, on the other hand, viewed the phrase as meaningless and the prohibition as complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>We favor the majority\u2019s interpretation. To rule otherwise would in effect disqualify any claimant with ankylosis of the toes from consideration for a scheduled-loss award. It is difficult to imagine that the General Assembly would decree that a condition (ankylosis) that arose <em>from </em>the injury would, in turn, prevent the claimant from receiving scheduled-loss compensation <em>for </em>the injury. We agree that a claimant with ankylosed toes must still prove that the ankylosis causes a total loss of use. We simply do not agree that the mere presence of a particular injury-induced condition automatically forecloses compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b588-7\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
