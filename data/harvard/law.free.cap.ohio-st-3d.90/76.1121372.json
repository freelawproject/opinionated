Gunnell\u2019s claims challenge the validity and sufficiency of his indictment and should have been raised by an alternative remedy in the ordinary course of law, <em>e.g., </em>appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>rather than by extraordinary writ. See <em>Orr v. Mack </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 429, 430, 700 N.E.2d 590, 591; <em>Wilkerson v. Mitchell </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 52, 716 N.E.2d 1157, 1158. Further, the indictment did charge Taylor with aggravated murder and aggravated robbery, and he entered a guilty plea to involuntary manslaughter, which is a lesser included offense of the charged offense of aggravated murder. <em>State v. Thomas </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 213, 533 N.E.2d 286, paragraph one of the syllabus. An accused can properly plead guilty to a lesser included offense of the charge for which he was indicted, and habeas corpus will not lie to challenge a conviction on this plea. <em>Crockett v. Haskins </em>(1965), 2 Ohio St.2d 322, 31 O.O.2d 580, 208 N.E.2d 744. Therefore, Gunnell was not convicted and sentenced upon an uncharged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b229-6\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
