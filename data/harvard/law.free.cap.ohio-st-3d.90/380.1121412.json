Commission orders, however, have uniformly listed \u201cacute lumbosacral sprain\u201d as the only allowed condition. It is unclear why this is so, and we find that this lack of clarity hinders further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">Dr. Bellamy stated that a chronic pain syndrome arising from claimant\u2019s neck/upper back was interfering with her ability to work. If cervical strain is an allowed condition, then there is no basis for the allegation that nonallowed conditions are contributing to claimant\u2019s inability to return to her former position of employment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If it is not a part of the claim, however, Kroger\u2019s assertions may have merit. We, therefore, find further consideration to be critical.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-13\">The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed, and the cause is returned to the commission for further consideration and clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-14\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b534-15\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.

We recognize that the DHO\u2019s order cites Dr. Bellamy\u2019s reference to \u201cdepression\u201d as well, but that clearly is just a passing observation on the doctor\u2019s part. Nothing in Bellamy\u2019s July 10, 1996 narrative implies that claimant has an emotional condition that is contributing to an inability to work.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
