Chapter 1923, is a summary proceeding in which \u2018any judge of a county court\u2019 may make inquiry into disputes between landlords and tenants, and, where appropriate, order restitution of the premises to the landlord.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Cuyahoga Metro. Hous. Auth. v. Jackson </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 129, 130, 21 O.O.3d 81, 82, 423 N.E.2d 177, 178. A forcible entry and detainer action is intended to serve as an expedited mechanism by which an aggrieved landlord may recover possession of real property.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 131, 21 O.O.3d at 83, 423 N.E.2d at 179; see, also, <em>Haas v. Gerski </em>(1963), 175 Ohio St. 327, 330, 25 O.O.2d 212, 214, 194 N.E.2d 765, 767. Thus, \u201c[g]iven its summary nature, the drafters of the Rules of Civil Procedure were careful to avoid-encrusting this special remedy with time consuming procedure tending to destroy its efficacy.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>67 Ohio St.2d at 131, 21 O.O.3d at 83, 423 N.E.2d at 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>The Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure \u201cprescribe the procedure to be followed in all courts of this state in the exercise of civil jurisdiction.\u201d Civ.R. 1(A). The rules are generally applicable to all civil proceedings in Ohio; however, there are exceptions. See Civ.R. 1(C); see, also, <em>Jackson, </em>67 Ohio St.2d at 130, 21 O.O.3d at 82, 423 N.E.2d at 178. One such exception provides that the rules, \u201cto the extent that they would by their nature be clearly inapplicable, shall not apply to procedure\u201d in forcible entry and detainer actions. Civ.R. 1(C)(3). Thus, it is incumbent upon us to determine whether amended Civ.R. 53(E) is applicable to procedure in forcible entry and detainer actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Former Civ.R. 53(E) required a referee to \u201cprepare a report upon the matters submitted by the order of reference.\u201d Former Civ.R. 53(E)(1), 67 Ohio St.3d at CXXXIV. Additionally, the referee\u2019s findings of fact had to be sufficient to enable the court \u201cto make an independent analysis of the issues and to apply appropriate rules of law in reaching a judgment order.\u201d Former Civ.R. 53(E)(5), <em>id. </em>at CXXXV.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">In <em>Jackson, </em>this court held that former Civ.R. 53(E) by its very nature was \u201cclearly inapplicable to proceedings in forcible entry and detainer, on the authority of Civ.R. 1(C).\u201d <em>Id., </em>67 Ohio St.2d 129, 21 O.O.3d 81, 423 N.E.2d 177, syllabus. The court aptly recognized that the rule\u2019s requirements would hinder the expeditious resolution of forcible entry and detainer actions, thereby defeating the underlying purpose behind these special proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 131-132, 21 O.O.3d at 83, 423 N.E.2d at 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">In 1989, this court applied similar reasoning and held that Civ.R. 52\u2019s requirement that a trial court enter findings of fact and conclusions of law as part of the record when a request is made by one of the parties is \u201cinapplicable to forcible entry and detainer proceedings on the authority of Civ.R. 1(C).\u201d <em>State ex rel. GMS Mgt. Co., Inc. v. Callahan </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 51, 543 N.E.2d 483, paragraph one of syllabus; see, also, Civ.R. 52.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court reasoned that \u201c[i]n light of the summary nature of forcible entry and detainer proceedings pursuant to R.C. Chapter 1923, there should, as a general rule, be no necessity for trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>judges to delay their judgments while developing findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Civ.R. 52.\u201d <em>Callahan </em>at 55, 543 N.E.2d at 487. The court further held that in forcible entry and detainer proceedings, the trial judge may \u201cprepare findings of fact and conclusions of law <em>sua sponte </em>within a reasonable time after a hearing on the merits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at paragraph two of syllabus. In forcible entry and detainer proceedings, a reasonable time would be seven working days after a hearing on the merits. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The following year this court held that the \u201cautomatic stay provision of Civ.R. 53(E)(7) is inapplicable to forcible entry and detainer actions.\u201d <em>Colonial Am. Dev. Co. v. Griffith </em>(1990), 48 Ohio St.3d 72, 549 N.E.2d 513, syllabus. The version of the rule at issue in <em>Griffith </em>provided for an automatic stay of the execution of a judgment until the court dealt with objections to a referee\u2019s report. See <em>id. </em>at 73, 549 N.E.2d at 515, fn. 1. The current version of the rule contains a similar automatic stay provision. See Civ.R. 53(E)(4)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">In 1995, former Civ.R. 53 was extensively amended.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See 73 Ohio St.3d at LXXVIII. Of significance to our determination of the issue presented in the case at bar are the 1995 amendments affecting Civ.R. 53(E). Since our previous decisions involving the interplay between Civ.R. 1(C) and Civ.R. 53(E) predate the 1995 amendments, this is our first opportunity to address the role of amended Civ.R. 53(E) in forcible entry and detainer proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">\u201cNew division (E) entirely replaces the prior language which required preparation of reports by referees.\u201d Staff Notes, 1995 Amendments. Therefore, \u201c[u]n-less specifically required by the order of reference, a magistrate is not required to prepare any report other than the magistrate\u2019s decision.\u201d Civ.R. 53(E). The 1995 amendments disposed of the report-writing requirement, because it \u201csubstantially slowed the decision of cases without adding anything of value to the decision-making process.\u201d Staff Notes, 1995 Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">Additionally, amended Civ.R. 53 allows the trial court to \u201cadopt the magistrate\u2019s decision if no written objections are filed unless it determines that there is an error of law or other defect on the face of the magistrate\u2019s decision.\u201d Civ.R. 53(E)(4)(a). Consequently, in the absence of written objections or an erroneous or patently defective magistrate\u2019s decision, a judge is no longer required \u201cto make an independent analysis of the issues,\u201d as required under the former version of the rule. Former Civ.R. 53(E)(5), 67 Ohio St.3d at CXXXV; see, also, Staff Notes, 1995 Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">As a result of the 1995 amendments, the sections of Civ.R. 53(E) at issue here no longer contain the time-consuming procedural requirements that once preclud<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>ed their application in forcible entry and detainer proceedings. For instance, the current provisions authorizing a magistrate to prepare a decision without factual findings and enabling the trial court to adopt the magistrate\u2019s decision without conducting an independent analysis are wholly consistent with the summary nature of forcible entry and detainer proceedings. See Civ.R. 53(E)(1) and (E)(4)(a). Thus, to the extent that Civ.R. 53(E) is neither inconsistent with the summary nature of forcible entry and detainer proceedings nor contrary to this court\u2019s previous decisions construing sections of the rule not addressed in this decision, Civ.R. 53(E) is applicable to procedure in these special proceedings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Having determined that the relevant portions of Civ.R. 53(E) are applicable to procedure in forcible entry and detainer proceedings, we must now examine the propriety of the court of appeals\u2019 decision in the case at bar. The court of appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment because the magistrate did not prepare a report to inform the judge of facts that would justify the magistrate\u2019s recommendation and allow the court to make an independent determination. The court of appeals stated that \u201cnotwithstanding the 1995 amendments to Civil Rule 53, the magistrate\u2019s decision was legally insufficient for the court to approve.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The court of appeals\u2019 decision is contrary to the plain language of Civ.R. 53(E). Moreover, the decision frustrates the anticipated purpose behind forcible entry and detainer proceedings by creating the potential for delay in what is intended to be a summary proceeding. Trial courts\u2019 dockets are filled with a high volume of forcible entry and detainer actions. Requiring magistrates to prepare findings of fact in each case and courts to make an independent analysis based on these factual findings would hinder the timely resolution of these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">The exception embodied in Civ.R. 1(C) recognizes that, based on the nature of interests involved, forcible entry and detainer proceedings merit special consideration. Former Civ.R. 53(E) was deemed inapplicable to procedure in forcible entry and detainer proceedings because the rule\u2019s requirements impeded the summary disposition of forcible entry and detainer cases. The 1995 amendments address the need for efficiency in these types of actions and provide trial courts with a framework that enables them to render expedited judgments in cases where neither party files objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>Thus, while the record in the case at bar is far from illuminating, we cannot say that the trial court erred when it adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision. Moreover, a reading of the court of appeals\u2019 opinion leads us to the conclusion that the court mistakenly applied the pre-1995 version of the rule to the facts of this case. Consequently, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b597-7\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer, Cook- and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b593-9\">. \u201cAs provided in this chapter, any judge of a county or municipal court or a court of common pleas, within the judge\u2019s proper area of jurisdiction, may inquire about persons who make unlawful and forcible entry into lands or tenements and detain them, and about persons who make a lawful and peaceable entry into lands or tenements and hold them unlawfully and by force. If, upon such inquiry, it is found that an unlawful and forcible entry has been made and the lands or tenements are detained, or that, after a lawful entry, lands or tenements are held unlawfully and by force, \u00e1 judge shall cause the plaintiff in an action under this chapter to have restitution of the lands or tenements.\u201d R.C. 1923.01(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b594-8\">. In 1988, when the action underlying our decision in <em>Callahan </em>was filed, former Civ.R. 52 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2X\">\u201cWhen questions of fact are tried by the court without a jury, judgment may be general for the prevailing party unless one of the parties in writing or orally in open court requests otherwise before the journal entry of a final order, judgment, or decree has been approved by the court in writing and filed with the clerk of the court for journalization, or not later than seven days after the party filing the request has been given notice of the court\u2019s announcement of its decision, whichever is later, in which case, the court shall state in writing the conclusions of fact found separately from the conclusions of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-9\">\u201cWhen a request for findings of fact and conclusions of law is made, the court, in its discretion, may require any or all of the parties to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law; however, only those findings of fact and conclusions of law made by the court shall form part of the record.\u201d 29 Ohio St.2d at lxviii.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b595-11\">. One obvious modification involves the judicial officer\u2019s title; in the current version of the rule, \u201cmagistrate\u201d replaces \u201creferee.\u201d See Civ.R. 53(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b596-7\">. Today\u2019s decision is not intended to affect our previous holdings in <em>Colonial Am. Dev. Co. v. Griffith </em>(1990), 48 Ohio St.3d 72, 549 N.E.2d 513, and <em>State ex rel GMS Mgt. Co., Inc. v. Callahan </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 51, 543 N.E.2d 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">While both of these cases were decided prior to 1995, their syllabus law remains relevant to certain provisions embodied in the amended version of Civ.R. 53(E). As the matter currently before us does not raise issues similar to the ones addressed in these cases, a determination of these issues is beyond the scope of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
