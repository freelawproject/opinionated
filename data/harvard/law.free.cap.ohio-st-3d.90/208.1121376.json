We first agree with Johnson that the court of appeals erred in concluding that he failed to comply with R.C. 2725.04(B) because he did not specify \u201c[t]he officer, or name of the person by whom [he] is * * * confined or restrained.\u201d Johnson\u2019s petition <em>did </em>identify his prison warden.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">Nevertheless, the court of appeals correctly denied the writ. See <em>State ex rel. Gilmore v. Mitchell </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 302, 303, 714 N.E.2d 925, 926 (\u201cwe will not reverse a correct judgment merely because of an erroneous rationale\u201d). Johnson\u2019s habeas corpus claims, which challenge the constitutionality of his parole revocation, are devoid of merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">\u201c \u2018As long as an unreasonable delay has not occurred, the remedy for noncompliance with the <em>Morrissey </em>parole-revocation due process requirements is a new hearing, not outright release from prison.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Spann v. Mitchell </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 416, 417, 696 N.E.2d 589, 590, quoting <em>State ex rel. Jackson v. McFaul </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 185, 188, 652 N.E.2d 746, 749. \u201c[U]nder the applicable test for unreasonable delay, prejudice receives substantial emphasis, and * * * the most serious component of prejudice is the possibility that delay will impair the accused parole violator\u2019s defense at his final parole revocation hearing.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Crigger v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth. </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 270, 272, 695 N.E.2d 254, 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">Although Johnson contends that several witnesses are no longer available to testify at a revocation hearing, some of these witnesses either already testified at the revocation hearing (Smith) or, in the case of Johnson\u2019s relatives, he never requested that they be made witnesses or stated in his petition what they would testify about.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Furthermore, regarding two additional witnesses, including a claimed alibi witness, who were allegedly requested as witnesses at the revocation hearing by Johnson, Johnson never signed the request for these witnesses, he did not include the address for one of the prospective witnesses on the request form, and he advised his attorney and the hearing officer at his revocation hearing that these persons would be harder to contact because they were \u201cstreet people.\u201d Therefore, it appears unlikely that these witnesses would have attended the revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Moreover, Jackson does not allege why he could not have obtained affidavits in lieu of testimony from these witnesses. <em>Crigger, </em>82 Ohio St.3d at 272-273, 695 N.E.2d at 256; see <em>Gagnon v. Scarpelli </em>(1973), 411 U.S. 778, 782, 93 S.Ct. 1756, 1760, 36 L.Ed.2d 656, 662, fn. 5 (substitutes for live testimony, where appropriate, are not prohibited by Morrissey); see, generally, 2 Cohen, The Law of Probation and Parole (2 Ed.1999) 21-40, Section 21:26 (\u201cIrrespective of the nature of a witness\u2019s testimony, it is often held that the Constitution does not entitle an indigent probationer or parolee to receive public funds to transport the witness to the site of the final revocation hearing\u201d). In fact, two documents purporting to be statements of these witnesses were attached to Johnson\u2019s petition, although they contain neither the witnesses\u2019 signatures nor notary stamps. There is no allegation why actual affidavits could not have been produced for the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Johnson consequently failed to allege prejudice with the required factual specificity to warrant extraordinary relief in habeas corpus. <em>Crigger, Spann, </em>and <em>Jackson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">In addition, the record establishes that the APA complied with the constitutional due process requirements for parole revocation proceedings in revoking Johnson\u2019s parole. We note that many of Johnson\u2019s <em>Morrissey </em>claims rely on the erroneous assumption that the APA was required to conduct two revocation hearings, a preliminary one and a final one. Under Ohio Adm.Code 5120:1-1-18, only one parole revocation hearing is required. Consolidating the preliminary and final revocation hearings mentioned in <em>Morrissey </em>into a single proceeding is constitutionally permissible. <em>Ellis v. Dist. of Columbia </em>(C.A.D.C.1996), 318 U.S.App.D.C. 39, 50, 84 F.3d 1413, 1424; see, also, 2 Cohen at 25-24-16, Section 25:12. Furthermore, Smith\u2019s statements to the officers were admissible hearsay under Evid.R. 803(2), and even if they were not, hearsay is admissible in revocation proceedings. <em>State ex rel. Coulverson v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth. </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 12, 16, 577 N.E.2d 352, 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">Finally, the court of appeals did not err in refusing discovery to Johnson for his habeas corpus proceeding. Discovery is not always required in habeas corpus proceedings; R.C. Chapter 2725 prescribes a basic, summary procedure for bringing habeas corpus actions. <em>Gaskins v. Shiplevy </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 380, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>382-383, 667 N.E.2d 1194, 1197. Discovery was not required for Johnson\u2019s meritless action.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Based on the foregoing, Johnson is not entitled to the requested writ of habeas corpus, and the court of appeals properly denied the writ. We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b363-7\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer, Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b363-8\">. Our holding renders the APA\u2019s motion to strike Johnson\u2019s amended brief moot. We also deny Johnson\u2019s motions for discovery, default judgment, and the appointment of counsel. Civ.R. 34 and 55 do not apply to appeals, and Johnson does not have a constitutional right to appointed counsel in these proceedings. Civ.R. 1(C)(1); see, also, <em>Gaskins, </em>76 Ohio St.3d at 382, 667 N.E.2d at 1196; <em>Wright v. Eckle </em>(Madison App.1957), 76 Ohio Law Abs. 323, 146 N.E.2d 890; <em>State ex rel. Jackson v. McManamon </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 1434, 713 N.E.2d 1047. In addition, although the APA failed to file a timely merit brief, we need not reverse the judgment of the court of appeals pursuant to S.Ct.Prac.R. VI(7) because Johnson\u2019s brief does not reasonably appear to sustain reversal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
