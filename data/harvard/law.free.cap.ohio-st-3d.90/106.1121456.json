Consequently, the respondent is hereby suspended from the practice of law for one year, with the entire suspension stayed conditioned upon his not engaging in the unsupervised private practice of law during that year and that he be monitored during that period on a regular basis by the relator or other appropriate agency.

I respectfully dissent from the sanction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-15\">Respondent essentially abandoned his practice in 1994. But respondent did more than that. He took the money from several clients and did little or nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>on their cases. He took no steps to withdraw and protect the interests of his clients. He essentially stole their money. None of it was returned until five years later, just prior to his disciplinary hearing. He also failed to cooperate fully with the investigation in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Time and again we have suspended attorneys who take their clients\u2019 money and do not pursue their cases. We have also suspended attorneys simply for failing to cooperate.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The only \u201cmitigation\u201d presented was that respondent has now returned to a \u201csupervised\u201d practice and that he \u201cdid convey a <em>sense </em>of remorse.\u201d He repaid the clients\u2019 fees only on the eve of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">From the nature of the actions the respondent failed to pursue, clients were clearly harmed. Bankruptcies were not filed, final hearings not attended, summary judgments granted, and his clients\u2019 cases dismissed. Surely such conduct deserves an actual suspension. I would suspend the respondent for two years and stay eighteen months of that suspension, pending conditions of monitoring and that no further violations be committed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b260-8\">Moyer, C.J., and F.E. Sweeney, J., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
