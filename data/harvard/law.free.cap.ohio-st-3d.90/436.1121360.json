The Industrial Commission and GMC disagree, and further state that the court of appeals erred in ordering the commission to reconsider claimant\u2019s application. We agree with the Industrial Commission and GMC.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">Claimant\u2019s argument was recently rejected by <em>State ex rel. Griffith v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 154, 156, 718 N.E.2d 423, 425. There, we wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">\u201cGriffith next argues that Rubbermaid certified her arthritic condition as part of her claim by authorizing and paying for her knee surgery. She relies on <em>State ex rel. Baker Material Handling Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 202, 631 N.E.2d 138, and <em>Garrett v. Jeep Corp. </em>(1991), 77 Ohio App.3d 402, 602 N.E.2d 691; however, the courts in those cases did not find the employers responsible for the claimants\u2019 additionally alleged conditions just because the employers authorized and paid for medical treatment. Rather, those employers were held accountable because they had explicitly acknowledged and certified the additional condition on C-174 forms designed, in part, to inform BWC about compensable conditions in their claims. * * * Rubbermaid has made no such explicit concessions. Thus, we hold that Rubbermaid did not allow Griffith\u2019s arthritic condition under <em>Baker </em>or <em>Garrett.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b590-12\">No such explicit concession exists here either. C-174s on file consistently list lumbosacral strain as the only allowed condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-13\">Moreover, the surgery and bill payment reports that claimant cites never mentioned degenerative disc disease, so there could be no payment or authorization of treatment for it. The condition was not initially raised until the appliea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>tion to reactivate the claim based on MeMaster\u2019s 1996 reports \u2014 eighteen years after the surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The holding in <em>Griffith </em>also invalidates the court of appeals\u2019 finding that \u201cherniated nucleus pulpos[u]s with associated radiculopathy\u201d was allowed in this claim by GMC\u2019s bill payment. There is thus no need for further consideration of the relationship of claimant\u2019s degenerative disc disease to his HNP. Since the latter has not been allowed in this claim, its relationship to claimant\u2019s degenerative condition is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the denial of a writ ordering reactivation of the claim, and authorization of treatment. We reverse those portions of the court of appeals\u2019 judgment that (1) found HNP to be an allowed condition and (2) ordered the commission to reconsider its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b591-8\">Moyek, C.J., F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer, Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b591-9\">Douglas and Resnick, JJ., dissent and would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
