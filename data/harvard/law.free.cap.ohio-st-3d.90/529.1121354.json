Respondent did not answer the complaint, and relator filed a motion for default.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Respondent did not respond to this motion, and, consequently, a panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline of the Supreme Court granted relator\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">According to the record, Simon Hunter retained respondent on March 10,1997, to represent Hunter in a lawsuit to recover damages for faulty electrical work on Hunter\u2019s home. When Hunter\u2019s attempts to contact respondent failed, he began a search for him that lasted months. With great difficulty, Hunter located respondent. Answering Hunter\u2019s inquiry, respondent promised action on Hunter\u2019s case; however, respondent did nothing further on the case. Hunter had paid respondent $500 as a retainer, but respondent did not file a lawsuit on Hunter\u2019s behalf and did not refund Hunter\u2019s retainer.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-12\">Next, Ella Kirksey Muhammad retained respondent in October 1996 to represent her in the appeal of a lawsuit. Respondent filed a notice of appeal in the case but did nothing further. Muhammad contacted the clerk of court, who informed her that the court had dismissed her appeal because respondent had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>filed a brief. Muhammad had paid respondent $3,600, which respondent did not refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">Third, Elmer Luke retained respondent on December 9, 1996, to pursue an insurance claim for Luke. Respondent assured Luke that he was working on the claim. However, respondent failed to act, and Luke discharged him on May 5, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Finally, respondent\u2019s wife, Kimetta Muttalib, informed the board that respondent had abandoned her and their four children in September 1997. She has learned that relator had married a woman while he was still married to Kimetta.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">A panel of the board found that respondent had violated DR 1-102(A)(3) (engaging in illegal conduct involving moral turpitude), 1-102(A)(4) (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), 1-102(A)(6) (engaging in conduct that adversely reflects on fitness to practice law), 6-101(A)(3) (neglecting legal matter entrusted to attorney), 9-102(B)(4) (failing to promptly pay all funds that client is entitled to receive), and Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G) (failing to cooperate with disciplinary investigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Relator recommended that the court permanently disbar respondent, and a majority of the panel agreed. The board adopted the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the panel, but recommended that we indefinitely suspend respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">We adopt the findings, conclusions, and recommendation of the board. We hereby indefinitely suspend respondent from the practice law in Ohio.

I agree with the findings and conclusions of the board, but would disbar respondent as the panel recommended. As the panel found, respondent performed \u201cpractically no services\u201d on behalf of the three clients named in the relator\u2019s complaint. And when respondent\u2019s inaction prompted these clients to try to contact him for an explanation, respondent engaged in \u201cdeceitful\u201d misrepresentations and/or \u201ctotally disappeared,\u201d retaining over $4,000 in advances for costs and in unearned fees. The panel also found that respondent committed illegal conduct involving moral turpitude by engaging in bigamy.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-13\">The board relied on \u201cthe facts involved in the three client incidents\u201d and respondent\u2019s \u201cabsence of a prior disciplinary record\u201d to depart from the panel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>recommended sanction of disbarment. But \u201cthe facts involved in the three client incidents\u201d are hardly mitigating. The \u201cFindings of Fact\u201d in the board report contain no mitigating information. Indeed, as the panel noted, \u201c[rjespondent did not submit any information in mitigation since he never appeared to contest any of the matters that have been asserted against him.\u201d Respondent has never responded to the complaint, amended complaint, or motion for default in this matter, and a lack of cooperation in the disciplinary process is-an <em>aggravating </em>factor under the board\u2019s own Guidelines for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And because I do not believe that the absence of a prior disciplinary record, without more, is a compelling mitigating factor,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> I would follow the panel\u2019s recommendation and disbar respondent.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b683-6\"><em>Kronenberg &amp; Kronenberg </em>and <em>Jacob A.H.
