For the reasons that follow, we hold that new and additional evidence permitted the commission\u2019s decision to grant rehearing but that the commission failed to cite evidence from which it could have legitimately assessed a VSSR. Accordingly, we reverse the court of appeals\u2019 judgment denying all relief and grant a limited writ ordering the commission\u2019s further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">\n<em>Rehearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">US Airways first argues that the commission had no new and additional evidence justifying rehearing. We reject this argument for the reasons cited by the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">The court of appeals properly recognized that the supervisor\u2019s affidavit, at least, constituted new and additional evidence. As its magistrate explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b406-13\">\u201cIn contending that the information contained in [the supervisor\u2019s] affidavit is not new evidence, but merely repetitive or cumulative of prior evidence, [US Airways] simply ignores the significance of the <em>source </em>of the information contained in the affidavit. As the ramp supervisor, Gregory Prewitt was presumably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Myers\u2019 supervisor and also was a company official with some authority over the area in which Myers worked.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">\u201cPrewitt\u2019s affidavit seriously undermined [US Airways\u2019] evidence that company policy forbade employees such as Myers from entering the conveyor while the system was energized.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">\u201cPrewitt\u2019s affidavit seriously undermined the factual premise of the first hearing officer\u2019s decision that [US Airways] had not violated Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-17(E). The first hearing officer reasoned that there was no foot hazard to Myers from the conveyor system while Myers was carrying out his assigned duties because his assigned duties did not require him, and in fact forbade him, to enter or stay in the conveyor system while it was operating. Prewitt\u2019s affidavit strongly suggests that it was indeed company policy that required or at least permitted Myers and his co-workers to do exactly what they did on the date of injury in attempting to clear the jammed bags.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">Thus, the court of appeals\u2019 judgment on this issue is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">\n<em>Clarity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-17(E) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">\u201cFoot protection shall be made available by the employer and shall be worn by the employee where an employee is exposed to machinery or equipment that presents a foot hazard or where an employee is handling material which presents a foot hazard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">The commission initially found no violation of this safety regulation because Myers was never \u201cexposed to machinery\u201d in a way that presented a foot hazard. The first SHO came to this conclusion for two reasons: (1) Myers was not \u201cexposed to contact\u201d as defined by Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-01(B)(47), which requires the exposure to occur \u201cin performance of [the employee\u2019s] regular or assigned duty,\u201d and (2) Myers was injured by the improper motor installation and not by the conveyor system <em>per se. </em>For both findings, the SHO relied on a US Airways customer service manager\u2019s affidavit, which stated that (1) airline policy prohibited employees from standing on or entering any conveyor unless the entire system was shut down, and (2) conveyor belts properly running in the same direction would not have created the \u201cpinch point\u201d that caused Myers\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-13\">But on rehearing, Gregory Prewitt, who had worked for US Airways for thirteen years and had been a ramp supervisor on the day of Myers\u2019s injury, advised:</p>\n<p id=\"b407-14\">1. \u201cIt [was] a common practice for [US Airways] employees at the Columbus station to keep the system of conveyors operating by standing on a down section of conveyor (just as [Myers] did) and throwing bags moving down the conveyor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>sections from the ticket counter to the conveyor sections still moving to the bag room.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">2. \u2018.\u2018Everyone knew that when the conveyor system shut down, you had to do whatever it took to keep the conveyor system operating and the bags moving.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">3. \u201cIt [was] a normal part of our assigned job duties to climb into the system of conveyors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">4. \u201c[T]he Columbus manager * * * never objected to this procedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">5. The customer service manager who had testified for US Airways in the first VSSR hearing \u201c[had] not [been] assigned to Columbus at the time of [Myers\u2019s] accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">Prewitt also disputed the first SHO\u2019s finding that the incorrect motor installation was the proximate cause of Myers\u2019s injury:</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">\u201cIt does not take two in-running conveyor sections to be caught. Although it would be easier to be drawn between two conveyor sections when the conveyor sections are running together, the same type of accident could occur when one conveyor section is down and the abutting conveyor is running.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">As the court of appeals observed, Prewitt contradicted the first SHO\u2019s reasons for denying VSSR relief and, therefore, his evidence was \u201cnew and additional\u201d as well as relevant, and might have been used to grant VSSR compensation on rehearing. Ohio Adm.Code 4121 \u2014 3\u201420(G)(1)(a). But for some reason, the second SHO apparently did not consider the real substance of Prewitt\u2019s affidavit, choosing instead to focus on foot injuries sustained by Myers\u2019s co-workers from other hazards such as handling luggage and using carts. The result is an overreaching discussion that creates more confusion than clarity.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">More specifically, the second SHO found a VSSR at the same time he observed that no evidence suggested that the particular foot hazard encountered by Myers could possibly have been foreseen by US Airways. Then to justify his award, the SHO relied on foot hazards that were not the cause of Myers\u2019s injury. US Airways attacks these flaws on grounds of causation, foreseeability, and strict construction, all of which represent strains in its overriding theme \u2014 that the order is fatally unclear.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-13\">We agree. As it stands now, the commission\u2019s order is too confused to fairly impose VSSR liability. The commission has no authority to penalize an employer for failing to protect employees from foot hazards that have nothing to do with the claimant\u2019s injury. In fact, we recently rejected this sweeping approach to finding VSSRs for \u201cpotential\u201d foot hazards in <em>State ex rel. Burchfield v. Printech Corp. </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 169, 699 N.E.2d 56. <em>Burchfield </em>held that even if a foot hazard existed in the claimant\u2019s workplace, the commission could not grant a VSSR award unless that foot hazard actually caused the claimant\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>We are thus faced with a commission order that fails to cogently explain the evidence and reasoning for granting a VSSR award. In a similar case, <em>State ex rel. Martin Painting &amp; Coating Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 333, 343, 678 N.E.2d 206, 214, we returned the cause to the commission with instructions to remedy this insufficiency. We follow that procedure here and grant a limited writ. The commission is therefore ordered to conduct further proceedings consistent with our opinion including to provide adequate explanation as to why the VSSR award must be granted or denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part and limited writ granted.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b409-6\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.
