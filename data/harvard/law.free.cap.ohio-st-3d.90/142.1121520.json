We determine that the court of appeals did not exceed the scope of appellate review under R.C. 2506.04 when it reviewed the decision of the common pleas court in this case. Nevertheless, we differ from the court of appeals because we conclude that the common pleas court did not err when it failed to apply Section 80 to preclude appellants\u2019 proposed use of the former convent. Because we reverse the decision of the court of appeals and reinstate the decision of the common pleas court, we need not- address appellants\u2019 constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The question at the center of this appeal is whether Section 80\u2019s General Requirements preclude the use of a portion of the former convent as residential apartments. The common pleas court did not address Section 80 in its decision affirming the board\u2019s order, even though Henley expressly raised Section 80 in her fourth assignment of error to that court. The court of appeals <em>did </em>expressly apply Section 80, concluding that even though Beatitude House would qualify as an \u201caccessory use\u201d under the general definition contained in Article I of the zoning ordinance, Section 80\u2019s General Requirements prohibited the use of the former convent as a dwelling due to the property\u2019s location in a residential zone. Appellants here contend that the court of appeals substituted its judgment for that of the common pleas court when it reversed the decision of the common pleas court on this basis. Since the court of appeals did not discuss the standard of review applicable to administrative appeals taken under R.C. 2506.04, we begin our analysis by reviewing that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">A. The Limited Standard of Appellate Review in an R.C. 2506.04 Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Construing the language of R.C. 2506.04, we have distinguished the standard of review to be applied by common pleas courts and courts of appeals in R.C. Chapter 2506 administrative appeals. The common pleas court considers the \u201cwhole record,\u201d including any new or additional evidence admitted under R.C. 2506.03, and determines whether the administrative order is unconstitutional, illegal, arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or unsupported by the preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence. See <em>Smith v. Granville Twp. Bd. of Trustees </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 608, 612, 693 N.E.2d 219, 223, citing <em>Dudukovich v. Lorain Metro. Hous. Auth. </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 202, 206-207, 12 O.O.3d 198, 201-202, 389 N.E.2d 1113, 1116-1117.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">The standard of review to be applied by the court of appeals in an R.C. 2506.04 appeal is <em>\u201cmore limited </em>in scope.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Kisil v. Sandusky </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 30, 34, 12 OBR 26, 30, 465 N.E.2d 848, 852. \u201cThis statute grants a more limited power to the court of appeals to review the judgment of the common pleas court only on \u2018questions of law,\u2019 which does not include the same extensive power to weigh \u2018the preponderance of substantial, reliable and probative evidence,\u2019 as is granted to the common pleas court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at fn. 4. \u201cIt is incumbent on the trial court to examine the evidence. Such is not the charge of the appellate court. * * * The fact that the court of appeals, or this court, might have arrived at a different conclusion than the administrative agency is immaterial. Appellate courts must not substitute their judgment for those of an administrative agency or a trial court absent the approved criteria for doing so.\u201d <em>Lorain City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 257, 261, 533 N.E.2d 264, 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>B. The Standard of Review Applied by the Court of Appeals</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">In their third proposition of law, appellants contend that the court of appeals misapplied the foregoing standards in this administrative appeal. In order to resolve this issue, we must determine what standard of review the court of appeals actually applied. Our inquiry is complicated by the fact that the court of appeals\u2019 opinion lacks any reference to R.C. 2506.04 or to any judicial decisions discussing the proper standard of review in administrative appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Nevertheless, the court of appeals\u2019 opinion focuses on the application of Section 80 to undisputed facts in the record. The application of Section 80 to the facts is a \u201cquestion of law\u201d \u2014 \u201c[a]n issue to be decided by the judge, concerning the application or interpretation of the law.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7 Ed.1999) 1260. That the application of Section 80 to this case involved a consideration of facts or the evidence did not turn this question into a question of fact. <em>O\u2019Day v. Webb </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St.2d 215, 58 O.O.2d 424, 280 N.E.2d 896, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Moreover, Henley\u2019s assignment of error to the court of appeals asserted that the common pleas court had \u201cabuse[d its] discretion\u201d by failing to preclude the proposed use on the basis of Section 80. This court has held that in administrative appeals under R.C. 2506.04, \u201c[w]ithin the ambit of \u2018questions of law5 for appellate court review would be abuse of discretion by the common pleas court.\u201d <em>Kisil, supra, </em>at fn. 4. Accordingly, the court of appeals did not exceed the proper scope of review under that statute when it sought to determine whether Section 80 applied to the undisputed facts in the record, or whether the common pleas court abused its discretion by failing to apply Section 80. R.C. 2506.04; see, also, <em>Kisil, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">Our conclusion that the court of appeals did not exceed the standard of review under R.C. 2506.04 does not preclude us from reaching a different <em>result </em>than the court of appeals on the issue of whether the common pleas court did, in fact, err by fading to prohibit the Sisters\u2019 proposal on the basis of Section 80. Accord <em>Solid Rock Ministries Internatl. v. Monroe Bd. of Zoning Appeals </em>(June 5, 2000), Butler App. No. CA99-10-170, unreported, 2000 WL 744584 (holding that, although common pleas court applied the proper standard of review to review decisions of zoning boards, common pleas court nevertheless misapplied the law when it found that prior permit issued by board disallowed proposed group home for unwed pregnant teenagers, when prior permit disallowed only schools and the group home was a permitted church use). Because we determine, <em>infra, </em>that Section 80 does not preclude the Sisters\u2019 proposed use of the convent, we conclude that the court of appeals erred when it reversed the decision of the common pleas court on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Article I of the Youngstown ordinance, after providing a guide to \u201cInterpretation of Certain Terms and Words,\u201d includes a \u201cList of Definitions.\u201d Section 12.10 of that list provides that an \u201cAccessory Use or Building\u201d is \u201c[a] use customarily incidental and subordinate to the principal use or building and located on the same lot with such principal use or building.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The court of appeals concluded, and we agree, that \u201csocial programs of a church, such as the ones in this case, <em>are accessory uses in that they are customarily incidental to the principal use.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The character of uses and structures that courts have deemed accessory to religious uses has varied widely. See, generally, Annotation, What Constitutes Accessory or Incidental Use of Religious or Educational Property Within Zoning Ordinance (1982), 11 A.L.R. 4th 1084, 1086, citing 2 Anderson, American Law of Zoning 2d, Section 12.26.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Several courts have specifically permitted residential accommodations in church buildings as accessory uses. See, <em>e.g., St. John\u2019s Evangelical Lutheran Church v. Hoboken </em>(1983), 195 N.J.Super. 414, 479 A.2d 935 (shelter for homeless); <em>Beit Havurah v. Norfolk Zoning Bd. of Appeals </em>(1979), 177 Conn. 440, 418 A.2d 82 (unrestricted overnight accommodations in synagogue). Most recently, the Twelfth District Court of Appeals determined that a home for unwed pregnant teenage girls, which included prenatal care, life skills training, and a spiritual education, was an integral part of a church\u2019s missionary purposes. <em>Solid Rock Ministries Internatl., supra. </em>Based on the foregoing, we agree with the court of appeals that Beatitude House would be \u201ccustomarily incidental\u201d to the principal use of the diocesan property as a Catholic church and would satisfy Article I\u2019s definition of \u201cAccessory Use or Building.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Article VII \u2014 the article containing Section 80\u2019s Supplemental Regulations\u2014 provides a different definition of \u201cAccessory Building\u201d from the one appearing in Article I\u2019s \u201cList of Definitions.\u201d Section 80, entitled \u201cRegulation of Accessory Buildings in Residential Districts,\u201d more specifically provides that \u201c[i]n residential districts, \u2018Accessory Building\u2019 means a structure constructed or installed on, above, or below the surface of a parcel, which is located on the same lot as a principal use or structure, and which is subordinate to or serves the principal use or structure, [and] is subordinate in area to the principal use or structure. \u2018Accessory Building\u2019 includes <em>any building of a subordinate nature attached to or </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number><em>detached from a principal structure or use, including but not limited to sheds, garages and greenhouses.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">After citing Section 80\u2019s definition of \u201cAccessory Building,\u201d the court of appeals seized on the following selected language from Section 80\u2019s \u201cGeneral Requirements\u201d to reverse the decision of the common pleas court and deny the Sisters\u2019 proposed use: \u201cIn residential districts, except as otherwise provided in this Ordinance, <em>an accessory building shall be permitted in association with a principal use or structure provided that:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">\u00ed&lt; * :\u00a1: $</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">\u201c2. <em>It shall not contain or be used as a dwelling unit.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">Relying on these provisions of the ordinance, the court of appeals came to the following conclusions: \u201cAccessory uses are permitted. These accessory uses may occur in accessory buildings. However, accessory buildings cannot contain dwelling units in any residential district unless the ordinance specifies an exception. * * * Accordingly, * * * St. Brendan\u2019s Church may not allow Beatitude House to remodel its former convent into apartments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">Implicit in the court of appeals\u2019 syllogism is the view that all separate structures in which accessory uses occur, if located in a residential area, are necessarily \u201caccessory buildings\u201d embraced by Section 80\u2019s prohibition of dwelling units in accessory buildings. We do not share this view, and determine on this question of law that the common pleas court did not err when it failed to apply Section 80 to preclude renovation of the former convent.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">For one, Section 80\u2019s definition of \u201cAccessory Building,\u201d unlike the general definition of \u201cAccessory Use or Building\u201d that appears in Article I, expressly refers to \u201csheds, garages and greenhouses.\u201d This list of structurally similar storage- or workshop-type buildings shows that the drafters of the zoning code had a particular type of structure in mind when they desired to prohibit dwelling units in \u201caccessory buildings\u201d in residential zones. Our conclusion is reinforced by Article Y\u2019s \u201cSchedule of Uses,\u201d which refers to accessory uses <em>\u201csuch as </em>garages, greenhouses, or tool shed.\u201d (Emphasis added.) If the drafters had not intended to limit the purview of Section 80 to this type of structure, and wished to render Section 80\u2019s prohibition applicable to <em>all </em>structures in which accessory uses happen to occur, they could easily have done so. But they did not. Instead of referring back to Article I\u2019s general definition of \u201cAccessory Use or Building,\u201d Section 80 limits the reach of its General Requirements by making them applicable to a narrower category of \u201cAccessory Buildings\u201d \u2014 a category defined and described with reference to sheds, garages, and greenhouses.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">Though the nonexhaustive list of structures in Section 80\u2019s definition of \u201cAccessory Building\u201d is preceded by the phrase \u201cincluding but not limited to,\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>canon of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>which has been cited with approval by this court, suggests that the general or unstated terms in the definition should be determined with reference to the terms expressly included. <em>State v. Hooper </em>(1979), 57 Ohio St.2d 87, 89-90, 11 O.O.3d 250, 252, 386 N.E.2d 1348, 1350; see, also, Miller, Pragmatics and the Maxims of Interpretation (1990), 1990 Wis.L.Rev. 1179, 1199\u2014 1200. In <em>Hooper, </em>we noted that the canon of <em>ejusdem generis </em>is particularly applicable to statutory language that must be strictly construed. <em>Hooper, </em>57 Ohio St.2d at 89, 11 O.O.3d at 251-252, 386 N.E.2d at 1350, fn. 4. Section 80, since it \u201cimpose[s] restrictions upon the use, management, control, or alienation of private property,\u201d should be strictly construed. See <em>State ex rel. Moore Oil Co. v. Dauben </em>(1919), 99 Ohio St. 406, 124 N.E. 232, paragraph one of the syllabus. Accordingly, the common pleas court did not err to the prejudice of appellees when it disregarded this regulation aimed at \u201csheds, garages, and greenhouses\u201d in the context of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Furthermore, the court of appeals cited only the second of Section 80\u2019s five enumerated General Requirements to support its reversal of the common pleas court. The four General Requirements that the court of appeals omitted from its analysis support appellants\u2019 view that Section 80\u2019s prohibitions apply to small, shed-like structures:</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">\u201c1. The total area occupied by accessory buildings shall not exceed * * * thirty-five percent of the gross floor area of the principal structure or * * * 770 square feet. <em>One shed, </em>not to exceed 120 square feet, shall be permitted in excess of the above area limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">\u201c3. <em>It shall not exceed eighteen (18) feet at the highest point, and the side walls shall not exceed 12 feet in height.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\"><em>\u201c4. </em>It shall meet all <em>yard requirements </em>of this zoning ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">\u201c5. <em>If not located in the rear yard, </em>it shall be an integral part of the principal building to which it is accessory.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">Courts are to read words and phrases in context. See R.C. 1.42. When the phrase \u201cit shall not contain or be used as a dwelling unit\u201d is read in its proper context, that context \u2014 like the canon of <em>ejusdem generis </em>\u2014 only reinforces our conclusion that Section 80\u2019s General Requirements apply to structures in residential zones resembling those specifically enumerated in Section 80\u2019s Definition of \u201cAccessory Building,\u201d and not to the former convent at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">The court of appeals stated that it resisted Beatitude House\u2019s invitation to \u201cinterpret the ordinance instead of simply applying it.\u201d But in order to apply Section 80 to the convent here, or to determine that the common pleas court abused its discretion by failing to apply it, the court of appeals necessarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>interpreted Section 80 broadly, so that the prohibitions contained in its General Requirements would embrace a structure completely unlike those listed in Section 80\u2019s definition of \u201cAccessory Building.\u201d Because zoning ordinances deprive property owners of certain uses of their property, however, they will not be extended to include limitations by implication. <em>Van Camp v. Riley </em>(1984), 16 Ohio App.3d 457, 16 OBR 539, 476 N.E.2d 1078. See, also, <em>Univ. Circle, Inc. v. Cleveland </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 180, 184, 10 O.O.3d 346, 348, 383 N.E.2d 139, 141; <em>Dauben, supra, </em>99 Ohio St. 406, 124 N.E. 232, paragraph one of the syllabus; 3 Anderson, American Law of Zoning 3d (1986) 7-8, Section 16.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Section 80\u2019s General Requirements, though they apply to the residential zone in which the former convent is located, prohibit dwelling units in sheds, garages, greenhouses, or other similar structures. The common pleas court did not err to the prejudice of appellees when it failed to apply Section 80 to prevent the Sisters from realizing their transitional-housing proposal at the former convent \u2014 a proposal that the board approved as a permissible accessory use.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">In their first and second propositions of law, appellants submit that when the court of appeals reversed the decision of the common pleas court and denied the accessory use permit, this infringed appellants\u2019 right to freely exercise their religion \u2014 a right independently guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 7, Article I of the Ohio Constitution. Due to our disposition of appellants\u2019 third proposition of law, appellants\u2019 constitutional claims are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b304-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnigk and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"A243\">F.E.

I agree that the Sisters\u2019 proposed use of the convent may be incidental to the church\u2019s primary use of the property. I also believe that providing assistance to poverty-stricken mothers is a worthy endeav- or. Nevertheless, I believe that the plain language of the Youngstown Zoning Ordinance precludes the Sisters from using the convent as a dwelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">A. Zoning Intent</p>\n<p id=\"b304-12\">The zoning ordinance seeks to regulate, among other things, population density in residential districts. Regulation of population density has been held to be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>valid zoning objective. See <em>State ex rel. Grant v. Kiefaber </em>(1960), 114 Ohio App. 279, 19 O.O.2d 207, 181 N.E.2d 905. Presumably to assist residential districts in maintaining their population density levels, Section 80 of the zoning ordinance also precludes \u201caccessory buildings\u201d from being used as dwelling units.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The church does not dispute that the convent is an accessory building that is located in a residential, single-family, R-7.2 district. Therefore, allowing the convent to be converted into a dwelling would be in clear conflict with the purpose of maintaining population density, not only because it would allow an accessory building that contains a dwelling, but also because it would allow a multifamily dwelling in a single-family district. Persons in these neighborhoods have a justifiable expectation that valid zoning regulations will be enforced to preserve the nature of their neighborhood. Accordingly, I believe that the zoning ordinance precludes the conversion of the convent into apartments.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">B. Free Exercise Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Although the issue is not addressed by the majority, the brief of the Beatitude House and the church argues that enforcement of the zoning laws to preclude the convent from being used for housing for participants in the Potter\u2019s Wheel Project would violate the church\u2019s right to free exercise of religion. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">The Free Exercise Clause prohibits the government from discriminating against someone solely because of religious beliefs, but it does not prohibit the government from enforcing religious-neutral laws of general applicability. <em>Oregon Dept. of Human Resources, Emp. Div. v. Smith </em>(1990), 494 U.S. 872, 110 S.Ct. 1595, 108 L.Ed.2d 876. The zoning ordinance merely divides property within the city of Youngstown into separate districts -with different land use regulations for various enumerated religious-neutral purposes. Section 80 does not prevent the Sisters from providing assistance to the women and their children; it merely prevents the Sisters from housing these families on this particular piece of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">Zoning laws often involve striking a balance between competing interests. In this case, the property is zoned single-family to preserve the character of a family neighborhood. Allowing the convent to be used for a multifamily dwelling would infringe on the neighbors\u2019 right to preserve the quality of their community. The zoning ordinance has nothing to do with inhibiting the laudable goal of aiding mothers in need, but everything to do with preserving the nature of the neighborhood as the zoning ordinance intended. Even applying the Ohio test for the free exercise of religion as set out in <em>Humphrey v. Lane </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 62, 728 N.E.2d 1039, I would find that Section 80 furthered a compelling state interest of preserving the nature of the neighborhood. I would also find that Section 80 achieved that interest using the least restrictive means because the housing for the Potter\u2019s Wheel Project participants could be located anywhere in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Youngstown where the zoning permitted such a use. Accordingly, I believe that enforcement of the zoning in this case does not violate the Free Exercise Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">C. <em>Ejusdem Generis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Article IV of the zoning ordinance allows the following use in the R-7.2, single-family residential district:</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">\u201cAccessory uses and structures incidental to any permitted residential use, such as garages, greenhouses or tool sheds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">In 1990, the Youngstown City Council passed Section 80 of the Supplementary Regulations to the ordinance. Section 80, entitled \u201cRegulation of Accessory Buildings in Residential Districts,\u201d states:</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">\u201cPurpose: It is the purpose of this Section to regulate accessory buildings in residential districts in order to promote the public health, safety and welfare. It is the intent of this Section to permit buildings that are compatible with principal uses and harmonious with the uses upon adjacent properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">\u201cDefinition: In residential districts, \u2018Accessory Building\u2019 means a structure constructed or installed on, above, or below the surface of a parcel, which is located on the same lot as a principal use or structure, and which is subordinate to or serves the principal use or structure, [and] is subordinate in area to the principal use or structure. \u2018Accessory Building\u2019 includes any building of a subordinate nature attached to or detached from a principal structure or use, including but not limited to sheds, garages and greenhouses.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">\u201cGeneral Requirements</p>\n<p id=\"b306-12\">\u201cIn residential districts, except as otherwise provided in this Ordinance, an accessory building shall be permitted in association with a principal use or structure provided that:</p>\n<p id=\"b306-13\">\u201c1. The total area occupied by accessory buildings shall not exceed: a) thirty-five percent of the gross floor area of the principal structure or * * * b) 770 square feet. One shed, not to exceed 120 square feet, shall be permitted in excess of the above area limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-14\">\u201c2. <em>It shall not contain or be used as a dwelling unit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-15\">\u201c3. It shall not exceed eighteen (18) feet at the highest point, and the side walls shall not exceed 12 feet in height.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-16\">\u201c4. It shall meet all the yard requirements of this zoning ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-17\">\u201c5. If not located in the rear yard, it shall be an integral part of the principal building to which it is an accessory.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b306-18\">Applying <em>ejusdem generis, </em>the majority holds that Section 80 applies only to \u201csmall, shed-like structures,\u201d and therefore Section 80 does not apply to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>convent. The majority reasons that Section 80\u2019s reference to \u201csheds, garages and greenhouses\u201d indicates that the drafters intended to limit Section 80\u2019s application to this type of small structure. The majority finds that the \u201cGeneral Requirements\u201d of Section 80 also support this limitation on Section 80\u2019s application. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Under the rule of statutory construction of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>\u201c[w]here general words <em>follow </em>the enumeration of particular classes of things, the general words will be construed as applying only to things of the same general class as those enumerated.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Light v. Ohio Univ. </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 66, 68, 28 OBR 165, 167, 502 N.E.2d 611, 613, citing <em>State v. Aspell </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 1, 39 O.O.2d 1, 225 N.E.2d 226. \u201cFor example, in the phrase <em>horses, cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, or any other barnyard animal, </em>the general language <em>or any other barnyard animal </em>* * * would probably be held to include only four-legged, hoofed mammals.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7 Ed.1999) 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">\u201cThe reason behind this principle of statutory construction is that, if the Legislature had meant the general words to be applied without restriction, it would have used a general term only, rather than specifically enumerating certain persons, subjects, or objects followed by general terminology.\u201d <em>State v. Greenburg </em>(Sept. 30, 1986), Franklin App. No. 86AP-286, unreported, at 5-6, 1986 WL 11090.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">The majority finds that the language \u201csheds, garages and greenhouses\u201d in Section 80 evidences an intent that the drafters of this section intended it to prohibit only \u201cstorage- or workshop-type buildings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">However, the language \u201csheds, garages and greenhouses\u201d does not precede, but rather follows, the definition of accessory building in Section 80, making the rule of <em>ejusdem generis </em>inapplicable. See, <em>e.g., Bascon Inc. v. de la Vega </em>(Nov. 19, 1999), Hamilton App. No. C-990172, unreported, 1999 WL 1043731. Thus, I believe that the drafters did not intend to limit the definition of accessory building, because they used a general term to define accessory building rather than a series followed by general language. <em>Greenburg, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">Moreover, words such as \u201cother,\u201d \u201cother thing,\u201d \u201cothers,\u201d or \u201cany other\u201d that follow the enumerated series signal that the rulemaking authority is seeking to limit the general words to the class of things listed in the enumerated series. <em>Glidden Co. v. Glander </em>(1949), 151 Ohio St. 344, 350, 39 O.O. 184, 187, 86 N.E.2d 1, 4. For example in <em>Light v. Ohio Univ., </em>the court construed R.C. 1533.18(B), which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">\u201c \u2018Recreational user\u2019 means a person to whom permission has been granted * * * to enter upon premises to hunt, fish, trap, camp, hike, swim, or engage in <em>other </em>recreational pursuits.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>The court in <em>Light </em>applied <em>ejusdem generis </em>and limited the phrase \u201cother recreational pursuits\u201d to the same general class of the items listed in the preceding enumerated series, <em>i.e., </em>hunting, fishing, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Unlike the statutory languag\u00e9 addressed in <em>Light, </em>Section 80 does not contain language such as \u201cother,\u201d which typically signifies an intent to limit a general term to the class of terms in the proceeding enumerated series. Instead, the words \u201csheds, garages and greenhouses\u201d is preceded by the phrase \u201cincluding but not limited to.\u201d The language \u201cincluding but not limited to\u201d is recognized by courts as indicating a nonexhaustive list of examples. See <em>In re Smallwood </em>(Jan. 26, 1998), Butler App. No. CA97-02-041, unreported, 1998 WL 24343; <em>In re Estate of Lewis </em>(July 23, 1999), Athens App. No. 98CA17, unreported, 1999 WL 595458; <em>State v. Barnett </em>(Feb. 8, 2000) Seneca App. No. 13-99-18, unreported, 2000 WL 140850; <em>K-Swiss, Inc. v. Cowens Sports Ctr., Inc. </em>(Nov. 8, 1995), Greene App. No. 95-CA-48, unreported, 1995 WL 655945. Thus, I would find that Section 80\u2019s reference to \u201csheds, garages and greenhouses\u201d is merely a nonexhaustive list of examples of the types of accessory buildings that may be erected in a residential district and not a limitation of the definition of an accessory building.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Finally, I believe that Section 80\u2019s language intends an expansive definition for the term \u201caccessory building.\u201d The <em>definition </em>portion of Section 80 reads: \u201c \u2018Accessory Building\u2019 includes <em>any </em>building of a subordinate nature attached to or detached from a principal structure or use, including but not limited to sheds, garages and greenhouses.\u201d (Emphasis added.) If the drafters of Section 80 had wished to limit its application to shed-like structures, it would have defined accessory building as a shed-like structure, but it did not. Instead Section 80 states that \u201caccessory building\u201d includes \u201cany building of a subordinate nature.\u201d \u201cAny\u201d is defined as \u201cone indifferently out of more than two: one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) 97. Thus, \u201cany\u201d is not a word of limitation, but rather suggests an expansive definition of an accessory building. Therefore, I do not believe that Section 80 was intended to apply only to small, shed-like structures.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">The majority also finds that the \u201cGeneral Requirements\u201d of Section 80 support the conclusion that Section 80 applies only to small shed-like structures. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion otherwise, only two of the five General Requirements address the size of the accessory building and thus lend even plausible support to the majority.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> More important, the General Requirements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>are merely a component of Section 80 that provides some limitations on the types of accessory buildings that <em>can </em>be erected in a residential district, as opposed to limiting the applicability of Section 80. Finally, it is the definition portion of Section 80 that actually defines the term accessory building, which, as I determined above, provides an expansive definition of the term \u201caccessory building.\u201d Thus, I do not believe that the General Requirements limit Section 80\u2019s application to small, shed-like structures.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">For all the aforementioned reasons, I believe that there is no intent on the part of the drafters of Section 80 to limit its application to small, shed-like structures. Therefore, I believe that the rule of <em>ejusdem generis </em>should not be applied in this case because it defeats Section 80\u2019s ban on dwelling units in accessory buildings in residential neighborhoods. <em>State v. Warner </em>(1990), 55 Ohio St.3d 31, 62, 564 N.E.2d 18, 47 (\u201cthe rule of <em>ejusdem generis </em>should not be invoked to defeat the obvious purpose of a legislative enactment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">D. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Therefore, I would hold that Section 80 precludes renovation of the convent for use as' a dwelling. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b309-8\">F.E. Sweeney, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b308-9\">. The first General Requirement allows a one-hundred-twenty-square-foot shed. However, this \u201cshed\u201d is \u201cpermitted in excess of the above area limits.\u201d The \u201cabove area limits\u201d allow a seven-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>hundred-seventy-square-foot building. Thus, the first General Requirement allows a shed <em>and </em>a seven-hundred-seventy-square-foot building. Accordingly, even this language cited by the majority allows a building bigger than a shed, by its own definition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
