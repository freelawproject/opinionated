Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7G\">1. It was impossible to produce the ballot at the trial, because it had been destroyed by the city clerk, as required by the statute of 1884, chapter 299, section 26. It is now objected that such destruction must be deemed to have been the act of the prosecutor, namely, the government, and that therefore the government could not properly be allowed to introduce secondary evidence of what the ballot was. But the destruction of ballots, under this general provision of law, cannot be deemed a wrongful or negligent destruction of a document, or one which involves any fault upon the part of the government or its agents ; and the case does not fall within the doctrine, which has sometimes been declared or implied, that a document which has been destroyed through the fault of the prosecutor cannot be proved by secondary evidence! See 3 Greenl. Ev., section 107; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snell, </em>3 Mass. 82; <em>Joannes v. Bennet, 5 </em>Allen, 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">2. It was not necessary to show that the ballot had been cancelled by a mechanical device, as provided in section 10 of the statute. Such cancellation is not essential to insure the counting of a ballot, since section 12 makes provision for the case where a ballot-box containing such mechanical device cannot be furnished. Besides, the evidence showing that the ballot came from the ballot-box which was actually used in the election would warrant the inference that it had been duly cast within the meaning of section 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">3. The alteration was sufficient to sustain the indictment. If the ballot had been originally cast, with the erasure shown, it could not properly have been counted as a ballot for Mr. Wakefield. The erasure was sufficient to \u201calter\u201d the ballot, so that the voter\u2019s intention would have been defeated if the fraud had not been observed or discovered. The name upon the ballot is to be taken as a whole. If the lines and marks drawn across it were sufficient to show an apparent intention upon the part of the voter to erase the name, so that the ballot would not be counted as a vote for Mr. Wakefield, that is sufficient to support the charge of altering the ballot by drawing lines and marks across the words and name \u201c Nelson S. Wakefield.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">4. The objection that the vote for Mr. Wakefield was not a \u201c ballot cast for any officer,\u201d because he was merely a candidate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>for office, and was not elected,. cannot prevail. The statute merely uses a short form of expression, and the meaning is not open to doubt; otherwise the statute would only apply to existing officers who might be candidates for re-election. The phraseology of \u201c voting for any officers to be then chosen\u201d is common and familiar in the legislation of this Commonwealth. Public Statutes, chapter 7, section 55. General Statutes, chapter 7, section 28. See also statute 1884, chapter 299, section 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-3\">5. The fact that the fraud of the defendant did not succeed, and that, by direction of the election officer, the ballot was counted and returned for Mr. Wakefield, cannot avail the defendant in defence of the indictment. The ballot was altered with intent to cheat and defraud, although the fraud was discovered at once.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
