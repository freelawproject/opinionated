J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGm\">This is a petition for a writ of mandamus against the respondents, who are the hoard of registrars of voters for the city of Lynn. The petition alleges that the board, when in session on the twenty-eighth day of September in the year 1891, refused to enter the petitioner\u2019s name on the voting lists, for the reason that it did not appear that he had paid any State or county tax within two years, as required by Article III. of the Amendments to the Constitution of Massachusetts. The petitioner also alleges that the respondents informed him that if he should pay a tax they would also require him to show that he was able to read the Constitution in the English language and to write his name, as required by Article XX. of the Amendments to the Constitution. The provisions of Article III., requiring the payment of a State or county tax within two years next preceding an election as a qualification for the right to vote at such election for State officers, were abolished by Article XXXII. of the Amendments to the Constitution, which went into effect on Nov. 8, 1891, and there is no reason to. believe that the respondents would now refuse to enter the petitioner\u2019s name on the voting lists because he has not paid a tax within two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">The petitioner, at the argument in this court, presented a brief in his own handwriting, and read from it, and it was apparent that he could read and write the English language easily and well. The petitioner\u2019s contention is that under St. 1892, c. 351, \u00a7 22, the registrars must require such a person as he is \u201c to read at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>three lines other than the title from an official edition of the Constitution, in such manner as to show that he is neither prompted nor reciting from memory,\u201d and must also require him \u201c to write his name in the register; \u201d and that such requirements are in violation of the rights secured to him as a citizen of the United States by the Constitution of the United States. The only provision in' the Constitution of the United States, as originally adopted, concerning the qualification of electors in the States is that the electors of the members of the House of Representatives of the United States \u201c shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislature.\u201d Art. I., \u00a7 2. When the Constitution of the United States was adopted the qualifications required of an elector of a representative or representatives in the House of Representatives of Massachusetts were that he should be a male person twenty-one years of age, resident in the town where he attempted to vote for the space of one year next preceding the election, and should have a freehold estate within the town of the annual income of three pounds, or any estate of the value of sixty pounds. Const. Mass., pt.-2, c. 1, \u00a7 3, art. 4. A constitution with such restrictions on the right to vote was regarded by the framers of the Constitution of the United States as republican in form. Article XIV. of the Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, \u00a7 2, provides that \u201c When the right to vote at any election ... is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens sHa.ll bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.\u201d This distinctly recognizes the right of a State to deny or abridge the right to vote of the male inhabitants who are twenty-one years of age; and it is well known that many of the States have, from time to time, by an impartial and uniform rule of prohibition, denied the right to vote to such of their male inhabitants as were thought not to possess the qualifications necessary for an independent and intelligent exercise of the right.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\">Article XV. of the Amendments to the Constitution of the United States provides that \u201cThe right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States, or by any State, on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\u201d This is the only prohibition on the States contained in the Constitution of the United States which concerns the right to vote. It is settled that the right to vote is not one of the privi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>leges or immunities of citizens of the United States within the meaning of Article XIV. of the Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cruikshank, </em>92 U.
