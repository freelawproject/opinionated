He alleges that he was <em>(1) </em>denied the \u201copportunity\u201d to secure counsel and refused \u201ccourt-appointed\u201d counsel and <em>(2) </em>refused the opportunity, and not given time, to secure witnesses. No circumstances are stated indicating a need for counsel, especially before a magistrate, or in what sense he was \u201crefused\u201d opportunity to secure witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>Appointment of counsel by a magistrate is unheard of in Maryland, but as Judge Marbury stated in denying the writ, on appeal petitioner would have been entitled to a trial <em>de </em>novo; counsel could then have been appointed, if necessary. Petitioner\u2019s second complaint could also have been reviewed on appeal, but not on <em>habeas corpus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
