Petitioner alleges (without any explanatory facts) that \u201che was put in double jeopardy\u201d and that various alleged \u201cirregularities\u201d occurred in his trial, <em>e.g., </em>that after waiving hearing (and apparently praying a jury trial) before the Juvenile Court, he was never indicted nor arraigned, was tried without appointment of counsel, that the jury trial \u201cwas closed to the public\u201d, that he was jeopardized \u201cin that previous record was brought up to jury while trial was in session\u201d; that he told the court he wanted to appeal \u201cbut was refused\u201d. No request for appointment of counsel or circumstances making appointment of counsel necessary are alleged; nor any facts showing in what sense or to what extent his trial \u201cwas closed to the public\u201d, or whether with his consent. <em>Dutton v. State, </em>123 Md. 373, 91 A. 417. Nor are facts alleged which made petitioner\u2019s previous \u201crecord\u201d inadmissible or absence of facts which would make it admissible. The offense in question was properly tried without indictment. <em>Atwood v. Warden of Maryland </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number><em>House of Correction, </em>193 Md. 708, 709, 66 A. 2d 204. No facts are alleged which indicate that, in respect of appointment of counsel or otherwise, any fundamental right was denied. In respect of alleged procedural errors at the trial, <em>habeas corpus </em>cannot be made to serve the purpose of an appeal or a new trial. This is specifically true of a claim of double jeopardy. <em>Brown v. Sheriff, </em>200 Md. 663, 91 A. 2d 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
