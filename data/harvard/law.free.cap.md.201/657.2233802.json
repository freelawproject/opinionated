He further alleges that he was not tried until March 21 and that the State\u2019s Attorney caused him to spend more than two months in jail. He contends (1) that he was denied the right to a speedy trial, and (2) that his sentence should date from January 16, the time of his arrest, and not from March 21, the time of his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">First, a prisoner cannot be released on <em>habeas corpus </em>after conviction merely because his trial was improperly delayed. <em>Ruben v. Welch, </em>159 F. 2d 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">Secondly, the imposition of sentence in a criminal case is a matter within the province of the trial court. The Court of Appeals generally has no right to determine the penalty within the statutory limits. <em>Reid v. State, </em>200 Md. 89, 88 A. 2d 478. There is no law in this State requiring that a sentence shall date from the time of the defendant\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">As petitioner has alleged nothing to justify his release on <em>habeas corpus, </em>his application must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-11\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
