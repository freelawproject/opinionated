He complains (1) that he was held in jail for 52 days before he was tried and thus was denied the right to a speedy trial; and (2) that the bail fixed by the Court was excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">First, a prisoner cannot be released on <em>habeas corpus </em>after conviction merely because his trial was improperly delayed. <em>Ruben v. Welch, </em>159 F. 2d 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Secondly, the fact that bail fixed by the Court was excessive does not vitiate the prisoner\u2019s conviction and therefore cannot be raised on <em>habeas corpus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
