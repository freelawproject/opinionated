Crane, a trial magistrate in Prince George\u2019s County, on charges of petty larceny and was sentenced to the Maryland House of Correction for the period of two years. He has applied here for leave to appeal from refusal of a writ of <em>habeas corpus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b675-14\">Petitioner alleges that the magistrate told him that \u201cshe would fine him instead of giving him a sentence, but she knew he had no money to pay a fine.\u201d He alleges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>that he is under 21 years of age and that he had no money when he was arrested and not even a postage st\u00e1mp to enable'him to notify his parents, and he assumed that the police would notify them, as he requested them to do. He alleges that his parents did not know where he was until two weeks after he was sentenced. He contends that he would not have been sent to the House of Correction if his parents had been notified, because they would have paid his fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">\u2019 The imposition of sentence in a criminal case is a matter within the province of the trial judge or magistrate. The Court of Appeals generally has' no right to determine the penalty within the statutory limits. <em>Reid v. State, </em>200 Md. 89, 88 A. 2d 478.
