He apparently complains that the indictment (which is not in the record, nor is the commitment nor the docket entries in the criminal case) charged him (in a count other than the one under which he was convicted) with the larceny of ten keys of the value of $2.50 each, whereas the keys were actually of the value of 25 cents each, thus charging as a felony what was actually only a misdemeanor. At the trial he was represented by counsel, apparently of his own selection. He alleges (without further factual basis) that he was not given a fair and impartial trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-13\">If the indictment was defective, or unsupported by evidence or petitioner in any respect was denied a fair and impartial trial, objections at the trial on any such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>grounds could have been reviewed on motion for a new trial or on appeal. As Judge France said in denying a writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>the writ cannot be made to serve the purpose of an appeal, or a new trial of the question of guilt or innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
