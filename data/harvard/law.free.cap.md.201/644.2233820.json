He alleges that he was denied his constitutional right by refusal of the court to appoint counsel for his defense. In this court he alleges that his request for counsel was denied \u201con the pretense that the charge was not serious enough to merit counsel.\u201d The right to appointment of counsel does not depend solely on the length of possible \u2014 or actual \u2014 sentence upon conviction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>Petitioner alleges no circumstances, age, experience (or lack of it) or others, requiring appointment of counsel. The burden is upon him \u201cto state facts tending to show that 'for want of benefit of counsel an ingredient of unfairness actively operated in the process that resulted in his confinement.\u2019 <em>Quicksall v.
