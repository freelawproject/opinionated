Petitioner expresses a desire to offer evidence of an alibi and other proof of his innocence. Apparently he was represented at the trial by counsel of his own selection. <em>Habeas corpus </em>cannot be made to serve the purpose of an appeal or a new trial of the question of guilt or innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-15\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
