He alleges that he was denied his constitutional right by refusal of the court to appoint counsel for his defense, he being pecuniarily unable to employ counsel; that the court in denying his request said that it was not the policy of the court to provide counsel in extortion cases. He alleges no special circumstances, age, experience (or lack of it) or others, which made appointment of counsel necessary. The burden is upon him \u201cto state facts tending to show that \u2018for want of benefit of counsel an ingredient of unfairness actively operated in the process that resulted in his confinement.\u2019 <em>Quick</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number><em>sall v.
