The alleged offense was committed at or near a prison camp near Elkton of which petitioner was a member. At the time he was under a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>sentence of 4 years which has since expired. He alleges that he was not guilty and (with great detail) that the evidence so indicates. He alleges that he was \u201cdenied\u201d \u201ctaking the stand\u201d by his court-appointed counsel, but not that he made any complaint to the court concerning this advice or \u201cdenial\u201d. It appears that he has made repeated applications for <em>habeas corpus </em>on the same grounds, all of which applications have been denied. <em>Habeas corpus </em>cannot be made to serve the purpose of an appeal or a new trial of the question of guilt or innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
