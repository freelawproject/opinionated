The incident occurred on February 6, 1976, in the traveled portion of Cottage Street, a public highway fronting the plaintiff\u2019s residence, while the plaintiff was retrieving his empty trash barrels after a trash collection by the defendant. The first count alleged a breach of the defendant\u2019s statutory duty under General Statutes \u00a7 lSa-149,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the second count sounded in nuisance. After a trial to the court, judgment was rendered for the defendant. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">On appeal the plaintiff claims that the trial court erred: (1) in concluding that the plaintiff failed to sustain his burden of proof on (a) his freedom from contributory negligence, (b) the existence of the defect in the street, and (c) whether the defendant had constructive notice of that defect; (2) in concluding that the icy condition did not constitute a nuisance; (3) in rendering judgment for the defendant who had presented no witnesses and introduced no evidence, and whose motion for judgment of dismissal had been denied by the court, thereby demonstrating that the plaintiff had estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>lished a prima facie case; and (4) in denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend his complaint by adding a third count. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">To recover under the first count of his complaint, i.e., breach of statutory duty, the plaintiff must prove, by a fair preponderance of the evidence, (1) that the highway was defective as claimed; (2) that the defendant actually knew of the particular defect or that, in the exercise of its supervision of highways in the city, it should have known of that defect; (3) that the defendant, having actual or constructive knowledge of this defect, failed to remedy it having had a reasonable time, under all the circumstances, to do so; and (4) that the defect must have been the sole proximate cause of the injuries and damages claimed, which means that the plaintiff must prove freedom from contributory negligence. See <em>Cusick </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>148 Conn. 548, 550-51, 172 A.2d 905 (1961); <em>Burke </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>147 Conn. 149, 151-52, 157 A.2d 757 (1960); <em>Wadlund </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>139 Conn. 169, 172, 176, 91 A.2d 10 (1952); <em>Jacen </em>v. <em>East Hartford, </em>133 Conn. 243, 246, 50 A.2d 61 (1946); <em>Pape </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>129 Conn. 256, 259-60, 28 A.2d 10 (1942); <em>Leitkowski </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>125 Conn. 49, 51, 3 A.2d 84 (1938); <em>Frechette </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>104 Conn. 83, 94, 132 A. 467 (1926); <em>Bartram </em>v. <em>Sharon, </em>71 Conn. 686, 43 A. 143 (1899).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The defendant first claims that the trial court erred in concluding that he did not sustain his burden of proof on the issues of his freedom from contributory negligence, the existence of the defect claimed and whether the defendant had constructive notice of the defect claimed. These three issues involved questions of fact for the trier to determine on the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>\u201cOn appeal, it is the function of this court to determine whether the decision of the trial court is clearly erroneous. See Practice Book, 1978, \u00a7 3060D. This involves a two part function: where the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision; where the factual basis of the court\u2019s decision is challenged we must determine whether the facts set out in the memorandum of decision are supported by the evidence or whether, in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the whole record, those facts are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980). \u201cWe do not examine the record to determine whether the trier of fact could have reached a conclusion other than the one reached. Rather, we focus on the conclusion of the trial court, as well as the method by which it arrived at that conclusion, to determine whether it is legally correct and factually supported.\u201d Ibid. Whether the plaintiff sustained his burden of proof on the issues of his freedom from contributory negligence, the existence of the defect claimed and constructive notice of that defect to the defendant, presented questions of fact for the trier to determine upon all the evidence. See, e.g., <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>162 Conn. 295, 306, 294 A.2d 290 (1972); <em>Cusick </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra; <em>Burke </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>supra. The credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony is for the trier. <em>Toffolon </em>v. <em>Avon, </em>173 Conn. 525, 531, 378 A.2d 580 (1977); <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>171 Conn. 23, 32, 368 A.2d 96 (1976). On the whole record, the conclusions challenged here are legally and logically correct, and the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>set out in the court\u2019s memorandum of decision find ample support in the evidence. We, therefore, cannot conclude that the court\u2019s conclusions here are clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The plaintiff next claims that the court erred in concluding that the icy condition did not constitute an intentional nuisance. He argues that the defendant \u201cintentionally\u201d created the snow and ice condition. He maintains that the defendant followed a practice of plowing only the center lane of Cottage Street, a one-way street with parking permitted on both sides, and that this practice was an intentional act. As a result of this practice, he claims that areas adjacent to the curb remained unplowed, and in those areas, \u201cice and snow accumulated from the first snowfall of the season creating . . . [the] \u2018rutty ice\u2019 condition\u201d of which he complains. The continuing inherent or natural tendency of this condition, the plaintiff contends, \u201cwas to create a danger and inflict injury upon individuals,\u201d especially himself, since he was \u201cforced by necessity to venture out upon\u201d this condition to retrieve his trash barrels. We cannot accept this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">We have recognized that a municipality may be liable for a nuisance it creates and maintains. See <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>167 Conn. 464, 470, 356 A.2d 176 (1975); <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>151 Conn. 689, 692, 202 A.2d 134 (1964); <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Bristol, </em>113 Conn. 386, 155 A. 499 (1931). The municipality is only liable in the event that, if the condition constituted a nuisance, it was created by some positive act of the municipality. <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>supra; <em>Bacon </em>v. <em>Rocky Hill, </em>126 Conn. 402, 407, 11 A.2d 399 (1940). We have already affirmed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>trial court\u2019s conclusions on the existence, as well as constructive notice, of the claimed defect which was essentially natural in origin, i.e., ice. We cannot say that the condition, i.e., the defect, which allegedly caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury was of the defendant\u2019s own making. We have had occasion to say that failure to remedy a condition not of the municipality\u2019s own making is not the equivalent of the required positive act in imposing liability in nuisance upon a municipality. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra; see <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>supra, 693. The circumstances of this case are not such as lead to a conclusion that the defect claimed was one created by some positive act of the defendant. For the reasons given, we cannot find any error on the nuisance claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s next claim is that the court erred in rendering judgment for the defendant, who presented no witnesses and introduced no evidence, although the court had denied the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of dismissal, thereby demonstrating that the plaintiff had established a prima facie case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court did not err. The denial of such a motion serves no other purpose than to establish the fact that a prima facie case has been made out. See Practice Book \u00a7 302 ;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Connecticut Co., </em>132 Conn. 400, 402, 44 A.2d 706 (1945); <em>Ace-High Dresses, Inc. </em>v. <em>J. C. Trucking Co., </em>122 Conn. 578, 579, 191 A. 536 (1937). The right of the court to grant such a motion \u201cis to be sparingly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>exercised; a plaintiff is entitled to every favorable inference that may be legitimately drawn from the evidence; and a party has the same right to submit a weak case as he has to submit a strong one; <em>Fritz </em>v. <em>Gaudet, </em>101 Conn. 52, 53, 124 A. 841 [1924]; where the granting of a nonsuit must depend in any appreciable degree upon the court\u2019s passing upon the credibility of witnesses, the nonsuit should not be granted; <em>Pentino </em>v. <em>Pappas, </em>96 Conn. 230, 232, 113 A. 451 [1921]; where a case is close, the preferable course is to deny a motion for a nonsuit; <em>Bawol </em>v. <em>Gumkowski, </em>104 Conn. 746, 133 A. 917 [1926].\u201d <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>134 Conn. 502, 505, 58 A.2d 729 (1948). The court\u2019s determination of such a motion, however, is obviously not a conclusion that the plaintiff has sustained his burden of proof on the contested issues of his complaint. Also, the defendant\u2019s failure to present any evidence to contradict the evidence offered by the plaintiff gives no support to a claim that the truth of all the essential allegations of the complaint has been proven, since the general burden of proof in civil actions is on the plaintiff. See <em>Silva </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>141 Conn. 126, 128, 104 A.2d 210 (1954). We therefore find no error as claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Finally the plaintiff contends that the court erred in denying his motion to amend the complaint by adding a third count. The allegations of the proposed amendment were identical with those of the first count except that it deleted the allegation of the plaintiff\u2019s exercise of due care. It was filed during the trial on February 14, 1980; the action had been pending since March, 1976. The plaintiff claims that the comparative negligence statute, i.e., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 52-5721i,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201celiminated [the] plaintiff\u2019s burden to plead and prove due care and freedom from contributory negligence in highway defect cases.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The trial court was correct in ruling that \u00a7 52-572h does not apply to actions for personal injuries based on General Statutes \u00a7 13a~149. It is settled law in this state that the liability of the defendant under \u00a7 13a-149 is purely for breach of a statutory duty and does not arise from negligence. See, e.g., <em>Hillier </em>v. <em>East Hartford, </em>167 Conn. 100, 104, 355 A.2d 1 (1974); <em>Burke </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>supra, 151; <em>Porpora </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>119 Conn. 476, 479, 177 A. 531 (1935); <em>Bartram </em>v. <em>Sharon, </em>supra, 692. The liability imposed under \u00a7 13a-149 was one not known to the common law. See, e.g., <em>Porpora </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra; <em>Frechette </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 87; <em>Bartram </em>v. <em>Sharon, </em>supra, 693. The language of \u00a7 52-572h is unambiguous; it provides that comparative negligence principles apply: \u201cIn causes of action <em>based on negligence </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 52-572h (a). Had the legislature intended the comparative negligence statute to apply to actions brought under \u00a7 13a-149, it could have explicitly done so by including specific language to that effect. \u201cThe intention of the legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>ture is found not in what it meant to say, but in the meaning of what it did say.\u201d <em>Colli </em>v. <em>Real Estate Commission, </em>169 Conn. 445, 452, 364 A.2d 167 (1975). See <em>Wiegand </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>170 Conn. 567, 581, 368 A.2d 103 (1976); <em>United Aircraft Corporation </em>v. <em>Fusari, </em>163 Conn. 401, 411, 311 A.2d 65 (1972). \u201cThe legislature is presumed to act with awareness of long-standing judicial construction of a statute or a statutory provision.\u201d <em>Faraday </em>v. <em>Dube, </em>175 Conn. 438, 443, 399 A.2d 1262 (1978); <em>Bahre </em>v. <em>Hogbloom, </em>162 Conn. 549, 558, 295 A.2d 547 (1972). Finally, we cannot say that the court abused its discretion in denying the proposed amendment on the ground that it was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b218-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 13a-149 provides in part: \u201cdamages for INJURIES BY MEANS OF DEFECTIVE ROADS AND BRIDGES.
