The district was to be composed of the town of Griswold excluding the borough of Jewett City which lies within the town. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 7-325<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a petition by twenty or more voters who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>did not reside within a city or borough of the town was presented to the board of selectmen. At a special town meeting called by the selectmen to act on the petition, qualified taxpayers who did not reside in the town were allowed to vote on the petition. This meeting was adjourned for eight days, until April 80,1980, when another vote was taken by paper ballot. The town moderator ruled that nonresident taxpayers would again be eligible to vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The plaintiff, a resident of the town and of the proposed district, began this action on April 24, 1980, to enjoin the defendants from conducting the April 30, 1980, vote and from proceeding any further in the matter. By agreement of the parties two issues were to be determined: (1) may a qualified taxpayer, as defined by General Statutes \u00a7 7-6,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> who is not a town resident vote at a meeting called to consider the establishment of a police tax district; and (2) may a referendum be held on the proposed establishment of a tax district pursuant to \u00a7 7-325. The trial court resolved both issues in the negative and rendered appropriate equitable relief in the plaintiff\u2019s favor. The defendants have appealed, claiming that both issues were wrongly decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">The defendants\u2019 contention that any voter as defined by \u00a7 7-6 is entitled to participate in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>\u00a7 7-325 organizational meeting fails in light of the plain legislative directive to the contrary. The procedure for organizing a police district is set forth in \u00a7 7-325. An organizational meeting must be called upon the petition of twenty or more \u201cvoters, as defined by section 7-6,\u201d of a town. The term \u201cvoters\u201d is defined in \u00a7 7-6 to include both electors and qualified taxpayers. A petitioner need not reside in nor own taxable property in the proposed district. Petitioners under \u00a7 7-325 may not, however, reside within a city or borough of the town. Participation at the organizational meeting called to act on the petition is limited by the statute to \u201cvoters residing within\u201d the area of the proposed district. The purpose of the meeting is to determine whether to create the proposed district. Once the petition is approved, the organizing voters may then proceed to name the district and to choose necessary officers to hold office until the first annual meeting of the district. On the basis of \u00a7 7-325, we conclude that only voters<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> residing within the area of the proposed district may vote at the organizational meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">To avoid this result, the defendants contend that the words \u201cresiding within such specified limits\u201d do not modify or restrict the word \u201cvoters,\u201d but rather serve only to limit participation at the organizational meeting to electors and nonresident qualified taxpayers who own property within the boundaries of the proposed district. This view is plainly unwarranted by the clear language of \u00a7 7-325.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>The defendants\u2019 second contention on appeal is that the question of whether the police tax district is to he created can he the subject of a referendum. Eelying on the definition of \u201creferendum\u201d in \u00a7 9-1 (n),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the defendants argue that the creation of a police district is \u201ca question or proposal which is submitted to a vote of the electors or voters, as the case may he, of a municipality at a meeting of such electors or voters pursuant to section 7-7.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 9-1 (n) (3). We agree with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>trial court that, because no police tax district exists until a petition is approved at the \u00a7 7-325 meeting, no municipality or other body politic exists for purposes of either \u00a7 9-1 (n) (3) or \u00a7 7-7. Section 7-325 details a cogent, comprehensive mechanism that is well tailored to meet the needs of local residents attempting to form a body politic. The interjection of referendum procedures into the formation process, as suggested by the defendants, finds no support in the statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b213-9\"> \u201c[General Statutes] See. 7-325. organization. Upon the petition of twenty or more voters, as defined by section 7-6, of any town, not residing within the territorial limits of any city or borough in sueh town, specifying the limits of a proposed district for any or all of the purposes set forth in section 7-326, and not including within such limits any part of any city or borough in such town, the selectmen of such town shall call a meeting of the voters residing within such specified limits to act upon such petition, which meeting shall be held at such place within such town and sueh hour as the selectmen designate, within thirty days after such petition has been received by sueh selectmen. Sueh meeting shall be called by posting a written notice of the same, signed by the selectmen, upon some public signpost within sueh town and also in some prominent place within sueh proposed district, at least fourteen days before the time fixed for such meeting, and by advertising such notice in two successive issues of some newspaper published or circulated in such town. Upon approval of such petition by such meeting, the voters may name the district and choose necessary officers therefor to hold office until the first annual meeting thereof; and the district shall thereupon be a body corporate and politic and have the powers, not inconsistent with the general statutes, in relation to the objects for which it was established, that are neeessary for the accomplishment of such objects, including the power to lay and collect taxes. The clerk of such district shall cause its name and a description of its territorial limits and of any additions that may be made thereto to be recorded in the land records of the town in which sueh district is located.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b214-8\">\u201c[General Statutes] See. 7-6. eligibility to vote.
