J.</author>\n<p id=\"Azf\">The complaint makes the following allegations. On November 20, 1976, the defendants A. Eli Nisenfeld and Esther Nisenfeld,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>by warranty deed conveyed certain real estate to the plaintiffs. In the deed the defendants specifically described the land as situated in the town of Monroe, state of Connecticut and they designated the land by reference to a map on record in the office of the Monroe town clerk. By executing the deed the defendants warranted that they \u201care well seized of the premises as a good indefeasible estate in fee simple: and have good right to bargain and sell the same . . . and that the same is free from all incumbrances\u201d and they bound themselves and their heirs \u201cforever, to warrant and defend the . . . granted . . . premises to . . . the . . . Grantees and to the survivor of them and to such survivor\u2019s heirs and assigns against all claims and demands whatsoever.\u201d The complaint further alleges that the defendants breached their warranties because on the date they conveyed the real estate and at all subsequent times, the town of Monroe claimed to own a part of the premises upon which it had constructed a public highway. The breach rendered the parcel nonconforming.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">The plaintiffs concede that they are suing on the deed and that the defendants executed the deed in Iowa. The defendants do not deny that they held title to the realty<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that they, \u201cin person,\u201d executed the warranty deed described in the complaint and conveyed the real property to the plaintiff. Furthermore, the defendants concede that the conveyance took place pursuant to a sale of the real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">In their action, the plaintiffs relied upon the service of process provisions of General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>\u00a7 52-59b (c).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendants were constructively served in Iowa. They moved to dismiss pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 142, claiming that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over them. The trial court rendered judgment for the defendants and ruled: (1) that the defendants had sufficient minimum contacts with Connecticut to satisfy constitutional standards; (2) that General Statutes \u00a7 52-59b (a) (1) permitted jurisdiction over a cause of action based upon a single transaction and (3) that the sale of real estate does not satisfy the \u201ctransacts any business\u201d requirement of that subsection. From that judgment the plaintiffs have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The plaintiffs allege that General Statutes \u00a7 52-59b empowers Connecticut courts to exercise personal jurisdiction over the defendants. General Statutes \u00a7 52-59b states in part: \u201c(a) As to a cause of action arising from any of the acts enumerated in this section, a court may exercise personal jurisdiction over any nonresident individual, or foreign partnership, or his or its executor or administrator, who in person or through an agent: (1) Trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>acts any business within the state ... or (4) owns, uses or possesses any real property situated within the state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The General Statutes do not define what the phrase \u201ctransacts any business\u201d means in the context of \u00a7 52-59b. We note, however, that in enacting \u00a7 52-59b, the legislature used New York Civil Practice Law \u00a7 302 (McKinney 1980-81 Sup.) as a model. <em>Gandolfo </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>31 Conn. Sup. 417, 424, 333 A.2d 65 (1975); 1 Stephenson, Conn. Civ. Proc. (2d Ed.) \u00a7 26, p. 97 n.318. We therefore find pertinent the judicial interpretation given to that New York statute. <em>Elida, Inc. </em>v. <em>Harmor Realty Corporation, </em>177 Conn. 218, 226, 413 A.2d 1226 (1979); <em>Gandolfo </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>supra. In accord with that interpretation, we construe the term \u201ctransacts any business\u201d to embrace a single purposeful business transaction. <em>George Reiner &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Schwartz, </em>41 N.Y.2d 648, 363 N.E.2d 551 (1977); <em>Hi Fashion Wigs, Inc. </em>v. <em>Peter Hammond Advertising, Inc., </em>32 N.Y.2d 583, 300 N.E.2d 421 (1973); <em>Parke-Bernet Galleries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Franklyn, </em>26 N.Y.2d 13, 16, 256 N.E.2d 506 (1970); <em>Longines-Wittnauer Watch Co. </em>v. <em>Barnes &amp; Reinecke, Inc., </em>15 N.Y.2d 443, 456, 209 N.E.2d 68, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Estwing Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Singer, </em>382 U.S. 905, 86 S. Ct. 241, 15 L. Ed. 2d 158 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">The term \u201ctransacts any business\u201d extends beyond the typical commercial enterprise to include the execution of a warranty deed pursuant to a single sale of real property. See <em>Tebedo </em>v. <em>Nye, </em>45 Misc. 2d 222, 256 N.Y.S.2d 235 (1965) (breach of contract to sell). See also <em>United States Steel Corporation </em>v. <em>Multistate Tax Commission, </em>367 F. Sup. 107 (S.D.N.Y. 1973) (tax audit by the multistate tax commission); <em>Harry Winston, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wald</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number><em>fogel, </em>292 F. Sup. 473, 481-82 (S.D.N.Y. 1968) (negotiating the retail purchase of a ring); <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Haberkorn, </em>30 App. Div. 2d 530, 291 N.Y.S.2d 119 (1968) (receiving medical treatment), appeal dismissed, 24 N.Y.2d 993, 250 N.E.2d 230 (no final judgment), appeal dismissed, 25 N.Y.2d 917, 252 N.E.2d 282 (1969) (improper form); <em>Kochenthal </em>v. <em>Kochenthal, </em>28 App. Div. 2d 117, 119, 282 N.Y.S.2d 36 (1967) (execution of a separation agreement); Weinstein, Korn &amp; Miller, N.Y. Civ. Prac. 302.08. The execution of a warranty deed pursuant to a sale of real property is a legal act of a most serious nature. It uses terms and procedures commonly associated with business and involves a financial transaction. The execution of such a deed clearly falls within the appropriately broad meaning of the term \u201cbusiness\u201d in General Statutes \u00a7 52-59b. <em>Kochenthal </em>v. <em>Kochenthal, </em>supra, 119-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The defendants\u2019 execution of the warranty deed in Iowa does not negate the transaction\u2019s connections with Connecticut. <em>Longines-Wittnauer Watch Co. </em>v. <em>Barnes &amp; Reinecke, Inc., </em>supra. The defendants\u2019 purposeful Connecticut related activity suffices to locate this transaction of theirs within this state despite the absence of allegations that the sale or closing occurred here; or that they or anyone acting for them solicited the plaintiffs\u2019 purchase or entered this state to deal with the plaintiffs. The deed described the land as located here and designated it by reference to records maintained here. By owning land in Connecticut the defendants invoked the benefits and protection of Connecticut\u2019s laws of real property, including as an incident of ownership the right to sell the property. If the defendants breached their warranties, the breach occurred because of acts committed here. The war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>ranties in the deed clearly anticipate litigation in Connecticut, which is the only forum that can determine title to Connecticut land. <em>Durfee </em>v. <em>Duke, </em>375 U.S. 106, 115, 84 S. Ct. 242, 11 L. Ed. 2d 186 (1963); <em>Farmers\u2019 Loan &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Postal Telegraph Co., </em>55 Conn. 334, 335, 11 A. 184 (1887); <em>In re Goar\u2019s Estate, </em>252 Iowa 108, 110, 106 N.W.2d 93 (1960). Thus, the fundamental incidents of this warranty deed render the defendants\u2019 purposeful execution of it a \u201ctransaction of any business within this state.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Hi Fashion Wigs, Inc. </em>v. <em>Peter Hammond, Advertising, Inc., </em>supra, 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>In determining whether the plaintiffs\u2019 canse of action arose from the defendants\u2019 transaction of business within this state we do not resort to a rigid formula. Eather, we balance considerations of public policy, common sense, and the chronology and geography of the relevant factors. N.Y. Civ. Prae. Law \u00a7 302; McLaughlin, Practice Commentaries (McKinney 1972) C302:2, p. 64. In this case each of those considerations leads us to conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action against the defendants arose from the defendants\u2019 transaction of business, in person, within the state.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>Because the defendants executed the warranty deed as an integral part of a Connecticut real estate transaction, the ties among the parties, this state, and the litigation allow Connecticut courts to exercise personal jurisdiction over the defendants without offending traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. <em>International Shoe Co. </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>326 U.S. 310, 316, 66 S. Ct. 154, 90 L. Ed. 95 (1945). See <em>Rush </em>v. <em>Savchuk, </em>444 U.S. 320, 327, 100 S. Ct. 571, 62 L. Ed. 2d 516 (1980); <em>Shaffer </em>v. <em>Heitner, </em>433 U.S. 186, 207-208, 97 S. Ct. 2569, 53 L. Ed. 2d 683 (1977). The defendants purposefully availed themselves of the privileges of owning and selling Connecticut land. Thus, this state may require them to defend a Connecticut suit alleging breach of the deed\u2019s warranties. <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Denckla, </em>357 U.S. 235, 254, 78 S. Ct. 1228,2 L. Ed. 2d 1283 (1958). See <em>Rush </em>v. <em>Savchuk, </em>supra, 329; <em>World-Wide Volkswagen Corporation </em>v. <em>Woodson, </em>444 U.S. 286, 295-98, 100 S. Ct. 559, 62 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b483-13\"> We shall use the term \u201cdefendants\u201d to refer only to the Nisenfelds although the complaint also named the town of Monroe as a defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b484-9\"> The defendants\u2019 brief correctly points out that the plaintiffs have not alleged in what capacity the defendants held title to the real property or sold it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b485-7\">General Statutes \u00a7 52-59b provides in part: . . . \u201c(e) Any nonresident individual, or foreign partnership, or Ms or its executor or administrator, over whom a court may exercise personal jurisdiction, as provided in subsection (a), shall be deemed to have appointed the secretary of the state as its attorney and to have agreed that any process in any civil action brought against such nonresident individual or foreign partnership, or his or its executor or administrator, may be served upon said secretary and shall have the same validity as if served upon such nonresident individual or foreign partnership personally. Such process shall be served by the officer to whom the same is directed upon said secretary by leaving with or at the office of said secretary, at least twelve days before the return day of such process, a true and attested copy thereof, and by sending to the defendant, by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, a like true and attested copy with an endorsement thereon of the service upon said secretary addressed to such defendant at Ms last-known address. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b488-6\"> The trial court and the defendants view our decision in <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Hopfeld, </em>160 Conn. 53, 273 A.2d 721 (1970), as having approved the use of General Statutes \u00a7 33-397 as a guide to interpreting the words \u201ctransacts business,\u201d in \u00a7 52-59a, a predecessor of \u00a7 52-59b. That view misconstrues <em>Lane. </em>In <em>Lane </em>we reported that the trial court had concluded that the words \u201ctransacts business\u201d had essentially the same meaning in \u00a7 52-59a as in \u00a7\u00a7 33-396 and 33-397 but we did not express any approval of that conclusion. Instead, we upheld the judgment for the defendant because, regardless of whether the defendant\u2019s activity amounted to the transaction of business in this state, any action of his in this state was not done \u201cpersonally or by an agent, salesman, employee, officer or another\u201d as specified in \u00a7 52-59a. <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Hopfeld, </em>supra, 58-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Under \u00a7 33-397 (a) certain enumerated activities, such as selling real estate, do not constitute \u201ctransacting business in this state for the purposes of . . . chapter [599].\u201d Chapter 599 regulates stock corporations. Clearly, the legislature intended \u00a7 33-397 to apply only to corporations and even then only for the purposes of chapter 599. The statute in question here, \u00a7 52-59b, appears in a different chapter. Furthermore, the phrase \u201ctransacts any business\u201d in \u00a7 52-59b has a broader meaning than the phrases \u201ctransact business\u201d in \u00a7 33-396; \u201ctransacting business\u201d in \u00a7 33-397; and \u201ctransacts business\u201d in the repealed \u00a7 52-59a, which was in issue in <em>Lane. </em>Therefore \u00a7\u00a7 33-396 and 33-397 provide no guidance for interpreting \u00a7 52-59b.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">If the defendants in the present cause of action were a corporation, \u00a7 33-111 (d) would subject it to suit in this state, because this action involves \u201creal property located in the state in which a foreign corporation . . . owns or claims to own an interest.\u201d See footnote 5, infra.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">Because both our corporate and individual long arm statutes reach the present action, we need not address the equal protection claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>which might arise should \u00a7 52-59b, as predieted in <em>Bross Utilities Service Corporation </em>v. <em>Aboubshait, </em>489 F. Sup. 1366, 1373 n.35 (D. Conn. 1980), reach beyond our corporate long arm statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b489-7\"> Although the plaintiffs have ignored \u00a7 52-59b (a) (4), we note that under the New York long arm statute, N.Y. Civ. Prac. Law \u00a7 302 (a) (McKinney 1980-81 Sup.), courts have based jurisdiction upon a nonresident defendant\u2019s ownership, use, or possession of real property situated within the state, although at the time of suit the defendant\u2019s ownership, use or possession had ceased. <em>Genesee Scrap &amp; Tin Baling Corporation </em>v. <em>Lake Erie Bumper Plating Corporation, </em>57 App. Div. 2d 1068, 395 N.Y.S.2d 826 (1977) (lease assigned); <em>Karrat </em>v. <em>Merhib, </em>62 Misc. 2d 72, 307 N.Y.S.2d 915 (1970) (action to recover commission under a brokerage contract for sale of realty; also jurisdiction under \u201ctransacts any business\u201d provision); <em>Tebedo </em>v. <em>Nye, </em>45 Misc. 2d 222, 256 N.Y.S.2d 235 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">Other jurisdictions have based jurisdiction on former interests in realty under similar long arm statutes. <em>Van Naarden </em>v. <em>Grassi, </em>488 F. Sup. 720 (E.D. Pa. 1980) (fraud and misrepresentation) ; <em>Hart </em>v. <em>DeLowe Partners, Ltd., </em>147 Ga.
