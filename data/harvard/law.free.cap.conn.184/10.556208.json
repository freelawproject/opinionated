The plaintiff seller, Superior Wire and Paper Products, sued the defendant buyer, Taleott Tool and Machine, Inc., and the defendant guarantors, George Roy, Alan Roy and Roy Machinery &amp; Sales, Inc., to recover the unpaid purchase price of shipments of steel. The defendants, by their answer and counterclaim, put into issue the conformity of the goods tendered, and sought damages for breach of warranty. The defendant guarantors also challenged the enforceability of their guaranty. The trial court found all of the issues for the plaintiff, and accordingly rendered a judgment for $110,994.04 in its favor. All the defendants have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-9\">The underlying facts found by the court and set forth in the memorandum of decision and the record are as follows. The plaintiff, Superior Wire and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>Paper Products (hereinafter Superior) is a Canadian corporation that sells steel rod and wire. The defendant, Taleott Tool and Machine, Inc. (hereinafter Taleott), is a middleman that purchases steel for resale to its customers. Between March, 1974, and December, 1974, Superior sold Taleott more than $1,000,000 worth of steel rod and wire. These goods were sold on invoices requiring payment in thirty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">At the end of June, 1974, Taleott owed $137,454.17. Concerned about the size of this debt, Superior\u2019s president went to Talcott\u2019s place of business to have a conversation with the defendant George Roy, an officer of Taleott. Several days later, on July 3, 1974, the defendants George Roy, Alan Roy and Roy Machinery &amp; Sales, Inc., wrote Superior guaranteeing payment for goods ordered by Taleott from Superior. Some time subsequent to the guaranty, Taleott furnished Superior further security in the form of a letter of credit for $200,000 which expired at the end of September. At the time of the letter of credit, Talcott\u2019s billings from Superior were $325,000. There were further shipments by Superior after expiration of the letter of credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">In the fall of 1974, steel prices fell precipitously. By November, Superior had stopped receiving payments from Taleott. In December, Taleott notified Superior that discontent with the quality of Superior\u2019s shipments was leading to rejections of Superior\u2019s steel by Talcott\u2019s customers. Taleott made no further payments to Superior thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">The trial court concluded that the plaintiff had established its claim to the unpaid purchase price, that the defendants had not sustained their burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>of proof on their counterclaim and that the defendant guarantors were liable on their guaranty. Each of these conclusions is challenged on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\">Before we consider the merits of these claims of error, it is well to place the parties\u2019 claims into context. As contracts for the sale of goods, these transactions are governed by the provisions of article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code. General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-102. \u201cUnder article 2, the rights and liabilities of the parties are determined, at least in part, by the extent to which the contract has been executed. The buyer\u2019s acceptance of goods, despite their alleged nonconformity, is a watershed. After acceptance, the buyer must pay for the goods at the contract rate; General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-607 (1); and bears the burden of establishing their nonconformity. General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-607 (4).\u201d <em>Stelco Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>182 Conn. 561, 563-64, 438 A.2d 959 (1980). Acceptance does not, however, constitute a definitive election to waive all claims and defenses with respect to the accepted goods. If the buyer can demonstrate that he has been damaged by the nonconformity of the goods that he has accepted, he is entitled to recover such damages as he can prove. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 42a-2-607 (3),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 42a-2-714.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Alternatively, if the buyer can demonstrate that the goods are substantially nonconforming, he is entitled, with some qualifications, to revoke his acceptance and recover the purchase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>price. General Statutes \u00a742a-2-608.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Whichever route the buyer elects, he is required to give timely notice to the seller within a reasonable time after he discovers or should have discovered the seller\u2019s breach. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a742a-2-607 (3) (a), 42a-2-608 (2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">In the present case, the defendants contest neither the sale and delivery of goods pursuant to contracts of sale, nor the fact of the acceptance of the goods by the corporate defendant. The plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>tiff\u2019s prima facie entitlement to recovery of the purchase price has therefore been established. The defendants can defeat this entitlement only by proving the nonconformity of the accepted goods. General Statutes \u00a742a-2-607 (4).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">With respect to the defendants\u2019 counterclaim, the defendants bear an even greater evidentiary burden. If they want to rely on the right conferred by \u00a7 42a-2-607 to sue for damages flowing from the acceptance of nonconforming goods, they must show not only that the goods were nonconforming, but that their nonconformity has resulted in measurable damages. Such damages include losses \u201cresulting in the ordinary course of events from the seller\u2019s breach\u201d; General Statutes \u00a742a-2-714 (1); or, more typically, damages measured by \u201cthe difference . . . between the value of the goods accepted and the value they would have had if they had been as warranted\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 42a-3-714 (2); augmented, in a proper case, by incidental or consequential damages. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a742a-2-714 (3), 42a-2-715. Unless the goods delivered were totally worthless, these sections do not authorize recovery by the buyer as damages of the purchase price previously paid to the seller. Compare General Statutes \u00a742a-2-711 (1). Rather, they contemplate that the buyer will prove an offset to the purchase price; see General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-717; although the offset may, because of consequential losses, if proven, exceed the purchase price in amount. The record appears to indicate no financial claim by the defendants other than one for reimbursement of invoices previously paid, and storage and transportation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>costs incidental thereto. The defendants\u2019 counterclaim therefore does not state a cognizable claim for damages under the provisions of article 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">Absent a claim for damages, the defendants\u2019 counterclaim must rest on whatever right they have to revoke acceptance, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-608. A buyer who justifiably revokes acceptance may recover \u201cso much of the price as has been paid.\u201d General Statutes \u00a742a-2-711 (1). In order to revoke acceptance, however, the buyer must prove more than that the goods were nonconforming. He must show that their \u201cnonconformity <em>substantially </em>impairs [their] value to him\u201d (emphasis added) and that they were initially accepted because the buyer reasonably expected the seller to cure any defects or because the buyer could not immediately discover such defects. General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-608 (1). These are the substantive standards against which the defendants\u2019 counterclaim must be measured and they highlight the burden<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that the defendants had in the trial court and have on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>Applying these standards, we must determine whether the trial court erred in its conclusions holding the defendants liable to pay the unpaid purchase price and disallowing their counterclaim to recover payments previously made. We note, first, that under each claim the trial court assigned to the defendants a lesser burden of proof than the statutes required. The court required the plaintiff, in its action to recover the purchase price, to bear the burden of showing the conformity of the accepted deliveries, contrary to General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-607 (4), which assigns to the defendants the burden of proving nonconformity. Furthermore, the court failed to recognize the defendants\u2019 burden to demonstrate substantial nonconformity on their counterclaim. General Statutes \u00a742a-2-608 (1). Obviously, the defendants cannot have been prejudiced by losing their case on standards more lenient than those to which they were entitled. We observe, further, that the defendants\u2019 challenges to the conclusions of the trial court are of such a nature that our review is severely limited. The defendants do not claim that they were deprived of a full and fair hearing; they raise no evidentiary claims of error. They ask instead that we overturn the factual findings of the trial court with respect to the conformity of the goods, the timeliness of notice of defects, and the existence of express and implied warranties. We are warranted in overturning the factual findings of the trial court only when such findings are clearly erroneous in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the record as a whole. Practice Book \u00a7 3060D; <em>Stelco Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>182 Conn. 561, 564, 438 A.2d 759 (1980); <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>The crucial finding of the trial court was its determination that the defendants had failed to establish that the goods were in fact defective or nonconforming. The court noted that the original specifications for the goods had been modified, by the consent of the parties, in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 42a-2-206 and 42a-2-207. That conclusion is not contested on this appeal. With respect to other claims of nonconformity, including the claims that the wire was rusty, out of round, and of improper chemical composition and/or hardness, reported by the ultimate users of the steel, the court found the evidence to be conflicting and unpersuasive. It is axiomatic that the trier of facts is the judge of the credibility of the witnesses who testify before her. <em>Swenson </em>v. <em>Dittner, </em>183 Conn. 289, 293, 439 A.2d 334 (1981); <em>Steinman </em>v. <em>Maier, </em>179 Conn. 574, 576, 427 A.2d 828 (1980); <em>Toffolon </em>v. <em>Avon, </em>173 Conn. 525, 530, 378 A.2d 580 (1977). It is noteworthy that the evidence of customer complaints was limited to only a part of the unpaid invoices involving only a part of the shipments involved in the claim and the counterclaim. On the issue of conformity, we find the record to support the findings made. See <em>Oilman </em>v. <em>Pedersen, </em>182 Conn. 582, 585, 438 A.2d 780 (1981); <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>The Contemporary Mission, Inc., </em>180 Conn. 150, 152, 429 A.2d 827 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">The defendants argue that the terms of the contracts of sale were modified to incorporate certain express and implied warranties. There is no doubt that descriptions on invoices ordinarily constitute express warranties that the goods shipped will conform to the description; see General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-313; but in the present case the invoices themselves contained arguably conflicting descrip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>tions, among which, a choice had to be made. Under such circumstances, interpretation of what the parties intended is again a question for the trier of facts. <em>Monroe Ready Mix Concrete, Inc. </em>v. <em>Westcor Development Corporation, </em>183 Conn. 348, 351, 439 A.2d 362 (1981); <em>Otto Contracting Co. </em>v. <em>S. Schinella &amp; Son, Inc., </em>179 Conn. 704, 709, 427 A.2d 856 (1980); see also General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-317. The trial court was acting within its province in finding an invoice\u2019s statement of detailed chemical analyses more persuasive than its general identification of the steel by a number representing its chemical composition. The defendants similarly failed to establish the existence of implied warranties. They have pointed to no evidence that the steel shipped was not of fair average marketable quality, the standard established for an implied warranty of merchantability by General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-314. They failed to persuade the trial court that the plaintiff knew or had reason to know of the special uses to which the defendants\u2019 customers intended to put the steel, and thus have not proven an implied warranty of fitness pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-315. On warranty, as on conformity in general, the factual conclusions of the trial court were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">Since we find no error in the trial court\u2019s determination that the plaintiff seller had fully complied with its contractual obligations, we need not review the trial court\u2019s findings that the defendants\u2019 notice of alleged defects was not timely. We turn instead to the defendants\u2019 final issue on this appeal, the defendants\u2019 argument that the trial court was in error in finding enforceable the guaranty of the defendants George Roy, Alan Roy and Roy Machinery &amp; Sales, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>The defendants do not contest their execution of the guaranty.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> They do not deny that their letter constituted an unconditional continuing guaranty. Cf. <em>Monroe Ready Mix Concrete, Inc. </em>v. <em>Westcor Development Corporation, </em>supra, 350. They argue, rather, that the guaranty was unenforceable, as a \u25a0matter of law, for lack of consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">The defendants\u2019 position is based upon two propositions which although factually accurate are legally insufficient. The plaintiff\u2019s president testified that the plaintiff, at the time that it asked for a guaranty, was not threatening to take legal action on the bills that were then outstanding since Talcott was not then in default. The plaintiff\u2019s president also testified that the plaintiff did not rely on the guaranty until after the expiration of letters of credit obtained subsequent to the execution of the guaranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Even if we were to overlook the modern law of contracts, which makes guaranties enforceable on the basis of reliance; see Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7 89C (Tent. Ed. 1973) ;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we would have no difficulty in finding consideration to have been bargained for and given in this case. Purchases were made by Talcott after expiration of the letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>of credit, at a time when action pursuant to the guaranty, which was continuing and unrevoked, was entirely appropriate. It is clear that the defendants contemplated that their letter of guaranty would induce further shipments by the plaintiff to Talcott. Whether these shipments were made contemporaneously with the execution of the letter of guaranty or at some time thereafter is legally irrelevant to the issue of inducement. The cases relied upon by the defendants, <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>142 Conn. 734, 118 A.2d 316 (1955), and <em>Savings Bank of Rockville </em>v. <em>Cohn, </em>116 Conn. 480, 165 A. 607 (1933), are therefore distinguishable. See <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Almy, </em>32 Conn. 297, 303-305 (1864); see generally 1 Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 76 (1963); 1A Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 206 (1963); 10 Williston, Contracts \u00a71253 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b25-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-607 (3) provides, in relevant part: \u201cWhere a tender has been accepted (a) the buyer must within a reasonable time after he discovers or should have discovered any breach notify the seller of breach or be barred from any remedy</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b25-6\"> \u201c[General Statutes] See. 42a-2-714. buyer\u2019s damages eor breach in regard to accepted goods.

It is generally assumed that the right to revoke must ordinarily be exercised more expeditiously than the right to recover damages. See White &amp; Summers, Uniform Commercial Code (2d Ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 8-3, 11-10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b27-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-607 (4) provides: \u201cThe burden is on the buyer to establish any breach with respect to the goods accepted.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b28-6\"> The defendants\u2019 burden in the particular circumstances of this case is exacerbated by Talcott\u2019s position as middleman between the seller and its own customers. In a sinking market, customers who act with dispatch have the opportunity to reject goods effectively, whether or not the goods are, in whole or in part, conforming. General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-602. Whether such a rejection is wrongful depends upon whether the goods tendered \u201cfail in any respect\u201d to conform to the terms of the contract of sale. General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-601. Inevitable delay in the return of goods up the line makes it likely that the middleman will encounter greater difficulties in attempting a timely rejection and will instead have to rely on his limited right to revoke acceptance, conditioned on his ability to prove a nonconformity that \u201csubstantially impairs [the] value [of the goods] to him.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-608. A middleman like the present corporate defendant may therefore find itself, under the provisions of article 2, accountable to its seller and to its customers in accordance with ineongruent standards.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b32-6\"> In a letter which became plaintiff\u2019s exhibit W in the trial court, addressed to the plaintiff\u2019s president, T.
