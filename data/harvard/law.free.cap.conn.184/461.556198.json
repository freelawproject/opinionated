On September 25,1979, as a result of a pretrial conference and discussion, in which <em>Zarrilli, J. </em>participated, the case was settled. On the same day, a stipulated judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff against all the defendants in the amount of $75,000, without interest and costs, provided that the judgment was paid to the plaintiff no later than March 25,1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">At the time of the rendering of this judgment in favor of the plaintiff, the court, <em>Zarrilli, J., </em>inquired of each of the individual defendants, who were present in court, whether they understood the judgment and whether the judgment was agreeable to them and to the corporate defendant. In response to the court\u2019s examination, the individual defendants responded that they did understand the meaning of the judgment and that it was acceptable to them and to the corporate defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>On or about March 25, 1980, when the sum due on the judgment became due, St. John contacted the Norwalk bank with which he did business and directed that bank to wire $75,000 in Canadian currency to the account of the plaintiff in Canada. When the plaintiff became aware of the deposit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>those funds in its bank account, the plaintiff refused this tender of performance and demanded that the judgment be paid in United States currency.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">On August 8,1980, St. John filed a motion to open judgment, alleging that, in consenting to the stipulation for judgment, he was of the opinion that he was stipulating to the payment of $75,000 in Cana<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>dian currency, and not in United States currency, in accordance with, the previous business practice between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">The motion was heard at the short calendar before Judge Zarrilli. St. John offered no witnesses or other supporting evidence in support of his argument. Judge Zarrilli, who remembered the case, the stipulation in open eourt, his inquiry of the defendants, and the understanding and assent of the parties to the judgment, denied the motion. From this denial, St. John has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 52-212a<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Practice Book \u00a7 326,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> each identically worded, state that unless otherwise provided by law, a motion to open judgment must be filed \u201cwithin four months succeeding the date on which it was rendered.\u201d In this case the court rendered judgment on September 25, 1979, and St. John filed his motion to open judgment on August 8, 1980. Since the motion was filed more than \u201cfour months succeeding the date on which [the judgment] was rendered,\u201d the trial court lacked jurisdiction to open the judgment unless the \u201cotherwise provided by law\u201d exception applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>\u201cIt is a well-established general rule that even a judgment rendered by the court upon the consent of the parties, which is in the nature of a contract to which the court has given its approval, can subsequently be opened [after the four month limitation] ... if it is shown that the stipulation, and hence the judgment, was obtained by fraud, in the actual absence of consent, or because of mutual mistake. See <em>Sparaco </em>v. <em>Tenney, </em>175 Conn. 436, 437-38, 399 A.2d 1261 [1978]; <em>Bryan </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>143 Conn. 456, 460-61, 123 A.2d 192 [1956]....\" <em>Kenworthy </em>v. <em>Kenworthy, </em>180 Conn. 129, 131, 429 A.2d 837 (1980). There is no claim by St. John that the stipulation for the judgment was obtained by fraud, duress or mutual mistake. In light of the defendant\u2019s responses to the court\u2019s inquiries on the day the judgment was rendered, we conclude that there was no actual absence of consent to the making of the stipulation or to the rendering of the judgment. See footnote 1, supra. The trial court could not hear the defendant\u2019s motion to open.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">During the preliminary negotiations for a stiputated judgment, there never was any mention, by the parties or the court, as to the kind of currency to be used in the payment of the judgment. In the absence of such discussion, it is logical to assume that payment would be made in United States currency, the currency at the place where the judgment was rendered. If it were otherwise, St. John should have inquired about it and insisted upon payment in Canadian currency before he consented and agreed to the rendering of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">If we assume arguendo that St. John filed his motion to open judgment within the four month period of limitation, he still would not succeed on appeal. A motion to open and vacate a judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>filed during the four months after which judgment was rendered is addressed to the court\u2019s discretion, and the action of the trial court will not be disturbed on appeal unless it acted unreasonably and in clear abuse of its discretion. See <em>Manchester State Bank </em>v. <em>Reale, </em>172 Conn. 520, 523-24, 375 A.2d 1009 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Fahey, </em>147 Conn. 13, 15, 156 A.2d 463 (1959). In determining whether the trial court abused its discretion, this court must make every reasonable presumption in favor of its action. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bitting, </em>162 Conn. 1, 11, 291 A.2d 240 (1971); <em>E. M. Loew\u2019s Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Surabian, </em>146 Conn. 608, 612, 153 A.2d 463 (1959). Considering the circumstances surrounding the rendering of the stipulated judgment and the active role played by the court, we are of the opinion that it did not abuse its discretion in denying St. John\u2019s motion to open judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b474-8\"><em> </em>The following dialogue took place:</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">\u201cThe Court: This is Docket Number 151974, Celanese Fibers Division vs. Pie Tarns, Incorporated, Et als.
