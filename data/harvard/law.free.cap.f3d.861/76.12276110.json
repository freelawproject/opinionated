Although the Supreme Court recently addressed this question in <em>Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 136 S.Ct. 1540, 194 L.Ed.2d 635 (2016), <em>as revised </em>(May 24, 2016), the inquiry is necessarily context-specific to the statutory right in question and the particular risk of harm Congress sought to prevent. Here, we address this issue as it relates to the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (\u201cFACTA\u201d), Pub. L. No. 108-159, 117 Stat. 1952 (codified as amended at 15 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c(g)), an issue of first impression in this Circuit. Guided by unambiguous statutory language that a receipt with a credit card expiration date does not raise a material risk of identity theft, and finding that the bare procedural violation alleged by the plaintiff does not present a material risk of harm, we conclude that allegations in her amended complaint do not satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement necessary to establish Article III standing to bring suit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court dismissing her amended complaint for lack of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"ae-dedup-0\">I. Factual History</p>\n<p id=\"AHs\">The brief factual history of this case is drawn from plaintiffs amended complaint filed after we remanded the case to the district court. FACTA seeks to prevent identity theft by, among other things, requiring that venders who accept credit and debit cards not print \u201cmore than the last 5 digits of the card number or the expiration date upon any receipt provided to the cardholder at the point of the sale or transaction.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c(g)(1). When plaintiff Devorah Crupar-Weinmann purchased food at Paris Baguette\u2019s midtown Manhattan restaurant on September 19, 2013, she paid for it with a credit card and received a printed receipt displaying her card\u2019s expiration date. She alleges that during this time period, \u201cParis Baguette routinely gave receipts to its customers at the point of sale at its various retail stores which displayed the expiration dates of the customers\u2019 credit and/or debit cards, in violation of the requirements of FACTA.\u201d Am. Compl. \u00b6 17. The plaintiffs amended complaint is otherwise devoid of specific factual allegations concerning her interaction with the restaurant or any consequences that stemmed from the display of her credit card\u2019s expiration date on the printed receipt. Instead, her complaint emphasizes that Congress\u2019s goal in passing FACTA was to reduce the risk of consumer identity theft by \u201cmak[ing] it more difficult for identity thieves to obtain consumers\u2019 [c]ard information by reducing the amount of information identity thieves could retrieve from found or stolen [c]ard receipts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 26. She further alleges that by \u201cknowingly and recklessly printing] ... [c]ard expiration dates on the [c]ard receipts,\u201d Paris Baguette violated FACTA, <em>id. </em>\u00b6 92, and that doing so \u201ccreated a real, non-speculative harm in the form of increased risk of identity theft,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">II. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">In 2013, Crupar-Weinmann filed her initial complaint, which the defendant moved to dismiss, primarily on the basis that she failed to plead facts sufficient to allege plausibly that Paris Baguette <em>willfully </em>violated FACTA. Following full briefing and oral argument, the district court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. <em>See Crupar-Weinmann v. Paris Baguette Am., Inc., </em>No. 13 CIV. 7013 JSR, 2014 WL 2990110, at *1, *5 (S.D.N.Y. June 30, 2014). The district court dismissed the plaintiffs claims with prejudice, \u201cconvinced that plaintiff would not be able to plausibly plead a claim for willful violation of FAC-TA, even if she were given the opportunity to replead.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *5. Crupar-Weinmann then moved for reconsideration, asserting both that the district court misconstrued the pleading standard for a willful violation of FACTA and that it erred in dismissing her complaint with prejudice and without leave to amend; the' court denied this motion on both grounds. <em>See Crupar-Weinmann v. Paris Baguette Am., Inc., </em>41 F.Supp.3d 411, 413-14. (S.D.N.Y. 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">Crupar-Weinmann then appealed, and bn October 28, 2015, we heard argument in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>both her case and a related case involving a similar legal question, <em>Katz v. The Donna Karan Company, LLC, et al., </em>No. 15-464. Shortly thereafter, the Supreme Court heard oral argument in <em>Spokeo, </em>which raised questions concerning whether a plaintiff who \u201callege[s] a bare procedural violation, divorced from any concrete harm, [can] satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement of Article III.\u201d 136 S.Ct. at 1549. We held both this case and <em>Katz </em>until the Court rendered its decision in <em>Spokeo, </em>which clarified standing doctrine in ways that we explain in more detail below. Given Spokeo\u2019s elucidation, we subsequently vacated and remanded both cases \u201cto allow plaintiffs an opportunity to replead their claims to comport with the pleading standards set forth in <em>Spokeo, </em>and to allow the district courts to address any standing questions in the first instance,\u201d and we retained appellate jurisdiction over the outcomes. <em>Cruper-Weinmann v. Paris Baguette Am., Inc., </em>653 Fed.Appx. 81, 82 (2d Cir. 2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">On remand, Crupar-Weinmann amended her complaint, Paris Baguette again moved to dismiss, and the district court again dismissed the plaintiffs complaint with prejudice, this time concluding that she lacked standing to bring claims for violations of FACTA\u2019s requirements. <em>Cruper-Weinmann v. Paris Baguette Am., Inc., </em>235 F.Supp.3d 570, 2017 WL 398657 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 30, 2017). Crupar-Wein-mann then moved to renew her appeal; we granted that motion, and the parties submitted letter briefing addressing the propriety of the district court\u2019s dismissal in light of <em>Spokeo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss the complaint for lack of standing pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), \u201cconstruing the complaint in plaintiffs favor and accepting as true all material factual allegations contained therein.\u201d <em>Donoghue v. Bulldog Inv\u2019rs Gen. P\u2019ship, </em>696 F.3d 170, 173 (2d Cir. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">II. Standing to Allege A Bare Procedural Violation of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">On appeal, the plaintiff challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of her amended complaint on the basis that she did not plead a concrete injury in fact sufficient to establish Article III standing to bring suit against Paris Baguette.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">A. Standing Doctrine After <em>Spokeo</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-12\">In <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>the Supreme Court explained that the \u201cirreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements\u201d: (1) \u201can injury in fact\u201d to \u201ca legally protected interest\u201d that is both \u201c(a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical,\u201d (2) \u201ca causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of,\u201d and (3) that it is \u201clikely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\u201d 504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). As here, the controversy in <em>Spokeo </em>implicated the \u201cconcrete and particularized\u201d element of injury-in-fact standing analysis. <em>See Spokeo, </em>136 S.Ct. at 1545, 1548. There, the Court considered a claim against Spokeo, a \u201cpeople search engine,\u201d alleging that when Spokeo trawled online sources to generate a profile of the plaintiff, it collected and reported inaccurate information about him, including his age, education, and marriage and family status, as well as job and socioeconomic position. <em>Id. </em>at 1544, 1546. The plaintiff asserted that Spokeo quali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>fied as a \u201cconsumer reporting agency\u201d under the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970 (\u201cFCRA\u201d), 84 Stat. 1127 (codified as amended at 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1681 <em>et seq.), </em>and that, as a result, Spokeo was required \u201cto \u2018follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy\u2019 of consumer reports, ... to limit the circumstances in which such agencies provide consumer reports \u2018for employment purposes,\u2019 ... and to post toll-free numbers for consumers to request reports,\u201d among other protections. <em>Spokeo, </em>136 S.Ct. at 1545 (quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1681e(b), 1681b(b)(1), 1681j(a)). Importantly, as with FACTA, violators of the FCRA can be liable for both actual and statutory damages. <em>Id. </em>The <em>Spokeo </em>plaintiffs putative class action lawsuit alleged that in publishing incorrect information about the plaintiff and similarly situated individuals, Spokeo willfully failed to comply with the FCRA\u2019s requirements, <em>id. </em>at 1546, and the case turned on whether harms stemming from bare procedural violations of the FCRA could satisfy the concreteness element of injury-in-fact standing analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">The Supreme Court concluded that while the <em>Spokeo </em>plaintiff could not \u201callege a bare procedural violation, divorced from any concrete harm, and satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement of Article III,\u201d that did \u201cnot mean ... that the <em>risk </em>of real harm cannot satisfy the requirement of concreteness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1549 (emphasis added). After all, as \u201cCongress is well positioned to identify intangible harms that meet minimum Article III requirements, [and] its judgment is also instructive and important,\u201d Congress \u201cmay \u2018elevat[e] to the status of legally cognizable injuries concrete, <em>de fac-to </em>injuries that were previously inadequate in law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 578, 112 S.Ct. 2130). Given the variety of ways a consumer reporting agency could run afoul of the FCRA, the Court recognized that while any given \u201cviolation of one of the FCRA\u2019s procedural requirements may result in no harm,\u201d \u201cCongress plainly sought to curb the dissemination of false information by adopting procedures designed to decrease that risk.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1550. Thus, the critical question for standing purposes is \u201cwhether the particular procedural violations alleged in this case entail <em>a degree of risk </em>sufficient to meet the concreteness requirement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The Court remanded the case for the lower court to engage in this inquiry in the first instance. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">B. <em>Post-Spokeo </em>Second Circuit Standing Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">We recently had the opportunity to apply <em>Spokeo </em>to another consumer class action lawsuit concerning a statute with a wide-ranging set of procedural rights and requirements, the Truth in Lending Act (\u201cTILA\u201d), Pub. L. No. 90-321, 82 Stat. 146 (1968) (codified as amended at 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1601 <em>et seq.), </em>in <em>Strubel v. Comenity Bank, </em>842 F.3d 181 (2d Cir. 2016). Unlike the single violation alleged here, <em>Strubel </em>involved a variety of alleged violations of the TILA, all related to required disclosures concerning the plaintiffs rights and responsibilities as a credit card holder and borrower of the bank. <em>Id. </em>at 185-86. Applying <em>Spokeo, </em>we recognized that \u201can alleged procedural violation can by itself manifest concrete injury where Congress conferred the procedural right to protect a plaintiffs concrete interests and where the procedural violation presents a \u2018risk of real harm\u2019 to that concrete interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 190. We noted, however, an important limitation: \u201c[E]ven where Congress has accorded procedural rights to protect a concrete interest, a plaintiff may fail to demonstrate concrete injury where violation of the procedure at issue presents no material risk of harm to that underlying interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 190. A central inquiry, then, is whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>particular bare procedural violation may present a material risk of harm to the underlying concrete interest Congress sought to protect. Accordingly, in <em>Strubel, </em>we held that those of the defendant\u2019s practices that \u201ccould cause consumers unwittingly not to satisfy their own obligations and thereby to lose their rights ... raise[d] a sufficient degree of the risk of real harm necessary to [establish] concrete injury and Article III standing,\u201d while other allegations where plaintiff \u201cfail[ed] to demonstrate sufficient risk of harm to a concrete TILA interest from [defendant\u2019s] alleged failure[s]\u201d were properly dismissed for lack of standing. <em>Id. </em>at 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">III. Material Risk of Harm under FACTA</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Applying <em>Strubel, </em>the key inquiry here is whether Paris Baguette\u2019s alleged bare procedural violation \u2014 printing Cru-par-Weinmann\u2019s credit card expiration date on her receipt \u2014 presents a material risk of harm to the underlying concrete interest Congress sought to protect in passing FACTA. We find it dispositive that in 2007, Congress clarified FACTA in the Credit and Debit Card Receipt Clarification Act of 2007 (\u201cClarification Act\u201d), stating that \u201c[e]xperts in the field agree that proper truncation of the card number, ... <em>regardless of the inclusion of the expiration date, </em>prevents a potential fraudster from perpetrating identity theft or credit card fraud.\u201d Pub. L. 110-241, \u00a7 2(a)(6), 122 Stat. 1565, 1565 (2007) (emphasis added). This makes clear that Congress <em>did not </em>think that the inclusion of a credit card expiration date on a receipt increases the risk of material harm of identity theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">Crupar-Weinmann counters that the Clarification Act maintained FACTA\u2019s prohibition on printing credit card expiration dates on receipts, which reflects Congress\u2019s continued belief that the action does pose a material risk of harm. While we acknowledge that the Clarification Act maintained FACTA\u2019s prohibition on this practice, we decline to draw plaintiffs proposed inference, because in the same Act, Congress <em>expressly </em>observed that the inclusion of expiration dates <em>did not </em>raise a material risk of identity theft, presumably to curtail the \u201chundreds of lawsuits [that] were filed [after FACTA\u2019s passage] alleging that the failure to remove the expiration date was a willful violation ... even where the account number was properly truncated[, and n]one of these lawsuits contained an allegation of harm to any consumer\u2019s identity.\u201d Pub. L. 110-241 \u00a7 2(a)(4)-(5), 122 Stat. at 1565. Congress could not have been clearer in stating that \u201c[t]he purpose of this Act is to ensure that consumers suffering from any actual harm to their credit or identity are protected while simultaneously limiting abusive lawsuits that do not protect consumers but only result in increased cost to business and potentially increased prices to consumers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2(b), 122 Stat. at 1566. Given this clarification of FACTA, coupled with our holding in <em>Strubel </em>that a plaintiff must allege that, at a minimum, the bare \u201cprocedural violation presents a \u2018risk of real harm\u2019 to [her] concrete interest,\u201d 842 F.3d at 190, we conclude that the plaintiff here has not alleged in her amended complaint that Paris Baguette\u2019s bare procedural violation of FACTA posed a material risk of harm to her.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We thus join our sister Cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>cuit in concluding, in a case with a nearly identical set of allegations, that \u201c[i]n these circumstances, it is hard to imagine how the expiration date\u2019s presence could have increased the risk that [plaintiffs] identity would be compromised.\u201d <em>Meyers v. Nicolet Rest. of De Pere, LLC, </em>843 F.3d 724, 727 (7th Cir. 2016).</p>\n<p id=\"Ath\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"Avx\">For these reasons, we join the Seventh Circuit in holding that the printing of an expiration date on an otherwise properly redacted receipt does not constitute an injury in fact sufficient to establish Article III standing to bring a claim alleging a bare procedural violation of FACTA. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b107-7\">. This is not to say that it is impossible to allege a different \u201cbare procedural violation\u201d of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c(g) for which some plaintiff might have standing. In a circumstance like this, however, where the plaintiff alleges no particular harm beyond a purely procedural violation, and Congress has found that <em>that </em>particular bare procedural violation does not increase the risk of the relevant material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>harm, the plaintiff lacks standing to proceed with such a suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
