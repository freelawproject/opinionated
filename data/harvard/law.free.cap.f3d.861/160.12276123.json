According to Herron, Fannie Mae blocked her attempt to become an embedded contractor at Treasury and then terminated her contract work with Fannie Mae in retaliation for her purported disclosures of gross waste and mismanagement by Fannie Mae in administering the programs. Herron sued Fannie Mae and three Fannie Mae officers, asserting claims under District of Columbia law and, in the alternative, under <em>Bivens. </em>The district court dismissed the <em>Bivens </em>claim in a published opinion, holding that Fannie Mae is not a government actor, and, in a subsequent unpublished opinion, granted summary judgment against Herron on her remaining claims.

Mnuchin, </em>848 F.3d 1072, 1080 (D.C. Cir. 2017). Fannie Mae and its brother corporation, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, also known as Freddie Mac, \u201cbuy residential mortgages from banks, repackage them for sale as mortgage-backed securities, and guarantee these securities by promising to make investors whole if borrowers default.\u201d <em>Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Fed. Housing Fin. Agency, </em>646 F.3d 924, 925 (D.C. Cir. 2011). Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac play a central role in the national mortgage market by providing lenders with capital to make more loans. <em>Perry Capital, </em>848 F.3d at 1080; <em>Judicial Watch, </em>646 F.3d at 926.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-15\">During the 2000s, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u201cbought risky mortgages and got caught up in the housing bubble.\u201d <em>DeKalb Cty. v. Fed. Housing Fin. Agency, </em>741 F.3d 795, 798 (7th Cir. 2013). The decline in housing prices in the mid-2000s \u201csubstantially eroded the value of Fannie [Mae]- and Freddie [Mae]-held mortgages.\u201d <em>Judicial Watch, </em>646 F.3d at 926. The ensuing financial crisis in 2007 and 2008 pushed both firms \u201cto the brink of collapse.\u201d <em>Perry Capital, </em>848 F.3d at 1079. To prevent these government-sponsored enterprises from defaulting, Congress enact<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>ed the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (\u201cHERA\u201d), Pub. L. No. 110-289, 122 Stat. 2654. <em>Perry Capital, </em>848 F.3d at 1079, 1080-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">HERA established the Intervenor Federal Housing Finance Agency (\u201cFHFA\u201d), an independent federal agency charged with supervising and regulating Fannie Mae. <em>See </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4511; <em>Perry Capital, </em>848 F.3d at 1080-81. Among other things, HERA authorized the FHFA to place Fannie Mae into conservatorship. <em>See </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4617(a). It exercised that authority on September 6, 2008. In conjunction with the appointment of the FHFA as conservator, Treasury committed to provide funding to Fannie Mae to keep it from defaulting. <em>See Perry Capital, </em>848 F.3d at 1079, 1082.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"Ah9\">The financial crisis also spurred Congress to enact the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (\u201cEESA\u201d), Pub. L. No. 110-343, 122 Stat. 3765. The EESA provides the Secretary of the Treasury with the \u201cauthority and facilities ... to restore liquidity and stability to the financial system of the United States,\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 5201(1), and directs the Secretary to act in a manner that, among other things, \u201cpreserves homeownership,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 5201(2)(B). To that end, the EESA authorized the Secretary to \u201cimplement a plan that seeks to maximize assistance for homeowners\u201d and to encourage loan servi-cers to minimize foreclosures. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5219(a)(1). Pursuant' to this authority, the Secretary established the Home Affordable Modification Program (\u201cHAMP\u201d), which is designed to prevent foreclosures by encouraging loan servicers to modify mortgage terms for eligible homeowners.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">A brief summary of HAMP is necessary to understand the factual allegations underlying this case. <em>See generally Wigod v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., </em>673 F.3d 547, 556-57 (7th Cir. 2012) (providing a detailed explanation of HAMP). HAMP \u2014 the largest mortgage modification program within Treasury\u2019s broader Making Home Affordable Program (\u201cMHAP\u201d) \u2014 provides struggling homeowners with an opportunity to modify the terms of their mortgages, and can include changes such as reduced interest rates and term extensions. A HAMP modification consists of two steps. First, a servicer offers an eligible homeowner a \u201ctrial modification,\u201d which allows the homeowner to make modified mortgage payments for a specified term to determine whether those payments are sustainable. Then, if the homeowner successfully completes the trial modification, the servicer can convert the homeowner to a permanent mortgage modification. To encourage participation, Treasury offered financial incentives to servicers who agreed to these modifications, and, prior to June 1, 2010, Treasury permitted servi-cers to approve homeowners for trial modifications without written verification of income, meaning that servicers placed eligible homeowners in \u201cstated\u201d or \u201cverbal\u201d trial modifications, rather than compelling \u201cverified\u201d trial modifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">On February 18, 2009, Treasury and Fannie Mae entered into a Financial Agency Agreement (\u201cFAA\u201d), under which Fannie Mae was to administer MHAP as a fiduciary to Treasury. <em>See </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 5211(c)(3) (authorizing Treasury to designate certain institutions as \u201cfinancial agents of the Federal Government\u201d). Fannie Mae was eligible to receive incentive payments from Treasury based on a number of metrics set forth in the FAA, including the number of modifications. And, at least in fiscal year 2009, Fannie Mae used the number of modifications, regardless of whether they converted to permanent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>modifications, as a metric in determining executive bonuses.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">In June 2009, after the FHFA placed Fannie Mae into conservatorship, ICon Professional Services (\u201cICon\u201d), a third-party contracting company, hired Herron to provide consulting services to Fannie Mae on MHAP and, more specifically, HAMP. Appellees Eric Schuppenhauer, a senior vice president at Fannie Mae, and Alanna Brown, Fannie Mae\u2019s Director of Government Programs and New Initiatives, were her direct supervisors. In addition to working with Fannie Mae officials and servi-cers, Herron worked directly with Treasury managers overseeing Fannie Mae\u2019s administration of MHAP.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Almost immediately after she began work at Fannie Mae, Herron raised a number of criticisms about Fannie Mae\u2019s administration of HAMP. <em>Summary Judgment Opinion, </em>2016 WL 1177918, at *3. Herron does not press her argument concerning the excessive burdens Fannie Mae allegedly imposed on servicers on appeal. <em>See id. </em>at *3, *23-25. And she forfeited her argument concerning the extension of the HAMP enrollment deadline, <em>see id. </em>at *4-7, *28-30, by failing to adequately raise it in her opening brief. <em>See City of Waukesha v. EPA, </em>320 F.3d 228, 250 n.22 (D.C. Cir. 2003). Therefore, the only criticism relevant to this appeal concerns the problems associated with the use of stated trial modifications, including the low rate of conversion to permanent modifications. <em>See Summary Judgment Opinion, </em>2016 WL 1177918, at <em>*3-4, </em>*25-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">The record establishes that the problems with stated trial modifications were highly debated and controversial topics at both Fannie Mae and Treasury. <em>See id. </em>at *25-27. Herron contends, however, that she was the only one who disclosed the extent of the problems. According to Her-ron, Fannie Mae pushed stated trial modifications, not to assist homeowners, but to obtain incentive payments from Treasury and justify higher executive bonuses. Her-ron alleges that Fannie Mae knew that many homeowners enrolled in trial modifications would never be eligible to convert to permanent modifications, and therefore Fannie Mae wasted^ public funds and mismanaged HAMP by pushing these modifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">Around the same time that she voiced these concerns, Herron began planning a move to Treasury. <em>See id. </em>at *7-11. On December 15, 2009, she proposed that she be hired by Fannie Mae as a dedicated \u201con site\u201d or \u201cembedded\u201d contractor at Treasury. Fannie Mae officials, including Schuppenhauer, initially supported the idea but soon began expressing concerns. <em>See id. </em>at *7-8. More specifically, Schup-penhauer and Appellee Nancy Jardini, Fannie Mae\u2019s acting Chief Compliance Officer, raised potential conflicts of interest and ethics issues relating to the move. <em>Id. </em>at *8-9. The parties dispute the facts regarding these issues \u2014 Herron argues that Fannie Mae created \u201ca spurious conflict of interest issue\u201d to block her move, while Fannie Mae asserts that the move would create serious conflicts of interest that needed to be addressed. It appears undisputed, however, that Fannie Mae ultimately decided not to go through with the move. Schuppenhauer also admitted that Herron\u2019s criticisms of Fannie Mae\u2019s administration of HAMP may have affected his views. On January 13, 2010, Herron told Schuppenhauer she was \u201cready to escalate\u201d the question of her move to Fannie Mae\u2019s Executive Vice President Terry Edwards and. Chief Executive Officer Mike Williams. After Schuppenhauer discussed the issue with Williams and Edwards, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>terminated Herron\u2019s contract work with Fannie Mae on January 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">After her HAMP work was terminated, Herron pursued other business opportunities in the industry. Two Fannie Mae managers, Rich McGhee and Patricia Fulcher, discussed the possibility of Herron working on non-HAMP. projects, but one of Fannie Mae\u2019s compliance attorneys told McGhee and Fulcher to stop recruiting Herron. <em>See id. </em>at *11. Herron also discussed potential employment opportunities with Timothy Rood, the president of the Collingwood Group, a financial services consulting group. After speaking with his contacts at Fannie Mae, however, Rood informed Herron that she appeared to be \u201cradioactive\u201d and he did not think she would be an asset to the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">On June 8, 2010, Herron sued Fannie Mae, Schuppenhauer, Brown, and Jardini, alleging that they blocked her move to Treasury and terminated her contract work in retaliation for her disclosures of Fannie Mae\u2019s \u201cgross waste of public funds\u201d and \u201cgross mismanagement\u201d in administering HAMP. Operating under the presumption that Fannie Mae is a private entity, Herron asserted claims under District. of Columbia law for wrongful termination in violation of public policy, civil conspiracy, and tortious interference with prospective contractual relations. Alternatively, if Fannie Mae is a government actor, Herron alleged a <em>Bivens </em>claim for retaliation in response to the exercise of her First Amendment rights. <em>See generally Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">Fannie Mae and the individual \u25a0 defendants first moved to dismiss Herron\u2019s alternative <em>Bivens </em>claim, asserting that Fannie Mae is a private entity and thus not subject to a <em>Bivens </em>action. The FHFA, in its capacity as conservator, intervened and moved to dismiss on the same ground. On April 30, 2012, the district court granted the motion. Bivens <em>Opinion, </em>857 F.Supp.2d at 88. Applying the framework set forth in <em>Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corp., </em>513 U.S. 374, 115 S.Ct. 961, 130 L.Ed.2d 902 (1995), the court concluded that Fannie Mae is \u201ca private entity and the appointment of [the] FHFA as conservator ... did not transform Fannie Mae into a public agency,\u201d because the conser-vatorship \u201cdid not establish <em>permanent </em>government authority to control Fannie Mae.\u201d <em>See </em>Bivens <em>Opinion, </em>857 F.Supp.2d at 88, 95-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">After the parties engaged in extensive discovery, Fannie Mae and the individual defendants moved for summary judgment on Herron\u2019s remaining wrongful termination, tortious interference, and conspiracy claims. On March 8, 2016, the district court granted the motion. <em>Summary Judgment Opinion, </em>2016 WL 1177918, at *1. The court recognized that Herron\u2019s status as an at-will contractor posed a fundamental problem for her tortious interference claim, <em>see id. </em>at *13-15, and her wrongful termination claim, <em>see id. </em>at *16. First, the court held that Herron\u2019s tortious interference claim failed as a matter of law because she had not identified a \u201ccommercially reasonable business expectancy\u201d on which to base the claim. <em>See id. </em>at *12-16. Second, the court held that the EESA provided a sufficient \u201cmandate of public policy\u201d to support Herron\u2019s wrongful termination in violation of public policy claim. <em>See id. </em>at *16, *19-20. It nevertheless entered summary judgment against her on that claim after concluding that \u201cthere is not a close fit between [her] criticism of the use of stated trials and her claimed public policy of disclosing Fannie Mae\u2019s gross mismanagement or waste of funds.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number><em>See id. </em>at *20-23, *25-27. Finally, the court explained that without \u201ca cognizable underlying tort,\u201d Herron\u2019s conspiracy' claim also failed. <em>See id. </em>at *30.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Herron appealed, challenging the district court\u2019s order granting the motion to dismiss her <em>Bivens </em>claim and its order granting the motion for summary judgment against her on the common law claims. She also appeals two orders denying discovery. Herron\u2019s additional argument regarding unsealing the summary judgment briefing does not warrant separate discussion in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Fannie Mae and the individual defendants cross-appealed, arguing that the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment could be affirmed on the alternative ground that the BESA did not set forth a sufficient public policy on which to base a wrongful termination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s dismissal of Herron\u2019s alternative <em>Bivens </em>claim. <em>Emory v. United Air Lines, Inc., </em>720 F.3d 915, 921 (D.C. Cir. 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">Herron alleges that, if Fannie Mae ,\u215b a government actor, Fannie Mae - and the individual defendants, acting as officers of the United States government, all are liable for retaliating against her for the exercise of her First Amendment rights. Because Herron\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claim is based on her contention that Fannie Mae \u201cis not a private entity but Government itself,\u201d we need not \u201ctraverse th[e] difficult terrain\u201d of the state action doctrine. <em>Lebron, </em>513 U.S. at 378, 115 S.Ct. 961; <em>see also Sprauve v. W. Indian Co., </em>799 F.3d 226, 229-30 (3d Cir. 2015); <em>Hack v. President &amp; Fellows of Yale Coll., </em>237 F.3d 81, 83 (2d Cir. 2000), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., </em>534 U.S. 506, 122 S.Ct. 992, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002). Instead, we apply the framework the Supreme Court established in <em>Lebr\u00f3n </em>for determining whether a \u201cGovernment-created and -controlled corporation ]\u201d is a government actor for constitutional purposes. 513 U.S. at 397, 115 S.Ct. 961.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-12\">In <em>Lebr\u00f3n, </em>the Court considered whether the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, commonly known as Amtrak, was part of the government for First Amendment purposes. <em>See id. </em>at 376, 394, 115 S.Ct. 961. Considering the \u201cpublic and judicial understanding of the nature of Government-created and -controlled corporations over the years,\u201d <em>see id. </em>at 394-97, 115 S.Ct. 961, the Court noted that arrangements providing for temporary government control over a government-created corporation do not make that corporation a government actor, <em>see id. </em>at 398-99, 115 S.Ct. 961. The Court then concluded that a corporation is \u201cpart of the Government\u201d for constitutional purposes when: \u201c[ (1) ] the Government creates [the] corporation by special law, [ (2) ] for the furtherance of governmental objectives, and [ (3) ] retains for itself permanent authority to appoint a majority of the directors of that corporation <em>Id. </em>at 400, 115 S.Ct. 961. Applying these criteria, the Court held that Amtrak was a government actor because \u201cit is established and organized under federal law for the very purpose of pursuing federal governmental objectives, under the direction and control of federal governmental appointees.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 397-98, 115 S.Ct. 961. As our sister circuits recognize, <em>Lebr\u00f3n </em>sets forth a three-part standard to determine whether a government-created corporation is part of the government for constitutional purposes. <em>See, e.g., Hack, </em>237 F.3d at 83-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-13\">This-case satisfies the first two <em>Le-br\u00f3n </em>criteria. Congress created Fannie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Mae to accomplish a number of governmental objectives for the national housing market. <em>See </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1716, 1716b, 4501; <em>Perry Capital, </em>848 F.3d at 1080. Although Congress converted Fannie Mae to a private corporation in 1968, \u201cits charter, and therefore its function ..., were unchanged.\u201d <em>DeKalb Cty., </em>741 F.3d at 797. Neither Fannie Mae nor the FHFA challenge that Congress\u2019s creation of Fannie Mae furthered \u201cgovernmental objectives.\u201d <em>See Am. Bankers Mortg. Corp. v. Fed. Home Loan Mortg. Corp., </em>75 F.3d 1401, 1406-07 (9th Cir. 1996) (holding that Freddie Mac satisfied the first two <em>Lebr\u00f3n </em>criteria). The real dispute in this case centers on the final <em>Lebr\u00f3n </em>criterion: permanent government control.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Herron urges that permanent government control is not required under the <em>Lebr\u00f3n </em>framework. But \u201c[w]e think <em>Lebr\u00f3n </em>means what it says.\u201d <em>Hack, </em>237 F.3d at 84. To find that a government-created corporation is a government actor for constitutional purposes, <em>Lebr\u00f3n </em>clearly requires permanent government control. <em>See </em>513 U.S. at 398-99, 115 S.Ct. 961. Otherwise put, permanency is \u201ca necessary condition precedent\u201d to consider a government-created corporation part of the government. <em>Sprauve, </em>799 F.3d at 233 n.8 (citations omitted). We do not read <em>Department of Transportation v. Association of American Railroads, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 1225, 191 L.Ed.2d 153 (2015), as dispensing with the permanency requirement. Consistent with <em>Lebr\u00f3n, </em>the Court in <em>Association of American Railroads </em>concluded that \u201cthe practical reality of federal control and supervision,\u201d not a statutory disclaimer, controls when determining an entity\u2019s status. <em>See id. </em>at 1231-33; <em>see also Lebron, </em>513 U.S. at 392-93, 399, 115 S.Ct. 961. Because the government\u2019s permanent control over Amtrak was already established in <em>Lebr\u00f3n, </em>the Court had no occasion to revisit that question in <em>Association of American Railroads. </em>Moreover, we generally presume that the Court does not overturn or limit its prior holdings through silence or implication. <em>See, e.g., Shalala v. Ill. Council on Long Term Care, Inc., </em>529 U.S. 1, 18, 120 S.Ct. 1084, 146 L.Ed.2d 1 (2000); <em>Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/Am. Express, Inc., </em>490 U.S. 477, 484, 109 S.Ct. 1917, 104 L.Ed.2d 526 (1989). Accordingly, the <em>Lebr\u00f3n </em>framework requires permanency. <em>See, e.g., Meridian Invs., Inc. v. Fed. Home Loan Mortg. Corp., </em>855 F.3d 573, 578-79 (4th Cir. 2017) (applying permanency requirement after <em>Association of American </em>Railroads).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">We therefore turn to the question of whether the federal government exercises permanent control over Fannie Mae. Fannie Mae\u2019s organic statute, <em>see </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1716b, 1718(a), 1723(b), does not place it \u201cunder the direction and control of federal governmental appointees,\u201d <em>cf. Lebron, </em>513 U.S. at 385-86, 397-98, 115 S.Ct. 961. Herron, therefore, does not dispute that Fannie Mae was a private entity before the conservatorship. <em>See, e.g., Northrip v. Fed. Nat\u2019l Mortg. Ass\u2019n, </em>527 F.2d 23, 30-32 (6th Cir. 1975); <em>see also Am. Bankers, </em>75 F.3d at 1407-09 (applying the <em>Lebr\u00f3n </em>framework and concluding that pre-conser-vatorship Freddie Mac was not a government actor because the government did not \u201ccontrol the operation of Freddie Mac through its appointees\u201d (quoting <em>Lebron, </em>513 U.S. at 399, 115 S.Ct. 961) (alterations omitted)). Rather, she argues that the FHFA\u2019s conservatorship converted Fannie Mae into a government actor because it gave the government <em>de facto </em>permanent control over Fannie Mae. As noted, HERA authorized the FHFA \u201cto undertake extraordinary economic measures\u201d with regard to Fannie Mae, including placing it into conservatorship. <em>Perry Capital, </em>848 F.3d at 1080-81. Herron asserts that the conservatorship transformed Fannie Mae <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>into a government actor because the federal government now exercises \u201cpervasive and far-reaching\u201d control over Fannie Mae, including the authority to determine its future. This is not the first time a plaintiff has advanced this argument, <em>see, e.g., Rubin v. Fannie Mae, </em>587 Fed.Appx. 273, 275 (6th Cir. 2014); <em>Wright v. Fed. Nat\u2019l Mortg. Ass\u2019n, </em>No. 1:13-cv-4294, 2014 WL 12042555, at *2-3 (N.D. Ga. Sept. 22, 2014), and it is not without some appeal. Nevertheless, Herron\u2019s argument misses the mark because the conservatorship does not amount to <em>permanent </em>government control.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The FHFA became conservator \u201cfor the purpose of reorganizing, rehabilitating, or winding up the affairs\u201d of Fannie Mae. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4617(a)(2). Although there is no specific termination date, the purpose of the conservatorship is to restore Fannie Mae to a stable condition. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>\u00a7 4617(b)(2)(D) (giving the FHFA authority as conservator to take actions \u201cnecessary to put [Fannie Mae] in a sound and solvent condition\u201d and \u201cappropriate to carry on [its] business ... and preserve and conserve [its] assets and property\u201d). \u201cThis is an inherently temporary purpose.\u201d <em>Rubin, </em>587 Fed.Appx. at 275. While the conservatorship authorized the government to exercise substantial control over Fannie Mae, \u201cthat control is temporary, \u2018as a private corporation whose stock comes into federal ownership might be.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Meridian Invs., </em>855 F.3d at 579 (quoting <em>Lebron, </em>513 U.S. at 398, 115 S.Ct. 961). Thus, the government\u2019s indefinite but temporary control does not transform Fannie Mae into a government actor. <em>See Lebron, </em>513 U.S. at 399, 115 S.Ct. 961 (citing <em>Reg\u2019l Rail Reorganization Act Cases, </em>419 U.S. 102, 152, 95 S.Ct. 335, 42 L.Ed.2d 320 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Further, as conservator, the FHFA succeeded to \u201call rights, titles, powers, and privileges\u201d of Fannie Mae. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4617(b)(2)(A)(i). This language evinces Congress\u2019s intention to have the FHFA step into Fannie Mae\u2019s private shoes. <em>Perry Capital, </em>848 F.3d at 1103 &amp; n.22. When it stepped into these shoes, the FHFA \u201cshed[ ] its government character and ... [became] a private party.\u201d <em>See Meridian Invs., </em>855 F.3d at 579. But while the FHFA\u2019s status changed, the status of Fannie Mae, as the \u201cshoes\u201d into which the FHFA stepped, did not. <em>See United States ex rel. Adams v. Aurora Loan Servs., Inc., </em>813 F.3d 1259, 1261 (9th Cir. 2016) (explaining that the FHFA as conservator stepped into Fannie Mae\u2019s shoes, and \u201cnot the other way around\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">In conclusion, the conservatorship over Fannie Mae did not create the type of permanent government control that is required under <em>Lebr\u00f3n, </em>and we therefore affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Her-ron\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">Herron asserts the following claims under District of Columbia law against Fannie Mae in its capacity as a private entity: (1) wrongful termination in violation of public policy; (2) tortious interference with prospective contractual relations; and (3) civil conspiracy. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment against Herron, <em>Robinson v. Pezzat, </em>818 F.3d 1, 7 (D.C. Cir. 2016), and for the reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">The district court concluded that the EESA provided a sufficient public policy to support Herron\u2019s wrongful termination in violation of public policy claim, but it granted summary judgment against her because she failed to satisfy the \u201cclose fit\u201d analysis. <em>See Summary Judgment Opinion, </em>2016 WL 1177918, at *16, *19-23, *25-27. We affirm the district court\u2019s ulti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>mate determination on the alternative ground that no public policy exception exists under the EESA.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">The District of Columbia has long recognized that an at-will employee may be discharged \u201cat any time and for any reason, or for no reason at all.\u201d <em>Liberatore v. Melville Corp., </em>168 F.3d 1326, 1329 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (quoting <em>Adams v. George W. Cochran &amp; Co., </em>597 A.2d 28, 30 (D.C. 1991)). But the District of Columbia Court of Appeals has recognized a \u201cvery narrow\u201d public policy exception to the at-will employment doctrine. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Adams, </em>597 A.2d at 34). Although the exception initially applied only to cases in which an employee was discharged for refusal to violate the law, courts may recognize additional public policy exceptions on a case-by-case basis. <em>See Fingerhut v. Children\u2019s Nat\u2019l Med. Ctr., </em>738 A.2d 799, 803-04 (D.C. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\"> An exception warrants recognition if it is \u201cfirmly anchored either in the Constitution or in a statute or regulation which clearly reflects the particular \u2018public policy\u2019 being relied upon\u201d and there is \u201ca close fit between the policy thus declared and the conduct at issue in the allegedly wrongful termination.\u201d <em>Carl v. Children\u2019s Hosp., </em>702 A.2d 159, 162, 164 (D.C. 1997) (Terry, J., concurring);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>see also Liberatore, </em>168 F.3d at 1331; <em>Fingerhut, </em>738 A.2d at 803 n.7. \u201cBy tying new causes of action to statutory and constitutional provisions,\u201d courts are prevented from \u201cdefining nebulous concepts of public policy\u201d and creating exceptions based on conduct that \u201csimply tends to be injurious to the public or against the public good.\u201d <em>Rosella v. Long Rap, Inc., </em>121 A.3d 775, 778 (D.C. 2015) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Without this statutory anchor, the at-will doctrine would be reduced to \u201ca virtual nullity.\u201d <em>Carl, </em>702 A.2d at 163 (Terry, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">Herron seeks to have this Court create a public policy exception to the at-will doctrine based on the EESA. That statute, Herron argues, reflects specific public policy interests in preventing foreclosures and protecting taxpayers\u2019 interests, which are directly relevant to Herron\u2019s purported disclosures of Fannie Mae\u2019s maladministration of MHAP. The district court agreed, holding that Herron\u2019s \u201cclaimed public policy of disclosing or protecting against the gross mismanagement and the gross waste of public funds is \u2018clearly reflected\u2019 and \u2018firmly anchored\u2019 \u201d in the EESA. <em>Summary Judgment Opinion, </em>2016 WL 1177918, at *19-20. In this, the district court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">\u201c[A]ny judicially recognized public policy exception to the at-will doctrine\u201d must be \u201c \u2018carefully tethered\u2019 to rights officially recognized in statutes or regulations .... \u201d <em>Carl, </em>702 A.2d at 164 (Terry, J., concurring). For this reason, one \u201ccommon denominator\u201d can be found in all of the cases applying the public policy exception: \u201cthe existence of specific laws or regulations that clearly reflect a policy prohibiting the activity about which the employee complained .... \u201d <em>Leyden v. Am. Accreditation Healthcare Comm\u2019n, </em>83 F.Supp.3d 241, 249 (D.D.C. 2015) (collecting cases); <em>see also Freas v. Archer Servs., Inc., </em>716 A.2d 998, 999-1003 (D.C. 1998) (noting that plaintiff alleged facts demonstrating that he was discharged \u201cin violation of a mandate explicitly set forth in [D.C.] law\u201d). That common denominator is missing in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>The EESA provisions the district court relied upon simply identify the general purpose of the statute and the goals the Secretary must consider in exercising his statutory authority. <em>See </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5201, 5213. Sections 5201 and 5213 neither \u201cset out a standard of conduct\u201d for Fannie Mae nor \u201cembody a specific public policy prohibiting [an employer] from engaging in the conduct [the employee] alleges.\u201d <em>Leyden, </em>83 F.Supp.3d at 249. These sections do not offer the sort of \u201cdeclaration of policy ... needed to support a public policy exception to the at-will doctrine,\u201d <em>Carl, </em>702 A.2d at 165 n.9 (Terry, J., concurring), and courts are prohibited from creating new exceptions by \u201cbroadening] the policies expressed\u201d in a statute or \u201cfilling] a perceived gap in the statute,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 162-63 (Terry, J., concurring) (citation, internal quotation marks, and alteration omitted). Relying on these provisions to create a new public policy exception would contravene the District of Columbia Court of Appeals\u2019 admonition against finding generalized exceptions. <em>See Rosella, </em>121 A.3d at 778. The district court therefore erred in concluding that Herron had identified a clear source of public policy upon which to base an exception to the at-will doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">But, because we reject Herron\u2019s request to recognize an exception that is not clearly reflected or firmly anchored in a statute or regulation, we affirm the district court\u2019s granting of summary judgment against Herron on her wrongful termination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">To support her tortious interference with prospective contractual relations claim, Herron relies on three expectancies: (1) working as a Fannie Mae contractor embedded at Treasury; (2) working as a Fannie Mae contractor on non-HAMP projects; and (3) working for the Collingwood Group. Under District of Columbia law, a tortious interference with prospective contractual relations claim requires a valid business expectancy, the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the expectancy, intentional interference causing a termination of the expectancy, and damages. <em>See Banneker Ventures, LLC v. Graham, </em>798 F.3d 1119, 1134 (D.C. Cir. 2015); <em>Browning v. Clinton, </em>292 F.3d 235, 242 (D.C. Cir. 2002); <em>Havilah Real Prop. Servs., LLC v. VLK, LLC, </em>108 A.3d 334, 345-46 (D.C. 2015). This theory of tortious interference protects \u201cbusiness expectancies, not grounded on present contractual relationships but which are commercially reasonable to anticipate, ... from unjustified interference.\u201d <em>Carr v. Brown, </em>395 A.2d 79, 84 (D.C. 1978). Because Herron has not identified a valid business expectancy, her claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">Herron cannot maintain a claim for tor-tious interference based on either of her expectancies of working as an at-will Fannie Mae contractor. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals has been reluctant to recognize a claim for tortious interference with prospective contractual relations based on a prospective at-will relationship. <em>See, e.g., McManus v. MCI Commc\u2019ns Corp., </em>748 A.2d 949, 957-58 (D.C. 2000). In an attempt to overcome the at-will hurdle, Herron alleges that she had a reasonable expectation of continuing employment because Fannie Mae \u201croutinely and automatically renewed\u201d contracts such as hers. Even assuming these contracts were routinely renewed, that fact is insufficient to rebut the at-will presumption. <em>See id. </em>at 957 (holding that at-will employee could not base her tortious interference claim on \u201ca long-term employment relationship and an expectancy of continuing employment relations with [the defendant]\u201d); <em>Bible Way Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ of the Apostolic Faith of Washington, D.C. v. Beards, </em>680 A.2d 419, 433 (D.C. 1996) (con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>eluding that plaintiffs failed to state a tor-tious interference claim based on an allegation of \u201ca tacit agreement\u201d of continued employment); <em>see also Summary Judgment Opinion, </em>2016 WL 1177918, at *14 (rejecting Herron\u2019s argument that she was not an at-will contractor).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Herron\u2019s claim fails for \u201can additional simple reason.\u201d <em>Summary Judgment Opinion, </em>2016 WL 1177918, at *14. In this case, Herron argues that Fannie Mae interfered with her prospective contractual relations <em>with Fannie Mae. </em>But, just as an employer cannot interfere with its own contract, Fannie Mae cannot interfere with its own business relationships. <em>See Little v. Dist. of Columbia Water &amp; Sewer Auth., </em>91 A.3d 1020, 1030 n.12 (D.C. 2014); <em>Paul v. Howard Univ., </em>754 A.2d 297, 309-10 (D.C. 2000); <em>McManus, </em>748 A.2d at 957-58; <em>see also Jerome Stevens Pharms., Inc. v. FDA, </em>402 F.3d 1249, 1255 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (noting that \u201cthe duty not to interfere with the plaintiffs economic relationship with a third party\u201d underlies tortious interference claims); <em>Dow Chem. Corp. v. Weevil-Cide Co., </em>897 F.2d 481, 488-89 (10th Cir. 1990) (explaining that, for purposes of a tortious interference with prospective contractual relations claim, \u201cone cannot \u2018interfere\u2019 with its own affairs\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">We also conclude that Her-ron\u2019s proffered expectancy outside of Fannie Mae is too remote to support a tortious interference claim. The prospect of obtaining employment is a recognized expectancy protected from interference. <em>Carr, </em>395 A.2d at 84. But any expectancy \u201c \u2018must be commercially reasonable to anticipate\u2019 before its loss may be actionable.\u201d <em>Banneker Ventures, </em>798 F.3d at 1134 (quoting <em>Browning, </em>292 F.3d at 242). As the District of Columbia Court of Appeals has recognized, some expectancies are \u201csimply too remote\u201d to support a tortious interference claim. <em>Carr, </em>395 A.2d at 84. Herron argues that she \u201cpursued a position\u201d at the Collingwood Group by discussing potential opportunities with the company\u2019s president. To have an actionable claim, however, she must show \u201ca probability of future contractual or economic relationship and not a mere possibility.\u201d <em>Havilah Real Prop. Servs., </em>108 A.3d at 351 (citation omitted); <em>cf. Banneker Ventures, </em>798 F.3d at 1134-35 (holding that the plaintiff had demonstrated \u201cfar more than a \u2018hope\u2019 \u201d of a future relationship). There is nothing in the record \u2014 such as a \u201cprospective final agreement,\u201d <em>see Banneker Ventures, </em>798 F.3d at 1135 \u2014 to support an inference that it was commercially reasonable for Herron to anticipate employment with the Colling-wood Group. Herron\u2019s claim that she pursued a position, standing alone, falls short' of establishing a valid business expectancy. <em>Cf. Browning, </em>292 F.3d at 242-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Because Herron failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact as to any valid business expectancy, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">Herron alleged in her complaint that Fannie Mae and the individual defendants conspired to \u2022wrongfully terminate her contract work. Citing <em>Myers v. Alutiiq International Solutions, LLC, </em>811 F.Supp.2d 261 (D.D.C. 2011), she argues on appeal that, instead of pursuing a conspiracy claim, she can proceed directly against the individual defendants on her wrongful termination claim. <em>See id. </em>at 268-70 (holding that D.C. case law suggests that a plaintiff may be able assert claims for wrongful termination against individual employees). It appears, therefore, that Herron has dropped her civil conspiracy claim. In any event, since Herron has failed to establish a cognizable underlying tort, her conspiracy claim fails. <em>See Brown</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number><em>ing, </em>292 F.3d at 245. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">y.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Herron also challenges two discovery rulings, which we review only for abuse of discretion. <em>Jankovic v. Int\u2019l Crisis Grp., </em>822 F.3d 576, 584 (D.C. Cir. 2016); <em>Brune v. IRS, </em>861 F.2d 1284, 1288 (D.C. Cir. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">Herron asserts that the district court abused its discretion by denying discovery into the government\u2019s control of Fannie Mae before dismissing her <em>Bivens </em>claim. A Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss tests the legal sufficiency of a plaintiffs complaint; it does not require a court to \u201cassess the truth of what is asserted or determine whether a plaintiff has any evidence to back up what is in the complaint.\u201d <em>Browning, </em>292 F.3d at 242 (citations, internal quotation marks, and alteration omitted). For this reason, Herron was not entitled to discovery before the court ruled on the motion to dismiss. <em>See, e.g., Mujica v. AirScan Inc., </em>771 F.3d 580, 593 <em>&amp; </em>n.7 (9th Cir. 2014); <em>Kolley v. Adult Protective Servs., </em>725 F.3d 581, 587 (6th Cir. 2013). In addition, for purposes of the motion to dismiss, the district court assumed that the federal government would not 'allow Fannie Mae to emerge from the conserva-torship as a private entity, which is precisely the information Herron sought in discovery. Because Herron failed to state a <em>Bivens </em>claim against Fannie Mae, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying her discovery into Fannie Mae\u2019s status as \u201ca <em>Lebr\u00f3n </em>state actor.\u201d <em>See Hack, </em>237 F.3d at 84-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">Herron also argues that she was entitled to discovery into the facts underlying a report that details the results of an investigation into Herron\u2019s allegations undertaken by Fannie Mae. <em>See Summary Judgment Opinion, </em>2016 WL 1177918, at *7 n.8 (discussing the report). During a telephone conference in or around April 2011, the district court denied Herron\u2019s discovery request but did not memorialize its order. We are constrained in our review because Herron failed to follow the proper procedure to allow this Court to adequately consider the district court\u2019s discovery ruling. When a district court makes a ruling off the record, Rule 10(c) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure provides an appellant with a mechanism to reconstruct the record and bring that ruling before an appellate court. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 10(c). Herron, as the appellant, bore the burden of invoking and complying with Rule 10(c) to properly challenge the district court\u2019s ruling denying discovery into the report. Because the district court\u2019s ruling was not memorialized and Herron failed to comply with the procedure set forth in Rule 10(c), \u201cmeaningful appellate review is virtually impossible.\u201d <em>Badami v. Flood, </em>214 F.3d 994, 999 (8th Cir. 2000). Under these circumstances, \u201cwe have no option but to defer to the district court\u2019s ruling ....\u201d <em>SIL-FLO, Inc. v. SFHC, Inc., </em>917 F.2d 1507, 1517 (10th Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b199-12\">For the reasons stated above, the district court\u2019s orders are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-13\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b196-6\">.
