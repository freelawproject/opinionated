Kline was suspended indefinitely from the practice of law in Kansas. He sued those involved for Violating his constitutional rights. The district court dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. He appeals. Having jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, this court affirms.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-14\">I.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1205-15\">In 2010, the Kansas Disciplinary Administrator filed a formal complaint against Kline for violations of the Kansas Rules of Professional Conduct (KRPC). A panel held a disciplinary hearing in two phases from February to July 2011. In October, it released a 185-page report finding multiple violations of the KRPC. It recommended an indefinite suspension from the practice of law. Kline filed exceptions to the report. The case went to the Kansas Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-16\">In May 2012, Kline moved to recuse five justices based on participation in earlier cases involving him. He argued recusal would \u201cnot hinder [his] appeal from being heard\u201d because \u201cthe Supreme Court may assign a judge of the court of the appeals or a district judge to serve temporarily on the supreme court.\u201d <em>See </em>Kan. Const. art. III, \u00a7 6(f) (\u201cThe supreme court may assign a district court judge to serve temporarily on the supreme court.\u201d); K.S.A. \u00a7 20-3002(c) (\u201cThe supreme court may assign a judge of the court of appeals to serve temporarily on the supreme court.\u201d). The five justices voluntarily recused.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-17\">Justice Daniel Biles \u2014 the most senior justice remaining \u2014 appointed court of appeals judges Henry W. Green, Jr. and Karen M. Arnold-Burger and district court judges Edward L. Bouker, Bruce T. Gat-terman, and Michael J. Malone to \u201cserve temporarily on the Supreme Court to participate in the hearing and decision of\u2019 Kline\u2019s case. <em>See </em>Kansas Supreme Court Internal Operating Procedures, Part I (\u201cThe Chief Justice is the presiding officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>of the Supreme Court of Kansas. If the Chief Justice is absent or unable to act, the justice who is next senior in continuous term of service on the court shall preside\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-4\">In November 2012, Kline argued his case before the Kansas Supreme Court. In October 2013, the court found \u201cclear and convincing evidence that Kline committed 11 KRPC violations.\u201d It ordered indefinite suspension. The court later denied Kline\u2019s motion for rehearing or modification, alleging factual and legal errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-5\">In February 2014, Kline moved to vacate or dismiss the judgment, claiming the court was unlawfully composed because Justice Biles lacked authority to appoint replacement judges. The Clerk of the Kansas Appellate Courts did not docket the motion because the case was closed. In March, Kline petitioned for certiorari in the United States Supreme Court, alleging due process and free speech violations. The Supreme Court denied the petition. <em>Kline v. Kansas Disciplinary Administr</em>ator, \u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1950, 188 L.Ed.2d 976 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-7\">In October 2015, Kline sued in federal district court, asserting ten counts for declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Counts one through nine attack the Kansas Supreme Court\u2019s decision. Count ten is a \u201cprospective challenge\u201d to the \u201cunconstitutionally vague\u201d Kansas Supreme Court Rule 219. The district court dismissed count three as a non-justiciable political question. It dismissed the other nine counts for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. Kline appeals the dismissal of claims under <em>Rooker-Feldman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1206-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-9\">This court reviews de novo a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Trackwell v. United States Gov\u2019t, </em>472 F.3d 1242, 1243 (10th Cir. 2007). \u201cFederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. They possess only that power authorized by Constitution and statute.\u201d <em>Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>511 U.S. 375, 377, 114 S.Ct. 1673, 128 L.Ed.2d 391 (1994). \u201cIt is to be presumed that.a.cause lies outside this limited jurisdiction, and the burden of establishing the contrary rests upon the party asserting jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-12\">\u201c[U]nder what has come to be known as the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, lower federal courts are precluded from exercising appellate jurisdiction over final state-court judgments.\u201d <em>Lance v. Dennis, </em>546 U.S. 459, 463, 126 S.Ct. 1198, 163 L.Ed.2d 1059 (2006). This preclusion applies to \u201cclaims actually decided by a state court, and claims inextricably intertwined with a prior state-court judgment.\u201d <em>Tal v. Hogan, </em>453 F.3d 1244, 1256 (10th Cir. 2006). \u201cThus, the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine prevents \u2018a party losing in state court ... from seeking what in substance would be appellate review of [a] state judgment in a United States district court, based on the losing party\u2019s claim that the state judgment itself violates the loser\u2019s federal rights.\u201d <em>Id., quoting Johnson v. De Grandy, </em>512 U.S. 997, 1005-06, 114 S.Ct. 2647, 129 L.Ed.2d 775 (1994) (alterations in original). \u201cThe essential point is that barred claims are those \u2018complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments.\u2019 \u201d <em>Campbell v. City of Spencer, </em>682 F.3d 1278, 1283 (10th Cir. 2012), <em>quoting Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-14\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-15\">The district court dismissed nine counts because \u201cthe <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>trine precludes ... exercising subject matter jurisdiction over them.\u201d Noting that Kline\u2019s case was a \u201ctextbook example of how the doctrine applies,\u201d the district court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1207-5\">The facts of this case are analogous to those in <em>District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983), one of the seminal cases giving rise to the doctrine. In <em>Feldman, </em>two law school graduates asked the District of Columbia Court of Appeals (\u201cD.C. Court of Appeals\u201d), which governs admission to the District of Columbia bar, to grant them a waiver from a rule requiring bar applicants to have graduated from an accredited law school. <em>Id. </em>at 464, 466, 103 S.Ct. 1303. The D.C. Court of Appeals denied their petitions, and the applicants sued the court and its individual judges in federal district court alleging a violation of their Fifth Amendment right to due process. <em>Id. </em>at 468, 468 n.2, 472, 474 n.10, 103 S.Ct. 1303. The district court dismissed both cases on the grounds that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 470, 473, 103 S.Ct. 1303. The Supreme Court upheld the dismissals, concluding the plaintiffs\u2019 claims that their Constitutional rights had been violated were \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the D.C. Court of Appeals\u2019 decisions denying their petitions. <em>Id. </em>at 486-87, 103 S.Ct. 1303. It noted:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1207-6\">United States District Courts ... have subject matter jurisdiction over general challenges to state bar rules, promulgated by state courts in nonjudicial proceedings, which do not require review of a final state court judgment in a particular case. They do not have jurisdiction, however, over challenges to state court decisions <em>in particular cases arising out of judicial proceedings even if those challenges allege that the state court\u2019s action was unconstitutional. </em>Review of those decisions may be had only in this Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1207-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 486, 103 S.Ct. 1303 (emphasis added). The Supreme Court explained that,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1207-9\">Orders of a state court relating to the admission, <em>discipline, </em>and <em>disbarment </em>of members of its bar may be reviewed only by the Supreme Court of the United States on certiorari to the state court, and not by means of an original action in a lower federal court. The rule serves substantial policy interests arising from the historic relationship between state judicial systems and the members of their respective bars, and between the state and federal judicial systems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1207-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 482 n.16, 103 S.Ct. 1303 (emphasis added) (internal quotation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1207-11\"><em>Kline v. Biles, </em>No. 2:15-CV-09335-DGK, 2016 WL 6680940, at **4-5 (D. Kan. Nov. 14, 2016).</p>\n<p id=\"A7s\">The district court also recognized: \u201cEvery federal appeals court has held that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine precludes an attorney from challenging the result of his or her state disciplinary hearing in a lower federal court, including attacking the process leading to the decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *5, <em>citing Smith v. Bender, </em>350 Fed.Appx. 190, 193-94 (10th Cir. 2009) (holding that <em>Rocker-Feldman </em>barred an unsuccessful state bar applicant from relitigating the refusal of Colorado Supreme Court Justices to recuse from his appeal). This case is no exception. Almost all of Kline\u2019s claims\u2014 that he was injured by the Kansas Supreme Court\u2019s allegedly wrongful judgment \u2014 fall squarely within the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-13\">Kline asserts the doctrine does not foreclose his claims because: (1) he is not seeking appellate review of the disciplinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>judgment; (2) his claims are not \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the disciplinary judgment; and (3) the judgment is \u201cvoid on its face.\u201d The district court carefully analyzed each of these arguments. This court adopts the thorough and well-reasoned analysis as it pertains to counts one, two, and four through nine. The district' court properly ruled it lacked jurisdiction over these counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-5\">The district court ruled the <em>Rook-er-Feldman </em>doctrine required dismissal of count ten. But count ten does not challenge the indefinite suspension; rather it seeks clarification of standards for reipstatement generally. <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>does not justify dismissal of count ten because it does, not apply \u201cwhen the relief sought by the plaintiffs would not reverse or \u2018undo\u2019 the state-court judgment.\u201d <em>See Mo\u2019s Express, LLC v. Sopkin, </em>441 F.3d 1229, 1237 (10th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-6\">Still, the district court did not err in dismissing count ten because it does not present a justiciable case or controversy. <em>See Brady v. UBS Fin. Servs., Inc., </em>538 F.3d 1319, 1327 (10th Cir. 2008) (stating that this court may affirm for any reason supported by the record, even if the reason was not relied on by the district court). \u201cArticle III of the United States Constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to the adjudication of \u2018Cases\u2019 or \u2018Controversies.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jordan v. Sosa, </em>654 F.3d 1012, 1019 (10th Cir. 2011), <em>quoting </em>U.S. Const. art. III, \u00a7 2, cl. 1. \u201c[T]he controversy must be real and substantial, admitting of specific relief through a decree of conclusive character, as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical set of facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1026 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-7\">In count ten, Kline asserts concern about the Kansas Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of Disciplinary Rule 219 \u2014 \u201cReinstatement\u201d \u2014 based on the court\u2019s \u201cfreewheeling application\u201d of KRPC 8.4\u2014 \u201cMaintaining the Integrity of the Profession: Misconduct.\u201d Kline alleges that Rule 219 \u201ccan mean anything\u201d and \u201cprovides no standards for Mr. Kline\u2019s behavior during the period of suspension, provides no standard for evaluating petitions for readmission, and therefore leaves decision-makers with unbridled discretion to grant or deny Mr. Kline\u2019s (or anyone\u2019s) petition for arbitrary reasons.\u201d But the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Kline\u2019s disciplinary case does not interpret Rule 219. The rule would apply only to petitions for reinstatement. His claim is thus based on hypothetical future events, \u201cfar too speculative to support a claim for declaratory relief.\u201d <em>See Columbian Fin. Corp. v. BancInsure, Inc., </em>650 F.3d 1372, 1376 (10th Cir. 2011) (\u201cIt is not the role of federal courts to resolve abstract issues of law.\u201d). The district court did not err in dismissing count ten.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1205-19\">. This statement of facts is based on the district court's order of dismissal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
