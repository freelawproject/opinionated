PARKER, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b99-14\">This appeal considers whether a state court order of protection that prohibited Petitioner-Appellant Emily Vega from contacting the victim of her harassment places her \u201cin custody\u201d within the meaning of the habeas statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. We conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b99-16\">In July 2009, Vega confronted Magdalena Camacho in front of an apartment building in the Bronx and an altercation ensued. Because at the time of this confrontation there was an order of protection in place against Vega directing her to stay away from Camacho, Vega was arrested and charged with criminal contempt in the second degree and harassment in the second degree. Before trial in Bronx County Supreme Court, the criminal contempt charge was reduced to attempted criminal contempt, a misdemeanor, which was tried to the court along with the harassment charge. At the close of the evidence, the court told the parties it would waive closing arguments and that closing memoran-da would not be accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-17\">Vega was convicted on both charges and was sentenced to a one-year conditional discharge, with the condition that she abide by a two-year order of protection. The order of protection required Vega to \u201cstay away from [Camacho] and/or from\u201d Camacho\u2019s home, school, business, and place of employment until September 20, 2012. Appendix (\u201cApp.\u201d) 109. While Camacho did not live at the Bronx apartment where the confrontation occurred, she visited the building every day so that her mother, who lived there, could look after her children. Vega\u2019s mother-in-law also lived in the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-18\">After exhausting state court remedies, Vega filed a petition under \u00a7 2254 seeking habeas relief on the ground that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>court\u2019s denial of an opportunity for defense counsel to make a closing argument violated her Sixth Amendment right to assistance of counsel under <em>Herring v. New York, </em>422 U.S. 853, 95 S.Ct. 2550, 45 L.Ed.2d 593 (1975). Vega contended that although she was not incarcerated at the time she filed her petition, she was still \u201cin custody\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2254(a) because she was subject to an order of protection that imposed a significant restraint on her liberty.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Magistrate Judge Fox recommended that the petition be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, concluding that, for a different, reason than we express here, \u00a7 2254(a)\u2019s custody requirement had not been satisfied. Judge Fox did not address the merits of Vega\u2019s claim. On review of Judge Fox\u2019s recommendation, Judge Gardephe dismissed the petition as moot, concluding that the potential collateral consequences of Vega\u2019s convictions were too speculative to demonstrate the existence of a live case or controversy sufficient to establish Article III standing. The district court granted Vega a certificate of appealability on her Sixth Amendment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of a \u00a7 2254 petition, including whether a petitioner was \u201cin custody\u201d at the time of filing. <em>See Carvajal v. Artus, </em>633 F.3d 95, 104 (2d Cir. 2011). In order for a federal court to have jurisdiction over a habeas petition, the petitioner must be \u201cin custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court\u201d at the time the petition is filed. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a); <em>Maleng v. Cook, </em>490 U.S. 488, 490-91, 109 S.Ct. 1923, 104 L.Ed.2d 540 (1989). The custody requirement may be satisfied by restraints other than \u201cactual, physical custody\u201d incarceration. <em>Jones v. Cunningham, </em>371 U.S. 236, 239-40, 83 S.Ct. 373, 9 L.Ed.2d 285 (1963). A petitioner may satisfy this requirement where she is subject to a significant restraint upon her physical liberty \u201cnot shared by the public generally.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 240, 83 S.Ct. 373. The focus is not so much on actual physical custody, but \u201cthe \u2018severity\u2019 of an actual or potential restraint on liberty.\u201d <em>Poodry v. Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians, </em>85 F.3d 874, 894-95 (2d Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">It is well settled that the custody requirement is \u201cdesigned to preserve the writ of habeas corpus as a remedy for severe restraints on individual liberty.\u201d <em>Hensley v. Mun. Ct., San Jose Milpitas Jud. Dist., </em>411 U.S. 345, 351, 93 S.Ct. 1571, 36 L.Ed.2d 294 (1973). Indeed, even before the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214, the use of habeas corpus was long \u201climited to cases of special urgency, leaving more conventional remedies for cases in which the restraints on liberty are neither severe not immediate.\u201d <em>See id.; see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">Accordingly, we have held that penalties that do not impose a severe restraint on individual liberty or the imminent threat of such a restraint do not satisfy the \u201cin custody\u201d requirement. <em>See, e.g., Kaminski v. U.S., </em>339 F.3d 84, 87-88 (2d Cir. 2003) (holding a restitution order could not be challenged through habeas petition because a monetary fine was not a sufficient restraint on liberty to meet the \u2018in custody\u2019 requirement); <em>Ginsberg v. Abrams, </em>702 F.2d 48, 49 (2d Cir. 1983) (petitioner\u2019s removal from the bench, revocation of his license to practice law, and disqualification as a real estate broker and insurance agent did not satisfy the custody requirement). We believe that the \u201crestriction\u201d on Vega\u2019s liberty is an analogue to ones we have held to be insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Vega, pointing to our recent decision in <em>Nowakowski v. New York, </em>835 F.3d 210 (2d Cir. 2016), argues that her sentence of a one-year conditional discharge in which she was to abide by a two-year order of protection was a sufficiently severe restraint on her liberty for habeas purposes. In that case, we held that a sentence of one year\u2019s conditional discharge, which required the performance of one day of community service within that time, sufficiently restrained Nowakowski\u2019s liberty to satisfy the \u201cin custody\u201d statutory requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">We found it significant that Nowakow-ski\u2019s sentence required his physical presence at particular times and locations both for community service and court appearances. <em>Id. </em>We pointed to cases in which the Supreme Court and other Courts of Appeals \u201cconsidered even restraints on liberty that might appear short in duration or less burdensome than probation or supervised release severe enough because they required petitioners to appear in certain places at certain times ... or exposed them to future adverse consequences on discretion of the supervising court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 216 (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Here, Vega\u2019s sentence does not rise to the same level of restraint as did the sentence in <em>Nowakowski. </em>First, Vega concedes that, unlike in <em>Nowakowski, </em>her sentence never required her physical presence at a particular time or location. Nor was she affirmatively required to do anything such as perform community service. Although she contends that this is a \u201cdistinction without a difference,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 28-29, we disagree. The only restraint on Vega\u2019s freedom was that she stay away from Camacho. This narrow and pinpointed restriction is neither severe nor significant. In fact, at Vega\u2019s trial in 2010, she testified that she had not seen Camacho since 2006, and Camacho testified that she had only encountered Vega \u201ca couple of times\u201d in the previous five years. App. 47. In any event, the restriction is far less intrusive than the restrictions imposed on Nowakowski which required him to be in a particular place at a particular time and perform a specific act under the threat of further penal sanction. <em>See Triestman v. Schneiderman, </em>1:16-CV-01079 (LEK/DEP), 2016 WL 6106467, at *3 (N.D.N.Y. Oct. 19, 2016), <em>appeal filed </em>(Nov. 14, 2016) (No. 16-3831) (\u201c[S]omeone who must appear in court is required to be there at a specified time. She has only one real choice as to how she spends the time allotted for her court appearance, because if she fails to show up, she may face serious consequences. But Triestman can go anywhere he likes at any time so long as he avoids his daughter. The range'of options available to him on a given day is therefore much greater than that open to someone who must appear in court that day.\u201d) By contrast, Vega can go anywhere at any time and do anything she wants as long as she avoids an intentional confrontation with Camacho. We view this \u201crestriction\u201d as modest, not severe.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">Moreover, the order of protection did not expose Vega to future adverse consequences at the discretion of a supervising court as did the order in <em>Nowakowski. </em>Although Vega faced the possibility of some new charge and future sanction if she were to violate the order of protection, we are not convinced that the entirely speculative possibility of a future charge for a future violation is sufficiently severe to place Vega \u201cin custody\u201d for purposes of the habeas statute. If this were enough, every state order of protection could become the subject of federal habeas litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">Vega argues that because Camacho visited the apartment building where Vega\u2019s mother-in-law lived every day to drop off <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>and pick up her children, \u201cit was possible\u201d that Vega would encounter Camacho. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 29. Again, we are not convinced. It is clear to us that an inadvertent encounter with Camacho would not violate the order of protection unless Vega engaged with her or drew attention to Vega\u2019s presence. Under N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 215.50, violation of the order of protection would require the state to establish \u201cintentional disobedience\u201d of the order. Thus, the chance or inadvertent encounter that concerns Vega would not suffice. To place herself in jeopardy, Vega must intentionally confront Camacho. In <em>Holmes v. Satterberg, </em>508 Fed.Appx. 660 (9th Cir. 2013), the Ninth Circuit held that the district court lacked jurisdiction over a habeas petition because \u201c[t]he state court\u2019s order that Holmes \u2018shall have no contact with\u2019 the victims of his harassment did not place a \u2018severe\u2019 and \u2018immediate\u2019 restraint on Holmes\u2019 individual liberty, and thus does not render him \u2018in custody\u2019 for habeas purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 661 (citations omitted). The court rejected the same argument that Vega makes here, holding that the possibility of accidental contact would violate the order was \u201chighly speculative.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Dremann v. Francis, </em>828 F.2d 6, 7 (9th Cir. 1987) (concluding petitioner was not \u201cin custody\u201d where a significant restraint was merely speculative); <em>Triestman, </em>2016 WL 6106467, at *3 (holding that because the petitioner, who was ordered to stay away from his daughter, could coordinate with the mother of his child to ensure that their daughter\u2019s schedule did not overlap with his, he was not sufficiently constrained to rise to the level of being \u201cin custody\u201d). We agree. For these reasons, we conclude that the order of protection does not constitute a significantly severe restraint to satisfy the \u201cin custody\u201d requirement of \u00a7 2254(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
