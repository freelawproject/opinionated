Appeal was then taken to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-32\">Claims 21, 22, and 24 read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-33\">\u201c21. The method of forming a tire mold side piece of laterally hollowed annular mold contour by hot die-pressing in the axial direction a metal blank of substantially less radial dimension of metal than the piece to -be formed, and not substantially of less height, so as to bring the metal to the desired shape by squeezing down and radial displacement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-34\">\u201c22. The method as set forth in claim 21 further characterized in that the blank is externally of smaller diameter than the highest portion of the piece, so that the metal of the blank is displaced radially to form the highest portion of the piece.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-35\">\u201c24. The method of forming a tire mold side piece of laterally hollowed annular mold contour which comprises hot die-pressing in the axial direction a ring of much less radial width than the pieee to be produced, and of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>greater height, between die faces of shapes; appropriate for the sides of the piece, and thus bringing the ring to the desired mold shape at substantially a single operation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">These claims were rejected by the tribunals of the Patent Office as defining nothing patentable over a patent to J. Clark for a process of making clamping-rings for pipe-couplings, being No. 1,060,320, issued April 29,1913. Certain features of the elaims seem also to have been regarded simply as not being inventive, with no particular regard to the reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The examiner, in addition to citing Clark, also rejected the claims on the subject-matter of an interference in which the appellants were at one time involved with a party, Witter, but the board disagreed with the examiner upon the applicability of the Witter reference, and same is not presented before us as a reference. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">A portion of the brief for appellants in the appeal is devoted to alleged \u201cinconsistent and prejudicial action\u201d in the Patent Office relating to the granting of the Clark patent- and the allowances to Witter following the disposition of the interference issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">These contentions do not seem of consequence to the court in so far as determining the question of the patentability of appellants\u2019 claims \u2014 the only issue before us \u2014 is concerned, and it is not deemed necessary to discuss them.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">It is the contention of appellants that Clark does not disclose (a) \u201cthe \u2018forming a tire mold side piece\u201d\u2019; (b) \u201cthe forging of a side piece \u2018of laterally hollowed annular mold- contour\u201d\u2019; (e) \u201cthe forging in the axial direction of a blank which is \u2018not substantially of less height\u2019 than the piece to be formed\u201d; (d) \u201ca forging which.brings the metal \u2018to the desired shape by squeezing down and radial displacement\u2019\u201d; (e) \u201ca \u2018blank\u2019 that is \u2018externally of smaller diameter than the highest portion of the piece\u2019 \u201d; (f) that element in claim 22 comprised in the clause \u201cso that the metal of .the blank is displaced laterally to form the highest portion of the piece.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">All the foregoing features alleged to be lacking in Clark appear (a, b, e, and d) in claim 21 and (e and f) in claim 22 of appellants. Claim 24 seems to include (a), (b), (c), and (d), somewhat altered in phraseology, with the addition to (d) of the phrase \u201cat substantially a single operation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-10\">Features (a) and (b) above quoted, apparently, relate solely to the shape of the article produced and, in themselves, or by themselves, are not regarded as constituting invention, but the other features do disclose a novelty which, unless anticipated by prior art, we regard as patentable.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-12\">' The Clark patent is related to an art which is not analogous to the art of the application, except a\u201cs both may perhaps be processes of forging. The patent is for a process of making metal rings which are used to clamp the couplings of metal pipes; the application covers a process for making molds in which rubber automobile tires are vulcanized.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-13\">Feature (e), as above quoted, requires that applicants\u2019 metal blank shall be \u201cnot substantially of less height\u201d than the piece which it is desired to form.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-14\">In the brief it is urged that this blank, before the forging, is of mueh greater height than the squeezed down mold piece produced after the forging, and the drawings are cited in verification.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-15\">The Clark specification states that in the process of making his rings he takes a bar of steel or wrought iron, preferably rectangular in cross section and of \u201cless dimension in both directions\u201d than the finished ring will be.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-16\">It is therefore insisted that applicants\u2019 blank, \u201cnot substantially of less height than, * * * \u201d is anticipated by Clark\u2019s bar of \u201cless dimension in both directions than. * * *\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b600-20\">It seems to us that applicants might have chosen a more apt expression than \u201cnot substantially of less height,\u201d in describing their blank, if, in fact, it is, as the brief argues, \u201cof mueh greater height.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-21\">Notwithstanding this, however, the specification after setting forth criteria for dies and blank, does recite:</p>\n<p id=\"b600-22\">\u201cWith dies and a blank corresponding to these criteria, the die-pressing operation will cause displacement of the metal of the blank <em>downward </em>toward the base of the flange portion of the piece and radially inward and outward to form the inner and outer portions, * * * and radially, especially, to form the deep flange portion or portions. It is to such formation of the deep flange portions principally by direct radial displacement (rather than by attempting to force the metal to a great height by mere pressure) that the peculiar advantages of our method are largely due. * * * \u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b600-24\">The drawings of the Clark patent, when carefully studied, seem to justify the conclusion that during the forging, the metal is pushed up to a greater height than the orig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>inal height of the ring before forging. The description of operation in the specification does not specifically state as to this, bnt refers to the drawings and figures, from which it seems the deduction of pushing the metal upward is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">As for the first portion of feature (d) (bringing the metal \u201cto the desired shape by squeezing down and radial displacement\u201d), while the Clark specification may be construed to disclose this, in part, it remains true, wo think, that his squeezing operation, in fact, differs from that of the application, at least to the extent that Clark \u201csqueezes down\u201d only around the edges of his blank while appellants\u2019 \u201csqueezing\u201d process operates upon \u201cevery bit of metal\u201d in their blank.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">The second part of feature (d), as enlarged by claim 24, is that of bringing \u201cthe ring to the desired mold shape at substantially a single operation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">The Clark specification says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-8\">\u201cThe compression of the ring blank is conveniently effected by acting upon the blank with die rollers having the required configuration, or I may place the heated ring blank between dies which will operate upon the whole of the blank at once and by compression, as by means of a hydraulic press, or by drop forging, forge it into the desired form.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">The patent thus sets forth that the forging may be by any one of three methods, rollers, press, or hammer. Appellants\u2019 application is limited to die-pressing. We think it proper to consider this particular feature in connection with all the other 'features of the claims, as hereinafter set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">As for the features comprised in (e) and (f) and partly in (d), the board said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-11\">\u201cIn Clark the opening is of less diameter in the blank than^ in the finished article. Whether there is a radial displacement of the metal of the blank to form the highest portion of the ring is not clear but is believed immaterial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-12\">It seems to us that when the particular character of the article which applicants propose to make is fully considered, the matter of radial displacement, as proposed by applicants, is probably of more importance than the board seems to attribute to it. The specification of applicants says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-13\">\u201cThe forming of the tire-mold piece by hot die-pressing has certain special advantages over other methods of producing articles in forged steel. The mechanical work being done on the metal 'en masse,\u2019 so to speak, rather than in detail, there is less likelihood of local overheating, or of-injury by working too cold, or of local overworking. On the other hand, the metal is subjected to a uniformity of pressure and working in the dies that tend to improve its grain and toughness, to compact it, and to correct any lack of homogeneity due to previous treatment that it may have undergone. The thorough and uniform effect of the die-pressing is enhanced, moreover, by the proportions of the annular blank discussed above, since they insure a very general moving about and deformation of nearly every portion of the blank during the pressing operation. The freedom of the hot die-pressed mold piece from internal stresses or strains is all the more important because of the oft-repeated quenchings at vulcanizing temperatures to which it is subjected in subsequent use.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-15\">While this may be somewhat argumentative for a specification, it is within a legitimate range, and we known of no reason why these considerations are not entitled to some weight, if correct, as reason indicates them to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-16\">After careful consideration of the claims, drawings, and specifications of the application and of the patent to Clark, we feel that the tribunals of the Patent Office fell into error in disallowing claims- 21, 22, and 24. While, when dissected, features are found concerning the patentability of which doubt exists in our minds, we are convinced that in certain essentials there is invention not shown to be anticipated by anything presented before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-17\">Applicants have apparently made a valuable contribution to the art of tire production, and we feel that they are entitled to have any doubts resolved in their favor. Application of McClaire, 57 App. D. C. 11, 16 F.(2d) 351; Irwin v. Hasselman (C. C. A.) 97 F. 964; Ex parte Harbeck, 191 O. G. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-18\">In so far as this court can determine from the record before us, appellants succeeded in solving an important problem in the field of automobile and truck tire making. Some of the steps of their process may bo related to some of the steps of the Clark process, but the doctrine as expressed in the syllabus of Truax v. Childs Co. (C. C.) 162 F. 907, seems apropos:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-19\">\u201cDevices and publications leading up to, but not fully accomplishing, a desired end, do not anticipate an invention which for the first time effectively meets all requirements and successfully accomplishes sueh end.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>In Beckwith v. Malleable Iron Range Co., 174 <em>F. 1001, </em>1009, 1010, the United States Circuit Court, E. D. of Wisconsin, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-4\">\u201cIt is elementary that, when it is sought to ascertain the state of the art by means of prior patents, nothing can be used except what is disclosed on the face of those patents. Such patents cannot be reconstructed in the light of the invention in suit and then used as a part of the prior art. Naylor v. Alsop Process Co., 168 F. 911, 920, <em>94 </em>C. C. A. 315.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">A syllabus of Topliff v. Topliff et al., 145 U. S. 156,12 S. Ct. 825, 36 L. Ed. 658, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">\u201cIt is not sufficient, in order to constitute an anticipation of a patented invention, that the device relied upon might, by modification, be made to accomplish the function performed. by that invention, if it were not designed -by its maker, nor adapted, nor actually used for the performance of such function.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">In General Electric Co. v. De Forest Radio Co. (D. C.) 17 F.(2d) 90, 91, the doctrine was stated that: \u00bb</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">\u201cPrior patent, to constitute \u2018anticipation/ must be sufficiently full, clear, and exact to enable persons skilled in art to construct or practice the invention without exercise of further inventive skill or experiment, and description must be sufficient to constitute a specification.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">The disclosures of the Clark patent do not seem to us to teach a method of making the tire mold of the application. They do not suggest any such product. No such product could be made by the Clark process, even by persons skilled in this art, except by modifications so extensive as practically to change the entire character of the operation.. Attention has been already directed to the fact that, upon what applicants designate as a most important element of their claimed invention, there is, apparently, a direct reversal of operation, in that in the patent the metal is pressed upward while in the application it is pressed downward. The results thus obtained are different and intended to be different.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">Claim No. 26 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-11\">\u201c26. A tire mold side piece of laterally hollowed annular mold contour axially hot die-pressed to shape, at substantially a single operation, out of a forged steel blank of substantially less radial dimension of metal than said piece and not substantially of less height, and characterized by corresponding homogeneity and toughness due to the flow of the metal from the aforesaid blank form to mold form in the dies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-13\">This claim for the article was rejected on the Clark reference and also \u201cbecause limited by the method of making it.\u201d We think the rejection on the latter ground was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-14\">In an opinion by Judge Bland, this court, in Re Butler, 37 F.(2d) 623, 17 C. C. P. A. 810, reviewed a number of decisions of other courts bearing upon the question of granting patent for an article when defined solely by the process of its making. In that case, however, invention was not found to exist, but the law, as this court understands it, was there stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-15\">In the case of In re Brown, 58 App. D. C. 285, 29 F.(2d) 873, 874, the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-16\">\u201cIt is a well-settled rule of patent law that claims for a product which is defined by the process of producing it will not be allowed; and the only exception to this rule seems to be in eases where the product' involves invention and cannot be defined except by the process used in its creation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-17\">We do not feel that applicants are within the exception. Furthermore, as pointed out by the examiner in his supplementary state-, ment of November 7, 1928:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-18\">\u201c * * * The structure of applicant\u2019s finished article shown in Fig. 6 does not reveal whether or not the article was die-pressed at substantially a single operation or a plurality of operations. Neither does it reveal whether or not the forged steel blank out of which it was made was \u2018of substantially less radial dimension of metal than said piece and not 'substantially of less height.\u2019 It is not seen how it can'be successfully contended that these two features of applicant\u2019s process appear in the finished product.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-20\">The fact that Clark was granted a patent on his article, described only by the method of producing it, does not convince us that applicants should be granted a similar one on theirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-21\">The decision of the Board of Appeals of the Patent Office is affirmed as to claim 26. As to claims 21, 22, and 24 it is reversed, and patent will issue accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-22\">Modified.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
