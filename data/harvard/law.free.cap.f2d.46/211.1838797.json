The weight of authority is to the effect that the statute makes no effort to set up a right of ownership, or use, whieh the common law does not or may not recognize.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">To the extent that Congress undertook, in the registration act, specifically to define what marks \u201cshall not.be refused registration\u201d and what marks \u201cshall not be registered,\u201d it merely sought to embody in the statute the principles of the common law, largely as the same has been interpreted and applied by the courts throughout the centuries.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">These general recitals of law, believed to be so well known and widely recognized as to require no citation of authority in their support, are here stated because of the apparent necessity of determining in this case whether the courts, in applying the common-law doctrine, have evolved and asserted principles whieh enable applicant to acquire sueh an ownership of the mark in issue as to render such mark eligible for registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-12\">The right of registration is all that we have to determine here. If the registration be granted and any issues arise as to the extent of appellant\u2019s rights, or as to the limits within whieh it may use the mark, such issues must be decided in some other proeeeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-13\">It seems to us that the use of the word \u201cmerely\u201d in the statute is quite significant, and must necessarily be given its proper meaning and weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-14\">Funk and Wagnalls\u2019 Standard Dictionary gives the following definitions of the word:</p>\n<p id=\"b236-15\">\u201cMerely. 1. Without including anything else; purely; only; solely.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-16\">2. Absolutely; wholly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-17\">The word \u201cmere\u201d is defined:</p>\n<p id=\"b236-18\">\u201c1. Sueh (as is mentioned) and no more; nothing but; sheer; simply; as, a <em>mere </em>child. (Italics quoted).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-19\">\u201c2. <em>Law. </em>Executed by specified persons, entirely, unaided.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-20\">\u201c3. Absolute; entire; unqualified;</p>\n<p id=\"b236-21\">\u201c4. Pure; unmixed.\u201d (Italics quoted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b236-22\">The word \u201cmerely,\u201d as it appears in the statute now before us, has received construction where used before the word \u201cdescriptive.\u201d In Hercules Powder Co. v. Newton, 266 F. 169, 172, the United States Circuit Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, said (the issue being the right to register):</p>\n<p id=\"b236-23\">\u201c \u2018Merely descriptive\u2019 means <em>only </em>-descriptive, or <em>nothing more than </em>descriptive. It may be that the force of the adverb is satisfied by the addition to the descriptive word of a picture or device, or by qualifying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>description through the addition of another word. Thus in Re Crosfield, supra (page 143) [this reference being to In re Crosfield (1910) L. R. I Ch. 130], it was suggested that, while appellant could not use the word \u2018Perfection\u2019 as a trade-mark for soap, if he used \u2018Crosfield\u2019s Perfection, different considerations might arise.\u2019 \u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">It is, of course, fundamental in trademark law that a \u201cgeographical name or term, by which is meant a term denoting locality, cannot bo exclusively appropriated as a trade-mark because such a term is generic or descriptive, and any one who can do so truthfully is entitled to use it.\u201d See 15 USCA \u00a7 85, note 22, p. 60, and list of authorities there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">But it is well settled, we think, that a geographic name or term may acquire such a secondary meaning as to remove it from the \u201cgeneric or descriptive\u201d designation which renders it incapable of individual appropriation, and make it subject to rights which equity will, within proper limits, protect. In other words, a geographic name can, and frequently does, acquire a meaning which causes it to become something other than <em>merely </em>geographic, or solely geographic, or only geographic.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">In Katschinski v. Keller et al., 49 Cal. App. 406, 193 P. 587, 589, the second division of the California District Court of Appeal, First District, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-8\">\u201cWhen a geographic name is not used in a geographical sense, but is used in a fictitious sense merely to indicate ownership, independent of location, it may be a good trademark or trade-name. Drake Medicine Co. v. Glossner, 68 Ohio St. 337, 67 N. E. 722, 727; Sanders v. Utt, 16 Mo. App. 322, 326.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">Other holdings bearing upon the question will be found in Phenix Cheese Co. v. Kirp (1917) 176 App. Div. 735, 164 N. Y. S. 71; Havana Commercial Co. v. Nichols (C. C. N. Y. 1907) 155 F. 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">Appellant\u2019s brief cites us to Ex parte Jewell Belting Co., 110 O. G. 309, 1904 C. D. 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">Registration was there sought of the word \u201cGibraltar\u201d as a trade-mark for belting. The Examiner refused it, on the ground that the word was geographical. The Commissioner of Patents reversed the decision of the Examiner, saying, among other things:</p>\n<p id=\"b237-12\">\u201cI am unable to agree with the conclusion that the effective significance of the word would be geographical if it were used as a mark upon goods such as belting. It undoubtedly has a geographical meaning; but when seen upon goods one of the essential characteristics of which is strength it is believed that the arbitrary meaning of the word would so far transcend its geographical meaning in the mind of the ordinary purchaser as to render the geographical meaning of comparative insignificance. It is not believed that purchasers would suppose that the goods were manufactured at Gibraltar. They are, in fact, manufactured by the appellant at Hartford, Conn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-14\">The applicant in the instant case is not located at Plymouth, but in the city of Detroit, Mich. There is no reason to suppose that the word has any location significance as used by it. It is proposed to register the word, not alone, but in combination with \u201cChrysler,\u201d and a drawing of a sea-going vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-15\">We think the notation, as a whole, comprises a designation, not merely geographic, and that appellant is entitled to the registration sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-16\">In reaching this conclusion, we have not given very great weight to the argument based upon the numerous prior registrations of the word \u201cPlymouth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-17\">A large number of these marks, if not all, were registered under the ten-year clause of the registration statute, and, as the Commissioner correctly said, \u201cin consequence, escape the bar of the statute against merely geographical marks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-18\">We think the decision may properly rest upon the fact that, by using the adverb \u201cmerely,\u201d Congress intended to, and did, follow the common-law principle that there are circumstances under which a geographic name, or term, may come to have a meaning other than one merely geographic, and that, where such is true, the word, so recognized or recognizable, at common law, should not be excluded from registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-19\">Such a meaning may grow up around a word when that word is used alone. We think that is true, to a certain extent, of the word \u201cPlymouth.\u201d But this case does not need to rest upon this alone, because appellant presents a notation which comprises another word and a figure to be used in connection with \u201cPlymouth,\u201d so that the combination quite clearly, it seems to us, constitutes a mark carrying no merely geographical significance, as appellant uses it. The geographical feature is, at least, made so remote as that we cannot agree that the mark is merely geographic.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>Appellant will be granted the registration as sought, and to this end the decision of the Commissioner is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">GRAHAM, Presiding Judge, concurs in the conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">LENROOT, Associate Judge, dissents.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b236-24\"> It has been suggested that, by the enactment of the ten-year clause of section 5 (15 USCA \u00a7 85), the Congress may have made eligible for registration some marks which the common law might not recognize or uphold. See expressions in Hercules Powder Co. v. Newton (C. C. A.) 266 F. 169, 171. That phase of the statute is not here involved. An interesting discussion is found in Scandinavia Belting Co. v. Asbestos <em>&amp; </em>Rubber Works of America (C. C. A.) 257 F. 937. -</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
