He gave to the appellant Groesbeck, a real estate dealer in Cincinnati, an option to buy this vacant lot, upon various terms and conditions as specified. One of these was that Hogan would \u201creserve the right to inspect and approve the plans of any building that is to be erected upon said lot, it being understood and agreed that said property may be used for an oil and gas filling station. If [Hogan] does not approve the plans then the acceptance of this option shall be void and the deposit be returned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AxA\">Groesbeck negotiated a lease to an oil company, and this provided that the lessee should erect a filling station according to certain plans. Pursuant to the understanding of the parties, these plans were submitted by the oil company to Groesbeck and by him to Hogan. They showed a metal building, and Hogan objected because he wanted it to be of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>brick,. and to be in general style and appearance like a nearby oil \u25a0 station, which he thought. a more desirable structure.' No agreement being reached upon this subject, Hogan considered the condition of the option not performed, and refused to convey. 'This action was brought to recover the optionee\u2019s damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">.Plaintiffs\u2019 position was that Hogan had no right to. demand satisfaction as to the appearance or materials of the structure, that he reserved no approval except as to the \u201cplans,\u201d and that his rightful scrutiny pertained only to such\" plans as showed dimensions and ground location; hence that his refusal to approve .the submitted plans upon the ground that he did not like the appearance or materials was merely arbitrary, and could not justify his refusal to convey.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">\u2019 We think Hogan \u00a1was right in his inter- ' pretation of the contract. Where building contracts refer, as they commonly do, to \u201cplans and specifications,\u201d it is logical, and may be neeess'ary, to differentiate between the two, and to say that the matter of' materials, and to soipe .extent the matter of appearance, must be classified as pertaining to \u201cspecifications\u201d rather than \u201cplans.\u201d Hartley-Zeigler Co. v. Bacon, 251 Pa. 87, 96 A. 257; Jenney v. Des Moines, 103 Iowa, 347, 72 N. W. 550; Nave v. McGrane, 19 Idaho, 111, 113 P. 82. We find no judicial definitions of \u201cplans,\u201d in any environment like this. Hogan was not particularly concerned with the ground plans of the building. It is plain, we think, that his natural concern would be with its appearance. He wished that this appearance detract' as little as possible from the value -of- his nearby property, and his satisfaction' with his home. In common use, when not associated in contract with \u201cspecifications,\u201d we -think the Word \u201cplans\u201d fairly refers to the whole subject-which in a building contract would be-eovered by \u201cplans and specifications\u201d; \u2022 that is, \u201ca! method of action, procedure, or arrangement.\u201d Noice v. Schnell, 101 N. J.Eq. 252, 269, 137 A. 582, 589, 50 A. L. R. 965. The owner who asked an-architect for tentative'plans for a new home would be surprised-to get no -elevation, nor -any information as'-to the proposed materials. 'Doubtless \u201cplans\u201d so used \u25a0 by itself W.ould have a rhuch.more -vague' and general interpretation: than that usually implied by \u201cspecifications\u201d; -but we have-no. .doubt that it -fairly covers the matter of brick walls in* st\u00e9ad of metal walls upon -a structure the appearance df -which would \u00a1materially; affect plaintiff\u2019s Adjoining .property,, and that it was intended to be.so used in this ease. .. .</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">If there were otherwise doubt about this, it would be made clear by the conduct of the parties. They knew what they meant by the word. For the purpose of getting Hogan\u2019s approval under this contract, the oil company prepared \u201cplans\u201d and Groesbeek submitted them to Hogan. They showed the materials, and upon them Hogan based his rejection. Groesbeek and associates did not then claim that Hogan had reserved no right to approve materials and appearance. They endeavored to satisfy him in another way.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">Reaching this conclusion, it becomes unnecessary to consider the other questions argued.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">Upon the ground stated, the judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
