The court below found that the patent was lacking in novelty, and dismissed the complaint, saying:</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\"><em>\u201cThe </em>law seems to be settled that a mere imitation of a well-known article is not patentable unless there is novelty in the means by which- the imitation is carried out, and then the question of infringement hinges on the infringement of the means and not the result.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">This conclusion is fully supported by the authorities cited: Union Paper Collar Co. v. Van Deusen, 10 Blatchf. 109, Fed. Cas. No. 14395, affirmed 23 Wall. 530, 23 L. Ed. 128; Simplex Lithograph v. Renfrew (C. C. A.) 250 F. 863; Harmon Paper v. Prager (C. C. A.) 287 F. 841; Scott &amp; Williams v. Aristo Hosiery Co. (C. C. A.) 7 F.(2d) 1003.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">The decree is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
