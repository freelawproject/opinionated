In eases of this character, and also in patent cases, a preliminary injunction will not ordinarily issue unless the plaintiff\u2019s showing is exceptionally clear. Where there is serious dispute, on material matters, it is usually wise to withhold the restraining power until the issues have been tried out on final hearing. In this ease, it appears by the bill of eomplaint that the complainant, a New Jersey corporation, is engaged in making and selling extracts and malt beverages under the trade-name \u201cCanadian\u201d and \u201cCanadian Club\u201d and that these trade-marks came from one William Ireland and his successor, William Ireland, Incorporated, a Massachusetts corporation, and Canadian Extract Company, which was later named \u201cCanadian Club Corporation,\u201d also a corporation of Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-25\">On December 23, 1929, all assets of this corporation, including good will and trademarks, were transferred to the Canadian Club Corporation, a corporation of New Jersey, the complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-26\">The bill further alleges that the defendant, since February, 1926, has been manufacturing extracts and carbonated beverages, including ginger ale, marketed under the name, \u201cCanada Dry,\u201d and that these words are deceptively similar to complainant\u2019s trade-marks \u201cCanadian\u201d and \u201cCanadian Club.\u201d It therefore prays for an injunction restraining the use of those words as an infringement of its trade-mark \u201cCanadian Club.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b988-27\">Most of the allegations of the bill are denied by the defendant. In addition, it is averred that \u201cCanadian Club Beverage Corporation\u201d brought suit against the \u201cCanadian Club Corporation\u201d in the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, to restrain it from using the trade-mark \u201cCanadian Club,\u201d on carbonated beverages; that this suit resulted in a decree on December 3, 1929, of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts (168 N. E. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>106), adjudging the complainant therein to be the owner of the trade-mark \u201cCanadian Club,\u201d in respect to carbonated beverages, and restraining the latter from using, or licensing others to use, the said names on such products. Respondent further alleging that it succeeded to the business and rights of tho \u201cCanadian Club Beverage Corporation,\u201d including the good will and trade-mark \u201cCanadian Club\u201d in respect to carbonated beverages, prayed for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">It is not controverted that the defendant in this action, while not formally a party to the ease in Massachusetts, in fact conducted that proceeding through its counsel as appears there of record, and upon the conclusion of the suit, on December 3, 1929, purchased the entire business, assets, and good will, and trade-mark \u201cCanadian Club,\u201d from the \u201cCanadian Club Beverage Corporation,\u201d the successful party in that ease. The defendant here thus claims to own the trademark \u201cCanadian Club,\u201d as applied to carbonated beverages, and continues to use it.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">If it be true, as defendant claims, the complainant\u2019s predecessor, from whom it claims title, has no ownership or interest in the trade-mark, \u201cCanadian Club,\u201d which is the subject-matter of the bill, the granting of a preliminary injunction was entirely proper. The decree of tho court as entered in the Massachusetts ease was in these words:</p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">\u201cOrdered, Adjudged and Decreed as follows; to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-8\">\u201c1. That the decree entered in this cause on February 25, 1929, dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s bill, be, and it hereby is, vacated and reversed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-9\">\u201c2. That a permanent injunction issue forthwith perpetually restraining the defendant corporation, its officers, employees, agents and servants, from using tho name \u2018Canadian Club,\u2019 in the manufacture and sale of carbonated beverages, and also from licensing other persons to use this name in connection with tho manufacture and sale of such beverages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b989-10\">On the face of the decree, which seems to be in harmony with the opinion of the court rendered in the ease, it appears to have been judicially determined that complainant\u2019s predecessor, from whom it claims title, had no ownership or interest in the trademark \u201cCanadian Club\u201d; and that such predecessor was perpetually enjoined from the use of that trade-name in the manufacture and sale of carbonated beverages. The court\u2019s preliminary injunction, therefore, based on that adjudication, has thp prima facies of the ease in its support. This injunction preserves the status between the parties and those in privity with them, under the decision of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. On final hearing, the complainant will have full opportunity to present such facts, or advance such interpretation of the decree of the Massachusetts court, as it may deem sufficient to sustain its biU.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-12\">The decree granting a preliminary injunction is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
