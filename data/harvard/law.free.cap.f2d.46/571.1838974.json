In order that the wheels may not slip and that the vehicle may have traction, applicant\u2019s device is so constructed that projecting flanges on each side of the tire of the wheel come in contact with the road when the wheels stand at an angle. The rim, bolts, nuts, and tire are so arranged as to provide a means which the applicant claims will prevent skidding.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The claims were rejected upon the following references: Reid, 623,034, April 11, 1899; Neill and others, 683,220, September 24, 1901; Bosworth, 1,043,061, November 5, 1912; Gray, 1,240,337, September 18, 1917; Dawson, 1,487,920, March 25, 1924; Hutchinson (Fr. Add.), 8,014, of 1907; Cann (French), 389,296, of 1908.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">We have carefully examined the references and the opinions of the tribunals below, and have considered the.argument of counsel on both sides, and agree with the Board of Appeals that applicant has disclosed nothing patentable over the prior art cited, and the decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
