It is merely an imitation of a well-' known article. It consists of an ordinary sawed shingle enlarged with a part of one side fluted or waved in such a manner that it simulate or imitates the natural appearance of the common split shake, which is made by splitting a piece of timber longitudinally, leaving the surface fluted or waved according to the grain or fibre of the wood.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">The law seems to he settled that a mere imitation of a well-known article is not patentable unless there is novelty in the means by which the imitation is carried out, and then the question of infringement hinges on the infringement of the means and not the result. .

A.) 287 F. 841; Scott <em>&amp; </em>Williams v. Aristo Hosiery Co. (C. C. A.) 7 F.(2d) 1003.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">It follows therefore that the plaintiff\u2019s patent, is without novelty and the bill should be dismissed, and it is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
