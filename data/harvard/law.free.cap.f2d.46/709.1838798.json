A. Gamble and William E. Armstrong \u00abon May 26, 1910, the title and the right to \u25a0use the trade-mark were vested in the assignees of record when each of the parties adopted and first used the mark, and that therefore neither could claim priority. In this connection, he said:</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\"><em>\u201cIt </em>appears, therefore, that when the parties to this interference adopted and appropriated the said mark, they were trespassers and neither could claim priority on the abandonment of the mark by the legal owners thereof, assuming the mark to have been abandoned by said owners. As was stated by the Court of Appeals, D. C., in Justin Seubert, Incorporated v. A. Santaella &amp; Co., 166 ,O. G. 987, 36 App. D. C. 447,1911 C. D. 341:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-5\"><em>\u201c \u2018If </em>two or more persons are using the mark at the time of abandonment, with or without knowledge of its prior use, neither would be prior to the other in point of time, since no one could in any event date priority of use beyond the time when the prior owner surrendered title by the act of abandonment.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Thereafter, on February 26, 1929, counsel for appellant, McFarland, formally notified the Commissioner of Patents that a letter had \u00a1been received from the registrant, Flora Ely Sehmauser, stating that she had not used the registered mark since 1909; that the assignment of her title and right to use the mark was invalid; and that therefore registration <em>No. </em>62,211 ought not to be considered as a bar to the registration of the mark by appellant. It was also stated, by counsel for appellant, that, if the showing made by counsel was deemed by the Commissioner of Patents to be insufficient, appellant should be given an opportunity to submit further evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">The letter from the registrant, Flora Ely Sehmauser, referred to by counsel, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-8\">\u201c2/18/29.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-9\">\u201cMr. B. F. Garvey, Washington, D. C.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-10\">\u201cDear Sir: Tour letter of inquiry was forwarded to me in reply will say I have not used the word \u2018Red Caps\u2019 in years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-11\">\u201cSince 1909 and probably a year or two before that date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-12\">\u201cAs for Dr. Gamble and Armstrong I cannot say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-13\">\u201cHope this will be of some assistance to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-14\">\u201cI am,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-15\">\u201cVery truly,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-16\">\u201cMrs. Flora E. Sehmauser,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-17\">\u201c202 Market Ave. So., Canton, Ohio.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-18\">Thereupon, on March 2, 1929, the Commissioner of Patents set aside his former decision and granted the parties to the interference a period of forty days within which evidence of abandonment of said registered mark might be submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-19\">On April 12, 1929, counsel for appellant filed an affidavit of the registrant, Flora E. Sehmauser, and the cause was again submitted to the Commissioner. The pertinent part of the affidavit reads as f ollows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-20\">\u201cFlora E. Sehmauser, of 202 Market Avenue, South, Canton, Ohio, being duly sworn, deposes and says that she is the registrant of trade-mark registration No. 62,211, on trade-mark \u2018Red-Caps\u2019 registered April 23rd, 1907; that use of this trade-mark was voluntarily abandoned by her in or about the year 1909 and has never been used by her since that date; that she is not aware that the mark has been used by others subsequent to her abandonment of the same; and that she has no interest whatsoever in the controversy now pending in the U. S. Patent Office, captioned Trade-Mark Interference No. 1112, Eugene J. Murphy Company v. Walter C. Bender v. Chas. A. McFarland; and that she is not acquainted with any of the parties thereto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-21\">\u201cFlora E. Sehmauser.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-22\">Thereafter, on April 23, 1929, the Commissioner reconsidered the evidence in the ease and held that the testimony submitted originally by appellee was sufficient to establish adoption and. use of the involved trademark for medicinal preparations prior to appellant\u2019s filing date. He held, however, that the evidence was not sufficient to establish that the registrant, Flora Ely Sehmauser, had abandoned the use of the trade-mark pri- or to the date of her assignment of her title and right to use the same to Gamble and Armstrong ; that the registration of the mark and the assignment thereof by the registrant was prima facie evidence of ownership by the assignees, Gamble and Armstrong; and that, as it appeared that each of the parties to the interference had attempted to adopt, appropriate, and use the mark on goods of the same descriptive properties during its ownership by Gamble and Armstrong, neither of them was entitled to register it.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-23\">Counsel for each of the parties are here contending that the letter and affidavit of the registrant, Flora Ely Sehmauser, are sufficient to establish that she had voluntarily abandoned the trade-mark prior to her assignment of the same to her assignees; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>the assignment hy the registrant was invalid; and that therefore neither the registration nor the assignment thereof hy the registrant is a legal bar to the registration of the mark. Accordingly, it is agreed by counsel for the involved parties that the question of priority is the only issue that this court need consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">It is conceded by counsel for the parties that, if the evidence in the record is insufficient to establish that the registrant, Flora Ely Sehmauser, voluntarily abandoned her registered trade-mark prior to her assignment of the same to her assignees, Gamble. and Armstrong, neither of the parties is entitled to have the mark registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">It appears from the record that the attention of counsel for the parties was directed to registration No. 62,211 several years before the Commissioner rendered his original decision; that, at the request of counsel for appellant, the Commissioner set aside his original decision and granted the parties a period of forty, days in which to establish that the registrant had voluntarily abandoned the involved trade-mark prior to ber assignment of the same; that the only evidence submitted by counsel consists of a letter from the registrant in which she said that she had not used the trade-mark \u201csince 1909, and probably a year or two before that date. As for Dr. Gamble and Armstrong, I cannot say,\u201d and an affidavit signed by the registrant in which it was stated \u201cthat use of this trade-mark was voluntarily abandoned by her in or about the year 1909, and has never been used by her since that time; and that she is not aware that the mark has been used by others subsequent to her abandonment of the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">We are of opinion that the statement contained in the registrant\u2019s letter and affidavit are not sufficient to establish that she abandoned the registered trade-mark prior to her assignment of the same. It is true that she said she had voluntarily abandoned it about the year 1909. However, it appears that, for a valuable consideration, she assigned her right and title to the same on May 26, 1910. This circumstance is not explained by the registrant, nor did she refer to it in either her letter or her affidavit of record, although counsel for the parties knew, or should have known, that her assignment was a vital factor in the ease. If the registrant had ceased to use the mark and had abandoned it in 1909, but, nevertheless, had assigned it, or attempted to assign it, in May, 1910, those facts should have clearly appeared from 'the evidence. What counsel asks this court to infer, they should have proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">The registration of a trade-mark is prima facie evidence of ownership, and abandonment ought not to be presumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">We do not mean to be understood as holding that abandonment of a registered trademark may properly be raised in a proceeding of this character. Due to our views of the evidence, it is unnecessary to decide this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">In view of the fact that the registrant\u2019s assignees, R. A. Gamble and William E. Armstrong, were presumptively, at least, the owners of the involved trade-mark when each of the parties attempted to adopt and use it, we are unable to hold that either is prior to the other in its adoption and use, since neither could establish adoption and the right to use it during its ownership by the registrant\u2019s assignees. Seubert v. Santaella &amp; Co., 36 App. D. C. 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-11\">For the reasons stated, the decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
