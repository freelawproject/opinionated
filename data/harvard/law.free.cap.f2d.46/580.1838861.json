Accordingly, it was incumbent upon appellee to establish adoption and continuous use of the trade-mark \u201cLoeklath\u201d on its goods prior to June, 1925.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-26\">Each of the tribunals of the Patent Office discussed the evidence somewhat in detail, and each held that appellee had used the trade-mark \u201cLoeklath\u201d on its goods for many years prior to June, 1925; \u2019that the goods of the parties possessed the same descriptive properties; ' that appellant\u2019s mark \u201cRoeklath\u201d closely simulated appellee\u2019s mark \u201cLoeklath\u201d; that the registration of appellant\u2019s mark would be likely to cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the public and deceive purchasers; and that appellant was not entitled to have its mark registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-27\">Although counsel for appellant has advanced in this court many reasons why, in his opinion, the decision of the commissioner should be reversed, his main contention is that, when appellee filed an application for registration of its mark \u201cLoeklath\u201d on June 10, 1926, it forwarded with its application a label which had been used on samples, but not on goods sold in interstate commerce; and that appellee was guilty of a material false representation in the filing of its application, and therefore is not in a position to urge its opposition to the registration by appellant of its trade-mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-28\">This matter was presented on the hearing before the Examiner of Interferences, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>again on a motion for a rehearing. The same question was presented to the Commissioner of Patents on both the hearing and an application for a rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">If the label filed with appellant\u2019s application was not precisely in the form of the trade-mark actually used by appellant, that fact does not clearly appear from the record. In any event, there is no indication from the evidence that appellee misrepresented or had any intention of misrepresenting the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Counsel for appellant has cited, in support of his argument, several eases holding, in substance, that, in order to establish his right to protection in a trade-mark opposition proceeding, the opposer must come into court with clean hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">In view of our conclusions hereinbefore stated, it is unnecessary to discuss these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">We are of opinion that appellee has established that it used its trade-mark \u201cLock-lath\u201d continuously since long prior to the adoption and use by appellant of the mark' \u201cRoeklath\u201d; that the goods of the parties possess the same descriptive properties; that the marks are confusingly similar; and that appellee would be damaged by the registration of- appellant\u2019s alleged trade-mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">Accordingly, the decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
