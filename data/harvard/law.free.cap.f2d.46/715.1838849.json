Rehearing was granted, and the case-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>was reargued on January 8,1931. The court has reconsidered the case, and concludes that, since claims 14,15, and 17, on account of said withdrawal in the brief of. appellant, were not considered as being before us for argument by the parties, they should not have been passed upon by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">Claims 14,15, and 17 are now regarded as not being before us on appeal. Claim 16 was never withdrawn. Claims 22, 23, and 24 having been withdrawn by reason of the suggestion of the court at the time of argument, the appellant, upon rehearing, requested that he be permitted to withdraw his withdrawal of the same. In view of these facts and the fact that claims 22, 23, and 24 were fully discussed by both sides, we shall regard them as having been before us for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Our decision is therefore modified, and the decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed as to claims 11,12,13, 18,19, 20, 21, <em>25, </em>and 26, and reversed as to claims 16, 2-2, 23, and 24, and the appeal is dismissed as to claims 14, 15, and 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Modified.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
