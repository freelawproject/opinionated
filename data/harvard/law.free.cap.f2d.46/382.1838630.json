A storage battery comprising a container and a component assembly ofi electrodes and separators, the electrodes comprising a reticulated grid and- an active material, of insufficient density to be self-retaining during the action of the battery, on the grid; the separators being pervious to electrolyte but substantially impervious to the active material and of a material which will expand when electrolyte is added whereby the assembly is placed under pressure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-19\">\u201c6. A storage battery comprising a container and a component assembly of electrodes and separators, the electrodes comprising a frame and a grid, the grid being of less thickness than the frame, an active material on the grid and flush with the frame, said active material being of insufficient density to be self-retaining during the action of the battery; the separators being pervious to the electrolyte but substantially impervious to the active material' and of a material which will expand when electrolyte is added whereby the assembly is placed under pressure.\u201d '</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-21\">The claims were rejected upon the following references: Usher, 509,271, November 21, 1893; Hutchinson, 1,159,035, November 2,1915; Cogan, British, 9048, May 20,1891; Pumpelly et al., British, 19,883, December 10, 1889.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-22\">The Cogan and Hutchinson patents are cited merely .to show the specific form of grid in appellant\u2019s claim 6, and it is virtually conceded that they do so, but appellant states that \u201cthis feature is merely a detail of claim 6.\u201d His claim is for the combination of the elements recited in Nos. 5 and 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-23\">If we disregard the grid -feature, claims 5 and 6 are practically identical, and Pumpelly and Usher are relied upon as the primary references against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-24\">In the brief in behalf of appellant it is said: \u201cBriefly, the combination in its essential details comprises a container 1, which the specification states \u2018should be of sufficient strength to withstand considerable outward force\u2019 for reasons hereinafter pointed out; electrodes 2 and 3 having highly porous non-coherent active material of insufficient density to be self-retaining in the grid during the action of the battery; and separators 4 capable of expanding when the electrolyte is added to the battery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-25\">And the brief then points out claimed advantages, and says: \u201cThe separators are of selected material having the property of expanding when the electrolyte of the battery is- introduced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-26\">The specification says: \u201cThe separators used in the present invention are preferably formed of woven or unwoven fibrous material impregnated and aggregated by a suitable bending agent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-27\">The claims, however, do not claim any specific material but say \u201cof a material which will expand when electrolyte is added whereby the assembly is placed under pressure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-28\">The Board of Appeals points out that in Pumpelly, while. \u201cperhaps the pressure be;tween the assembled parts is not materially increased by the swelling of the separators,\u201d still, since the separators hold the active material in place, \u201cthere is the neeessary pressure for this purpose between the separators and the plates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-29\">Usher states that he may use separators of wood, earthenware, or an equivalent substance, and the board says \u201cexpansive action is necessarily inherent\u201d in such wooden separators.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Both Hutchinson and Cogan teach the use of active material on the grid, \u201cflush with the frame.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">Careful study of appellant\u2019s application has been made by us in the light of the prior art cited, and we fail to see where, by his combination of elements disclosed in this pri- or art, and such substitutions as he suggests, he has produced an article possessing the qualities of novelty essential to entitle him to patent upon the claims made, although he may have made useful improvements. Patentable novelty \u2014 invention\u2014is lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
