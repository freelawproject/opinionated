White, appeals from a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas dismissing a claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy that he asserted against defendants-appellees, Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company (\u201cSears\u201d), Ken Smith, Tony Bonfiglio, and Gloria Alston. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">{\u00b6 2} On May 17, 2004, White filed suit against appellees asserting claims for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy, breach of contract, and unjust enrichment. All of White\u2019s claims stemmed from the termination of his employment with Sears.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">{\u00b6 3} In his complaint, White alleged that Sears originally hired him as a stocking employee on May 20, 1986. White then worked for Sears in different capacities before Sears promoted him to the position of ASM Operations/Human Resources Manager for the Westland store in 2001 or 2002. As an ASM Operations/Human Resources Manager, White\u2019s responsibilities included reviewing employees\u2019 time records and assuring that those records were accurate. According to White, Sears managers routinely altered employees\u2019 time records if they were inaccurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">{\u00b6 4} In September 2003, one of the employees of the Westland store punched a time card indicating that he had worked until 10:15 p.m., even though that employee had actually stopped working at 10:00 p.m. Another Sears employee altered that employee\u2019s time card to reflect the 10:00 p.m. stopping time.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">{\u00b6 5} In late 2003, White was asked if he had altered the disputed time card and he replied that he could not remember doing so. On December 31, 2003, Sears fired White for altering the time card.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">{\u00b6 6} Rather than answering White\u2019s complaint, appellees filed motions to dismiss it pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6). In part, appellees argued that White failed to plead sufficient facts to establish a claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy. On September 2, 2004, the trial court issued a decision in which it agreed with appellees and dismissed White\u2019s claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy. The trial court held that White\u2019s claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy failed because he did not establish the first element of the claim \u2014 the existence of a clear public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">{\u00b6 7} On September 27, 2004, the trial court reduced to judgment its September 2, 2004 decision. On November 22, 2004, the trial court issued a second judgment entry dismissing White\u2019s claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy and, unlike the first judgment entry, finding that there was no just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>cause to delay an immediate appeal. White now appeals from the November 22, 2004 judgment entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">{\u00b6 8} On appeal, White assigns the following errors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-5\">1. The Trial Court erred when it dismissed plaintiffs claim for wrongful discharge in violation of Ohio public policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\">2. The Trial Court erred when it ruled that Ohio does not recognize any clear public policy in favor of requiring employers to maintain accurate employee time records.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-7\">3. The Trial Court erred by confusing the \u201cclarity\u201d and \u201cjeopardy\u201d elements of a public policy wrongful discharge claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-8\">4. The Trial Court erred in its conclusion that terminating Mr. White under the circumstances alleged in his Complaint would not jeopardize public policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">{\u00b6 9} Appellate review of a judgment granting a Civ.R. 12(B)(6). motion to dismiss is de novo. <em>Perrysburg Twp. v. Rossford, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 79, 2004-Ohio-4362, 814 N.E.2d 44, at \u00b6 5. When reviewing such a judgment, an appellate court must accept the material allegations of the complaint as true and make all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff. <em>Maitland v. Ford Motor Co., </em>103 Ohio St.3d 463, 2004-Ohio-5717, 816 N.E.2d 1061, at \u00b6 11. For a defendant to prevail on a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion, it must appear beyond doubt from the complaint that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts entitling him to relief. <em>Cincinnati v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 416, 2002-Ohio-2480, 768 N.E.2d 1136, at \u00b6 5; <em>Desenco, Inc. v. Akron </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 535, 538, 706 N.E.2d 323, quoting <em>Vail v. Plain Dealer Publishing Co. </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 279, 280, 649 N.E.2d 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">{\u00b6 10} By his first assignment of error, White first argues that because he had asserted that there was a clear public policy, the trial court erred in dismissing his claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">{\u00b6 11} Traditionally, an employer could terminate the employment of any at-will employee for any cause, at any time whatsoever, even if the termination was done in gross or reckless disregard of the employee\u2019s rights. <em>Phung v. Waste Mgt., Inc. </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 100, 102, 23 OBR 260, 491 N.E.2d 1114. However, in <em>Greeley v. Miami Valley Maintenance Contrs., Inc. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 228, 551 N.E.2d 981, paragraphs one and two of the syllabus, the Supreme Court of Ohio recognized an exception to the employer\u2019s plenary right to terminate his employee\u2019s employment: an employer may not discharge an employee in violation of public policy. If an employer does so, the discharged employee can bring a cause of action in tort against the employer. Id. at paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>{\u00b6 12} To assert a viable claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy, a plaintiff must establish each of the following four elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-5\">\u201c1. That a clear public policy existed and was manifested in a state or federal constitution, statute or administrative regulation, or in the common law (the <em>clarity </em>element).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">\u201c2. That dismissing employees under circumstances like those involved in the plaintiffs dismissal would jeopardize the public policy (the <em>jeopardy </em>element).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-7\">\u201c3. The plaintiffs dismissal was motivated by conduct related to the public policy (the <em>causation </em>element).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-8\">\u201c4. The employer lacked overriding legitimate business justification for the dismissal (the <em>overriding justification </em>element).\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-9\">(Emphasis sic.) <em>Kulch v. Structural Fibers, Inc. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 134, 151, 677 N.E.2d 308, quoting H. Perritt, The Future of Wrongful Dismissal Claims: Where Does Employer Self Interest Lie? (1989), 58 U.Cin.L.Rev. 397, 398-399. Of these four elements, the first two (the clarity and jeopardy elements) are questions of law to be decided by the court. <em>Collins v. Rizkana </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 65, 70, 652 N.E.2d 653. The last two (the causation and overriding justification elements) are questions of fact to be decided by a jury. Id.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">{\u00b6 13} When determining whether a clear public policy exists, a court must consider both state and federal law, including the Ohio and federal Constitutions, statutes, administrative regulations, and common law. <em>Kulch, </em>supra, 78 Ohio St.3d at 152, 677 N.E.2d 308. Although a specific statute does not have to be violated in order for a claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy to arise, \u201can exception to the traditional doctrine of employment-at-will should be recognized only where the public policy alleged to have been violated is of equally serious import as the violation of a statute.\u201d <em>Painter v. Graley </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 377, 384, 639 N.E.2d 51, citing <em>Greeley, </em>supra, 49 Ohio St.3d at 234, 551 N.E.2d 981.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">{\u00b6 14} In his complaint, White alleged that there is a clear public policy requiring employers to maintain accurate employee time records. The trial court, however, did not review federal and state law to analyze whether the public policy that White articulated existed. Rather, the trial court accepted appellees\u2019 alternative characterization of the public policy at issue, and considered only whether appellees\u2019 version of the public policy was manifested in state or federal law. This was error. In resolving a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion, a court is confined to the averments contained in the complaint. <em>Bell v. Horton </em>(1995), 107 Ohio App.3d 824, 826, 669 N.E.2d 546. Thus, the trial court was required to determine whether the clear public policy as articulated in the complaint, not in appellees\u2019 motions, was apparent in state or federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>{\u00b6 15} To prove the existence of a clear public policy requiring the maintenance of accurate employee time records, White cites the Ohio Minimum Wage Standards Act (\u201cMWSA\u201d), R.C. Chapter 4111 et seq., and the Fair Labor Standards Act (\u201cFLSA\u201d), Section 201 et seq., Title 29, U.S.Code. Both the MWSA and the FLSA require employers to make and keep employee time records. According to R.C. 4111.08, \u201c[e]very employer * * * shall make and keep for a period of not less than three years a record of the name, address, and occupation of each of the employer\u2019s employees, the rate of pay and the amount paid each pay period to each employee, the hours worked each day and each work week by the employee * * Likewise, according to Section 211(c), Title 29, U.S.Code, \u201c[e]very employer * * * shall make, keep, and preserve such records of the persons employed by him and of the wages, hours, and other conditions and practices of employment maintained by him * * Section 211(c), Title 29, U.S.Code is implemented by Section 516.2, Title 29, C.F.R., which lists the exact type of information an employer must maintain, including \u201c[hjours worked each workday and total hours worked each workweek.\u201d Section 516.2(a)(7), Title 29, C.F.R.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">{\u00b6 16} Although neither the state nor federal codified law specifically states that employee records must be \u201caccurate,\u201d R.C. 4111.13(A) prohibits an employer from falsifying employee records. Similarly, Section 215(a)(5), Title 29, U.S.Code prohibits an employer from making any employee record \u201cknowing that such * * * record [is] false in a material respect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">{\u00b6 17} Further, federal courts have interpreted Section 211(c), Title 29, U.S.Code and/or Section 516.2, Title 29, C.F.R. to require employers to maintain \u201cadequate,\u201d \u201cproper,\u201d \u201ctrue,\u201d and \u201caccurate\u201d employee time records. <em>Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co. </em>(1946), 328 U.S. 680, 687, 66 S.Ct. 1187, 90 L.Ed. 1515 (\u201cit is the employer who has the duty under \u00a7 11(c) of the [FLSA] to keep proper records of wage, hours and other conditions and practices of employment\u201d); <em>Walton v. United Consumers Club, Inc. </em>(C.A.7, 1986), 786 F.2d 303, 314 (\u201cSection 11(c) of the FLSA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 211(c), requires every employer to keep an accurate record of the hours worked by each employee\u201d); <em>Dunlop v. Gray-Goto, Inc. </em>(C.A.10, 1976), 528 F.2d 792, 795 (\u201cthe duty to keep adequate and accurate records under the [FLSA] rests squarely on the employer\u201d); <em>Kline v. Wirtz </em>(C.A.5, 1967), 373 F.2d 281, 282 (\u201cthe Employer has the obligation to maintain accurate time and wage records\u201d); <em>Schwind v. EW &amp; Assoc., Inc. </em>(S.D.N.Y.2005), 357 F.Supp.2d 691, 707 (\u201cPursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 211(c), an employer has the duty to keep accurate records of employees\u2019 \u2018wages, hours, and other conditions and practices of employment\u2019 \u201d); <em>Herman v. Hector I. Nieves Transp., Inc. </em>(D.P.R.2000), 91 F.Supp.2d 435, 449 (\u201cThe Secretary\u2019s implementing regulations are found at 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 516 and require, inter alia, that employers preserve, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>three years, true and accurate records of: (1) the total daily and weekly hours employees work * * * \u201d); <em>Herman v. Palo Group Foster Home, Inc. </em>(W.D.Mich. 1997), 976 F.Supp. 696, 701 (Section 211(c), Title 29, U.S.Code and Section 516, Title 29, C.F.R. \u201crequire that, among other things, employers maintain accurate records of the number of hours worked each workday and workweek by each employee\u201d); <em>Reich v. Cole Ents., Inc. </em>(S.D.Ohio 1993), 901 F.Supp. 255 (defendants violated Section 211(c), Title 29, U.S.Code and Section 215(a)(5), Title 29, U.S.Code \u201cin that they * * * failed to make, keep and preserve adequate and accurate records of their employees and of the wages, hours and other conditions and practices of employment * * * \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">{\u00b6 18} Moreover, maintaining accurate employee time records is integral to the effectiveness of the MWSA and the FLSA. Failure to make and keep accurate employee time records \u201c \u2018can obscure a multitude of minimum wage and overtime violations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moon v. Kwon </em>(S.D.N.Y.2002), 248 F.Supp.2d 201, 218, quoting <em>Wirtz v. Mississippi Publishers Corp. </em>(C.A.5, 1966), 364 F.2d 603, 607 (Section 211(c), Title 29, U.S.Code and Section 516.2, Title 29, C.F.R. requirements are not mere technicalities, but rather, \u201c \u2018fundamental underpinnings\u2019 \u201d of the FLSA). Thus, if employers are not required to make and keep accurate employee time records, the purpose of both the MWSA and the FLSA \u2014 to ensure a fair day\u2019s work for a fair day\u2019s pay \u2014 will be subverted. <em>A.H. Phillips, Inc. v. Walling </em>(1945), 324 U.S. 490, 493, 65 S.Ct. 807, 89 L.Ed. 1095.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">{\u00b6 19} Accordingly, given the MWSA\u2019s and the FLSA\u2019s statutory and administrative provisions, we conclude that both Ohio and federal law manifest a clear public policy requiring employers to maintain accurate employee time records.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">{\u00b6 20} Appellees, however, argue otherwise based upon <em>Shugars v. Allied Machine &amp; Eng. Corp., </em>Tuscarawas App. No. 2002-CA-10-0085, 2003-Ohio-4672, 2003 WL 22053933. In <em>Shugars, </em>the plaintiff accessed her computerized time records and corrected inaccuracies contained therein. Id. at \u00b6 3. After the plaintiffs employer terminated her at-will employment for altering her time records, the plaintiff filed suit against her employer and asserted a claim of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy. Id. at \u00b6 5. The plaintiff asserted that the FLSA manifested a clear public policy that employers must maintain accurate employee time records and pay employees for all time worked. Id. at \u00b6 31. On an appeal of a judgment granting the employer\u2019s summary judgment motion, the appellate court considered \u201cwhether a State or Federal statute was violated, creating an exception to the at-will employment.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 30. Because the court found that the evidence did not establish a violation of the FLSA, the court concluded that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment against the plaintiff on her claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy. Id. at \u00b6 32-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>{\u00b6 21} Because the <em>Shugars </em>court\u2019s analysis is not consistent with current Supreme Court of Ohio precedent, we decline to follow its holding in the instant case. Rather than determine whether the FLSA manifested a clear public policy favoring the creation and retention of accurate employee records, the <em>Shugars </em>court focused on whether any provision of the FLSA was violated. The Supreme Court explicitly rejected this approach <em>in-Kulch, </em>supra, 78 Ohio St.3d at 150, 677 N.E.2d 308, when it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\">If there was ever any serious question whether a specific statute had to be violated for <em>Greeley </em>to apply, <em>Painter </em>answered that question in the negative * * *. See <em>Painter, </em>paragraph three of the syllabus. The question whether the <em>Greeley </em>public-policy exception to the employment-at-will doctrine applies only in cases involving a statutory violation was soundly rejected not only in <em>Painter, </em>but in the recent case of <em>Collins </em>* * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Therefore, although the facts of the <em>Shugars </em>case are similar to the case at bar, the holding has no bearing on whether there is a clear public policy regarding an employer\u2019s responsibility to maintain accurate employee time records.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">{\u00b6 22} The existence of a clear public policy satisfies only the first element of White\u2019s claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy. We now turn to the second element of the claim and examine whether the termination of White\u2019s employment jeopardized the clear public policy at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">{\u00b6 23} As the trial court found that White\u2019s claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy failed because he did not assert a clear public policy, the trial court did not address the jeopardy element. However, because our review of a judgment granting a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss is de novo, <em>Perrysburg Twp., </em>supra, 103 Ohio St.3d at \u00b6 5, we may address this second ground on which appellees sought a dismissal of White\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">{\u00b6 24} When analyzing the jeopardy element, a court must inquire \u201cinto the existence of any alternative means of promoting the particular public policy to be vindicated by a common-law wrongful-discharge claim.\u201d <em>Wiles v. Medina Auto Parts, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 240, 2002-Ohio-3994, 773 N.E.2d 526, at \u00b6 15, citing 2 Perritt, Employee Dismissal Law and Practice (4th Ed.1998), 44, Section 7.17. If a statutory remedy that adequately protects society\u2019s interests already exists, then there is no need to recognize a claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy. Id. Thus, for example, a plaintiff fired for protesting accounting irregularities, who can establish a clear public policy in favor of accuracy in corporate record keeping, must also establish that the other means for promoting the policy, such as regulatory requirements for audits, criminal penalties, and rights of shareholders and creditors to maintain private civil actions, are inadequate. 2 Perritt, supra, at 44, Section 7.17</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>{\u00b6 25} Following this rule, this court held that the jeopardy element was not satisfied in <em>Jurczak v. J &amp; R Schugel Trucking Co., </em>Franklin App. No. 03AP-451, 2003-Ohio-7039, 2003 WL 22999504. There, the plaintiff asserted that Ohio criminal law manifested a clear public policy prohibiting individuals under the influence of narcotic drugs from operating a motor vehicle. Id. at \u00b6 31. The plaintiff argued that this public policy would be jeopardized if he could not bring a claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy against his employer for discharging him for refusing to work when he was ill and on a narcotic medication. Id. We disagreed. Because federal law imposes civil and criminal penalties on employers who require an employee to drive a commercial motor vehicle while taking a narcotic medication, this court found that adequate statutory remedies existed promoting the public policy at issue. Id. at \u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">{\u00b6 26} In the case at bar, both the MSWA and the FLSA contain alternative means for promoting the clear public policy requiring employers to maintain accurate employee time records. The MSWA gives the Director of Commerce the power to enter the place of business of any employer to inspect the employee time records and question employees to ascertain whether the employer has properly made and kept the records. R.C. 4111.04(B). If the employer has failed to make, keep, and preserve employee time records or falsified employee time records, the MSWA imposes criminal liability. R.C. 4111.99(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">{\u00b6 27} Similar to MSWA, the FLSA gives the Secretary of Labor the power to investigate any employer to determine whether that employer has failed to make and keep accurate employee time records. Section 211(a), Title 29, U.S.Code. If the Secretary of Labor ascertains that the employer is not making and keeping accurate employee time records, he may seek an injunction requiring the employer to comply with the record-keeping requirements. Section 211(a), Title 29, U.S.Code; Section 217, Title 29, U.S.Code. See, e.g., <em>Herman v. Hector I. Nieves Transp., Inc., </em>supra, at 451 (enjoining an employer from continued and future violations of Section 211(c), Title 29, U.S.Code). Additionally, if the employer willfully fails to make and preserve accurate employee records, the FLSA imposes criminal penalties. Section 216(a), Title 29, U.S.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">{\u00b6 28} Given the regulatory oversight and the civil and criminal penalties, the public policy requiring the maintenance of accurate employee time records is adequately protected. Consequently, we find that White\u2019s discharge does not jeopardize the public policy at issue, and, thus, we need not recognize a claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">{\u00b6 29} Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly dismissed White\u2019s claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy. Therefore, we overrule White\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>{\u00b6 30} Because White\u2019s first assignment of error was so broadly drafted as to encompass the arguments raised by the remaining assignments of error, we find that the remaining assignments of error are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">{\u00b6 31} For the foregoing reasons, we overrule White\u2019s first assignment of error, and overrule his second, third, and fourth assignments of error as moot. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b466-7\">Brown, P.J., and Sadler, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
