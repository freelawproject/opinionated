(collectively, \u201cCondon\u201d), appeal from the trial court\u2019s judgment in favor of plaintiff-appellee, State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Company, on its complaint seeking a declaration that it was not obligated to defend or indemnify Condon under its business-insurance policies for federal lawsuits brought by family members of deceased persons whose remains were impermissibly manipulated and photographed by Condon in the Hamilton County Morgue. Because State Farm\u2019s policies excluded coverage for personal-injury claims arising from the willful violation of a penal statute, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">{\u00b6 2} Condon photographed the bodies in the morgue between August 2000 and January 2001. His convictions on eight counts of the gross abuse of a corpse, in violation of R.C. 2927.01(B), \u201cwere the result of Condon\u2019s using corpses in the Hamilton County Morgue as models for his photographic art without official permission or the consent of the deceased individuals\u2019 families.\u201d <em>State v. Condon, </em>157 Ohio App.3d 26, 2004-Ohio-2031, 808 N.E.2d 912, at \u00b6 2. We affirmed his convictions, see <em>State v. Condon, </em>152 Ohio App.3d 629, 2003-Ohio-2335, 789 N.E.2d 696, and the Ohio Supreme Court refused to accept the case for review. See <em>State v. Condon, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 1546, 2003-Ohio-4671, 795 N.E.2d 684.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">{\u00b6 3} State Farm is currently defending Condon, under a reservation of rights, in a federal class-action suit pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. The federal lawsuit was brought by family members of the deceased persons. The lawsuit, brought under Sections 1983 and 1985, Title 42, U.S.Code, alleges that Condon, Jonathan Tobias, M.D., and other government officials at the Hamilton County Morgue violated, and conspired to violate, the families\u2019 constitutional rights in three ways. The families claim that the federal defendants have violated their substantive due-process rights by actions that shock the conscience, by depriving them of their property rights in the remains of their loved ones, and by depriving them of their fundamental right to privacy. The federal plaintiffs allege that Condon wrongfully gained access to the morgue, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>where, after manipulating the bodies, he took and distributed photographs of their family members.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">{\u00b6 4} On July 25, 2002, State Farm filed this declaratory judgment action. State Farm moved for summary judgment and supported its motion with affidavits and attached exhibits. Condon filed a memorandum in response. In a proceeding that was not transcribed for this court, the parties agreed with the trial court to convert their arguments on the motion for summary judgment into a bench trial based on the evidence submitted in support of or in response to the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">{\u00b6 5} On August 31, 2004, the trial court issued an amended decision and entry acknowledging that it was ruling in a bench trial and granting judgment in favor of State Farm. Live testimony was not taken. The trial court declared the rights of the parties and identified numerous justifications for ruling in State Farm\u2019s favor, including its finding that \u201cno claim asserted against Condon occurred during a State Farm Policy [covered] period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">{\u00b6 6} In a single assignment of error, Condon now argues that the trial court erred in entering judgment for State Farm because (1) the acts that are the basis of the federal plaintiffs\u2019 claims \u201coccurred\u201d while Condon was insured by State Farm, (2) the federal plaintiffs have properly raised claims for personal injury and property damage, and (3) Condon did not willfully violate a penal statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">{\u00b6 7} State Farm issued three business-insurance policies to Condon covering interrupted periods of time from October 1998 to March 2002. The policies provided that State Farm \u201cwould pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury, property damage, personal injury or advertising injury * * * caused by an occurrence.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cOccurrence\u201d was defined as an accident that results in bodily injury or property damage, or the commission of an offense or series of related offenses that result in personal injury. \u201cPersonal injury\u201d was defined as \u201cinjury, other than bodily injury, arising out of one or more of the following offenses:</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">{\u00b6 9} \u201ca. false arrest, detention or imprisonment;</p>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cb. malicious prosecution;</p>\n<p id=\"b627-12\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cc. wrongful eviction from, wrongful entry into, or invasion of the right of private occupancy of a room, dwelling or premises that a person occupies, by or on behalf of its owner, landlord or lessor;</p>\n<p id=\"b627-13\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cd. oral or written publication of material that slanders or libels a person or organization or disparages a person\u2019s or organization\u2019s goods, products, or services;</p>\n<p id=\"b628-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>{\u00b6 13} \u201ce. oral or written publication of material that violates a person\u2019s right of privacy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">{\u00b6 14} Each policy excluded coverage for bodily injury or property damage that is \u201cexpected or intended from the standpoint of the insured\u201d or resulted from the \u201cwillful and malicious acts of the insured.\u201d Most important, in subsection 16(d), the policies excluded coverage for personal injury \u201carising out of the willful violation of a penal statute or ordinance committed by or with the consent of the insured * *</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Occurrences During Covered Periods</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">{\u00b6 15} Condon first argues that the trial court erred by concluding that the acts for which he seeks a defense and indemnification did not occur during a covered period. State Farm\u2019s first policy expired on October 31, 1999. After-wards, there was no State Farm policy in place until December 22, 1999. This second policy expired on December 1, 2000. Again, no State Farm policy extended coverage until February 7, 2001, when the third policy took effect. Condon took the morgue photographs between August 2000 and January 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">{\u00b6 16} Relying upon <em>Trinity Universal Ins. Co. v. Turner Funeral Home, Inc. </em>(Dec. 12, 2003), E.D.Tenn. Nos. 1:02-cv-231, 1:02-cv-298, and 1:03-cv-083, the trial court concluded that the families were not actually harmed until the coroner informed them that the photos had been taken. This occurred between January 19 and January 25, 2001. Thus, the \u201coccurrence\u201d required for coverage had happened in the gap between the second and third policies. But <em>Trinity Universal </em>stands for the proposition that a plaintiffs claim for mental anguish does not <em>accrue </em>until the plaintiff is actually aware that a relative\u2019s corpse has been mishandled. See id.; see, also, <em>Biro v. Hartman Funeral Home </em>(1995), 107 Ohio App.3d 508, 669 N.E.2d 65 (emotional-distress claims do not accrue until the plaintiff learns of the tort).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">{\u00b6 17} State Farm argues that we must defer to the findings of the trial court. This deference would preclude reversing its judgment if it is supported by some competent, credible evidence. See <em>Myers v. Garson </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 610, 614 N.E.2d 742; <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578, syllabus. This is the proper standard where the trial court has made factual findings after having heard the testimony of witnesses. See <em>Seasons Coal Co. v. Cleveland </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 77, 80, 10 OBR 408, 461 N.E.2d 1273; see, also, <em>Stand Energy Corp. v. Cinergy Servs. </em>(2001), 144 Ohio App.3d 410, 417, 760 N.E.2d 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">{\u00b6 18} Here, we do not contest the trial court\u2019s factual findings about the duration of the coverage periods, but we do hold that the trial court incorrectly interpreted the meaning of the contract term \u201coccurrence,\u201d confusing it with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>accrual of a claim. Our resolution of these issues on appeal requires only the interpretation of the policy terms. These issues raise only questions of law that we review de novo. See <em>Alexander v. Buckeye Pipe Line Co. </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 241, 7 O.O.3d 403, 374 N.E.2d 146; see, also, <em>Air Prods. &amp; Chems., Inc. v. Indiana Ins. Co. </em>(Dec. 23, 1999), 1st Dist. Nos. C-980947 and C-990009, 2000 WL 955600.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">{\u00b6 19} There is no requirement in the policies that the harm to third persons be completed during a covered period. The policies do not require that a cause of action by third persons must accrue during coverage. As the term is defined in the policies, \u201coccurrence\u201d refers to the accident or the offense or series of related offenses that result in an injury to third persons. The occurrence in this case was Condon\u2019s manipulation and photography of the bodies in the morgue. Condon completed all the acts underlying his convictions for the gross abuse of the corpses between August 2000 and January 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">{\u00b6 20} Thus, some of the photographs were taken during the second covered period. Because Condon seeks coverage against a class action, for purposes of this declaratory judgment action, it is impossible to identify which plaintiffs have claims related to photographs taken under the covered period and which do not. Thus, the allegations only state claims \u201cwhich [are] potentially or arguably within the policy coverage.\u201d <em>Willoughby Hills v. Cincinnati Ins. Co. </em>(1984), 9 Ohio St.3d 177, 180, 9 OBR 463, 459 N.E.2d 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Personal Injury, Intentional Acts, and the Penal Statute Exclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">{\u00b6 21} But Condon\u2019s success on the coverage-dates issue presents only a hollow victory. Both Condon and State Farm agree that at the time the trial court entered judgment in this case, the only claims remaining against Condon from the federal lawsuits were claims under Section 1983, Title 42, U.S.Code. State Farm asserts that state claims for civil conspiracy, intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, and unjust enrichment have been subsequently reinstated against Condon. This is not reflected in the record certified for our review. See App.R. 9(A). The written decision of the federal court reinstating the state claims has been appended to State Farm\u2019s appellate brief. Because the federal court\u2019s decision came after the trial court\u2019s judgment and was not part of the record before the trial court, we cannot decide this appeal on the basis of that decision. See <em>State v. Ishmail </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 402, 8 O.O.3d 405, 377 N.E.2d 500, syllabus; see, also, <em>Cincinnati School Dist. v. Ohio Dept. of Edn., </em>1st Dist. No. C-040434, 2005-Ohio-1876, 2005 WL 927162, fn. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">{\u00b6 22} Condon acknowledges that the central tenets of the remaining federal claims, as reflected in the record, are claims for personal injury for violations of privacy arising out of Condon\u2019s wrongful entry into the morgue and his written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>publication of the morgue photographs. But following the long-standing public policy in Ohio that \u201c[liability insurance does not exist to relieve wrongdoers of liability for intentional, antisocial, criminal conduct,\u201d <em>Gearing v. Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 34, 38, 665 N.E.2d 1115, the policies exclude coverage for injuries resulting from intentional and criminal acts. In subsection 16(d), the exclusions section of the policy, coverage \u201cdoes not apply to * * * personal injury * * * arising out of the willful violation of a penal statute or ordinance committed by or with the consent of the insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">{\u00b6 23} At his criminal trial, Condon was convicted of eight counts of gross abuse of a corpse, in violation of R.C. 2927.01(B), punishable as a felony of the fifth degree. R.C. 2927.01(B), which requires proof that a person \u201ctreat[ed] a human corpse in a way that would outrage reasonable community sensibilities,\u201d is a penal statute, or \u201ca law that defines an offense and prescribes its corresponding fine, penalty, or punishment.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8 Ed.Rev.1999) 1449; see, also, <em>State v. Collier </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 267, 273, 581 N.E.2d 552.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">{\u00b6 24} Condon relies upon <em>Manley v. Rufus Club Mozambique, Inc. </em>(1996), 111 Ohio App.3d 260, 675 N.E.2d 1342, where the Seventh Appellate District cautioned against invoking issue preclusion between criminal and civil actions, to assert that he did not act willfully. We note that, unlike the plaintiff in <em>Manley </em>who was merely a witness at trial, Condon, as a party, had every opportunity to fully litigate the issue of his culpable mental state in the criminal prosecution against him. See <em>Manley </em>at 263, 675 N.E.2d 1342.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">{\u00b6 25} A conviction for gross abuse of a corpse requires proof that the accused acted recklessly. See <em>State v. Glover </em>(1984), 17 Ohio App.3d 256, 257, 17 OBR 524, 479 N.E.2d 901; see, also, R.C. 2901.21(B); <em>State v. Condon, </em>152 Ohio App.3d 629, 2003-Ohio-2335, 789 N.E.2d 696, at \u00b6 30-31. Under R.C. 2901.22(C), a person acts recklessly when \u201cwith heedless indifference to the consequences, he perversely disregards a known risk that his conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, he perversely disregards a known risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cRecklessness has been held to be the functional equivalent of willfulness in the civil context. * * * For the purpose of deciding whether the exclusion here has been triggered, reckless action is tantamount to willful conduct.\u201d <em>Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Kubacko </em>(1997), 124 Ohio App.3d 282, 288, 706 N.E.2d 17; see, also, <em>Thompson v. McNeill </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 102, 104, 559 N.E.2d 705, fn. 1 (\u201cThe term \u2018reckless\u2019 is often used interchangeably with \u2018willful\u2019 and \u2018wanton\u2019 \u201d). Thus, a conviction for gross abuse of a corpse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>is a willful violation of a penal statute. Pursuant to subsection 16(d), there is no coverage under the policies for the personal injuries alleged in this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">{\u00b6 27} The assignment of error is overruled, as Condon is not entitled to coverage under the State Farm policies. As Condon\u2019s conduct as alleged in the federal complaint is indisputably outside the scope of coverage, there is no duty to defend. See <em>Willoughby Hills v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., </em>9 Ohio St.3d at 180, 9 OBR 463, 459 N.E.2d 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">{\u00b6 28} Therefore the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b631-8\">Sundermann and Hendon, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b631-21\">. Even if the bodily-injury and property-damage claims remained at issue, it is likely that Condon's criminal convictions would trigger the policies\u2019 intentional-acts exclusion. See <em>Allstate Ins. v. Cole </em>(1998), 129 Ohio App.3d 334, 336, 717 N.E.2d 816 (\"a criminal conviction, in and of itself, may conclusively establish intent for purposes of applying an intentional acts exclusion,\u201d and \"a conviction involving the element of recklessness is sufficient to trigger an intentional acts exclusion, regardless of the underlying facts\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
