Appellants raise a single assignment of error: \u201cThe trial court erred in its order of September 29, 2003 dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 complaints.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-12\">{\u00b6 2} The facts of this case are as follows. Appellants filed complaints against the insurance companies seeking postsettlement interest pursuant to <em>Hartmann v. Duffey, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 456, 2002-Ohio-2486, 768 N.E.2d 1170. The case originally consisted of 27<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> individual complaints, but the trial court consolidated them into one case. Appellants also filed individual motions for class certification against each insurance company pursuant to Civ.R. 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-13\">{\u00b6 3} In its September 29, 2003 opinion and judgment entry, regarding the eight appellants still remaining in the instant appeal, in granting summary judgment to appellees in five<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the underlying cases, the trial court cited <em>Marks </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number><em>v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>153 Ohio App.3d 378, 2003-Ohio-4043, 794 N.E.2d 129, and ruled that appellants had not sued the proper party. In granting summary judgment to appellees in seven<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the underlying cases, the trial court cited <em>Fontbank, Inc. v. CompuServe, Inc. </em>(2000), 138 Ohio App.3d 801, 742 N.E.2d 674, and ruled that appellants\u2019 claims were barred by the parol-evidence rule. In granting summary judgment to appellees in four<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the underlying cases, the trial court ruled that appellants\u2019 claims were barred by res judicata. Further, based on its ruling granting summary judgment on the proper-party issue, to one appellee, Safe Auto Insurance Company, the trial court denied summary judgment to Safe Auto on its counterclaim against appellant Sherri Burwell for breach of her settlement agreement. Finally, the trial court ruled in favor of appellants on the issue of releases. Several appellees filed cross-appeals on this portion of the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">{\u00b6 4} Appellate review of a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is de novo. <em>Grafton v. Ohio Edison Co. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 102, 105, 671 N.E.2d 241. Accordingly, we review the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment independently and without deference to the trial court\u2019s determination. <em>Brown v. Scioto Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1993), 87 Ohio App.3d 704, 711, 622 N.E.2d 1153. Summary judgment will be granted only when there remains no genuine issue of material fact and, when construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, reasonable minds can only conclude that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 66, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46; Civ.R. 56(C). The burden of showing that no genuine issue of material fact exists falls upon the party who moves for summary judgment. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 294, 662 N.E.2d 264. However, once the movant supports his or her motion with appropriate evidentiary materials, the nonmoving party \u201cmay not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleadings, but his response, by affidavit or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d Civ.R. 56(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">{\u00b6 5} In their argument relative to appellees as the proper parties to a suit for <em>Hartmann </em>interest under R.C. 1343.03(A), appellants argue that the trial court misconstrued <em>Peyko v. Frederick </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 164, 25 OBR 207, 495 N.E.2d 918, and that under Peyko\u2019s principles as well as those stated in <em>Lovewell </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number><em>v. Physicians Ins. Co. </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 143, 679 N.E.2d 1119, the insurance companies are the proper parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">{\u00b6 6} The Supreme Court of Ohio stated in <em>Hartmann v. Duffey, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 456, 2002-Ohio-2486, 768 N.E.2d 1170, syllabus: \u201cPursuant to R.C. 1343.03(A), a plaintiff who enters into a settlement agreement that has not been reduced to judgment is entitled to interest on the settlement, which becomes due and payable on the date of settlement.\u201d Further, with regard to the public-policy reasons behind such an award of interest, the court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c[T]he entitlement to interest, whether it be prejudgment interest, postjudgment interest, or postsettlement interest, \u2018is allowed, not only on account of the loss which a creditor may be supposed to have sustained by being deprived of the use of his money, but on account of the gain being made from its use by the debtor.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 12, citing <em>Landis v. Grange Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 339, 342, 695 N.E.2d 1140, and <em>Hogg v. Zanesville Canal &amp; Mfg. Co. </em>(1832), 5 Ohio 410, 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">{\u00b6 8} Appellants cite the public-policy interest pronouncement in <em>Hartmann </em>as support for the insurance companies being the proper parties in the present action. Appellants contend that it is the insurance companies, which hold the settlement money, that gain by any delay between the settlement date and the date of payment. However, recently in <em>Rengel v. Valley Forge Ins. Co., </em>6th Dist. No. OT-03-045, 2004-Ohio-5248, 2004 WL 2334254, we had the opportunity to examine the proper-party issue related to <em>Hartmann </em>postsettlement-interest claims brought against an insurance company. Similar to five of the previously noted underlying cases in the present appeal, in <em>Rengel, </em>the underlying tort action at issue was a personal injury claim against a tortfeasor. Thus, despite any public-policy discussion in <em>Hartmann, </em>we found that the rule of law set forth in <em>Chitlik v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(1973), 34 Ohio App.2d 193, 63 O.O.2d 364, 299 N.E.2d 295, and <em>Peyko v. Frederick </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 164, 25 OBR 207, 495 N.E.2d 918, applied, and the tortfeasor was the proper party. We distinguished <em>Lovewell </em>as involving an award of prejudgment interest and the interpretation of the contract between the tortfeasor and his insurer. <em>Rengel, </em>2004-Ohio-5248, 2004 WL 2334254, at \u00b6 21. We found that the award of R.C. 1343.03(A) post-settlement interest was statutory in nature and the issue of from whom the interest is to be paid was a question of law. Id., \u00b6 22. We went on to cite <em>Marks v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>153 Ohio App.3d 378, 2003-Ohio-4043, 794 N.E.2d 129, and its discussion of the insurer/insured relationship and its application to the payment of postsettlement interest. Specifically, in <em>Rengel, </em>we stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cIn this ease, appellant Rengel, with the aid of Valley Forge, negotiated a settlement with [tortfeasor] Riverfront. We agree with the <em>Marks </em>court\u2019s discussion of the insurer/insured relationship and its application to the payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>of post-settlement interest. Thus, as in <em>Marks, </em>we conclude that a tortfeasor is responsible for the payment of post-settlement interest. This does not prevent, as stated in <em>Peyko, </em>supra, the tortfeasor from seeking reimbursement from the insurer if the insurer was responsible for the delay of payment.\u201d Id. \u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">{\u00b6 10} Thus, in <em>Rengel </em>we concluded that the trial court did not err in dismissing the appellants\u2019 action against the tortfeasor\u2019s insurer, Valley Forge.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">{\u00b6 11} In response to <em>Rengel, </em>in their reply brief, appellants argue that the approach suggested under <em>Rengel </em>needlessly doubles litigation. Appellants invoke the general power and authority of this court as outlined in Rep.R. 4(B) and suggest that we should not follow our own ruling in <em>Rengel. </em>We decline such an invitation. Thus, as in <em>Rengel, </em>we conclude that in the five of the eight remaining underlying cases<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> where the claim was against the tortfeasor, the tortfeasor is responsible for the payment of postsettlement interest. The insurance companies are not the proper parties in these cases. Thus, the trial court did not err in finding that there were no genuine issues of material fact and that these appellees were entitled to judgment as a matter of law on appellants\u2019 claims for interest because appellants had not sued the proper parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">{\u00b6 12} Next, we will consider appellants\u2019 argument relative to application of the parol-evidence rule. This argument would necessarily apply to the remaining three underlying cases.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The parol-evidence rule states, \u201c \u2018[A]bsent fraud, mistake or other invalidating cause, the parties\u2019 final written integration of their agreement may not be varied, contradicted or supplemented by evidence of prior or contemporaneous oral agreements, or prior written agreements.\u2019 \u201d <em>Galmish v. Cicchini </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 22, 27, 734 N.E.2d 782, quoting 11 Williston on Contracts (4th Ed.1999) 569-570, Section 33:4. The rule, therefore, \u201cprohibits the admission of testimony regarding prior or contemporaneous oral agreements which contradict or vary the terms of written agreements.\u201d <em>Finomore v. Epstein </em>(1984), 18 Ohio App.3d 88, 89, 18 OBR 403, 481 N.E.2d 1193.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">{\u00b6 13} Appellants cite <em>Snyder v. Lindsay, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 32, 2002-Ohio-3319, 770 N.E.2d 580, and argue that the parol-evidence rule has no application in the present case. Appellants assert that the written settlement agreements do not vary from or conflict with the prior oral settlement agreements, as they are silent as to the exact date of settlement. Therefore, the court must look to extrinsic evidence of the settlement date, which is contained in the electronic data files of each appellee insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>{\u00b6 14} In <em>Snyder, </em>on February 15, 2000, the parties signed a stipulated dismissal stating that the case was settled, and a confidential settlement agreement was entered into on that date. <em>Snyder v. Lindsay </em>(Apr. 12, 2001), 8th Dist. No. 78121. As part of the settlement agreement, a qualified settlement fund was established on March 13, 2000. By February 29, 2000 \u2014 a date predetermined by the appellants \u2014 one appellee had paid his settlement amount. On March 24, 2000, the remaining appellees issued checks to the appellants along with a release and settlement agreement to be signed by plaintiffs. The Eighth District Court of Appeals held that interest was payable to the appellants, but that an evidentiary hearing was required on the question of when the settlement money became due and payable and, thus, when interest started to accrue. The Supreme Court of Ohio affirmed as to the award of interest, but reversed as to the remand for an evidentiary hearing. <em>Snyder v. Lindsay, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 32, 2002-Ohio-3319, 770 N.E.2d 580. The court simply stated: \u201cInterest is to be computed by the trial court from the date of settlement, consistent with our decision in <em>Hartmann v. Duffey, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 456, 768 N.E.2d 1170.\u201d Id. The Eighth District Court of Appeals noted in a subsequent appeal on a different issue in the same case that \u201c[Consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, the defendants tendered the interest that had accumulated on the settlement between the time it had been agreed upon, February 15, 2000 * * *.\u201d <em>Snyder v. Lindsay, </em>8th Dist. No. 82663, 2003-Ohio-5388, 2003 WL 22310915, at \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">{\u00b6 15} <em>Snyder </em>is distinguishable from the present case because there was a written stipulation of dismissal and settlement signed by the parties on February 15, 2000, making the settlement date clear. In the present case, appellants claim inapplicability of the parol-evidence rule to reach back to an oral-settlement-agreement date.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">{\u00b6 16} We find that the recent case of <em>Layne v. Progressive Preferred Ins., </em>104 Ohio St.3d 509, 2004-Ohio-6597, 820 N.E.2d 867, is instructive on the issue of whether the parol-evidence rule bars extrinsic evidence of an oral-settlement date in the present case. Similar to the claims in the present case, in <em>Layne, </em>the appellant sought statutory interest under R.C. 1343.03(A) pursuant to the holding in <em>Hartmann v. Duffey, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 456, 2002-Ohio-2486, 768 N.E.2d 1170. The court held that an integration clause in a written \u201crelease of claims\u201d nullified an alleged prior oral agreement between the parties. <em>Layne, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 509, 2004- Ohio-6597, 820 N.E.2d 867, \u00b6 11. Therefore, the settlement date for purposes of R.C. 1343.03(A) was the date of the written agreement, and the appellant was not entitled to interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">{\u00b6 17} Appellants emphasize the narrow holding of <em>Layne, </em>which involved an integration clause in the written agreement. Apparently, none of the written agreements involving the eight remaining appellants include an integration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>clause. Appellees, on the other hand, assert that while an integration clause makes the presumption stronger, even in the absence of an integration clause, there still remains a presumption that any agreement reduced to writing is a complete integration of the parties\u2019 agreement. Based on some discussion by the Supreme Court of Ohio in <em>Layne, </em>we agree with appellees\u2019 contentions. Although the question in the present case \u2014 whether extrinsic evidence of an oral-settlement date is admissible in the absence of an integration clause in the subsequent written agreement \u2014 was not directly addressed by <em>Layne, </em>we believe that some of Layne\u2019s discussion is instructive. In <em>Layne, </em>the Supreme Court of Ohio rejected the appellant\u2019s argument that when a release of claims containing an integration clause is silent or ambiguous on the issue, parol evidence may be offered to show the date of contracting. In doing so, the court noted the facts as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cBut the November 15 agreement is neither silent nor ambiguous as to the date of settlement. The November 15 agreement lists only November 15 as the date of agreement and makes no mention of any prior date of agreement. The integration clause only <em>adds to </em>[the appellant\u2019s] problem with this argument * * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">{\u00b6 19} Thus, it appears from the foregoing discussion in <em>Layne, </em>that even without an integration clause, the appellant claiming <em>Hartmann </em>interest based on an oral settlement agreement subsequently reduced to writing without any reference to the oral-settlement-agreement date has a \u201cproblem.\u201d The court also appears to put some responsibility on the interest claimant for failing to negotiate and document a \u201cdue and payable date.\u201d The court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cFurther, the parties to an oral agreement such as this one must be responsible for ensuring that the date of settlement, and the due and payable date, if different, are negotiated and agreed upon. [The appellant] did not strike or modify the integration clause, <em>nor did he negotiate beforehand for a certain date on which interest would begin to accrue.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id. at \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">{\u00b6 21} Thus, under the foregoing discussion in <em>Layne, </em>even in the absence of an integration clause, if there is no -written provision to the contrary concerning an alternate settlement date or \u201cdue and payable\u201d date, the date of the written \u201crelease\u201d or settlement agreement is the date from which <em>Hartmann </em>interest would accrue. There is additional support for this position in <em>Marks. </em>The court cited the affirmed Fifth District Court of Appeals decision in <em>Layne </em>and found that even without an integration clause in the release at issue, the appellant was not entitled to <em>Hartmann </em>interest. <em>Marks </em>at \u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">{\u00b6 22} In the present case, we also disagree with appellants\u2019 contention that the written release agreements at issue are silent as to the date of settlement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>All three of the agreements are dated as to the day they were executed, and appellants\u2019 signatures as of that date are notarized. Furthermore, we reject appellants\u2019 attempts to characterize these written agreements, which are titled as \u201creleases,\u201d as somehow not actually addressing \u201csettlement\u201d and, thus, as not serving as a possible basis for calculation of <em>Hartmann </em>interest. The Supreme Court of Ohio in <em>Layne </em>rejected a similar argument by the appellant who characterized the written agreement as a \u201cmere \u2018release of claims.\u2019 \u201d Id., \u00b6 10. The agreements at issue in the present case either state that the purpose of the releases is \u201cto forever * * * settle * * * all claims\u201d or that \u201c * * * the Releasor voluntarily accepts said sum for the purpose of making a full and final * * * settlement.\u201d Therefore, any extrinsic evidence of a different date of settlement necessarily would contradict these written agreements. The parol-evidence rule prohibits such extrinsic evidence. Further, all three of the agreements indicate that as of that date, the settlement amount was \u201cin hand paid\u201d and/or state that the receipt and sufficiency of the amount \u201cis hereby acknowledged.\u201d Therefore, these appellants are not entitled to <em>Hartmann </em>interest. Thus, the trial court did not err in finding that there were no genuine issues of material fact and that these appellees were entitled to judgment as a matter of law on appellants\u2019 claims for interest because the claims were barred by the parol-evidence rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">{\u00b6 28} Since this court has determined that the trial court\u2019s summary-judgment ruling and dismissal of appellants\u2019 underlying complaints relative to all eight of the remaining appellees was not in error pursuant to either or both the proper party and parol-evidence-rule arguments, appellants\u2019 arguments relative to res judicata are moot. In addition, based on our findings relative to the issues raised in appellants\u2019 assignment of error, we find that the release issue raised in certain appellees\u2019 cross-appeals is rendered moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">{\u00b6 24} Based on the foregoing, we find appellants\u2019 assignment of error not well taken. Accordingly, the judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed. Appellants are ordered to pay the costs of this appeal, for which sum judgment is rendered against appellants on behalf of Lucas County and for which execution is awarded.
