In the complaint, appellant alleged the following: (1) appellant was living and working in California when Cable Tech \u201cbecame aware of [appellant]\u201d through an employment placement agency and offered him a position in Columbus, Ohio; (2) \u201c[t]hrough various phone conversations and emails that occurred in February and March of 2003, Stone, acting on behalf of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Cable Tech, apprised [appellant] of the position of Field Service Technician, informed him that he was hired, and instructed him that his start date was March 21, 2003\u201d; (3) Stone \u201cprovided [appellant] with an \u2018offer of employment\u2019 letter that [appellant] signed and sen[t] back to Cable Tech indicating his acceptance of Cable Tech\u2019s terms\u201d; (4) \u201c[b]ased upon [appellees\u2019] representations, [appellant] and his wife uprooted and moved to Columbus so that [appellant] could take the new position with Cable Tech\u201d; (5) when appellant and his wife arrived in Columbus, appellees did not have work for appellant; and (6) at the end of April, Stone told appellant that \u201c \u2018we need only one employee in Ohio\u2019 \u201d and that appellant would not be working for Cable Tech. Appellant asserted that he suffered damages from appellees\u2019 conduct and raised claims of \u201cbreach of contract/detrimental reliance,\u201d fraudulent inducement, unlawful discriminatory practices in violation of R.C. 4112.02 et. seq., and a violation of Ohio public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">{\u00b6 3} Appellees moved to dismiss appellant\u2019s complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction and improper venue pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(2) and 12(B)(3) respectively. Eric Stroud, Cable Tech president and chief executive officer, and Stone attached affidavits to the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">{\u00b6 4} Stroud\u2019s affidavit indicated the following: (1) Cable Tech is incorporated in Iowa with its principal place of business in Iowa; (2) Cable Tech provides service, installation, and maintenance to phone systems, including installing, moving or changing cable lines; (3) Cable Tech has never been licensed to do business in Ohio; (4) Cable Tech has never maintained an office in Ohio; (5) Cable Tech does not \u201cregularly conduct business in Ohio\u201d; (6) Cable Tech \u201chas hired independent contractors * * * to provide services in the Cleveland area on behalf of Sprint * * * but these independent contractor jobs equate to less than 25 total hours worked in Ohio,\u201d and Sprint, \u201ca non-Ohio based company,\u201d paid for the jobs \u201cthrough its office\u201d in Kansas; (7) \u201c[a]round Spring 2003, Cable Tech was considering placing Field Service Technicians in Ohio, based on a new service contract it had acquired with Sprint to provide phone system services on behalf of Sprint,\u201d and it \u201cappeared this would include significant work in the Columbus, Ohio area\u201d; (8) the business opportunity with Sprint \u201cwas not realized, and so Cable Tech could not employ any Field Service Technicians for that area as planned\u201d; (9) \u201c[a]t no time were Cable Tech representatives present in Ohio related to the present dispute\u201d; and (10) Stroud \u201cwould be significantly burdened if forced to defend this lawsuit in Ohio\u201d because it \u201cwould be extremely difficult for both [him], as well as [his] employees, to travel to Ohio on whqt might result in several lengthy trips over the course of this litigation\u201d and because \u201cCable Tech\u2019s business operations would be significantly disrupted by [his] absence, as well as the absence of other employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>{\u00b6 5} Stone\u2019s affidavit indicated the following: (1) Cable Tech is incorporated in Iowa and has its principal place of business in Iowa; (2) Cable Tech has never been licensed to do business in Ohio; (3) Cable Tech does not regularly conduct business in Ohio; (4) Stone has \u201cnot been involved in the discreet subcontracting work [Cable Tech has] done in Ohio\u201d; (5) Stone is an Iowa resident; (6) Stone has not been in Ohio in the last ten years and has never been in Ohio on behalf of Cable Tech, \u201cincluding related to this matter\u201d; (7) \u201c[a]round the spring of 2003, [Stone] received information about [appellant], then a resident of California,\u201d through an employment placement agency; (8) Stone originally contacted appellant for work in California but learned that appellant was moving to Ohio and' was interested in a position in Ohio; (9) \u201c[m]ost communication^] that occurred between [appellant] and [Stone] were exchanged via electronic mail or telephone while [appellant] resid[ed] in California, including his interview\u201d; (10) \u201c[a]t that time, Cable Tech was considering placing Field Service Technicians in Ohio, based on a new service contract it had acquired with Sprint\u201d; (11) the Sprint contract \u201cwould include significant work in the Columbus, Ohio area\u201d; (12) \u201c[b]eeause of the unpredictability of this new business opportunity, [appellant], while still residing in California, was only offered a position to serve as an independent contractor for Cable Tech\u201d and, after 60 days, appellant \u201cwould only become an employee of Cable Tech * * * if both Cable Tech and [appellant] mutually agreed that was desirable\u201d; (13) \u201c[o]ver the course of the next month or so, [appellant] and [Stone] exchanged a few electronic mail and telephone communications regarding the delay or possibly complete lack of work stemming from the Sprint business, totaling somewhere around three communications\u201d; and (14) \u201c[a]t the end of this time period, [Stone] communicated to [appellant] that Cable Tech could not employ any Field Service Technicians for that area as planned.\u201d Stone also stated in the affidavit that (1) \u201c[d]uring all of [Stone\u2019s] communications with [appellant], [Stone] was physically present in Iowa\u201d; and (2) defending this litigation in Ohio would burden Stone\u2019s professional obligations to Cable Tech. Lastly, Stone stated that (1) appellant moved to Ohio \u201ceven before responding to our offer of an independent contract relationship\u201d; and (2) \u201c[obviously, [appellant\u2019s] move to Ohio was not dependent on retaining employment with Cable Tech.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">{\u00b6 6} Appellant filed a memorandum opposing appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss and attached copies of electronic mail communications between appellant and Stone. As an example, Stone sent a February 28, 2003 e-mail to appellant while appellant was in California and discussed the potential employment opportunity. Other electronic mail communications involved appellant, in Ohio, asking Stone when Cable Tech would start assigning work. The communications also denote Stone\u2019s responses to appellant\u2019s inquiries. In particular, in response to appellant\u2019s inquiries, on April 1, 2003, Stone told appellant that Cable Tech added <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>appellant to the dispatch list, and on April 2, 2003, Stone told appellant that his \u201cofficial start date\u201d is April 7, 2003, \u201calthough it may move forward if we have a dispatch between now and then.\u201d After appellant asked Stone why Cable Tech had not assigned him work as of April 10, 2003, Stone responded that appellant could either \u201cexercise some patience\u201d or \u201cresign now and we\u2019ll find another tech from the resumes in the area.\u201d Lastly, in response to appellant\u2019s April 14, 2003 question about when he would get work-related supplies, Stone assured appellant that he would be receiving a \u201cwelcome kit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">{\u00b6 7} On December 9, 2004, the trial court granted appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and improper venue pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(2) and 12(B)(3) respectively. Thus, the trial court dismissed appellant\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">{\u00b6 8} Appellant appeals, raising one assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">The trial court erred in finding that the Franklin County Court Of Common Pleas lacked jurisdiction over appellees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">{\u00b6 9} Appellant\u2019s single assignment of error concerns the trial court\u2019s decision to dismiss appellant\u2019s complaint. Appellant does not challenge the trial court\u2019s decision to grant appellees\u2019 Civ.R. 12(B)(3) motion to dismiss for improper venue, and, therefore, we will not address the trial court\u2019s dismissal for improper venue. See App.R. 12(A) and 16(A). Rather, appellant contends that the trial court erred by dismissing his complaint upon granting appellees\u2019 Civ.R. 12(B)(2) motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. However, we disagree with appellant\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">{\u00b6 10} Once a defendant moves to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, a plaintiff must establish that the trial court had personal jurisdiction over the defendant. <em>Robinson v. Koch Refining Co. </em>(June 17, 1999), Franklin App. No. 98AP-900, 1999 WL 394512; <em>Giachetti v. Holmes </em>(1984), 14 Ohio App.3d 306, 307, 14 OBR 371, 471 N.E.2d 165. If the trial court determines personal jurisdiction without holding an evidentiary hearing, the trial court must \u201cview allegations in the pleadings and the documentary evidence in a light most favorable\u201d to the plaintiff and resolve \u201call reasonable competing inferences\u201d in favor of the plaintiff. <em>Goldstein v. Christiansen </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 232, 236, 638 N.E.2d 541; <em>Giachetti </em>at 307, 14 OBR 371, 471 N.E.2d 165; <em>Robinson. </em>Without an evidentiary hearing, a plaintiff need establish only a prima facie showing of personal jurisdiction. <em>Giachetti </em>at 307, 14 OBR 371, 471 N.E.2d 165; <em>Robinson. </em>A prima facie showing exists if a plaintiff produces sufficient evidence to allow reasonable minds to conclude that the trial court has personal jurisdiction. <em>Giachetti </em>at 307, 14 OBR 371, 471 N.E.2d 165; <em>Robinson. </em>If the plaintiff makes a prima facie showing of personal jurisdiction, the trial court shall not dismiss the complaint without holding an evidentiary hearing. <em>Giachetti </em>at 307, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>14 OBR 371, 471 N.E.2d 165; <em>Robinson. </em>Lastly, personal jurisdiction is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>Kvinta v. Kvinta, </em>Franklin App. No. 02AP-836, 2003-Ohio-2884, 2003 WL 21291049, at \u00b6 74; <em>Robinson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">{\u00b6 11} When determining whether an Ohio court has personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant, the court must (1) determine whether Ohio\u2019s long-arm statute and the applicable civil rule confer personal jurisdiction and, if so, (2) whether granting jurisdiction under the statute and rule comports with the defendant\u2019s due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>Goldstein, </em>70 Ohio St.3d at 235, 638 N.E.2d 541, citing <em>U.S. Sprint Communications Co., Ltd. Partnership v. Mr. K\u2019s Foods, Inc. </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 181, 183-184, 624 N.E.2d 1048. Courts must engage in the two-step analysis because the long-arm statute does not give Ohio courts jurisdiction to the limits of the due process clause. Id. at 238, 638 N.E.2d 541, fn. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">{\u00b6 12} Ohio\u2019s long-arm statute, R.C. 2307.382, outlines specific activities by which a nonresident defendant comes within an Ohio court\u2019s personal jurisdiction. <em>U.S. Sprint, </em>68 Ohio St.3d at 184, 624 N.E.2d 1048. Civ.R. 4.3(A) authorizes out-of-state service of process on a defendant to effectuate personal jurisdiction. <em>Kentucky Oaks Mall Co. v. Mitchell\u2019s Formal Wear, Inc. </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 73, 75, 559 N.E.2d 477. As such, R.C. 2307.382 and Civ.R. 4.3(A) are coextensive and \u201ccomplement each other.\u201d <em>U.S. Sprint </em>at 184, 624 N.E.2d 1048, fn. 2, quoting <em>Kentucky Oaks Mall </em>at 75, 559 N.E.2d 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">{\u00b6 13} Appellant first argues that the trial court had jurisdiction over appellees because they \u201ctransacted business\u201d in Ohio. See R.C. 2307.382(A)(1) and Civ.R. 4.3(A)(1). R.C. 2307.382(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-8\">(A) A court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a person who acts directly or by an agent, as to a cause of action arising from the person\u2019s:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-10\">(1) Transacting any business in this state[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">{\u00b6 14} Similarly, Civ.R. 4.3(A)(1) provides that a plaintiff may make service of process on a nonresident</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-12\">who, acting directly or by an agent, has caused an event to occur out of which the claim that is the subject of the complaint arose, from the person\u2019s:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-14\">(1) Transacting any business in this state[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-15\">{\u00b6 15} As used in the above jurisdictional provisions, \u201ctransact\u201d means \u201cto prosecute negotiations; to carry on business; to have dealings.\u201d <em>Kentucky Oaks Mall, </em>53 Ohio St.3d at 75, 559 N.E.2d 477, quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5 Ed.1979) 1341. Thus, the term \u201ctransact\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>embraces in its meaning the carrying on or prosecution of business negotiations but it is a broader term than the word \u2018contract\u2019 and may involve business negotiations which have been either wholly or partly brought to a conclusion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3\">(Emphasis deleted.) Id. Accordingly, as used in R.C. 2307.382(A)(1) and Civ.R. 4.3(A)(1), \u201c[transacting any business in this state\u201d connotes a broad statement of jurisdiction. <em>Kentucky Oaks Mall, </em>53 Ohio St.3d at 75, 559 N.E.2d 477. Therefore, cases involving whether a nonresident defendant \u201ctransacted business\u201d in Ohio \u201c \u2018have reached their results on highly particularized fact situations, thus rendering any generalization unwarranted.\u2019 \u201d <em>U.S. Sprint, </em>68 Ohio St.3d at 185, 624 N.E.2d 1048, quoting 22 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (1980) 430, Courts and Judges, Section 280. \u201cWith no better guideline than the bare wording of the statute to establish whether a nonresident is transacting business in Ohio, the court must, therefore, rely on a case-by-case determination.\u201d <em>U.S. Sprint </em>at 185, 624 N.E.2d 1048.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">{\u00b6 16} Here, appellant relies on <em>U.S. Sprint </em>to assert that the trial court had jurisdiction over appellees for their \u201ctransacting business in Ohio.\u201d In <em>U.S. Sprint, </em>the plaintiff, U.S. Sprint Communications (\u201cU.S. Sprint\u201d), sued Mr. K\u2019s Foods, Inc. (\u201cMr. K\u2019s\u201d), in an Ohio trial court, although neither party was headquartered in Ohio. Mr. K\u2019s, located in Buffalo, New York, manufactured pizza products and cookies for wholesale distribution and home delivery and generated its sales through telemarketing. Mr. K\u2019s made telemarketing calls to prospective New York customers through its New York office and in other states through independent distributors. In Ohio, Mr. K\u2019s worked with two distributors: (1) Mr. K\u2019s Distribution and Sales of Cleveland, Inc., and (2) Mr. K\u2019s Distribution and Sales of Columbus, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">{\u00b6 17} U.S. Sprint sued Mr. K\u2019s to recover for unpaid long-distance telephone service on 17 accounts. Six accounts were located in Ohio, one in Pennsylvania, and the remaining ten in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">{\u00b6 18} The Ohio Supreme Court concluded that Mr. K\u2019s was \u201ctransacting business\u201d in Ohio under the long-arm statute. Id., 68 Ohio St.3d at 185, 624 N.E.2d 1048. The court noted that Mr. K\u2019s frequently used the U.S. Sprint long-distance telephone Service to make long-distance calls to Ohio to sell its products on behalf of its home delivery division. The court also recognized that Mr. K\u2019s Ohio independent distributors used the U.S. Sprint long-distance phone service to place orders with Mr. K\u2019s for pizza and cookies to be sold in Ohio. Thus, having concluded that Mr. K\u2019s was \u201ctransacting business\u201d in Ohio, the court held that Ohio\u2019s long-arm statute conferred jurisdiction over Mr. K\u2019s in regard to U.S. Sprint\u2019s claims pertaining to the Ohio long-distance accounts. Because the trial court had personal jurisdiction over Mr. K\u2019s under the long-arm statute, the court also held that the trial court had jurisdiction over Mr. K\u2019s in regard to the non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Ohio long-distance accounts because the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure and constitutional due process guarantees allowed joinder of the non-Ohio claims. Id., citing Civ.R. 18(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">{\u00b6 19} However, appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>U.S. Sprint </em>is misplaced. In <em>U.S. Sprint, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court concluded that personal jurisdiction under the long-arm statute existed over Mr. K\u2019s because Mr. K\u2019s transacted business in Ohio by using U.S. Sprint long-distance accounts to conduct business in Ohio and to take orders from its Ohio independent distributors for goods to be sold in Ohio. Here, the transactions that appellant claimed induced him to move to Ohio did not take place in Ohio. Rather, appellant was residing in California when an employment placement agency provided information about appellant to Iowa resident Stone and Iowa corporation Cable Tech. Likewise, appellant was living in California when Stone, in Iowa, interviewed appellant. Similarly, appellant was residing in California when the Iowa corporation offered the independent-contractor position.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">{\u00b6 20} Although appellant communicated with Stone after appellant moved to Ohio, the record evinces that the communications primarily consisted of e-mails that appellant initiated. As noted below, such \u201cunilateral activity\u201d from appellant is insufficient for a court to confer jurisdiction over appellees. See <em>Gallert v. Courtaulds Packaging Co. Inc. </em>(S.D.Ind.1998), 4 F.Supp.2d 825, 830. Moreover, as Stone indicated in his affidavit, \u201c[m]ost communication[s] that occurred between [appellant] and [Stone] were exchanged via electronic mail or telephone while [appellant] resid[ed] in California * * *.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">{\u00b6 21} Appellant also points to business negotiations that Cable Tech had with Sprint to further allege jurisdiction under the \u201ctransacting business\u201d prongs of the long-arm statute and rule. However, these negotiations are immaterial to our inquiry because the negotiations were with Sprint, a party not involved in this suit. See R.C. 2307.382(A) (establishing that a court exercises personal jurisdiction under the long-arm statute for causes of actions \u201carising from\u201d acts enumerated in the statute); Civ.R. 4.3(A) (establishing that a plaintiff may make service of process on a nonresident who \u201chas caused an event to occur out of which the claim that is the subject of the complaint arose\u201d from acts enumerated in the rules of civil procedure); R.C. 2307.382(C) (\u201cWhen jurisdiction over a person is based solely upon this section, only a cause of action arising from acts enumerated in this section may be asserted against him\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">{\u00b6 22} Accordingly, we conclude that R.C. 2307.382(A)(1) and Civ.R. 4.3(A)(1) did not confer jurisdiction over appellees. Next, appellant argues that the trial court had jurisdiction over appellees because they contracted to supply services or goods in Ohio. See R.C. 2307.382(A)(2) and Civ.R. 4.3(A)(2). R.C. 2307.382(A)(2) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>(A) A court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a person who acts directly or by an agent, as to a cause of action arising from the person\u2019s:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-5\">* <em>% </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-6\">(2) Contracting to supply services or goods in this state[J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">{\u00b6 23} Similarly, Civ.R. 4.3(A)(2) provides that a plaintiff may make service of process on a nonresident:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-8\">who, acting directly or by an agent, has caused an event to occur out of which the claim that is the subject of the complaint arose, from the person\u2019s:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-11\">(2) Contracting to supply services or goods in this state[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-12\">{\u00b6 24} To support his claim that the trial court had jurisdiction over appellees under the \u201c[contracting to supply services or goods\u201d prongs in the long-arm statute and rule, appellant again points to negotiations between Cable Tech and Sprint for Cable Tech to provide phone-system services on behalf of Sprint in Ohio. However, as noted above, the negotiations are immaterial because Cable Tech engaged in the negotiations with Sprint, a nonparty, and appellees did not contract \u201cto supply services or goods\u201d to appellant in Ohio. See R.C. 2307.382(A) and (C); Civ.R. 4.3(A). Thus, we conclude that R.C. 2307.382(A)(2) and Civ.R. 4.3(A)(2) did not confer jurisdiction over appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-13\">{\u00b6 25} Nonetheless, even if appellees\u2019 contacts were sufficient to confer jurisdiction under the long-arm statute and rule, we must still determine whether those contacts were sufficient under the Fourteenth Amendment due process clause to have allowed the trial court to exercise jurisdiction under the statute and rule. <em>Goldstein, </em>70 Ohio St.3d at 235, 638 N.E.2d 541; <em>U.S. Sprint, </em>68 Ohio St.3d at 183-184, 624 N.E.2d 1048.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-14\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c[T]he extent to which the reach of the long-arm statute is limited by due process is a question of federal law.\u201d <em>Scullin Steel Co. v. Natl. Ry. Utilization Corp. </em>(C.A.8, 1982), 676 F.2d 309, 311. The United States Supreme Court has held that in order for a state court to exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant, the defendant must have \u201cminimum contacts\u201d with the state. <em>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson </em>(1980), 444 U.S. 286, 291, 100 S.Ct. 559, 62 L.Ed.2d 490, quoting <em>Internatl. Shoe Co. v. Washington </em>(1945), 326 U.S. 310, 316, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95. The due process clause protects a nonresident defendant\u2019s liberty interest in not being subject to a court\u2019s judgment if the defendant has established no meaningful \u201c \u2018contacts, ties, or relations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz </em>(1985), 471 U.S. 462, 471-472, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528, quoting <em>Internatl. Shoe </em>at 319, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>{\u00b6 27} Under the due process clause, a court obtains either specific or general jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant. <em>Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia v. Hall </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 408, 414, 104 S.Ct. 1868, 80 L.Ed.2d 404, fns. 8 and 9. Specific jurisdiction exists when a plaintiffs controversy is related to or arises out of the defendant\u2019s contact with the forum state. General jurisdiction exists when a court exercises personal jurisdiction over a defendant in a suit not arising out of or not related to the defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum state.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">{\u00b6 28} We first consider specific jurisdiction, which depends on the \u201c \u2018relationship among the defendant, the forum, and the litigation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Helicopteros, </em>466 U.S. at 414, 104 S.Ct. 1868, 80 L.Ed.2d 404, quoting <em>Shaffer v. Heitner </em>(1977), 433 U.S. 186, 204, 97 S.Ct. 2569, 53 L.Ed.2d 683. In particular, a court examines whether the defendant \u201cpurposefully established minimum contacts within the forum State\u201d and whether the \u201clitigation results from alleged injuries that \u2018arise out of or relate to\u2019 those activities\u201d creating \u201cminimum contacts.\u201d <em>Burger King, </em>471 U.S. at 472-473, 476, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528. For purposes of specific jurisdiction, \u201cminimum contacts\u201d exist when the nonresident defendant\u2019s purposeful and related contacts \u201ccreate a \u2018substantial connection\u2019 with the forum State.\u201d Id. at 475, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528. Personal jurisdiction is proper under such circumstances because the defendant \u201cshould reasonably anticipate being haled into court\u201d in the forum state. Id. at 474, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528, quoting <em>Worldr-Wide Volkswagen, </em>444 U.S. at 297, 100 S.Ct. 559, 62 L.Ed.2d 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">{\u00b6 29} If the court concludes that a defendant has established the requisite \u201cminimum contacts\u201d with the forum state under specific jurisdiction, the court next examines whether asserting personal jurisdiction over the defendant comports with \u201c \u2018fair play and substantial justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Burger King, </em>471 U.S. at 476, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528, quoting <em>Internatl. Shoe, </em>326 U.S. at 320, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95. In particular, the court evaluates: \u201c \u2018the burden on the defendant,\u2019 \u2018the forum State\u2019s interest in adjudicating the dispute,\u2019 \u2018the plaintiffs interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief,\u2019 \u2018the interstate judicial system\u2019s interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies,\u2019 and the \u2018shared interest of the several States in furthering fundamental substantive social policies.\u2019 \u201d <em>Burger King </em>at 477, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528, quoting <em>Worldr-Wide Volkswagen, </em>444 U.S. at 292, 100 S.Ct. 559, 62 L.Ed.2d 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">{\u00b6 30} In <em>Gallert, </em>4 F.Supp.2d at 830, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana held that the due process clause precluded it from exercising specific jurisdiction over nonresident defendants. In <em>Gallert, </em>the plaintiff sued Thatcher Plastic and its parent company, Courtaulds Packaging Company, for wrongful employment termination. Courtaulds was a West Virginia company, and Thatcher Plastic was headquartered in Illinois. The plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>resided in Indiana and maintained a sales office in his Indiana home. Additionally, the plaintiff \u201c \u2018had a facsimile machine and telephone in his residence that he used to communicate with\u2019 \u201d Thatcher Plastic. Id. at 828. Moreover, the plaintiff had worked with Thatcher Plastic for more than 13 years as a sales representative, and the plaintiff had been responsible for selling in Indiana for more than five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">{\u00b6 31} In concluding that it did not have specific jurisdiction over the defendants, the trial court noted that the plaintiff \u201cwas the Thatcher Plastic division\u2019s only employee in Indiana, and that Thatcher Plastic\u2019s sales in Indiana were not very significant.\u201d Id., 4 F.Supp.2d at 830. Moreover, the trial court noted that management made decisions in Illinois to hire and subsequently terminate the plaintiffs employment. Lastly, the trial court found insignificant to the specific-jurisdiction inquiry the communications between the parties. The trial court described the communications as \u201cunilateral activity\u201d that \u201ccannot satisfy the requirement of contact with the forum State.\u201d Id., quoting <em>Nu-Way Systems v. Belmont Marketing </em>(C.A.7, 1980), 635 F.2d 617, 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">{\u00b6 32} Here, like <em>Gallert, </em>the record establishes that appellees\u2019 decision to create and terminate the independent-contractor arrangement with appellant did not take place in Ohio, given that Stone was never physically in Ohio for business related to appellant\u2019s case, no Cable Tech representatives were in Ohio in matters related to appellant\u2019s case, and Cable Tech has never maintained an office in Ohio. As noted in <em>Gallert, </em>the place where appellees decided to hire and terminate appellant\u2019s employment is a relevant consideration in support of specific jurisdiction. <em>Gallert, </em>4 F.Supp.2d at 830; see, also, <em>Charlesworth v. Marco Mfg. Co. </em>(N.D.Ind.1995), 878 F.Supp. 1196, 1201 (concluding that the trial court did not have specific jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant in a plaintiffs wrongful-employment-termination suit filed in an Indiana federal court by noting that the defendant made decisions in California to hire and terminate the plaintiffs employment).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">{\u00b6 33} Additionally, we find insignificant to the specific jurisdiction inquiry that Stone, on behalf of Cable Tech, responded to appellant\u2019s \u201cunilateral\u201d electronic mail communications that appellant initiated while he was in Ohio. See <em>Gallert, </em>4 F.Supp.2d at 830; see, also, <em>LAK, Inc. v. Deer Creek Enterprises </em>(C.A.6, 1989), 885 F.2d 1293, 1297, 1301 (examining specific jurisdiction on a breach-of-contract case and concluding that minimum contacts did not stem from the plaintiffs attorney originating telephone calls in the forum state to the nonresident defendant\u2019s attorney during pertinent contract negotiations). Similarly, we find it insignificant that Stone, on behalf of Cable Tech, exchanged \u201ca few\u201d telephone communications about the independent-contractor arrangement with appellant while appellant was in Ohio. We recognize that \u201c[a] numerical count of the calls <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>* * * has no talismanic significance,\u201d but note that \u201c[t]he use of interstate facilities such as the telephone and the mail is a \u2018secondary or ancillary\u2019 factor and \u2018cannot alone provide the \u201cminimum contacts\u201d required by due process * * *.\u2019 \u201d <em>LAK, Inc., </em>885 F.2d at 1301, quoting <em>Scullin Steel Co., </em>676 F.2d at 314, and citing <em>Stuart v. Spademan </em>(C.A.5, 1985), 772 F.2d 1185, 1194. Given that the telephone communications merely constitute an \u201cancillary factor,\u201d and considering the other evidence in this case, we do not find the above telephone communications sufficient to establish the requisite \u201cminimum contacts.\u201d <em>LAK, Inc. </em>at 1301. We also apply this \u201cancillary factor\u201d rationale to further find insignificant to the specific jurisdiction inquiry appellant and Stone\u2019s electronic communications. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">{\u00b6 34} Lastly, other circumstances of appellant\u2019s case establish that appellees did not maintain sufficient \u201cminimum contacts\u201d with Ohio in regard to the independent-contractor arrangement they made with appellant. Specifically, an employment agency provided Cable Tech, an Iowa corporation with its principal place of business in Iowa, and Stone, an Iowa resident, information about appellant while appellant was a California resident. In addition, \u201c[m]ost communication[s] that occurred between [appellant] and [Stone] were exchanged via electronic mail or telephone while [appellant] resid[ed] in California * * *.\u2019 \u201d Similarly, Stone was in Iowa during all of his communications with appellant. Likewise, Stone interviewed appellant while appellant was residing in California, and appellant was still residing in California when Cable Tech offered the independent-contractor position. Furthermore, in <em>Gallert, </em>the defendants maintained only one Thatcher Plastic employee in the forum state, and, here, Cable Tech\u2019s business opportunity with Sprint \u201cwas not realized,\u201d and, considering appellant\u2019s complaint, Stone indicated to appellant that it could employ only one technician in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">{\u00b6 35} Thus, through the above evidence, and in light of <em>Gallert, </em>we conclude that appellees\u2019 contacts with Ohio in relation to the independent-contractor arrangement do not rise to the level of a \u201c \u2018substantial connection\u2019 \u201d with Ohio to allow Stone and Cable Tech to \u201creasonably anticipate being haled into court\u201d in Ohio. <em>Burger King, </em>471 U.S. at 474, 475, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528. Accordingly, appellees did not \u201cpurposefully [establish] minimum contacts\u201d in support of specific jurisdiction. See <em>Burger King </em>at 477, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528. Without the requisite \u201cminimum contacts,\u201d our specific jurisdiction inquiry ends, and we need not examine whether asserting personal jurisdiction over appellees comports with \u201c \u2018fair play and substantial justice.\u2019 \u201d Cf. <em>Burger King </em>at 477, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528 (\u201cOnce it has been decided that a defendant purposefully established minimum contacts within the forum State, these contacts may be considered in light of other factors to determine whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>the assertion of personal jurisdiction would comport with \u2018fair play and substantial justice\u2019 \u201d). Because appellees did not establish the requisite \u201cminimum contacts\u201d in regard to the independent-contractor arrangement that they made with appellant, we conclude that the due process clause precluded the trial court from exercising personal jurisdiction over appellees through specific jurisdiction. <em>Burger King </em>at 477, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528; <em>Gallert, </em>4 F.Supp.2d at 829-830.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">{\u00b6 36} In arguing that the trial court had jurisdiction over appellees, appellant also points to contacts that appellees had with Ohio that do not relate to the independent-contractor arrangement. Specifically, appellant notes that Cable Tech has previously hired independent contractors to provide services in the Cleveland area on behalf of Sprint. Appellant also refers to Stone\u2019s statement that he has \u201cnot been in the state of Ohio in the last ten years.\u201d However, such nonrelated contacts are irrelevant to our inquiry because appellant bases his cause of action on the independent-contractor arrangement that appellant was to carry out in Ohio, the forum state, and, as a result, a specific-jurisdiction analysis applies rather than a general-jurisdiction analysis that would consider such nonrelated contacts. See <em>Helicopteros, </em>466 U.S. at 414, 104 S.Ct. 1868, 80 L.Ed.2d 404, fn. 8-9. Nonetheless, for the following reasons, we conclude that appellees\u2019 nonrelated contacts with Ohio did not evoke personal jurisdiction over them through general jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">{\u00b6 37} A court may exercise general jurisdiction over a defendant who has \u201ccontinuous and systematic\u201d contacts with the forum state. <em>Helicopteros, </em>466 U.S. at 416, 104 S.Ct. 1868, 80 L.Ed.2d 404. General jurisdiction requires \u201ca greater amount of contacts\u201d than specific jurisdiction. <em>Charlesworth, </em>878 F.Supp. at 1200. Under general jurisdiction, the contacts must be \u201c \u2018so substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit against [the defendant] on causes of action arising from dealings entirely distinct from those activities.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gallert, </em>4 F.Supp.2d at 831, quoting <em>Internatl. Shoe, </em>326 U.S. at 318, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">{\u00b6 38} In <em>Helicopteros, </em>the plaintiffs instituted a wrongful-death action in a Texas state court against parties that included a Columbian corporation, Helic\u00f3pteros Nacionales de Colombia (\u201cHelicol\u201d). The plaintiffs instituted the action after individuals died in a crash in Peru involving a helicopter that Helicol owned. The United States Supreme Court held that the Texas court did not have general jurisdiction over Helicol because Helicol did not have \u201ccontinuous and systematic\u201d contacts with Texas. Id., 466 U.S. at 416, 104 S.Ct. 1868, 80 L.Ed.2d 404. The court stated that \u201ccontinuous and systematic\u201d contacts did not stem from Helicol sending a representative to Texas to negotiate a joint venture, or from Helicol receiving from the agreed upon joint venture over $5 million in payments drawn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>on a Texas bank account. Id. at 410-411, 416, 104 S.Ct. 1868, 80 L.Ed.2d 404. In so concluding, the court noted that the representative made only one trip to Texas to negotiate the joint venture, and the court held that the check payment constituted a \u201cunilateral activity\u201d with no indication that Helicol ever requested that the checks be drawn on a Texas bank account. Id. at 416-417, 104 S.Ct. 1868, 80 L.Ed.2d 404, citing <em>Kulko v. California Superior Court </em>(1978), 436 U.S. 84, 93, 98 S.Ct. 1690, 56 L.Ed.2d 132. The court also rejected general jurisdiction despite Helicol\u2019s purchasing 80 percent of its helicopter fleet from a Texas company, or Helicol\u2019s purchasing $4 million in parts and accessories from a Texas company. The court reasoned that \u201cpurchases and related trips, standing alone, are not a sufficient basis for a State\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Helicopteros </em>at 417, 104 S.Ct. 1868, 80 L.Ed.2d 404. Lastly, the court concluded that general jurisdiction did not stem from Helicol sending pilots, managers, and maintenance personnel to Texas for training. The court described the training as a \u201cbrief presence of Helicol employees in Texas\u201d that did not amount to a \u201ccontinuous and systematic\u201d contact. Id. at 416, 418, 104 S.Ct. 1868, 80 L.Ed.2d 404. In declining general jurisdiction, the court also emphasized that \u201cHelicol does not have a place of business in Texas and never has been licensed to do business in the State\u201d and that Helicol \u201cnever has maintained an office or establishment\u201d in Texas. Id. at 411, 416, 104 S.Ct. 1868, 80 L.Ed.2d 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">{\u00b6 39} Here, Cable Tech has far fewer contacts with Ohio than did Helicol with Texas in <em>Helic\u00f3pteros. </em>When, as appellant mentions, Cable Tech hired independent contractors for work in the Cleveland area, the work equated \u201cto less than 25 total hours.\u201d Under <em>Helic\u00f3pteros, </em>such brief presence in Ohio does not rise to the level of a \u201ccontinuous and systematic\u201d contact. Id., 466 U.S. at 416, 418, 104 S.Ct. 1868, 80 L.Ed.2d 404. Additionally, Sprint, a non-Ohio-based company, paid for the independent-contractor work through its office in Kansas, demonstrating further disconnect from Ohio. We also recognize that, as in <em>Helicopteros, </em>Cable Tech has never been licensed to do business in Ohio and has never maintained an office in Ohio. Accordingly, pursuant to <em>Helicopteros, </em>Cable Tech lacks the ongoing contacts with Ohio that would rise to the level of \u201ccontinuous and systematic.\u201d Id. at 416, 104 S.Ct. 1868, 80 L.Ed.2d 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">{\u00b6 40} We also conclude that Stone lacks \u201ccontinuous and systematic\u201d contacts with Ohio. See <em>Helicopteros, </em>466 U.S. at 416, 104 S.Ct. 1868, 80 L.Ed.2d 404. Again, appellant refers to Stone\u2019s indication that he has \u201cnot been in the state of Ohio in the last ten years.\u201d As in <em>Helic\u00f3pteros, </em>Stone\u2019s long-ago visit to Ohio merely amounts to a \u201cbrief presence,\u201d and does not equate to \u201ccontinuous and systematic.\u201d Id. at 416, 418, 104 S.Ct. 1868, 80 L.Ed.2d 404. Furthermore, Stone is an Iowa resident and has never been in Ohio on Cable Tech\u2019s behalf. Additionally, Stone was not involved in the limited services that Cable Tech <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>provided for Sprint in the Cleveland area, and we cannot apply such activities of Cable Tech to exert jurisdiction over Stone. See <em>Balance Dynamics Corp. v. Schmitt Industries, Inc. </em>(C.A.6, 2000), 204 F.3d 683, 698, quoting <em>Weller v. Cromwell Oil Co. </em>(C.A.6, 1974), 504 F.2d 927, 929 (\u201cjurisdiction over the individual officers of a corporation cannot be predicated merely upon jurisdiction over the corporation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">{\u00b6 41} Lastly, appellees\u2019 contacts from this present action did not culminate in \u201ccontinuous and systematic\u201d contacts with Ohio, given Cable Tech\u2019s claim that the business opportunity with Sprint \u201cwas not realized.\u201d Cf. <em>Gallert, </em>4 F.Supp.2d at 831-832, citing <em>Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc. </em>(1984), 465 U.S. 770, 774, 104 S.Ct. 1473, 79 L.Ed.2d 790 (noting that \u201c[c]ontacts related to the dispute, though alone insufficient for specific jurisdiction, may be considered along with other contacts in determining general jurisdiction\u201d and holding that, although the trial court did not have specific jurisdiction over a defendant and its parent corporation, the court had general jurisdiction through the parent corporation\u2019s nonrelated contacts with the forum).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">{\u00b6 42} Because neither Cable Tech nor Stone has maintained the high threshold for \u201ccontinuous and systematic\u201d contacts with Ohio, we.conclude that the due process clause precluded the trial court from exercising personal jurisdiction over Cable Tech or Stone through general jurisdiction. See <em>Helicopteros, </em>466 U.S. at 416, 104 S.Ct. 1868, 80 L.Ed.2d 404; <em>Charlesworth, </em>878 F.Supp. at 1200.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">{\u00b6 43} Thus, the Fourteenth Amendment due process clause precluded the trial court from exercising such personal jurisdiction because appellees lack the requisite \u201cminimum contacts\u201d under either specific or general jurisdiction. See <em>Worldr-Wide Volkswagen, </em>444 U.S. at 291, 100 S.Ct. 559, 62 L.Ed.2d 490; <em>Burger King, </em>471 U.S. at 476, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528; <em>Helicopteros, </em>466 U.S. at 416, 104 S.Ct. 1868, 80 L.Ed.2d 404. Therefore, we conclude that the trial court did not err in finding that it lacked personal jurisdiction over appellees and in granting appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. Therefore, we overrule appellant\u2019s single assignment of error and affirm the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b536-9\">Brown, P.J., and McGrath, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
