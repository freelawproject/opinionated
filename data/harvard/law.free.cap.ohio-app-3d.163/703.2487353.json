Painter, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">{\u00b6 1} Petitioner-appellant, James E. Miller, presents on appeal a single assignment of error, in which he contends that the Hamilton County Common Pleas Court erred when it dismissed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus and his petition for postconviction relief. We affirm the common pleas court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-12\">{\u00b6 2} In August 2003, the Hamilton County Municipal Court, following a trial to the court, found Miller guilty of assault and sentenced him to community control. Miller took no direct appeal from his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-13\">{\u00b6 3} He instead filed with the municipal court a postconviction petition seeking relief from his conviction under R.C. 2953.21 on the ground that he had been denied the effective assistance of counsel when his trial counsel failed to demand a jury trial. The municipal court denied the petition upon its determination that it had no jurisdiction to entertain it. The court dismissed the petition on the authority of <em>State v. Cowan, </em>in which the Ohio Supreme Court held that \u201c[a] municipal court is without jurisdiction to review a petition for postconviction relief filed pursuant to R.C. 2953.21.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Miller, again, did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-14\">{\u00b6 4} Instead, he presented the same ground for relief to the common pleas court in the form of a postconviction petition and a petition under R.C. 2725.04 seeking a writ of habeas corpus. The common pleas court dismissed both petitions, and Miller appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>\n<em>I. Postconviction Petition.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">{\u00b6 5} The common pleas court dismissed Miller\u2019s postconviction petition upon its determination that Miller should have raised his claim in a direct appeal from his conviction. \u201cUnder the doctrine of res judicata, a final judgment of conviction bars a convicted defendant who was represented by counsel from raising and litigating in any proceeding^] except an appeal from that judgment, any defense or any claimed lack of due process that was raised or could have been raised by the defendant at the trial [that] resulted in that judgment of conviction[ ] or on an appeal from that judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, a common pleas court may apply the doctrine of res judicata to dismiss a postconviction claim if the claim presents a matter that can fairly be determined without resort to evidence outside the record.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">{\u00b6 6} But the doctrine of res judicata did not operate to bar Miller\u2019s claim. Miller offered in support of his petition his own affidavit, in which he averred that he had, on three separate occasions, asked his trial counsel to demand a jury trial. His counsel\u2019s failure to accede to these requests provided the fundament for Miller\u2019s postconviction challenge to his counsel\u2019s competence. Miller thus offered outside evidence in support of his postconviction challenge to trial counsel\u2019s performance, and the claim depended for its resolution upon that evidence \u2014 he could not have presented it on direct appeal. Accordingly, we conclude that Miller\u2019s postconviction claim was not subject to dismissal under the doctrine of res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">{\u00b6 7} Our conclusion does not, however, compel us to reverse, because the court properly denied Miller\u2019s petition, albeit for the wrong reason.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">{\u00b6 8} Even though the postconviction statutes permit a petition to be filed by \u201c[a]ny person who has been convicted of a criminal offense,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Ohio Supreme Court has read the language of those statutes to imply that the General Assembly did not intend to confer jurisdiction to entertain a postconviction petition upon a municipal court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Evidently, the court found the term \u201cany\u201d to be ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>{\u00b6 9} The statutes require that a postconviction petitioner file his petition with the court that sentenced him. Thus, a postconviction petitioner may seek relief only from a judgment of conviction entered by a common pleas court. It\u2019s a classic <em>Catch-22 </em>situation: if an aspiring petitioner is sentenced in municipal court, he has no right to postconviction relief. So one may be deprived of constitutional rights with impunity in municipal court and have no remedy? The Ohio Supreme Court evidently did not apprehend this absurdity.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">{\u00b6 10} Miller, in his postconviction petition, sought relief from his municipal-court conviction. Because the Ohio Supreme Court has held that the postconviction statutes provide relief only from a common-pleas-court conviction, the court below properly dismissed his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">\n<em>II. Habeas Corpus.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">{\u00b6 11} Turning to Miller\u2019s challenge to the dismissal of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, we note that R.C. 2725.01 et seq. permits a person who has been \u201cunlawfully restrained of his liberty\u201d to apply for a writ of habeas corpus \u201cto inquire into the cause of such imprisonment, restraint, or deprivation.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Miller sought a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that he had been restrained of his liberty in violation of his constitutionally secured rights to a jury trial and to the effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">{\u00b6 12} A writ of habeas corpus is an equitable remedy and thus will not lie when the petitioner has an adequate legal remedy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The common pleas court essentially found that Miller had an adequate legal remedy when it dismissed his habeas corpus petition upon its determination that he should have raised his claim in a direct appeal from his conviction. But Miller could not have raised on direct appeal the challenge to counsel\u2019s competence advanced in his habeas corpus petition, because the challenge depended for its resolution on evidence outside the record. Thus, the availability of a direct appeal did not provide Miller with an adequate legal remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">{\u00b6 13} The availability of the postconviction remedies afforded by R.C. 2953.21 et seq. also provides a basis for denying a writ of habeas corpus.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But the postconviction statutes afford relief only from a common-pleas-court conviction, while Miller sought relief from his municipal-court conviction. Thus, the postconviction statutes could not be said to have provided Miller with an adequate legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>remedy. We, therefore, conclude that Miller\u2019s habeas corpus petition was not subject to dismissal on the ground that he had an adequate legal remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">{\u00b6 14} Again, this conclusion does not compel us to reverse the judgment. Again, the court was right accidentally.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In <em>Harrod v. Harris,</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we denied a writ of habeas corpus to a petitioner who was under postrelease control, citing the \u201clong[-]held\u201d rule that the habeas corpus statutes provide a remedy \u201conly when the petitioner is presently in confinement.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We defined \u201cconfinement\u201d as \u201cthe actual physical custody of the state,\u201d and we rejected the petitioner\u2019s argument that postrelease control was \u201ctantamount to confinement due to its attendant restraints on his liberty.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">{\u00b6 15} The municipal court sentenced Miller to community control. Thus, Miller was not in the actual physical custody of the state. We, therefore, hold that the common pleas court properly dismissed Miller\u2019s habeas corpus petition, because the habeas corpus statutes afforded him no remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">\n<em>III. No Remedy?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">{\u00b6 16} Obviously, there must be a remedy, else anyone denied the right to a jury trial in municipal court would simply be out of luck. That situation cannot be permitted to occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">{\u00b6 17} We note that Crim.R. 57(B) provides that \u201c[i]f no procedure is specifically prescribed by rule, [a] court may proceed in any lawful manner not inconsistent with these rules of criminal procedure, and shall look to the rules of civil procedure and to the applicable law if no rule of criminal procedure exists.\u201d The criminal rules thus contemplate resort to the civil rules for procedures not anticipated by the criminal rules. And Civ.R. 60(B)(5) permits relief from a judgment for \u201cany * * * reason justifying [such] relief.\u201d It follows that Civ.R. 60(B) may afford a criminal defendant relief from a judgment of conviction.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>{\u00b6 18} But Miller unambiguously invoked R.C. 2953.21 in seeking postconviction relief and R.C. 2725.0 in seeking a writ of habeas corpus. Therefore, neither his postconviction petition nor his habeas corpus petition could have been recast and reviewed as a Civ.R. 60(B) motion for relief from judgment.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">\n<em>TV. Conclusion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">{\u00b6 19} Upon our determination that the common pleas court properly dismissed Miller\u2019s postconviction and habeas corpus petitions, we overrule his assignment of error. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b749-8\">Doan, P.J., and Hildebrandt, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b745-15\">. 101 Ohio St.3d 372, 2004-Ohio-1583, 805 N.E.2d 1085, syllabus.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b746-8\">. <em>State v.
