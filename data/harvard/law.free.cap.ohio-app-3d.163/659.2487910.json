Coles and others, have filed a motion to remand this case to the trial court for the purpose of ruling on a pending motion for relief from judgment pursuant to Civ.R. 60(B). Defendant-appellee, Lawyers Title Insurance Corporation, opposes the remand and moves the court for an order dismissing appellants\u2019 appeal, alleging that it was not timely -filed. Appellants respond with a memorandum in opposition to appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-11\">{\u00b6 2} We will first address the issue of timeliness of the appeal. The trial court judge in this case granted summary judgment to defendant, Lawyers Title, in a judgment entry signed and file-stamped on June 28, 2005. The judgment was entered on the court\u2019s journal on July 1, 2005. The appearance docket contains an entry dated July 18, 2005, which reads, \u201cCopies of \u2018J.E.\u2019, filed on June 28, 2005, Sent regular Mail to D. Jeffery Rengel, Darrell A. Clay [the attorneys in this case].\u201d On August 17, 2005, appellants filed a notice of appeal from the July 1, 2005 judgment. Appellee states that since the notice of appeal was filed more than 30 days after July 1, it was late, and the appeal should be dismissed. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-12\">{\u00b6 3} App.R. 4 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b701-13\">{\u00b6 4} \u201c(A) Time for appeal. A party shall file the notice of appeal required by App.R. 3 within thirty days of the later of entry of the judgment or order appealed or, in a civil case, service of the notice of judgment and its entry if service is not made on the party within the three day period in Rule 58(B) of the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-14\">{\u00b6 5} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b701-15\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c(D) As used in this rule, \u2018entry\u2019 or \u2018entered\u2019 means when a judgment or order is entered under Civ.R. 58(A) or Crim.R. 32(C).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-16\">{\u00b6 7} Civ.R. 58(B) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b702-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>{\u00b6 8} \u201c(B) Notice of filing. When the court signs a judgment, the court shall endorse thereon a direction to the clerk to serve upon all parties not in default for failure to appear notice of the judgment and its date of entry upon the journal. Within three days of <em>entering the judgment upon the journal, the clerk shall serve the parties in a manner prescribed by Civ.R. 5(B) and note the service in the appearance docket. </em>Upon serving the notice and notation of the service in the appearance docket, the service is complete. The failure of the clerk to serve notice does not affect the validity of the judgment or the running of the time for appeal except as provided in App.R. 4(A).\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">{\u00b6 9} It follows that the deadline for filing the notice of appeal in this case was 80 days from July 1, 2005 or, if Civ.R. 58(B) was not complied with by the clerk of court, 30 days from the date the clerk served appellants\u2019 counsel, in a manner prescribed by Civ.R. 5(B), with notice of the judgment and its entry on the journal and recordation of that service in the appearance docket. In this case, the appearance docket indicates service by regular mail on July 18, 2005. Appellee, however, states that service was accomplished within three days of June 28, 2005, when a copy of the judgment entry was placed in appellants\u2019 attorney\u2019s \u201ccourthouse mailbox.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">{\u00b6 10} The basis of appellee\u2019s contention that service was accomplished within three days of June 28, 2005, is an affidavit of Beth A. Naufel, which states that (1) she is the civil bailiff for the Erie County Court of Common Pleas, (2) \u201clocal counsel\u201d have individual mailboxes, set up by the clerk of courts, at the courthouse, (3) the clerk of courts timely puts all \u201cnotices, pleadings and entries\u201d in the local counsel\u2019s mailboxes after they are filed, and (4) \u201cto the best of [her] knowledge\u201d the \u201ccourt\u201d placed a copy of the judgment entry granting defendant summary judgment in plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\u2019s courthouse mailbox within three days of June 28, 2005 [the date it was file-stamped],</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">{\u00b6 11} Appellee states that this procedure of placing the final judgment entry in appellants\u2019 counsel\u2019s courthouse mailbox is proper service pursuant to Civ.R. 5(B), which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cService: * * * Service upon the attorney or party shall be made by delivering a copy to the person to be served, transmitting it to the office of the person to be served by facsimile transmission, mailing it to the last known address of the person to be served or, if no address is known, leaving it with the clerk of the court. * * * \u2018Delivering a copy\u2019 within this rule means: handing it to the attorney or party; leaving it at the office of the person to be served with a clerk or other person in charge; if there is no one in charge, leaving it in a conspicuous place in the office; or, if the office is closed or the person to be served has no office, leaving it at the dwelling house or usual place of abode of the person to be served with some person of suitable age and discretion then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>residing in the dwelling house or usual place of abode. Service by mail is complete upon mailing. Service by facsimile transmission is complete upon transmission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">{\u00b6 13} Appellee states that placing the judgment in the courthouse mailbox is:</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c[T]he functional equivalent of actual physical delivery to the attorney. * * * Placing papers in a mailbox reserved for the attorney, a mailbox as to which that attorney has knowledge, and as to which long-standing custom and usage in the county imposes the obligation to retrieve important papers from, accomplishes all the same goals as does actual physical delivery, while simultaneously freeing the Clerk of Court from the onerous obligation of physically handing the papers to counsel. * * * Leaving a copy of an entry in Counsel\u2019s attorney mailbox is also the functional equivalent of mailing it to that attorney\u2019s office * * *. [T]he mailbox in question is reserved for the exclusive use of delivering papers to counsel, much as a post office box at a United States post office accomplishes the same thing with regard to mail from other senders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">{\u00b6 15} The Fifth District Court of Appeals has addressed this issue in <em>Cole v. Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(Oct. 16, 1995), 5th Dist. No. 1995CA00066, 1995 WL 617610, where the court held, \u201cLeaving the entry in the [courthouse] mailbox of Appellant\u2019s attorney is not a prescribed method of service required by Civ.R. 58(B) and 5(B).\u201d We agree; nothing in Civ.R. 5(B) even suggests that the clerk carries out the duty of serving notice of a final judgment on a party\u2019s counsel by placing a copy of that judgment in a courthouse mailbox. We also agree with appellants\u2019 statement that a locked, numbered United States Post Office Box is \u201ca far cry from an unlocked hanging file folder situated on the front desk of the Erie County Clerk\u2019s Office, which is readily visible by and accessible to any number of people who walk into the unlocked clerk\u2019s office on a daily basis.\u201d Further, we do not find that requiring the clerk of court to properly serve counsel with notice of final judgments is an \u201conerous obligation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">{\u00b6 16} Therefore, we find that Civ.R. 58(B) was not followed in this case and that leaving a copy of a final judgment entry in an attorney\u2019s \u201ccourthouse mailbox\u201d is not service pursuant to Civ.R. 5(B). In this case, Civ.R. 5(B) service was accomplished by regular mail on July 18, 2005, and the notice of appeal was filed on August 17, 2005; therefore, the appeal is timely, and the motion to dismiss is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">{\u00b6 17} We are compelled to comment further on the procedure used by the clerk of court in this case, since we find that even if putting a copy of a final decision in an attorney\u2019s \u201ccourthouse mailbox\u201d were proper Civ.R. 5(B) service, Civ.R. 58(B) requires more. Several formalities must be observed when a judge enters a final judgment, and unless these formalities are followed, the parties are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>denied due process. See <em>Atkinson v. Grumman Ohio Corp. </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 80, 86, 523 N.E.2d 851, where the court states:</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cThese rules are to be applied in all courts of this state in the exercise of civil jurisdiction at law, or in equity, except as stated in Civ.R. 1(C). The rules are:</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cA. Within three days of the entry of any final appealable judgment or order, the clerk of courts shall serve a notice of the entry in any manner provided in Civ.R. 5, upon every party who is not in default for failure to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cB. The clerk shall make a notation in the case docket indicating that the required service has been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cC. Once the clerk has served notice of the entry and entered the appropriate notation in the docket, the notice shall be deemed to have been served. The failure of any party to receive such notice shall not affect the validity of the judgment or the running of the time for appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">{\u00b6 22} In the instant case, few of these formalities were observed. Initially, Civ.R. 58(B) requires that when the court signs a judgment,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the judge \u201cshall endorse thereon a direction to the clerk to serve upon all parties not in default for failure to appear notice of the judgment and its date of entry upon the journal.\u201d The final entry in this case does not contain such an endorsement, the purpose of which is to notify the clerk of courts that the judge considers the decision to be an appealable order pursuant to R.C. 2505.02 and which must be entered upon the court\u2019s journal within 30 days pursuant to Sup.R. 7(A), which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cThe judgment entry specified in Civil Rule 58 and in Criminal Rule 32 shall be filed and journalized within thirty days of the verdict, decree, or decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">{\u00b6 24} Once a judgment has been journalized, the clerk of court is required, within three days, to notify \u201call parties not in default for failure to appear\u201d that a final judgment has been entered and to advise them of the date that the final judgment was entered upon the court\u2019s journal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Finally, the clerk must note in the appearance docket the date that the notice was given. If the Civ.R. 58(B) service does not occur within three days, the time to appeal does not begin to run until service is made and noted in the appearance docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>{\u00b6 25} In this case, the clerk apparently left a copy of the final judgment in the attorneys\u2019 courthouse mailbox prior to the date that judgment was entered on the journal. Even if the courthouse mailbox delivery were proper service, the notice would be defective because it does not serve to inform the parties of when the time to file a notice of appeal begins to run. App.R. 4. In addition, even if leaving a copy of the decision in the courthouse mailbox had been adequate service, there is no notation in the appearance docket as to when that was done, as required by Civ.R. 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">{\u00b6 26} Finally, we note that the court\u2019s appearance docket in this case has an incorrect entry. The following entry dated June 28, 2005, reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cJ.E. filed. Deft., Lawyers Title Insurance Corp.\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED. Pltfs\u2019 claims against Lawyers Title Insurance Company are DISMISSED with prejudice at pltfs.\u2019 Costs. 494-508-494.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">{\u00b6 28} The final judgment signed by the judge contains the following notation at the bottom: \u201cJ494/508 7-1-05,\u201d which we assume means that the judgment was journalized at book 494, page 508 on July 1, 2005, not on June 28, 2005. This contradiction between the appearance docket and the actual judgment entry as to the date the judgment was entered in the journal is problematic to the parties and the appellate court, who are all charged with the duty of determining when a notice of appeal has been timely filed. The appearance docket should indicate the actual date of journalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">{\u00b6 29} Turning to appellants\u2019 motion to remand this case to the trial court so it can rule on the pending Civ.R. 60(B) motion, the Supreme Court of Ohio has held, in <em>Howard v. Catholic Social Serv. of Cuyahoga Cty., Inc. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 141, 147, 637 N.E.2d 890, that \u201can appeal divests trial courts of jurisdiction to consider Civ.R. 60(B) motions for relief from judgment.\u201d See, also, <em>Majnaric v. Majnaric </em>(1975), 46 Ohio App.2d 157, 75 0.0.2d 250, 347 N.E.2d 552, where the court states:</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cWhere a motion to vacate a judgment is pending in the trial court and an appeal is also pending from the same judgment, the appellant may move the appellate court, for good cause, to remand the matter to the trial court for a hearing on the motion to vacate. Sustaining such a motion will not divest the appellate court of jurisdiction to hear the pending appeal if it is not rendered moot by the hearing on the motion to vacate.\u201d Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">{\u00b6 31} We find the motion to remand well taken, and it is granted. The court remands this case to the Erie County Court of Common Pleas for a period of 30 days from the date of this decision and judgment entry for the purpose of allowing that court to rule on the pending Civ.R. 60(B) motion. The proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>in this court are stayed until further order of the court. The clerk of the Erie County Court of Common Pleas shall notify this court when the trial court judge has ruled on the Civ.R. 60(B) motion. It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b706-5\">Singer, P.J., Handwork and Parish, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b704-12\">. \"Judgment\u201d is defined in Civ.R. 54(A) as \"a decree and any order from which an appeal lies as provided in Section 2505.02 of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b704-13\">.
