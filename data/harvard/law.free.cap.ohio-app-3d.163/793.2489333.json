Her husband, James Furnier, drove her to the office of her family physician, defendant-appellee Dr. Edwin E. Gallenstein. Gallenstein advised Machiko to go directly to Providence Hospital\u2019s emergency room because he was concerned that her symptoms could be related to heart disease. Gallenstein telephoned the emergency room and informed the physician on duty, defendant-appellee Dr. Timothy W. Drury, of Machiko\u2019s symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">{\u00b6 2} When the Furniers arrived at the emergency room, the staff took Machiko\u2019s medical history. Tests were ordered, including an electrocardiogram that showed no abnormal results. Machiko was given a gastrointestinal (\u201cGI\u201d) cocktail. Machiko\u2019s symptoms appeared to abate after she drank the GI cocktail. She was diagnosed with esophagitis, a gastrointestinal disorder. Drury discharged Machiko with a prescription for Tagamet and with instructions to follow up with Dr. Gallenstein in a few days. Machiko took the Tagamet over the next several weeks, but on occasion she suffered from similar symptoms. Machiko saw Dr. Gallenstein three times during those weeks, and he continued to treat her for esophagitis.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">{\u00b6 3} On the morning of May 12, 1994, Machiko again experienced shortness of breath, chest pain, and radiating arm pain. The Tagamet she took did not improve her condition. Eventually, Machiko stopped breathing. James called for emergency assistance. While he waited, James attempted mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Paramedics arrived and noted that Machiko\u2019s heart had stopped beating. They were unable to revive her and transported her to the hospital, where she was placed on life support. Machiko died four days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">{\u00b6 4} James, as administrator of Machiko\u2019s estate (hereinafter the administrator will be referred to as \u201cFurnier,\u201d and the first names of the Furniers will be used where appropriate to differentiate between them), filed a wrongful-death and survival action against Dr. Gallenstein, Dr. Drury, and Drury\u2019s employer, defendant-appellee Qualified Emergency Specialists, Inc. (\u201cQES\u201d) alleging that if they had properly diagnosed Machiko with coronary-artery disease and treated her accordingly, she would not have suffered a heart attack on May 12, 1994, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>she would not have died four days later. The ease went to trial in 1998. Following Furnier\u2019s case-in-chief, defense counsel moved for a directed verdict in favor of all defendants. The trial court granted defense counsel\u2019s motion. Furnier appealed and we reversed the trial court\u2019s decision. We held that Furnier had presented substantial competent evidence to establish a prima facie case of medical malpractice to support the wrongful-death and survival claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">{\u00b6 5} On May 8, 2000, James Furnier died. The Furniers\u2019 son, Robert, was substituted as administrator and plaintiff in the action. The retrial of the case in December 2000 resulted in a jury verdict in favor of all defendants. Furnier has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">{\u00b6 6} The first assignment of error alleges that the trial court erred in permitting defense counsel to make improper and inflammatory arguments to the jury during opening statements to the effect that Robert Furnier, his counsel, and his experts had \u201cmanufactured\u201d the case against the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">{\u00b6 7} During opening statement, over objections by Furnier\u2019s counsel, defense counsel stated to the jury, \u201cNow, I\u2019ll tell you this. I really resent, on behalf of these doctors, anybody standing up in front of this jury and telling you that these doctors, Dr. Gallenstein, who saw Mrs. Furnier 315 times, 315 times, from 1966 to 1994, that he\u2019d just [throw] her away. Now, I submit to you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you\u2019re going to find something in this case. It\u2019s a fascinating case for a lot of reasons, but this is a case, I submit to you, that has been totally orchestrated by Mrs. Furnier\u2019s son, Robert, who happens to be a lawyer. * * * I don\u2019t know where I left off, but Robert Furnier is the son of Mrs. Furnier. Robert Furnier is a lawyer. He\u2019s also the administrator of the estate and the beneficiary. Robert Furnier\u2019s partner is Mr. Thomas. Robert Furnier files this lawsuit. * * * This is science, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, and I ask you, as I did when we were impaneling you, to bring to bear in this case your background, your education, your training, your instincts in this case, and you make the plaintiffs prove this case within the confines of medicine, not just throwing something up against the wall so they can get some money. * * * And, frankly, I think if [Mrs. Furnier] were here, she\u2019d be outraged that [Dr. Gallenstein has] been sued.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">{\u00b6 8} Regarding Furnier\u2019s experts, defense counsel stated to the jury, \u201cLet\u2019s start first with what I expect to see; the three alleged experts they\u2019re going to bring into this courtroom to try to prove this case, all three of whom work for a professional expert service. The name that you\u2019ll hear in this trial is Elliott Stone. Sounds like a movie star, but he\u2019s not. He\u2019s a lawyer from New York who developed, some years ago, a panel where he would get expert medical people to contract with lawyers so they could file lawsuits against doctors and present testimony. Elliott Stone is the one who brought and found these three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>experts that you\u2019re going to hear: Dr. Siegel, Dr. McTague, and it\u2019s Dr. Ferentz. You will hear the testimony of Dr. Ferentz, this guy from Baltimore. He will tell you that at least 80 times he\u2019s contracted with Elliott Stone to give testimony in cases, and Dr. Siegel, this cardiologist from New York, and Dr. McTague, who\u2019s the emergency room doctor, will tell you that he\u2019s in law school, he\u2019s going to be a lawyer. * * * And they\u2019re going to bring into this courtroom, through these transcripts, three individuals who have been paid to tell you that [D]octors Gallenstein and Drury made a mistake, and that mistake did something to Mrs. Furnier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c[T]he function of an opening statement by counsel in a jury trial is to inform the jury in a concise and orderly way of the nature of the case and the questions involved, and to outline the facts intended to be proved. * * * Counsel should be accorded latitude by the trial court in making his opening statement, but when he deliberately attempts to influence and sway the jury by a recital of matters foreign to the case, which matters he knows or ought to know cannot be shown by competent or admissible evidence, or when he makes a statement through accident, inadvertence or misconception which is improper and patently harmful to the opposing side, it may constitute the basis for ordering a new trial or for the reversal by a reviewing court of a judgment favorable to the party represented by such counsel.\u201d See <em>Maggio v. Cleveland </em>(1949), 151 Ohio St. 136, 38 O.O. 578, 84 N.E.2d 912, paragraphs one and two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cRemarks which are not warranted by the evidence and are designed to arouse passion or prejudice to the extent that there is a substantial likelihood that the jury may be misled may constitute prejudicial error.\u201d See <em>Jones v. Olcese </em>(1991), 75 Ohio App.3d 34, 598 N.E.2d 853. \u201cWhen argument spills into disparagement not based on any evidence, it is improper.\u201d See <em>Clark v. Doe </em>(1997), 119 Ohio App.3d 296, 695 N.E.2d 276, citing <em>Cusumano v. Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. </em>(1967), 9 Ohio App.2d 105, 38 O.O.2d 132, 223 N.E.2d 477. Counsel is obligated to refrain from unwarranted attacks on opposing counsel, the opposing party, and the witnesses. See <em>Jones v. Macedonia-Northfield Banking Co. </em>(1937), 132 Ohio St. 341, 8 O.O. 108, 7 N.E.2d 544; <em>Dillon v. Bundy </em>(1991), 72 Ohio App.3d 767, 596 N.E.2d 500. It is the trial court\u2019s duty to see that counsel\u2019s statements are confined to proper limits. See <em>Clark v. Doe, </em>supra. Abusive comments directed at opposing counsel, the opposing party, and the opposing party\u2019s witnesses should not be permitted. See <em>Pesek v. Univ. Neurologists Assn., Inc. </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 495, 721 N.E.2d 1011. If there is room for doubt about whether counsel\u2019s improper remarks may have influenced the outcome of the case, that doubt should be resolved in favor of the losing party. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">{\u00b6 11} In the instant case, defense counsel\u2019s message to the jury was clear: lawyer Robert Furnier used his wiles to orchestrate or manufacture a baseless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>lawsuit against his mother\u2019s doctors in order to get money. Defense counsel implied to the jury that Robert Furnier and his counsel went to another lawyer in New York in order to find medical experts who would assist in building a baseless lawsuit against Machiko Furnier\u2019s doctors. Defense counsel went so far as to suggest that Machiko Furnier would have been \u201coutraged\u201d at her son\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">{\u00b6 12} We point out that Machiko\u2019s husband, James, as administrator, originally filed the lawsuit against his wife\u2019s doctors. Robert was merely substituted as administrator and plaintiff when his father died. There is no evidence in the record to suggest that Robert Furnier or anyone else \u201corchestrated\u201d or \u201cmanufactured\u201d a frivolous lawsuit. To the contrary, we held in the prior appeal that Furnier had presented substantial competent evidence to establish a prima facie case of medical malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">{\u00b6 13} Defense counsel\u2019s remarks were clearly designed to arouse the jury\u2019s passion and prejudice. The remarks were improper and beyond the bounds of permissible argument. See <em>Clark v. Doe, </em>supra, 119 Ohio App.3d 296, 695 N.E.2d 276. We hold that the trial court abused its discretion in overruling Furnier\u2019s counsel\u2019s objections to defense counsel\u2019s opening statement. We recognize that Furnier\u2019s counsel did not object to all of the remarks that defense counsel made about Furnier\u2019s experts, but the additional remarks enhanced the prejudicial effect of the remarks to which Furnier\u2019s counsel did object. In light of all the other prejudicial remarks to which Furnier\u2019s counsel objected, after reviewing defense counsel\u2019s opening statement as a whole, we hold that there was a substantial likelihood that the jury was misled and that the verdict was influenced by defense counsel\u2019s improper remarks. The first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">{\u00b6 14} The second assignment of error alleges that the trial court erred in allowing defense expert Dr. Paul Hirsh to change his testimony about the cause of Machiko Furnier\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">{\u00b6 15} In the first trial, when defense counsel asked Dr. Hirsh whether Mrs. Furnier suffered a pulmonary embolism, Hirsh answered, \u201cI think it\u2019s not a very likely possibility.\u201d When defense counsel again asked Hirsh if he had an opinion whether Machiko Furnier was experiencing a pulmonary embolism on the morning of May 12, 1994, Hirsh said, \u201cI think it\u2019s just as likely as not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">{\u00b6 16} Prior to the second trial, Furnier filed a motion in limine to preclude Dr. Hirsh from testifying that a pulmonary embolism had caused Machiko\u2019s death, because Hirsh had stated in the first trial that he could not offer that opinion to a reasonable degree of medical probability as required by <em>Stinson v. England </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 451, 633 N.E.2d 532. In arguing the motion in limine, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>Furnier\u2019s counsel stated that if the defense witness was going to change his testimony for the second trial, then the motion was \u201cpremature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">{\u00b6 17} During the second trial, when defense counsel asked Hirsh whether Machiko Furnier\u2019s death was caused by a pulmonary embolism, Hirsh stated, \u201cIt absolutely was, I think. No question about it.\u201d No objection was raised to Hirsh\u2019s testimony. Furnier\u2019s counsel thoroughly cross-examined Hirsh regarding the differences between his testimony in the first and second trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">{\u00b6 18} By failing to object to Hirsh\u2019s testimony at the second trial, Furnier waived any error in its admission. Further, the inconsistencies in Hirsh\u2019s testimony were thoroughly explored by Furnier\u2019s counsel during Hirsh\u2019s cross-examination. The second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">{\u00b6 19} The third assignment of error alleges that the trial court erred in preventing Furnier\u2019s counsel from cross-examining Dr. Hirsh about whether he had the same insurance carrier as the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">{\u00b6 20} Prior to his cross-examination of Hirsh, and outside the presence of the jury, Furnier\u2019s counsel stated to the trial court, \u201cI intend to ask Dr. Hirsh whether he\u2019s insured or whether his company, Comprehensive Cardiology Consultants, is insured by Medical Protective, the company that insures the defendants, because I believe it\u2019s relevant to show bias under Rule 411, and I wanted to do that out of the presence of the jury.\u201d The court refused to allow Furnier\u2019s counsel to question Hirsh about his insurance carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">{\u00b6 21} An expert\u2019s bias and pecuniary interest are fair subjects for cross-examination. See <em>Calderon v. Sharkey </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 218, 24 O.O.3d 322, 436 N.E.2d 1008; <em>Clark v. Doe, </em>supra, 119 Ohio App.3d 296, 695 N.E.2d 276. In <em>Ede v. Atrium S. OB-GYN, Inc. </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 124, 642 N.E.2d 365, syllabus, the Ohio Supreme Court stated, \u201cIn a medical malpractice action, evidence of a commonality of insurance interests between a defendant and an expert witness is sufficiently probative of the expert\u2019s bias as to clearly outweigh any potential prejudice evidence of insurance might cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">{\u00b6 22} There is no evidence in the record as to the identity of the defendants\u2019 insurance carriers. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the trial court committed prejudicial error in failing to allow Furnier\u2019s counsel to question Hirsh about his insurance carrier. If, upon retrial, Furnier can establish that Hirsh has the same insurance carrier as the defendants, plaintiffs counsel must be permitted to cross-examine Hirsh on the issue within the bounds of <em>Ede, </em>71 Ohio St.3d 124, 642 N.E.2d 365. Based upon the state of the record, the third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>{\u00b6 23} The fourth assignment of error alleges that the trial court erred by prohibiting Furnier\u2019s counsel from cross-examining defense expert Dr. Norman Schneiderman about his testimony in other cases in order to impeach his credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">{\u00b6 24} Out of the presence of the jury, Furnier\u2019s counsel proffered, \u201cHad the court not ruled in granting defense\u2019s objection, plaintiff would have offered evidence that this witness, Dr. Schneiderman, has testified as an expert witness for the defense in the case of Estate of Andrea Williams versus Franciscan Health Systems in which he was named as an expert on behalf of Dr. Drury and on behalf of defendant Quality Emergency Specialists, Inc., and that the attorney who called them was Mr. Lyon, and that he testified in favor of Dr. Drury.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cThat, further, that he was called as an expert witness for the defense in the case of Michael Hutchinson versus Dr. Babard, another emergency room physician, in a case involving chest pain at rest, in which he gave \u2014 the witness gave testimony conflicting with his testimony in these proceedings in numerous respects, not limited to the proper use of a GI cocktail, the diagnosis of a hiatal hernia with gastric reflux, that he was named by an attorney \u2014 by Mr. Lyon again, that Mr. Lyon also named Dr. Hirsh in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cThat, further, that this witness was named as an expert by Mr. Lyon on behalf of Dr. Knochel, an employee of QES, as well as QES as defendant, his employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cAnd in the case of the Estate of Michael Hobing versus Dr. Knochel and others in Montgomery County, and that he gave opinions in that case which were contrary, directly contrary to the testimony that he\u2019s given in this case, again with respect to the treatment of a patient who presented in the ER with chest pain in a three-day history of on and off chest pain after exertion wherein the exertion was discounted by the expert witness on the stand in this case, that in his testimony that Dr. Knochel met the standard of care, even though an enzyme test was abnormal and not repeated, and that the EKG was abnormal, despite these factors, that contradicts or is contradictory of his testimony in this case, including his testimony that nitroglycerin should not be used for ruling [sic] coronary artery disease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">{\u00b6 28} Furnier\u2019s counsel argued that the evidence elicited would have borne directly on Dr. Schneiderman\u2019s bias, his credibility, and the weight that the jury would have afforded his testimony. The trial court stated that it would allow plaintiffs counsel to question Schneiderman only about \u201chow many times he has testified, and in regards to association with [defense counsel] and his firm.\u201d The trial court refused to allow plaintiffs counsel to question Schneiderman about any of the other issues because the court did not want \u201cmini trials of other cases within this trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>{\u00b6 29} We are unable to determine from the record whether the trial court erred in refusing to allow Furnier to cross-examine Schneiderman on his prior, allegedly inconsistent testimony, because Schneiderman\u2019s prior testimony is not in the record, and, therefore, we cannot say whether it was inconsistent with his trial testimony in the instant case. We point out, however, that the court erred in its blanket refusal to allow Furnier to cross-examine Schneiderman in this area. If Schneiderman\u2019s prior testimony was inconsistent with his testimony in this trial, plaintiffs counsel had a right to cross-examine him on the inconsistencies. See Evid.R. 613. The fourth assignment of error is sustained to the extent that it challenges the trial court\u2019s blanket refusal to allow Furnier to cross-examine Schneiderman on the allegedly inconsistent statements, but overruled to the extent that specific error is not demonstrated in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">{\u00b6 30} The fifth assignment of error alleges that the trial court erred in refusing to allow plaintiff to read the deposition of Dr. Gallenstein into evidence on rebuttal. The fifth assignment of error is overruled because Dr. Gallenstein\u2019s deposition testimony did not rebut any matters raised by the defense in its case. Gallenstein\u2019s testimony should have been presented in the plaintiffs case-in-chief. The trial court did not err in refusing to allow plaintiff to read Gallenstein\u2019s deposition on rebuttal, because it was not proper rebuttal testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">{\u00b6 31} The sixth assignment of error, which alleges that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that the defendants had the burden of proof as to Machiko Furnier\u2019s diminished life expectancy, is overruled because the jury returned a verdict for the defendants, and, therefore, plaintiff cannot show any prejudice resulting from the trial court\u2019s failure to give the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">{\u00b6 32} The judgment of the trial court is reversed and the cause is remanded for a new trial and for further proceeding consistent with law and this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b842-9\">Winkler, P.J., and Painter, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
