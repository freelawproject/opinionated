We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">{\u00b6 2} In 1996, White was indicted on nine counts of forgery, fourth-degree felonies. R.C. 2913.31. White subsequently pleaded guilty to four counts of the indictment and the trial court nolled the remaining counts. The trial court sentenced White to six months\u2019 imprisonment on each count, with the sentences to be served concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">{\u00b6 3} On April 19, 2004, White moved to vacate or set aside the judgment and sentence, and to withdraw his guilty plea pursuant to R.C. 2943.031(D) and Crim.R. 32.1. The trial court denied White\u2019s motion and he timely appealed raising two assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">{\u00b6 4} \u201c[1] The trial Court committed plain and reversible Error when the trial court denied Defendant-Appellant\u2019s Motion to Vacate or Set Aside Judgment and Sentence and to Withdraw Guilty Plea pursuant to R.C. 2943.031(D)[ ], [Crim.R.] 32.1, [and] from the trial court\u2019s previous failure to provide Defendanb-Appellant with the advisement codified at R.C. 2943.031(A) before the trial court accepted the Defendant-Appellant\u2019s Guilty plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">{\u00b6 5} \u201c[2] Appellant\u2019s Guilty Plea was not a knowingly, voluntarily, and Intelligent plea, because the trial Court failed to address the issue of citizenship as required by R.C. 2943.031. Thus, [the trial court] violated [Crim.R.] 11(C)(2).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">{\u00b6 6} R.C. 2943.031 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c(A) Except as provided in division (B) of this section, prior to accepting a plea of guilty or a plea of no contest to an indictment, information, or complaint charging a felony or a misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor if the defendant previously has not been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a minor misdemeanor, the court shall address the defendant personally, provide the following advisement to the defendant that shall be entered in the record of the court, and determine that the defendant understands the advisement:</p>\n<p id=\"b418-12\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cIf you are not a citizen of the United States, you are hereby advised that conviction of the offense to which you are pleading guilty (or no contest, when applicable) may have the consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of naturalization pursuant to the laws of the United States.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>{\u00b6 9} \u201cUpon request of the defendant, the court shall allow him additional time to consider the appropriateness of the plea in light of the advisement describ\u00e9d in this division.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c(B) The court is not required to give the advisement described in division (A) of this section if either of the following applies:</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c(1) The defendant enters a plea of guilty on a written form, the form includes a question asking whether the defendant is a citizen of the United States, and the defendant answers that question in the affirmative;</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c(2) The defendant states orally on the record that he is a citizen of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">{\u00b6 13} R.C. 2943.031(D) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cUpon motion of the defendant, the court shall set aside the judgment and permit the defendant to withdraw a plea of guilty or no contest and enter a plea of not guilty or not guilty by reason of insanity, if, after the effective date of this section, the court fails to provide the defendant the advisement described in division (A) of this section, the advisement is required by that division, and the defendant shows that he is not a citizen of the United States and that the conviction of the offense to which he pleaded guilty or no contest may result in his being subject to deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of naturalization pursuant to the laws of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">{\u00b6 15} We review the trial court\u2019s judgment denying White\u2019s motion using an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>State v. Francis, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 490, 2004-Ohio-6894, 820 N.E.2d 355, \u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c[A] defendant seeking relief under R.C. 2943.031(D) must make his * * * case before the trial court under the terms of that statute, * * * the trial court must exercise its discretion in determining whether the statutory conditions are met, and * * * an appellate court reviews a trial court\u2019s decision on the motion under an abuse-of-discretion standard in light of R.C. 2943.031(D).\u201d Id. at \u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-12\">{\u00b6 17} To be entitled to relief under R.C. 2943.031(D), White must show four things: (1) the trial court failed to give the advisement required by R.C. 2943.031(A), (2) the trial court was required to give the advisement, (3) he is not a citizen of the United States, and (4) the conviction of the offense to which he pleaded guilty or no contest may result in his being subject to deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of naturalization under United States law.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>{\u00b6 18} In the instant case, there is no dispute that White is not a citizen of the United States, the trial court was required to give the advisement, and the trial court did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">{\u00b6 19} White attached this motion a copy of an order that had been issued by an immigration judge, ordering White to be removed from the United States to Jamaica.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">{\u00b6 20} The state contends that WThite had an affirmative duty to inform the trial court at the time of his plea that he was not a citizen of the United States. We disagree. Wdiile Wlhite is required to provide some documentation or other evidence to support his motion pursuant to R.C. 2943.031(D), see <em>State v. Almingdad, </em>151 Ohio App.3d 453, 455, 2003-Ohio-295, 784 N.E.2d 718, the advisement statute places the duty on the court to determine the defendant\u2019s citizenship status. The very language of the advisement shows this, as it states, <em>\u201cIf </em>you are not a citizen of the United States * * (Emphasis added.) R.C. 2943.031(A). Further, R.C. 2943.031(A) requires the court to address the defendant personally. It does not, by its plain language, require the advisement to be given only to noncitizens. Of course, noncitizens are the only persons who have a remedy for the trial court\u2019s failure to give the advisement under R.C. 2943.031(D). See, generally, <em>State v. Gegia, </em>11th Dist. No. 2003-P-0026, 2004-Ohio-1441, 2004 WL 574623, \u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">{\u00b6 21} A defendant must show that he suffered a prejudicial effect from the trial court\u2019s failure to comply with R.C. 2943.031(A). Id. at \u00b6 29. \u201cThe mere possibility of deportation as a result of the guilty plea is insufficient to demonstrate such effect.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">{\u00b6 22} Here, White attached a deportation order to his motion and stated that the order was based on the offenses to which he pleaded guilty in the instant case. Thus, White has shown prejudice. Cf. <em>Gegia, </em>supra at \u00b6 30 (\u201cIn this case, there is nothing in the record that demonstrates that deportation proceedings have commenced against Gegia, nor does Gegia claim that deportation is currently being sought against him. Thus, Gegia fails to demonstrate the requisite prejudicial effect to vacate his guilty plea\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">{\u00b6 23} Finally, the state argues that the doctrine of res judicata bars Wdiite from raising the issues herein because he failed to file a direct appeal of his judgment and sentence. In <em>Gegia, </em>we held, \u201cThe doctrine of res judicata * * * does not apply to a motion pursuant to R.C. 2943.031(A) [sic] when the movant\u2019s non-citizenship was outside the record for purposes of direct review.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">{\u00b6 24} White made the four-part showing required under R.C. 2943.031(D). Thus, the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion. Whdte\u2019s first assignment of error has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>{\u00b6 25} Our decision on White\u2019s first assignment of error renders his second assignment of error moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">{\u00b6 26} For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Lake County Court of Common Pleas is reversed, and this matter is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b421-6\">Ford, P.J., and O\u2019Toole, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
