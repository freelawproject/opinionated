That is why they must be corroborated to a greater degree than some other tips to law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-13\">{\u00b6 2} Defendant-appellant Dwayne Smith challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress. He argues that the police lacked credible evidence to corroborate an anonymous tip. The tip led to an investigatory stop of his vehicle and the discovery of cocaine through a canine sniff.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-14\">{\u00b6 3} Because the tip contained neither predictive information nor means to test the informant\u2019s credibility, we hold that the tip was unreliable and did not create the reasonable suspicion needed to stop Smith\u2019s vehicle. And corroboration, while attempted, did not rise to the necessary level. Thus the cocaine found in the car and evidence later found during a search of 3025 Theresa Street were obtained in violation of Smith\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. We reverse the convictions that ensued from the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-15\">I. A Tip that Appeared to Be \u201cJust What the Dr. Ordered\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-16\">{\u00b6 4} On June 27, 2004, Cincinnati Police District Three received an anonymous tip through the Crime-Stoppers program. The tip identified Dwayne Smith, of 3025 Theresa Street, Apartment No. 2, as a person who dealt in crack cocaine. The tipster also stated that Smith carried a gun, drove a black Cadillac, and kept the cocaine in a Dr. Pepper can in the glove compartment. But the tip did not provide any information about past drug transactions or predict any future deals.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>{\u00b6 5} The police began to investigate Smith, found his mug shot, and checked his criminal record. Although there were no previous drug-related offenses, there was a mug shot because Smith had been convicted of involuntary manslaughter in 1992. The police found the Cadillac, checked the license, and obtained addresses for Smith. Although Smith\u2019s car was registered at a Losantiville Avenue address, the utility and telephone bills at the Theresa Street address were listed in Smith\u2019s name. It was later discovered that the lease for the Theresa Street apartment was in the name of Smith\u2019s sister, Latoyia. And she testified that Smith did not live there, although her boyfriend, another black male, did live at that address.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">{\u00b6 6} The police believed that the tip was reliable enough to proceed with the investigation. Between the time of the tip and Smith\u2019s arrest, the police conducted surveillance to determine whether the black Cadillac was present at 3025 Theresa Street. Officer Michael Reynolds believed that he saw the Cadillac at that address six times during the 32-day investigation, but he never saw Smith parking the car. As Smith was incarcerated in the Hamilton County Justice Center (because of a misdemeanor) for 26 days of the 32-day period, it obviously was difficult for Officer Reynolds to corroborate whether Smith lived at 3025 Theresa Street. During this time, the black Cadillac was being used by Smith\u2019s sister at the Theresa Street address.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">{\u00b6 7} Nonetheless, the police used a \u201csource of information\u201d (confidential informant) to allegedly arrange a purchase of cocaine from Smith for July 29, 2004. This was to take place at a location on Ferguson Road. We say \u201callegedly\u201d because the record is sparse. Officer Reynolds testified that he had listened in on a cellular-phone conversation-^-but then an objection was made and sustained \u2014 and the narrative moved on without being fleshed out. Thus the record does not reflect any details of this conversation \u2014 nothing in the record tells us (1) who was on the phone, (2) what number was called, (3) how anyone knew it was Smith on the line, (4) when and where on Ferguson Road the transaction was to occur, (5) what drug was to be sold or bought, and (6) what quantity of drug was to be transferred. The information might well have been available, but it did not find its way into the record. And we are limited by the evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">{\u00b6 8} On the day the drug deal was supposed to occur, a Hamilton County Sheriffs helicopter observed an African-American male leave the Theresa Street address and drive away in a black Cadillac towards Ferguson Road. But the transaction \u2014 which would have caught Smith red-handed \u2014 never occurred. Because the police were unable to get their informant to the designated meeting spot on time, a police sergeant ordered two officers to pull Smith over on an investigatory stop. The officers stopped Smith at the intersection of Glenway <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Avenue and Guerley Road, approximately two and a half miles from the Theresa Street apartment. Neither the officers on the ground nor the ones in the helicopter observed Smith commit any traffic or criminal violations. And no one knew whether it was actually Smith in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">{\u00b6 9} The officers pulled Smith over and asked him to step out onto the sidewalk. Because of the warning that Smith carried a gun, the officers frisked him. There were no drugs or weapons on Smith, and he refused to consent to a search of his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">{\u00b6 10} The officers decided to call a drug canine to the scene. After 15 to 20 minutes, Officer John Mendosa arrived with his drug-sniffing dog, Caesar. Caesar walked around the car and alerted on the driver\u2019s and passenger\u2019s doors by scratching. Officer Mendosa opened the passenger door and Caesar entered the car and alerted to the glove compartment. When Officer Mendosa opened the glove compartment, Caesar grabbed a Dr. Pepper can with his mouth. Officer Mendosa then took the can away and noticed that the can had a false top. Upon removal of the top, crack cocaine was found inside.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">{\u00b6 11} After the police found the crack cocaine in the Dr. Pepper can, a search of Smith\u2019s wallet yielded a handwritten receipt for the rent for 3025 Theresa Street. But the receipt was in the name of Latoyia Smith. The police nevertheless applied for a search warrant to search the 3025 Theresa Street apartment. Upon execution of the warrant, the officers found approximately 95 grams of crack cocaine hidden in a VCR case, another quantity of 10 to 25 grams of crack cocaine hidden in a jewelry box, and a quantity of marijuana. The police further found three weapons on the premises, two .45s and one Derringer.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">{\u00b6 12} Appellate review of a suppression ruling involves mixed questions of law and fact.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When ruling on a motion to suppress, the trial court serves as the trier of fact and is the primary judge of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> An appellate court must accept the trial court\u2019s findings of fact as true if they are supported by competent and credible evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But the appellate court must then determine, without any deference to the trial court, whether the facts satisfy the applicable legal standard.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>III. Anonymous Tips</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">{\u00b6 13} The Ohio Supreme Court has recognized three categories of informants: (1) the identified citizen informant, (2) the known informant, i.e., someone from the criminal world who has a history of providing reliable tips, and (3) the anonymous informant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A tip from an anonymous informant can give rise to a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But standing alone, an anonymous tip is generally insufficient to support reasonable suspicion because it lacks the necessary \u201cindicia of reliability.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cUnlike a tip from a known informant whose reputation can be assessed and who can be held responsible if her allegations turn out to be fabricated, * * * \u2018an anonymous tip alone seldom demonstrates the informant\u2019s basis of knowledge or veracity.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Consequently, anonymous tips require corroboration that establishes \u201csufficient indicia of reliability to provide reasonable suspicion to make the investigatory stop.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">{\u00b6 14} In the present case, the first assignment of error questions whether the Crime-Stoppers anonymous tip was sufficiently corroborated to provide reasonable suspicion. If there was enough corroboration to create reasonable suspicion, then the police could have properly made the investigatory stop.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">{\u00b6 15} In <em>Alabama v. White, </em>the police received an anonymous tip asserting that a woman was carrying cocaine in a brown attach\u00e9 case and predicting that she would leave an apartment building at a certain time, get into a car matching a particular description, and drive to a named hotel to make a drug deal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court held that this tip, standing alone, would not have justified a <em>Terry </em>stop.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Only after police observation demonstrated that the informant had accurately predicted White\u2019s movements did it become reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>to believe that the tipster had accurate information.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The court stressed that anonymous tips cannot just state \u201ceasily obtained facts and conditions existing at the time of the tip.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Instead the court held that the critical factor is the ability to predict the suspect\u2019s future behavior.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Considering that the route driven by White involved several turns, the court concluded that the destination was sufficiently corroborated to allow the police to pull her over before reaching the hotel.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">{\u00b6 16} The court further refined the law of anonymous tips in <em>Florida v. J.L., </em>in which the police received information that a black male wearing a plaid shirt, standing at a particular bus stop, was carrying a gun.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> When the police arrived at the bus stop, there were three African-American males, one wearing a plaid shirt.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Apart from the tip, there was no reason to suspect any of the three of criminal conduct. But one of the officers approached and frisked J.L., who did have a gun in his pocket.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The court held that an anonymous tip that provided no predictive information and left the police with no means to test the informant\u2019s credibility was unreliable and did not justify the stop and frisk.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> That the tip turned out to be correct did not mean that there was any reasonable suspicion to believe that these three men had engaged in unlawful conduct in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">{\u00b6 17} For an anonymous tip to provide police with reasonable suspicion to justify a stop and frisk, the tip must not only contain detailed facts, but also predict future activities or provide means to test the informant\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">{\u00b6 18} In the present case, the anonymous tip simply did not rise to the level of reliability to allow the police to gain the reasonable suspicion to stop Smith\u2019s car. The tip provided facts that most neighbors could have conveyed. The tip provided a name, an address, a car, and the location of drugs in the car. While the tip turned out to be correct about the cocaine in the Dr. Pepper can in the glove compartment, the tip provided no means for the police to test that detail. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>The tip also failed to provide any predictive information about any future drug transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">{\u00b6 19} Instead, the future drug transaction was set up through another informant, who made a call from a cellular phone. From the record, the details of this drug transaction are ambiguous at best. Officer Reynolds testified only that he listened in while the informant set up the drug buy. No details were ever produced as to how Officer Reynolds knew that the informant was talking to Smith, what the exact date, time, and location of the drug deal would be, or what drugs were to be involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">{\u00b6 20} The one detail Officer Reynolds provided to the court \u2014 that the drug deal was at a Ferguson Road location \u2014 was vague. Officer Reynolds did not even specify where on Ferguson Road the buy was to take place. And the police stopped Smith before they could corroborate that he was en route to that location. Unlike the <em>White </em>case where the defendant made a series of turns towards a particular location and was pulled over on the street where the alleged drug transaction was to take place, Smith\u2019s driving did not indicate any predicted behavior, nor did Smith even reach the street where the transaction was supposedly to take place.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">{\u00b6 21} The state maintains that Smith was pulled over as he was driving toward Ferguson Road. But the facts did not demonstrate that Smith was driving anywhere but up Glenway Avenue into Price Hill towards Western Hills. When Smith left the Theresa Street address, he was within three blocks of Glenway Avenue. Under the state\u2019s analysis, by simply driving on the main thoroughfare located near Theresa Street, Smith necessarily was driving to a Ferguson Road location. If the police had their informant in place to make the buy or allowed Smith to proceed closer to the intended location, the predictive-information element could have been met. As they stood, however, the anonymous tip and the subsequent informant did not provide the necessary predictive information to increase the reliability of the tip.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">{\u00b6 22} By detaining Smith before any predicted behavior could be ascertained, and by failing to introduce any detailed information by the confidential informant, the police were left with bare facts similar to the ones the United States Supreme Court in <em>Florida v. J.L. </em>held to be insufficient to allow for an investigatory stop. As we have previously mentioned, there might have been sufficient information for the stop and detention \u2014 -but it is not in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">IV. The Cocaine Is Out</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">{\u00b6 23} The United States Supreme Court announced the exclusionary rule in <em>Weeks v. United States, </em>holding that evidence obtained in violation of an accused\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights could not be used in a federal criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>prosecution against him.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The exclusionary rule of the Fourth Amendment was extended to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment in <em>Mapp v. Ohio.</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The exclusionary rule reaches not only primary evidence obtained as a direct result of an illegal search or seizure, but also evidence later discovered and found to be derivative of an illegality, or \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">{\u00b6 24} In this case, when the officers seized Smith without reasonable suspicion and subjected the car to a canine sniff, the cocaine found in the Dr. Pepper can necessarily became evidence obtained in violation of Smith\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. The trial court should have granted the motion to suppress as to the primary evidence obtained as a result of the illegal search, the cocaine. In addition, Officer Reynolds testified that the warrant was predicated on the corroboration of the anonymous tip of the crack cocaine found in the Dr. Pepper can and the rent receipt for 3025 Theresa Street found in Smith\u2019s wallet during the search incident to arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cQ. Could you tell us what kind of information your investigation gathered that led you to ask for a warrant at that address?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cA. There was \u2014 once the stop was initiated, there was a quantity of crack cocaine that was found in a Dr. Pepper can inside the glove box, as described in our anonymous tip to the district. We had Officer Kowalski actually watch the defendant get into his car in the parking lot at 3025 Theresa Street. Also, a search incident to arrest of Mr. Smith for the crack cocaine in his glove box, there as a handwritten receipt for the rent at 3025 Theresa Street, made out in the name of Latoyia Smith, for $700.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">{\u00b6 27} Because the search warrant was based on evidence discovered through an illegal seizure, the later-discovered evidence found at 3025 Theresa Avenue is fruit of the poisonous tree and is now also excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">V. Alleged Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">{\u00b6 28} Smith\u2019s second assignment of error concerning ineffective assistance of counsel need not be addressed. Because the suppression motion should have been successful, and now will be as a result of this decision, Smith has not been prejudiced by any alleged failings of his trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>{\u00b6 29} We reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and remand this cause for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b616-5\">Doan, P.J., and Hendon, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b611-10\">.
