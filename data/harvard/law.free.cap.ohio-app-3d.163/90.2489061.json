The following facts give rise to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-16\">{\u00b6 2} In the early morning of April 16, 2004, Officer Mark Emde of the Heath Police Department was on patrol in the city of Heath. Shortly before midnight, he observed a vehicle driving erratically on State Route 79. The officer saw the vehicle weave within its lane several times and cross the berm and the centerline a few times. As the vehicle approached the intersection of State Route 79 and 30th Street, Officer Emde saw the vehicle abruptly swerve left, pass the vehicle in front of it, and proceed through the light. According to Officer Emde, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>driver of the vehicle did not activate his turn signal when he made this lane change. As a result, Officer Emde ordered the car to stop. Officer Emde exited his cruiser, approached the vehicle, and asked the appellee for his license, registration, and proof of insurance. When he did so, he immediately noticed a strong odor of alcohol coming from the car. When Officer Emde asked the appellee whether he had been drinking, appellee denied that he had. The officer also noticed that the appellee avoided making eye contact with him during this exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">{\u00b6 3} Based on these observations, the officer asked the appellee to exit the vehicle so he could administer standardized field sobriety tests. When appellee got out of the car, he appeared unsteady on his feet and used the driver\u2019s side door to steady himself. The officer also noticed that the appellee seemed to be shuffling his feet and not to be walking in a normal fashion. In addition, when Officer Emde administered the horizontal gaze nystagmus (\u201cHGN\u201d) test, he noticed that the appellee\u2019s eyes were red and glassy.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">{\u00b6 4} On June 18, 2004, appellee filed a motion to suppress. On July 6, 2004, appellant filed its objection and response to appellee\u2019s motion to suppress. On July 9, 2004, appellant filed an amended objection and response to appellee\u2019s motion to suppress. A suppression hearing was held on August 24, 2004. On September 22, 2004, the court issued a judgment entry granting the appellee\u2019s motion in part, stating: \u201cThe court finds S[enate] B[ill] 163 to be a conflict with the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of Evidence Rule 702 as set forth in the <em>Homan </em>case and it is therefore unconstitutional pursuant to Article IV, Section 5(B) of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d On December 9, 2004, the trial court issued a supplemental decision clarifying the court\u2019s earlier ruling on the admissibility of the field sobriety tests. In its December 9, 2004 supplemental decision, the trial court held that Officer Emde failed to \u201cstrictly comply with the standardized procedures for the administration of the One-Leg Stand, the Walk-and-Turn, and the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test.\u201d Specifically the trial court noted that the officer failed to give proper instructions to the appellee prior to the performance of the standardized field sobriety tests. As to the HGN test, the court found that the officer could not recall whether he had asked the appellee to remove his glasses prior to conducting the test and further that the officer did not give the appellee proper instructions on how to perform the test. The trial court further found that the officer did not take field notes as required by the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration manual. Accordingly, the trial court granted the appellee\u2019s motion and suppressed the results of the field sobriety tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">{\u00b6 5} Following the trial court\u2019s ruling on appellee\u2019s motion, appellant timely appealed, raising the following assignment of error for our consideration:</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>{\u00b6 6} \u201cI. The trial court erred when it declared Ohio Revised Code 4511.19(D)(4)(b) amended and enacted on April 9, 2003 to be unconstitutional as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">{\u00b6 7} The issue in the case at bar is whether the mandate of strict compliance laid down by the Supreme Court in <em>State v. Homan </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 421, 732 N.E.2d 952, renders the legislative provision demanding only substantial compliance unconstitutional under Section 5(B), Article IV of the Constitution of Ohio and Evid.R. 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">{\u00b6 8} This court recently addressed this precise issue. In <em>State v. Robinson </em>(2005), 160 Ohio App.3d 802, 2005-Ohio-2280, 828 N.E.2d 1050, at \u00b6 29, 37-44, we noted:</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cA trial judge or jury is not suited, absent expert testimony, to determine whether a given deviation from the testing protocol found in the NHTSA [National Highway Traffic Safety Administration] manual renders the results of the HGN test unreliable. The possibility arises that the state may try to have the trooper qualified as an expert to testify that his method did not skew the results even though he did not follow the procedure. This possibility creates a problem because the officer does not have a background in statistical analysis, nor the methodology utilized by NHTSA in determining the reliability of the HGN, nor the effect of any deviation from standard protocol.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cThe decisions in <em>[State v.] Schmitt </em>[ (2004), 101 Ohio St.3d 79, 2004-Ohio-37, 801 N.E.2d 446] and <em>Homan </em>make clear that absent strict compliance in the realm of any FST [field sobriety test], a test such as the HGN, which is not a psychomotor test within the observations a layperson would make in assessing an individual\u2019s sobriety and is not within a juror\u2019s common understanding, will not satisfy the threshold reliability standard for the admission of expert testimony pursuant to Evid. R. 702. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cIt is unlikely that the average juror has any conception or understanding of what \u2018nystagmus\u2019 means. It is a scientific term probably not familiar to most persons. The relationship of nystagmus to the consumption of alcohol or drugs is a scientific principle. The manifestation of nystagmus under different circumstances is also a scientific theory that would not be known by the average person. HGN testing is based on a scientific principle not generally known by lay jurors. <em>State v. DeLong, </em>5th Dist. No. 02CA35, 2002-Ohio-5289, 2002 WL 31185809 at \u00b6 59-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>{\u00b6 13} \u201cThe Ohio Supreme Court has determined that if the test is done in strict compliance with the protocol for the administration of the test, then the state does not have to bring in an expert to testify concerning the underlying principles and scientific validity of the test. However, if strict compliance is not shown in a particular case, then the state does not get the benefit of this \u2018presumption\u2019 of reliability. A jury may be inappropriately influenced by the apparent scientific precision of HGN testing or otherwise fail to properly understand it. <em>State v. DeLong, </em>supra. Accordingly, the Ohio Supreme Court has determined that in order to achieve admission under Evid. R. 702, the test must meet the strict compliance standard set forth in <em>Homan </em>and <em>[State v.] Bresson </em>[ (1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 123, 554 N.E.2d 1330].</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cAbsent strict compliance with the testing protocol, the HGN test would not be admissible under the Rules of Evidence. Accordingly, R.C. 4511.19(D) would mandate the exclusion by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cHowever, a defendant\u2019s performance of nonscientific standardized field sobriety tests would be admissible even absent proof of \u2018strict compliance\u2019 pursuant to R.C. 4511.19(D). The most recent pronouncement from the Ohio Supreme Court characterizes the walk-and-turn, one-leg stand, and other psycho-motor coordination tests as \u201cnonscientific field sobriety tests.\u201d <em>Schmitt, </em>supra, 101 Ohio St.3d 79, 2004-Ohio-37, 801 N.E.2d 446, at \u00b6 12. Accordingly, admissibility of these tests is not dependent upon fulfillment of Evid. R. 702\u2019s requirements for scientific evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cThe finder of fact is less likely to be inappropriately influenced by a psychomotor test within the observations a layperson would make in assessing an individual\u2019s sobriety. This type of test is within a juror\u2019s common understanding. <em>State v. DeLong, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cWe conclude, then, that for all practical purposes, under existing statutes, R.C. 4511.19(D) is viable only so far as it complements Evid.R. 702 and the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decisions interpreting the admission of scientific, nonpsychomotor field sobriety tests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">{\u00b6 19} To argue that the Rules of Evidence do not apply to a suppression hearing misses the point. See <em>State v. Nutter, </em>128 Ohio Misc.2d 24, 2004-Ohio-3143, 811 N.E.2d 185; <em>Mt. Vernon v. Seng, </em>5th Dist. No. 04CA000012, 2005-Ohio-2915, 2005 WL 1384628. The Rules of Evidence clearly will apply <em>at trial. </em>If an officer testifies during a hearing on a defendant\u2019s motion to suppress that he did not conduct the FSTs under the appropriate standard,then it logically follows that the noncompliant tests cannot be admitted at any subsequent trial. Accordingly, suppression of the test results for failure to perform the tests using the appropriate protocol is appropriate because the noncompliant tests would not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>admissible at trial. The question of admissibility at trial is separate and distinct from the question whether the officer had probable cause to arrest a defendant based upon the noncompliant FSTs.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">{\u00b6 20} As a result, as to nonscientific psychomotor field sobriety tests, the state in this case need only have shown that Officer Emde performed them in substantial compliance with the applicable standards described in R.C. 4511.19(D)(4)(b). <em>State v. Robinson </em>(2005), 160 Ohio App.3d 802, 2005-Ohio-2280, 828 N.E.2d 1050; <em>State v. Nicholson, </em>Warren App. No. CA2003-10-106, 2004-Ohio-6666, 2004 WL 2849229. The HGN was not conducted in strict compliance with the testing protocol. Accordingly, based upon the above analysis, the results of the HGN test are not admissible at trial, and Officer Emde may not testify regarding appellant\u2019s performance on the HGN test.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">{\u00b6 21} We reverse the trial court\u2019s decision insofar as it finds R.C. 4511.19(D) unconstitutional in its entirety. We conclude then that for all practical purposes, under existing statutes, R.C. 4511.19(D) is viable only insofar as it complements Evid.R. 702 and the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decisions interpreting the admission of scientific, nonpsychomotor field sobriety tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">{\u00b6 22} We reverse the trial court\u2019s decision to suppress the nonscientific, psychomotor field sobriety test results. These test results will be admissible if the trial court finds that the officer performed those tests in substantial compliance with the applicable standards described in R.C. 4511.19(D)(4)(b). The amended statute does not attempt to define \u201csubstantial compliance.\u201d Thus, it will remain the province of the courts to determine whether the standard was met on a case-by-case basis. Additionally, the court must still find that the proffered evidence meets the standard for admissibility contained in Evid.R. 401 and Evid.R. 403 prior to admitting the evidence at trial. The amended statute does not preclude an attack at trial on the specific testing procedure used by an. officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">{\u00b6 23} We sustain the trial court\u2019s decision insofar as it suppressed testimony concerning the HGN test because the trial court has found that the officer failed to conduct the test in strict compliance with the testing protocol.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">{\u00b6 24} The judgment of the Licking County Municipal Court is affirmed in part and reversed in part. This cause is remanded to that court for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b135-11\">Hoffman, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b135-12\">Edwards, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b136-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>Edwards, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aj\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">{\u00b6 25} I concur with the decision of the majority to reverse and remand this matter to the trial court for purposes of determining whether the nonscientific, psychomotor field sobriety tests were performed in substantial compliance with the applicable standards. I agree with the majority that if these tests were performed in substantial compliance with the standards, then the results are admissible at trial and that R.C. 4511.19(D) is constitutional as to nonscientific, psychomotor field sobriety tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">{\u00b6 26} I dissent from the conclusion of the majority that R.C. 4511.19(D) is unconstitutional in regard to the admissibility of the results of an HGN test performed in substantial compliance with NHTSA standards. Instead, I would hold that R.C. 4511.19, which provides for admission of field sobriety tests that are administered in substantial compliance with NHTSA testing procedures, is constitutional for the reasons set forth in my concurring opinion in <em>Mount Vernon v. Seng, </em>5th Dist. No. 04CA000012, 2005-Ohio-2915, 2005 WL 1384628.</p>\n<p id=\"Adb\">{\u00b6 27} However, I do limit my conclusion regarding the constitutionality of R.C. 4511.19 to the constitutional issue that has been raised in the case sub judice. That issue is whether R.C. 4511.19 conflicts with Evid.R. 702 as applied in <em>Homan. </em>I do not draw any conclusion at this time as to whether R.C. 4511.19 denies due process of law when it allows for the admissibility of field sobriety test results when those tests are done in substantial compliance with NHTSA standards. Such a denial of due process would exist if scientific data does not support R.C. 4511.19.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
