CIC contends that the Blairs are not entitled to underinsured-motorist coverage under either an automobile liability policy issued to the Blairs or a commercial general liability policy issued to a business owned by Mrs. Blair. Because the Blairs were injured while riding a motorcycle that was not listed in the policy, the \u201cother owned auto\u201d exclusion precludes coverage for their injuries. Nor are the Blairs entitled to coverage by operation of law under the commercial general liability policy because it is not a \u201cmotor vehicle policy\u201d as statutorily defined. Therefore, CIC was not required to offer uninsured/underinsured-motorist (\u201cUM/UIM\u201d) coverage. And although the policy states that CIC will provide such coverage when required by statute, no statute requires it to do so. Accordingly, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the Blairs and in denying CIC\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-12\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>In August 2001, a negligent driver injured the Blairs while they were riding a motorcycle. Progressive Insurance Company insured the negligent driver and paid its policy limits of $12,500 per person/$25,000 per occurrence. Progressive also insured the Blairs for underinsured-motorist coverage on the motorcycle with limits of $25,000 per person/$50,000 per occurrence. These limits were also exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>{\u00b6 3} The Blairs had three insurance policies issued by CIC: a homeowners\u2019 policy, an automobile liability policy covering three vehicles owned by the Blairs, and a commercial general liability policy insuring the beauty salon Classi Image (a sole proprietorship owned by Mrs. Blair). The Blairs filed a complaint against CIC seeking underinsured-motorist coverage under each of these three policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">{\u00b6 4} CIC moved for summary judgment, arguing that the Blairs were not entitled to underinsured-motorist coverage under any of the policies it issued. The Blairs conceded that summary judgment was appropriate as to the homeowners\u2019 policy but argued that they were entitled to coverage under the automobile policy and commercial general liability policy. The court granted CIC\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the homeowners\u2019 policy but denied it on the other two.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">' {\u00b6 5} Thereafter, the Blairs moved for summary judgment on the automobile policy and commercial general liability policy. The Blairs also sought summary judgment on the amount of coverage they were entitled to under the commercial general liability policy, claiming that they were entitled to higher limits than the policy stated because CIC had unilaterally reduced the coverage limits without properly notifying Mrs. Blair.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">{\u00b6 6} After the court granted the Blairs\u2019 motions, CIC appealed the court\u2019s decision, assigning the following errors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-8\">(1) Appellant The Cincinnati Insurance Company asserts that the Trial Court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Appellees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-9\">(2) Appellant The Cincinnati Insurance Company further asserts that the Trial Court erred in failing to enter summary judgment in its favor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">In its reply brief, CIC supplements its initial brief with the following assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-11\">(3) In the alternative, if coverage is afforded under The Cincinnati Insurance Company\u2019s commercial general liability policy, the Trial Court erred in holding the limits are $300,000 per occurrence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">However, an appellant may not use a reply brief to raise new issues or assignments of error. <em>Durham v. Pike Cty. Joint Vocational School, </em>150 Ohio App.3d 148, 2002-Ohio-6300, 779 N.E.2d 1051, at \u00b6 12, citing <em>Sheppard v. Mack </em>(1980), 68 Ohio App.2d 95, 22 O.O.3d 104, 427 N.E.2d 522, fn. 1. A reply brief simply provides an opportunity for an appellant to respond to issues raised in the appellee\u2019s brief. App.R. 16(C); see <em>In re Haubeil, </em>Ross App. No. 01CA2631, 2002-Ohio-4095, 2002 WL 1823001; <em>Sheppard. </em>Accordingly, CIC\u2019s third assignment of error is not properly before the court, and we will not consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">{\u00b6 7} An appellate court independently reviews a trial court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment. <em>Grafton v. Ohio Edison Co. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 102, 105, 671 N.E.2d 241. In doing so, we apply the standard contained in Civ.R. 56. <em>Horsley v. Essman </em>(2001), 145 Ohio App.3d 438, 442, 763 N.E.2d 245. Under Civ.R. 56(C), summary judgment is appropriate when (1) no genuine issue of material fact remains to be litigated, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) it appears from the evidence, when viewed most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, that reasonable minds can come to a conclusion only in favor of the moving party. E.g., <em>Grafton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">INTERPRETATION OF INSURANCE CONTRACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">{\u00b6 8} The interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law that an appellate court reviews de novo, without deference to the trial court. <em>Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Guman Bros. Farm </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 107, 108, 652 N.E.2d 684. In interpreting an insurance policy, a court\u2019s role \u201cis to give effect to the intent of the parties to the agreement.\u201d <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256,. at \u00b6 11. In doing so, \u201c[w]e examine the insurance contract as a whole and presume that the intent of the parties is reflected in the language used in the policy. We look to the plain and ordinary meaning of the language used in the policy unless another meaning is clearly apparent from the contents of the policy. When the language of a written contract is clear, a court may look no further than the writing itself to find the intent of the parties. As a matter of law, a contract is unambiguous if it can be given a definite legal meaning.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">{\u00b6 9} However, when provisions in an insurance contract \u201care reasonably susceptible of more than one interpretation, they will be construed strictly against the insurer and liberally in favor of the insured.\u201d <em>King v. Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 208, 519 N.E.2d 1380, at syllabus; see, also, <em>Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, at \u00b6 13. This \u201c \u2018rule will not be applied so as to provide an unreasonable interpretation of the words of the policy.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 14, 797 N.E.2d 1256, quoting <em>Morfoot v. Stake </em>(1963), 174 Ohio St. 506, 23 O.O.2d 144, 190 N.E.2d 573, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">Automobile Liability Policy</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">{\u00b6 10} CIC contends that the Blairs are not entitled to underinsured-motorist coverage under the automobile liability policy because the UM/UIM endorsement contains an \u201cother owned auto\u201d exclusion. That exclusion exempts coverage for injuries or property damage sustained while operating a motor vehicle that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>owned by a named insured if the motor vehicle is not specifically identified in the policy. Because the Blairs were injured while operating a motorcycle they owned but did not list on the declarations page, CIC contends that they are not entitled to underinsured-motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">{\u00b6 11} The Blairs counter that they are entitled to coverage because the policy is ambiguous and therefore must be construed in their favor. They argue that the policy fails to define \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d and that the \u201cother owned auto\u201d exclusion does not require the motor vehicle to be specifically identified as a \u201ccovered auto\u201d under the liability policy or by make, model, year, etc. Further, they argue, since the liability policy specifically states that a motorcycle can be a \u201ccovered auto,\u201d it is reasonable to interpret the contract as a whole to mean that a motorcycle owned, maintained, or used by a covered person is \u201cspecifically identified\u201d in the policy for purposes of the exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">{\u00b6 12} The trial court adopted the Blairs\u2019 arguments and determined that the automobile liability policy was ambiguous. The court concluded that it was reasonable to interpret the policy to mean that a motorcycle owned, maintained, or used by a covered person is \u201cspecifically identified\u201d as a motor vehicle for which UM/UIM coverage is provided. Because the motorcycle was specifically identified in the liability portion of the contract, the court concluded that the exclusion in the underinsured-motorist coverage was inapplicable and that the Blairs were entitled to coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">{\u00b6 13} R.C. 3937.18 allows insurance companies to exclude UM/UIM coverage for vehicles not listed in the policy. The Blairs do not dispute that CIC could exclude such vehicles; rather, they contend that the automobile policy issued by CIC does not accomplish this objective. Therefore, we examine the plain language of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">{\u00b6 14} The declaration sheet of the liability policy issued by CIC effective April 30, 2001, to April 30, 2002, lists three \u201ccovered autos\u201d: a 1997 Honda Accord LX, a 1995 Toyota Camry LE, and a 1992 GMC Sonoma. A 1994 Geo Tracker was apparently added to the policy but deleted before the accident, and the Camry was deleted and a 1996 Toyota Avalon was added. No motorcycles were ever listed as one of the \u201ccovered autos.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">{\u00b6 15} The liability coverage in the policy provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">When a covered person becomes legally responsible because of an auto accident or for physical damage to a non owned auto, we will pay:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-12\">A. for bodily injury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-13\">B. for property damage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-14\">C. for property damage to a non-owned auto;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>\u201cCovered person\u201d as used in this Part means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-5\">1. You or any family member for the ownership, maintenance or use of any auto (including a motorhome, truck or motorcycle) or trailer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">{\u00b6 16} The UWUIM endorsement states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-7\">We will pay compensatory damages which a covered person is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\">1. An uninsured motor vehicle * * * because of bodily injury:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-9\">a. Sustained by a covered person; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-10\">b. Caused by an accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">The policy defines \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d as including \u201ca land motor vehicle or trailer of any type * * * [wjhich is an underinsured motor vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-12\">{\u00b6 17} The uninsured-motorist endorsement also contains exclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-13\">A. We do not provide Uninsured Motorists Coverage for bodily injury or property damage sustained by any person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-14\">1. While that person is operating or occupying a motor vehicle owned by a named insured, a spouse or a resident relative of a named insured, if the motor vehicle is not specifically identified in the policy under which a claim is made, or is not a newly acquired or replacement motor vehicle covered under the terms of the policy under which the uninsured and underinsured motorist coverages are provided.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-15\">{\u00b6 18} The trial court determined that the CIC automobile policy was ambiguous because it failed to define the term \u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d We conclude that \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d must be given its ordinary meaning because the policy does not specifically define the term. The American Century Dictionary defines \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d as a \u201cpowered road vehicle, such as a car, truck, etc.\u201d Clearly, a motorcycle would fall within this definition. Moreover, the Ohio Supreme Court has interpreted the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d as used in R.C. 3937.18 to include motorcycles.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Horsely v. United Ohio Ins. Co. </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 44, 46, 567 N.E.2d 1004. The CIC policy is not ambiguous simply because it failed to define \u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d That term must be given its ordinary interpretation, which clearly includes motorcycles.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>{\u00b6 19} The Blairs do not dispute that they owned the motorcycle they were operating at the time of the accident. Therefore, we must determine whether the motorcycle was \u201cspecifically identified\u201d in the automobile policy. We conclude that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">{\u00b6 20} The trial court found that the policy could be reasonably interpreted as specifically identifying the motorcycle the Blairs were riding simply because it refers to a motorcycle under the definition of \u201ccovered person.\u201d This interpretation ignores the plain and ordinary meaning of the words used in the policy. The American Century Dictionary defines \u201cspecific\u201d as \u201cclearly defined,\u201d \u201cparticular,\u201d or \u201cexact; precise; giving full details.\u201d Therefore, a general reference to any motorcycle would not be a specific identification of that motorcycle. Rather, the policy would need to include characteristics such as the year, make, model, and vehicle identification number of the motorcycle for it to be \u201cspecifically identified\u201d in the policy. Here, the only motor vehicles specifically identified in the policy are those listed on the declarations page as \u201ccovered autos.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">{\u00b6 21} Having reviewed the CIC automobile policy, we conclude-that it was not ambiguous. The policy clearly excludes UM/UIM coverage for any motor vehicle owned and operated by a named insured that is not specifically identified in the policy. Because the Blairs were operating a motor vehicle that they owned and that was not specifically identified in the policy, the \u201cother owned auto\u201d exclusion applies and the Blairs are not entitled to UM/UIM coverage. The court erred in denying CIC\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granting the Blairs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Commercial General Liability Policy</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">{\u00b6 22} CIC also contends that the Blairs are not entitled to UM/UIM coverage under the commercial general liability policy issued to Classi Image, a sole proprietorship owned by Mrs. Blair. The commercial general liability policy includes an endorsement for hired-auto and nonowned auto liability. CIC acknowledges that in <em>Waters v. George, </em>Athens App. No. 02CA36, 2003-Ohio-2093, 2003 WL 1949751, we concluded that UM/UIM coverage should have been offered under a commercial general liability policy providing liability coverage for non-owned autos because the policy was a motor-vehicle policy. We held that the coverage existed in that case as a matter of law because the insurer failed to offer UM/UIM coverage, although we ultimately concluded that coverage was unavailable to the plaintiffs, as they were not insureds under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">{\u00b6 23} CIC contends that <em>Waters </em>is distinguishable because it interpreted an earlier version of R.C. 3937.18, which did not specifically define \u201cmotor vehicle policy.\u201d H.B. No. 261, effective September 30, 1997, amended R.C. 3937.18 to define a \u201cmotor vehicle policy\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Any policy of insurance that serves as proof of financial responsibility, as proof of financial responsibility is defined by division (K) of section 4509.01 of the Revised Code, for owners or operators of the motor vehicle specifically identified in the policy of insurance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The commercial general liability policy issued to Classi Images was effective from December 15, 1998, through December 15, 2001. Therefore, this statutory definition of \u201cmotor vehicle policy\u201d applies. Because the commercial general liability policy issued to Classi Images does not identify any specific motor vehicles, it cannot serve as proof of financial responsibility and does not qualify as a \u201cmotor vehicle policy\u201d under R.C. 3937.18. See <em>Russell v. Heritage Mut. Ins. Co., </em>Hamilton App. No. C-030868, 2004-Ohio-5851, 2004 WL 2480704, at \u00b6 11 (an insurance policy that does not list any specific automobiles cannot qualify as proof of financial responsibility). Therefore, CIC was not required to offer UM/UIM coverage to Classi Images, and no such coverage exists by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">{\u00b6 24} The Blairs also argue that the endorsement itself provides UM/ UIM coverage. Specifically, the Blairs rely on section (A)(3) of the endorsement, which states, \u201cWe will provide the uninsured/underinsured motorists coverage required by statute.\u201d The Blairs contend that the endorsement was actually drafted in 1992 and, at that time, the offering of UM/UIM coverage was statutorily required. Therefore, the endorsement must be interpreted as providing UM/UIM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">{\u00b6 25} The Ohio Supreme Court has held that the statutory law in effect at the time the parties enter into a contract for insurance controls the rights and duties of the contracting parties for determining the scope of coverage of an underinsured-motorist claim. <em>Ross v. Farmers Ins. Group of Cos., </em>82 Ohio St.3d 281, 1998-Ohio-381, 695 N.E.2d 732, at syllabus. The commercial general liability policy issued to Classi Images has an effective date of December 15, 1998, well after the legislature added the definition of \u201cmotor vehicle policy\u201d to R.C. 3937.18. The date that the endorsement was actually drafted has no relevance.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">{\u00b6 26} Because the commercial general liability policy does not specifically identify any automobiles, it cannot serve as proof of financial responsibility and is not a \u201cmotor vehicle policy\u201d as defined in R.C. 3937.18. Thus, CIC was not required to offer UM/UIM insurance to Classi Images, and its failure to do so does not result in coverage by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">{\u00b6 27} The provision that CIC \u201cwill provide the uninsured/underinsured motorists coverage required by statute\u201d does not require coverage here. This provision can only be interpreted as meaning that UM/UIM coverage will be provided under the Hired Auto and Non-Owned Liability Endorsement only when statutorily required. The Blairs have not cited any statute in effect at the inception of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>the policy that requires CIC to provide that coverage here. Therefore, no UM7UIM coverage exists under the endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">{\u00b6 28} The court erred in granting summary judgment to the Blairs and denying summary judgment to CIC as to the commercial general liability policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">{\u00b6 29} Having found merit in both of CIC\u2019s assigned errors, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand this matter for further action consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b130-8\">Abele, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AuH\">McFarland, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b127-16\">. {\u00b6 a} 2001 S.B.
