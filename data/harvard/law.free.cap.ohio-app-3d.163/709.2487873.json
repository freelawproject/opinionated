Painter, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b751-15\">{\u00b6 1} Plaintiffs-appellants Leonard and Vida Reith experienced extensive flooding of their driveway and house from 1993 until 2003. The Reiths believed that the flooding was caused by the construction in the early 1990s of the Chatham Woods subdivision on the farmland across the street from their house. The Reiths sued defendant-appellee Parrott <em>&amp; </em>Strawser Properties, Inc., the developer of the subdivision, and defendant-appellee McGill Smith Punshon, Inc., the engineering company that had designed the water-drainage system for the subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-16\">{\u00b6 2} The trial court granted McGill\u2019s motion for summary judgment based on the statute of limitations. The trial court denied the Reiths\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment. A jury trial was then held to determine whether Parrott had been negligent when it developed the subdivision. The jury found in favor of Parrott, concluding that there had been no negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-17\">{\u00b6 3} The Reiths now appeal with three assignments of error, arguing that the trial court erred when it granted summary judgment to McGill, and when it denied their motion for partial summary judgment. While we sympathize with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>the Reiths\u2019 plight, we must apply the law, in this case the statute of limitations. We hold that the trial court was correct in each of its rulings, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\"><em>I. The Water Comes </em>\u2014 But <em>from Where?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">{\u00b6 4} The Reiths moved into their house on Rich Road in 1986. At that time, the property across the street had a farmhouse on it surrounded by undeveloped farmland. The Chatham Woods subdivision was built in two stages, beginning in the late 1980s. The first stage, a Homerama development, was completed in the early 1990s. The second stage was completed in 1993 or 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">{\u00b6 5} The Reiths experienced no water problems until the end of 1993. Leonard Reith testified in his deposition that, beginning in late 1993, water would gather on the driveway after it rained. He would need to pump the water off the driveway, and he called the flooding \u201cdisconcerting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">{\u00b6 6} The Reiths repeatedly augered a drain pipe on their property, believing that it was clogged, but the flooding continued. In addition to the flooding of the driveway and sometimes minor flooding in the basement each time it rained heavily, the Reiths\u2019 yard gradually developed a sinkhole. Mr. Reith testified that they were not sure why the flooding had occurred, but that they did know that the water was coming from a catch basin on the opposite side of the street that was installed when Chatham Woods was constructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">{\u00b6 7} The Reiths eventually contacted the Hamilton County Engineer\u2019s office in 1996 or 1997. Bill Hill, a county engineer, came out to the Reiths\u2019 house and inspected the sinkhole. Hill told the Reiths that a pipe connecting their driveway drain to a pipe running underneath their yard had been breached. Hill also said that because the breached connection was under the Reiths\u2019 private property, it was the Reiths\u2019 responsibility, not the county\u2019s, to fix it.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">{\u00b6 8} The Reiths decided that they could not afford the estimated $60,000 to excavate their yard and to have the pipes fixed. So for the next several years, they continued pumping water from their driveway each time that it rained. The Reiths bought ever larger pumps, eventually, in 2000, purchasing an industrial-strength pump.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-11\">{\u00b6 9} In April or May 2001, the Reiths finally hired a contractor to excavate their yard and to install a catch basin at the site of the sinkhole. The work was scheduled to be done in late July.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-12\">{\u00b6 10} But before any work was done, on July 17, 2001, a massive rainstorm flooded the Reiths\u2019 driveway and house. The Reiths estimated that their basement had seven feet of water and their family room, a half-story up from the basement, had about a foot and a half of water. Mr. Reith testified that a gigantic wall of water had poured over Rich Road onto his property. Reith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>claimed that he had an \u201cepiphany\u201d that night and, for the first time, realized that all the water was coming from Chatham Woods.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">{\u00b6 11} The next morning, knowing that Parrott &amp; Strawser was the developer of Chatham Woods, Vida Reith called Neal Strawser and asked for the name of Parrott &amp; Strawser\u2019s insurance company. Strawser declined to divulge the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">{\u00b6 12} In August 2001, the contractor hired to excavate the yard and to install the catch basin came to the Reiths\u2019 property. At that point, it was discovered that, about eight feet underground, at the site of the sinkhole, a 24-inch pipe dead-ended. Unconnected to the 24-inch pipe were two 10-inch pipes, which then ran under the rest of the Reiths\u2019 property, eventually surfacing in a neighbor\u2019s yard. Because two 10-inch pipes can carry only about 40 percent of the flow of a 24-inch pipe, trouble followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">{\u00b6 13} The pipes were not connected and appeared never to have been connected, so the contractor could not complete his work. The Reiths contacted the Hamilton County Engineer\u2019s office and the Hamilton County Public Works Department. Each office sent a representative to the Reiths\u2019 house, both of whom told the Reiths that it was not the county\u2019s problem to fix, but the Reiths\u2019, because it was on private property.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">{\u00b6 14} Soon after, another rainstorm again flooded the Reiths\u2019 house. The Reiths then invested in 80-pound sandbags and barricaded their garage door. Though it required the Reiths to give up use of their garage, the sandbags effectively prevented any more flooding for several years. Meanwhile, the Reiths began litigation. After initially suing individual homeowners in the Chatham Woods subdivision, the Reiths eventually named McGill and Parrott as defendants in their suit in April 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">{\u00b6 15} Steve Mary, the Public Works representative who had visited the Reiths in 2001 after the first flood, told them that a possible solution for the problem would occur when the county followed through on a planned widening of Rich Road. In 2003, the county widened Rich Road. During the widening process, the pipe under the road from the subdivision to the Reiths\u2019 property was abandoned, and water from the subdivisi\u00f3n was rerouted along Rich Road. The Reiths have not experienced any more flooding since the piping was rerouted.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">{\u00b6 16} Richard Carr, a civil engineer, testified in a deposition for the Reiths. Carr stated that the Reiths\u2019 problem was caused by too much water flowing through the pipes under their yard. He also stated that had the 24-inch pipe continued under the entire length of the Reiths\u2019 yard, the system could probably have handled all the water. In fact, when Carr gave an estimate to the Reiths to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>eliminate the flooding, he suggested extending the 24-inch pipe under the entire length of their yard.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">{\u00b6 17} But in his deposition, Carr insisted that the cause of the flooding was not the ill-fitting pipes \u2014 the 24-inch pipe ending in gravel with two 10-inch pipes nearby \u2014 but too much water passing under the Reiths\u2019 yard. Carr testified that the water-drainage system for Chatham Woods was designed properly, in that all the water from the subdivision was collected and taken to Rich Road in a 24-inch pipe. But he thought that the designers of the system and the developers of the subdivision neglected to anticipate where all the water leaving the subdivision would eventually end up.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">{\u00b6 18} Carr testified that it was McGill\u2019s and Parrott\u2019s duty to ascertain that there was adequate outfall for the water leaving the subdivision. He claimed that if they had checked during construction to determine where all the water leaving the subdivision would eventually surface, they would have discovered that the outfall from the 24-inch pipe was two 10-inch pipes that eventually surfaced about 160 feet away from the Reiths\u2019 property in a neighbor\u2019s yard. In sum, Carr stated, \u201c[TJhey designed a beautiful system to convey the water to a certain point but then they failed to confirm that * * * there was a proper discharge from that point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">{\u00b6 19} James Watson, an engineer with McGill, did not work on the Chatham Woods project, but reviewed all the survey and engineering records retained by the company. He testified that the water-drainage design was consistent with the standards of the Hamilton County Public Works Department. He claimed that the Reiths\u2019 problem was caused by blockage of the pipes that ran through their yard, which was a private system.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">{\u00b6 20} Watson testified that an engineer did not have to determine the outfall. He said that the system designed by McGill drained the water to the existing watershed, which was the standard practice at the time. He testified that the design was reasonable because the surface water from 7.9 acres was directed towards the same 24-inch pipe that it had been directed to before the construction. Watson agreed that an engineer had an obligation to respect the limits of the watershed, but he insisted that the same amount of surface water had been directed into the existing 24-inch pipe.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">{\u00b6 21} Watson also testified that draining the water to the developed watershed was the only feasible design at the time. When the county widened Rich Road in 2003, it changed the water drainage from Chatham Woods so that the water ran along Rich Road, rather than across the road onto the Reiths\u2019 property. Watson testified that this was not a reasonable design for McGill to have used because it was more involved, and because there was simply no reason at the time not to use the same 24-inch pipe that had already drained the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>\n<em>II. Surface Water or Sewer Water</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">{\u00b6 22} The trial court granted McGill\u2019s motion for summary judgment, ruling that the four-year statute of limitations<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> barred the Reiths\u2019 claims. In their first assignment of error, the Reiths argue that the summary judgment was granted in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">{\u00b6 23} We review a grant of summary judgment de novo.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> McGill was entitled to prevail on its summary-judgment motion only if (1) there was no genuine issue of material fact, (2) it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) it appeared that reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion when viewing the evidence in favor of the party opposing the motion, and that conclusion was adverse to the party opposing the motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">{\u00b6 24} Before we discuss the statute of limitations, we must address the Reiths\u2019 argument that there is a legal distinction between storm water when it is above the ground and storm water when it is channeled through underground pipes. The Reiths contend that once the surface water enters a pipe underground, it becomes sewer water. That is simply not correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">{\u00b6 25} In <em>Crawford v. Rambo, </em>in 1886, the Ohio Supreme Court defined surface water as \u201cthat which is diffused over the surface of the ground, derived from falling rains and melting snows, and continues to be such until it reaches some well defined channel in which it is accustomed to, and does flow with other waters, whether derived from the surface or springs; and it then becomes the running water of a stream, and ceases to be surface water.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">{\u00b6 26} In <em>Mays v. Moran, </em>the Fourth Appellate District determined that water accumulating on the plaintiffs\u2019 property was surface water because it resulted from rainfall and drained by flowing across their property and eventually into a ditch.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Emminger v. Bergman, </em>the Second Appellate District determined that water created by rain and snow that was collected and delivered to the defendant\u2019s property through a 24-inch pipe was properly characterized as surface water.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> And in <em>Aeh v. Madison Twp. Trustees, </em>where the defendants constructed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>a culvert under a driveway that diverted rainwater onto the plaintiffs property, both parties and the court agreed without argument that the channeled underground water was surface water.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">{\u00b6 27} Consequently, we conclude that, in this case, the surface rain water that was temporarily channeled underground through pipes remained surface water until it reached an endpoint where it mixed with \u201cother waters.\u201d That is, it remained surface water while piped under the Reiths\u2019 property. It did not change character until it emptied from the two 10-inch pipes into a ditch in a neighbor\u2019s yard and flowed into a creek that eventually emptied into the Little Miami River.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">{\u00b6 28} The Reiths\u2019 attempt to define the storm water in a pipe as sewer water confuses a storm-water system and a sewage system. During Watson\u2019s deposition, the Reiths\u2019 own counsel clarified the point: \u201c[W]e\u2019re going to concentrate today basically on the storm water system and not the sewage system. Is that your understanding? These are separate and distinct things.\u201d Watson replied, \u201cSure.\u201d The Reiths\u2019 counsel continued, \u201cUnfortunately, some people don\u2019t understand the separate and distinct things and it creates problems; does it not?\u201d Watson acknowledged, \u201cIt does.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">{\u00b6 29} Despite this, in their appellate brief, the Reiths cite the statutory definitions of sewage and waste water, and argue that surface water must become sewage if it passes underground. Sewage is defined as any substance containing excrement, while waste water means any storm water containing sewage or other pollutants.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">{\u00b6 30} The difference between storm water and sewage lies in what the water contains, not in whether it is above or below ground. Thus, we are not persuaded that there is a legal distinction between surface water that is above the ground and surface water that is temporarily channeled through underground pipes.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">{\u00b6 31} Finally, the Reiths attempt to distinguish surface water above and below the ground by claiming that McGill\u2019s expert, Watson, made the distinction. But this is not so. Watson was asked whether water in the underground pipes was surface water, and he replied, \u201cSure it is.\u201d When opposing counsel pointed out that the surface water would no longer actually be on the surface, Watson acknowledged, \u201cSurface water collected by a pipe system, okay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">{\u00b6 32} Based on Watson\u2019s dubious \u201cadmission\u201d that the water\u2019s character changed once it entered a drainage system underground, the Reiths argue that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>the flooding that began in late 1993, which routinely entered their basement and caused a sinkhole in their yard, was a distinct injury separate from the extensive flooding they experienced in 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">{\u00b6 33} There is simply no legal or logical reason to make such a distinction, other than to help the Reiths avoid the statute of limitations barring their claims. We conclude that the distinction the Reiths attempt to make in this case between the earlier flooding and the later flooding, upon which much of their case rests, amounts to no distinction at all. The later flooding was more severe, but the undisputed facts indicate that all the flooding was caused by the same surface-water runoff.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">\n<em>III. Statute of Limitations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">{\u00b6 34} We now turn to the statute-of-limitations issue. Under R.C. 2305.09(A), there is a four-year statute of limitations for all trespass actions upon real property. Under R.C. 2305.09(D), the four-year limit applies for an injury to rights not arising from a contract. Therefore, the Reiths\u2019 claims for negligence and trespass were governed by the four-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">{\u00b6 35} The Reiths, relying on their distinction between two separate types of flooding, contend that only the surface flooding was governed by the four-year statute of limitations. But R.C. 2305.09 refers to \u201ctrespassing under ground.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This indicates that the four-year limit is meant to apply to all trespass claims upon real property, whether involving surface water or underground water. In addition, in <em>Harris v. Liston, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court held that the four-year limit of R.C. 2305.09(D) applies when a party seeks recovery for injury or damage to real property.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">{\u00b6 36} In <em>Harris, </em>the court also held that the four-year statute of limitations begins to run when damage to the property is \u201cfirst discovered, or through the exercise of reasonable diligence it should have been discovered.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Again relying on the false distinction between flooding caused by water coming over the top of the ground and flooding caused by pipes under the ground, the Reiths assert that because the \u201csurface water flooding did not occur until July 17, 2001,\u201d the cause of their damage was not discovered until 2001. Under this view, the statute of limitations did not begin running until 2001, and their claims against McGill were timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>(\u00b6 37} This, again, is a flawed argument. The undisputed facts indicate that the inadequate piping on the Reiths\u2019 private property led to water flooding their driveway, yard, and house. Sometimes the water was underground. Sometimes it was above the ground. But it was the same surface-water runoff. More importantly for statute-of-limitations purposes, the Reiths always suspected that the cause of their problems was the building of the Chatham Woods subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">{\u00b6 38} The Reiths began to experience serious flooding of their property in 1993 and 1994. Leonard Reith testified that, at that time, water would gather on the driveway after it rained, and that, there would be minor flooding in their basement. Vida Reith agreed in her deposition that they first experienced flooding in 1993 or 1994, after Chatham Woods was completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">{\u00b6 39} Leonard Reith\u2019s testimony revealed that there was a direct and observable correlation between the construction of Chatham Woods and the Reiths\u2019 water problems. Reith testified, \u201cThe more homes that were built, that is when I started experiencing the water problems, * * * [and] as that was being developed, more and more of that development was causing more of a problem. As it got developed, it was almost exponentially that the water would be more and more.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">{\u00b6 40} And later, Reith stated simply, \u201cI lived there predevelopment. I lived there post-development. My feet were dry predevelopment. My whole body was wet post-development.\u201d He reiterated, \u201cIt was continually getting worse and worse as the development was growing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">{\u00b6 41} Reith testified that \u201ca little bit later than \u201993-\u201994,\u201d the sinkhole in their yard began forming. He did not realize what it was at first and would repeatedly throw dirt into it. But the hole continued to get wider until he had to take action to ensure that people would not fall into it. By 1996 or 1997, he contacted Hamilton County about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">{\u00b6 42} The county engineer, Bill Hill, told the Reiths that the sinkhole was caused by a disconnect between pipes under their property. They were told, more than four years before their suit was filed, that it was their responsibility to determine specifically what the problem was and to fix it. When the Reiths finally followed Hill\u2019s advice, at least four years later, they discovered the inadequate outfall-pipe tie-in between the 24-inch pipe and the two 10-inch pipes.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">{\u00b6 43} We conclude, as a matter of law, on these undisputed facts that the Reiths knew or should have known that their property was being damaged by water flow associated with the Chatham Woods development at least four years before their lawsuit against McGill. Therefore, the Reiths\u2019 claim against McGill was barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>{\u00b6 44} The Reiths next correctly cite the proposition that negligence is not complete until there has been an invasion of a legally protected interest of the plaintiff, that is, until there is an occurrence of harm.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Keeping with the false distinction between surface flooding and underground flooding, the Reiths argue that there was no harm from surface water until 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">{\u00b6 45} But, again, the undisputed facts indicate that the Reiths experienced harm from McGill\u2019s allegedly negligent design beginning in late 1993. This was ten years before the Reiths sued McGill. While the \u201csurface flooding\u201d in July 2001 was more catastrophic than the earlier flooding, it was undoubtedly caused by the same problem with the pipes under the Reiths\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">{\u00b6 46} We agree with the trial court\u2019s assessment: \u201cInjury to the Reiths\u2019 property manifested itself and was discovered no later than 1994 under circumstances that any reasonable finder of fact would determine warranted investigation into potential causes related to the Chatham Woods development.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">{\u00b6 47} We hold that the Reiths\u2019 claim against McGill was time-barred and that the trial court properly granted summary judgment for McGill. Therefore, we overrule the Reiths\u2019 first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">\n<em>IV. Continuing Trespass</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">{\u00b6 48} In their second assignment of error, the Reiths argue that because the water causing the flooding on their property was a continuing trespass, the trial court erred when it used the four-year statute of limitations to grant McGill\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">{\u00b6 49} In <em>Frisch v. Monfort Supply Co., </em>we clarified the difference between a permanent and a continuing trespass.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> A permanent trespass occurs when the defendant\u2019s tortious act has been fully accomplished, but injury to the plaintiffs estate from that act persists in the absence of further conduct by the defendant.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In contrast, a continuing trespass results when the defendant\u2019s tortious activity is ongoing, perpetually creating fresh violations of the plaintiffs property rights.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>{\u00b6 50} A claim for a continuing trespass may be brought at any time until the claim has ripened into a presumptive right by adverse possession, which takes 21 years.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> But a claim for a permanent trespass must' be brought within the four-year statute of limitations of R.C. 2305.09(D).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In this case, the allegedly tortious act by McGill was the design of a drainage system that did not account for the eventual outfall of surface water. It is undisputed that McGill\u2019s design of the system, including even the installation of the system, was completed by 1994, at the latest. After that, McGill had nothing to do with Chatham Woods.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">{\u00b6 51} With McGill\u2019s allegedly tortious act completed, any ongoing injury to the Reiths\u2019 property would have had to be considered a permanent trespass. Under these circumstances, the Reiths were required to bring their trespass claim against McGill within four years of McGill\u2019s tortious act. As we have already discussed, the Reiths failed to timely file their claim within the four years, and, consequently, their trespass claim was barred by the statute of limitations. Therefore, we overrule the Reiths\u2019 second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">\n<em>V. Reiths Not Entitled to Summary Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">{\u00b6 52} In their third and final assignment of error, the Reiths argue that the trial court erred when it did not grant their motion for summary judgment against both McGill and Parrott on the issue of trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">{\u00b6 53} We have already determined that the Reiths\u2019 trespass claim against McGill was time-barred and that McGill was properly granted summary judgment. Therefore, as a matter of simple logic, the Reiths could not be entitled to summary judgment on their trespass claim against McGill. In support of their view, the Reiths again insist that there was a continuing trespass. But we have already addressed and dismissed that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">{\u00b6 54} As for Parrott, the matter is more complicated. The trial court denied not only the Reiths\u2019 motion for summary judgment, but also Parrott\u2019s summary-judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">{\u00b6 55} The trial court determined, as we have, that McGill\u2019s design and control responsibilities for the Chatham Woods drainage system ended no later than 1994. Once McGill\u2019s allegedly tortious act was completed, the Reiths had no claim for a continuing trespass against McGill.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>{\u00b6 56} But the trial court concluded that a similar definitive date could not be established for Parrott\u2019s involvement. The court determined that whether Parrott was continuously involved with Chatham Woods was unclear from the evidence before it, meaning that a question of fact remained for a jury to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">{\u00b6 57} Our review of the record convinces us that, at the summary-judgment stage, a question of fact remained concerning how much control Parrott retained over Chatham Woods and whether it retained responsibility for the drainage system. It is possible that Parrott did not retain any control over the system and was completely removed from responsibility for it, similar to McGill, thus making the trespass a permanent one subject to the four-year statute of limitations. It is also possible, though, that Parrott retained some control over the system, and that the trespass could be found to be a continuing trespass not barred by the four-year statute of limitations. But the Reiths had the obligation to prove the extent of Parrott\u2019s involvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">{\u00b6 58} We are also not convinced that reasonable minds, viewing the evidence in favor of Parrott, could come to but one conclusion, that being that Parrott trespassed on the Reiths\u2019 property. Reasonable minds could very well conclude that Parrott did not commit a trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">{\u00b6 59} Therefore, we hold, as the trial court did, that it was not appropriate to grant summary judgment against Parrott on the issue of trespass, and we overrule the Reiths\u2019 third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">{\u00b6 60} Parrott further argues that, under <em>Continental Ins. Co. v. </em>Whittington,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the trial court\u2019s denial of the Reiths\u2019 motion for summary judgment was mooted or rendered harmless because there was a subsequent trial. But without a full record before us of what happened at that trial, we cannot rely on <em>Continental </em>and simply hold that the trial court\u2019s denial of the Reiths\u2019 summary-judgment motion was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">{\u00b6 61} Having overruled all three of the Reiths\u2019 assignments of error, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b761-11\">Hildebrandt, P.J., and Hendon, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b755-9\">.
