Pasquale et al., appeal the Lake County Court of Common Pleas\u2019 award of summary judgment in favor of appellee, State Automobile Insurance Company. For the reasons herein, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">{\u00b6 2} On August 25, 2001, appellants\u2019 four-year-old son was struck by a Yamaha YZ-250 off-road motorcycle operated by Robert Gersten. The child eventually died from the injuries. As a result of the accident, appellants obtained a recovery from Gersten\u2019s liability carrier for his policy limits of $12,500. Appellants possessed personal automobile and business automobile insurance issued by appellee. Appellee consented to appellants\u2019 receipt of the tendered policy limits and reserved its right to contest any claim for uninsured/underinsured-motorist (\u201cUM/UIM\u201d) coverage under its policies. On September 18, 2002, appellee filed a complaint for declaratory judgment seeking a determination as to whether appellants were entitled to IIM/UIM coverage under either the personal auto policy or the business auto policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-13\">{\u00b6 3} On June 2, 2003, appellee filed its motion for summary judgment. In its motion, appellee argued that a provision in both policies, which restricted the definition of an uninsured/underinsured motor vehicle, precluded recovery. The provision purported to restrict the definition of uninsured/underinsured vehicle so as to exclude claims arising from vehicles designed mainly for use off public roads while not on public roads. On June 16, 2003, appellants filed a motion in opposition to appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment and their own cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>motion for summary judgment. In their motion, appellants did not dispute that the vehicle was an \u201coff-road\u201d motorcycle; rather, appellants contended that the off-road vehicle restriction was an invalid restriction of UM/UIM coverage under R.C. 3937.18 as it was drafted by Am.Sub.H.B. No. 261, 147 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2372 (\u201cH.B. 261\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">{\u00b6 4} On December 12, 2003, the trial court granted appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied appellants\u2019 motion. In awarding summary judgment to appellee, the trial court relied principally upon the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Davidson v. Motorists Mut. Ins. Co.,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a case interpreting a pre-H.B. 261 version of R.C. 3837.18. In its judgment entry, the trial court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cIn <em>Davidson </em>* * *, the Ohio Supreme Court noted that R.C. 3937.18 requires UWUIM coverage be offered when the policy is an automobile or motor vehicle liability policy. The court noted that automobiles are subject to motor vehicle registration and are designed for and are used for transporting people on a public highway. Id. at 268, 744 N.E.2d 713. It also noted that the definition of \u2018motor vehicle liability policy\u2019 that is provided in R.C. 4509.01(L) limits the phrase to policies certified as proof of financial responsibility for vehicles in which person or property may be transported upon a highway. Id. at 269, 744 N.E.2d 713. The court then went on to conclude that \u2018the financial responsibility laws and the UIM statute are related in purpose and that the General Assembly intended them both to apply only to policies that insure against liability arising from the ownership or operation of \u201cvehicles\u201d that can be used for transportation on the highway.\u2019 Id., citing <em>Delli Bovi v. Pacific Indemn. Co. </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 343, 345, 708 N.E.2d 693. While <em>Davidson </em>dealt with the question of whether a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy was required to offer uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage, the reasoning provided by the court is applicable here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">{\u00b6 6} Pursuant to the foregoing authority, the trial court determined that motor vehicle liability policies need cover only motor vehicles operated on highways. The court reasoned that IIWUIM coverage can be so limited because it is \u201cintended to provide reciprocal or the mutual equivalent of automobile liability coverage and because motor vehicles that are not intended to be operated on highways need not be covered by liability insurance * * *.\u201d The court concluded that excluding vehicles not intended for operation on highways does not violate the policies behind R.C. 3937.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">{\u00b6 7} Appellant appealed the foregoing judgment entry and raises the following assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>{\u00b6 8} \u201c[1.] Whether the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to State Automobile Insurance Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c[2.] Whether the trial court erred in denying the motion for summary judgment filed by defendant-appellant Russell J.

Appellants argue that the policy restrictions on UM/UIM coverage excluding claims arising from injuries occasioned by vehicles designed mainly for use off public roads while not on public roads are invalid restrictions of coverage under the applicable version of R.C. 3937.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-20\">{\u00b6 40} In response, appellee reiterates the argument supporting the trial court\u2019s judgment. Specifically, the trial court awarded appellee summary judgment based upon the clear and unambiguous nature of the exclusion in the policy in conjunction with its belief that such exclusions do not run afoul of the purposes of R.C. 3937.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-21\">{\u00b6 41} \u201c[F]or the purpose of determining the scope of coverage of an underinsured motorist claim, the statutory law in effect at the time of entering into a contract for automobile liability insurance controls the rights and duties of the contracting parties.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Here, the parties stipulated that the applicable version of R.C. 3937.18 is Am.Sub.H.B. No. 261 (effective September 3, 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>{\u00b6 42} In <em>Martin v. Midwestern Group Ins. Co.,</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Supreme Court of Ohio underscored that the purpose of UM/UIM coverage' as codified in R.C. 3937.18, is to protect persons, not vehicles, from losses which, due to the tortfeasor\u2019s lack of coverage, would go uncompensated.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Hence, to determine the validity of an exclusion of UM/UIM coverage, a court must determine whether the exclusion comports with the statutory guidelines set forth in R.C. 3937.18.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If the exclusion conflicts with or undermines the statute\u2019s purpose, it is invalid and unenforceable.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court emphasized that R.C. 3937.18 is the yardstick by which all exclusions of UM/UIM coverage must be measured.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">{\u00b6 43} <em>Martin </em>operated to invalidate \u201cother owned vehicle\u201d exclusions to the extent that they conflicted with the statute\u2019s purpose of protecting people, not vehicles.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> However, in 1997, <em>Martin </em>was superseded by amendments to former R.C. 3937.18(J) through H.B. 261, which permitted an insurance company to (1) exclude insureds who were not occupying covered vehicles and (2) particular classes of vehicles as being outside the definition of an UM/UIM vehicle. Put differently, subsequent to H.B. 261, insurance companies could include, in their insurance policies, exclusions pertaining to UM/UIM coverage as long as the exclusions did not conflict with R.C. 3937.18.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> While the amendment ostensibly modified the statute\u2019s purpose as construed by <em>Martin, </em>it did not affect <em>Martin\u2019s </em>holding that an exclusion of UM/UIM coverage must conform to R.C. 3937.18.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">{\u00b6 44} With this in mind, we note that the applicable version of R.C. 3937.18 (H.B.261) provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">{\u00b6 45} \u201c(A) No automobile liability or motor vehicle liability policy of insurance insuring against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury or death suffered by any person arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state * * * unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>both of the following coverages are offered to persons insured under the policy for loss due to bodily injury or death suffered by such insureds:</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">{\u00b6 46} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">{\u00b6 47} \u201c(2) Underinsured motorist coverage, which shall be in an amount of coverage equivalent to the automobile liability or motor vehicle liability coverage and shall provide protection for insureds thereunder against loss for bodily injury, sickness, or disease, including death, suffered by any person insured under the policy * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">{\u00b6 48} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">{\u00b6 49} \u201c(J) The coverages offered under division (A) of this section or selected in accordance with division (C) of this section may include terms and conditions that preclude coverage for bodily injury or death suffered by an insured under any of the following circumstances:</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">{\u00b6 50} \u201c(1) While the insured is operating or occupying a motor vehicle owned by, furnished to, or available for the regular use of a named insured * * * if the motor vehicle is not specifically identified in the policy under which a claim is made * *</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">{\u00b6 51} \u201c(2) While the insured is operating or occupying a motor vehicle without a reasonable belief that the insured is entitled to do so, provided that under no circumstances will an insured whose license has been suspended, revoked, or' never issued, be held to have a reasonable belief that the insured is entitled to operate a motor vehicle;</p>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">{\u00b6 52} \u201c(3) When the bodily injury or death is caused by a motor vehicle operated by any person who is specifically excluded from coverage for bodily injury liability in the policy under which the uninsured and underinsured motorist coverages provided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-12\">{\u00b6 53} Here, the decedent was struck by an underinsured party driving a motor vehicle excluded under the policy; to wit, \u201ca vehicle designated for use off public roads while not on public roads.\u201d As indicated above, any exclusion in an insurance policy relating to UM/UIM coverage <em>must </em>conform with the dictates of R.C. 3937.18.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As far as we can discern, the exclusion in appellee\u2019s policy fails to fall into one of the specified \u201cexcludable\u201d categories set forth under R.C. 3937.18(J) as it was written at the time of H.B. 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-13\">{\u00b6 54} In particular, while the motorcycle that struck the decedent was not identified in the policy, neither appellant nor any other insured was operating or occupying it at the time of the accident. Accordingly, R.C. 3937.18(J)(1) does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>apply. Further, R.C. 3937.18(J)(2) is inapplicable because, again, an insured was not <em>operating or occupying </em>the motor vehicle in question. Finally, R.C. 3937.18(J)(3) does not apply because the driver of the motorcycle was not \u201cspecifically excluded from coverage for bodily injury liability\u201d under the policy. As the exclusion fails to fall into one of the specified categories set forth under R.C. 3937.18(J), it does not comport with the letter of the statute. Thus, without more, we cannot categorically say it comports with the purpose of the statute as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">{\u00b6 55} Furthermore, H.B. 261 defined four classes of vehicles which would not be understood as \u201cunderinsured motor vehicles\u201d and could therefore be properly excluded from coverage:</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">{\u00b6 56} \u201c(K) As used in this section, \u2018uninsured motor vehicle\u2019 and \u2018underinsured motor vehicle\u2019 do not include any of the following motor vehicles:</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">{\u00b6 57} \u201c(1) A motor vehicle that has applicable liability coverage in the policy under which the uninsured and underinsured motorist coverages are provided;</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">{\u00b6 58} \u201c(2) A motor vehicle owned by, furnished to, or available for the regular use of a named insured, a spouse, or a resident relative of a named insured;</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">{\u00b6 59} \u201c(3) A motor vehicle owned by a political subdivision, unless the operator of the motor vehicle has an immunity under Chapter 2744. of the Revised Code that could be raised as a defense in an action brought against the operator by the insured;</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">{\u00b6 60} \u201c(4) A motor vehicle self-insured within the meaning of the financial responsibility law of the state in which the motor vehicle is registered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">{\u00b6 61} The exception which appellee seeks validation, i.e., vehicles designated for use off public roads while not on public roads, does not appear in the statute. Hence, by operation of \u201cexpressio unius est exclusio alterius\u201d we cannot say, as a matter of law, that appellee\u2019s exclusion is valid under H.B. 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">{\u00b6 62} While our research fails to reveal a case precisely on point with the issue in the instant matter, the Sixth Appellate District\u2019s opinion in W. <em>Am. Ins. Co. v. </em>Holman<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> addressed a similar exclusion and found it invalid under a pre-H.B. 261 version of R.C. 3937.18. In <em>Holman, </em>an insured was struck and killed by a sprint racecar while acting as a flagman at a racetrack. The claimant sought underinsured-motorist coverage, but the carrier rejected the claim citing a restriction in the coverage, which provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b428-12\">{\u00b6 63} \u201c \u2018* * * \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d does not include any vehicle or equipment</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>{\u00b6 64} \u201c \u2018 * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">{\u00b6 65} \u201c \u20185. Designed mainly for use off public roads while not on public roads.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">{\u00b6 66} The court held the restriction invalid as the vehicle in question was a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d pursuant to R.C. 4501.01(B) and the intent R.C. 3937.18(A)(1) is to provide UM/UIM coverage for injured persons \u201cwho have a legal cause of action against a tortfeasor but who are uncompensated because the tortfeasor is either (1) not covered by liability insurance or (2) covered in an amount that is less than the insured\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The court concluded:</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">{\u00b6 67} \u201c[Ajppellant has a legal cause of action against the tortfeasor for her decedent\u2019s death but will go uncompensated by the tortfeasor who is uninsured. The exclusion in the policy issued by appellee, if given effect, will eliminate uninsured motorist coverage to appellant even though her claim arises from a cause of action recognized by Ohio tort law, a result that would clearly be contrary to the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting R.C. 3937.18.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">{\u00b6 68} The substantive holding in <em>Holman </em>is instructive; however, the fact that <em>Holman </em>was based upon a pre-H.B. 261 version of R.C 3937.18 is perhaps more illuminating. While drafting H.B. 261, the legislature had a universe of possible exclusions and limitations it could have included in the retooled version of R.C. 3937.18. Because insurance carriers attempted to exclude recreational vehicles from UM/UIM coverage prior to H.B. 261,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> we can presume that the legislature was aware that carriers found such exclusions desirable. However, the legislature did not specifically permit the exclusion of recreational vehicles in H.B. 261. In our view, such an omission is telling: the General Assembly did not intend such exclusions to fall within the scope of valid UM/UIM limitations. In our view, the exclusion at issue is invalid as it failed to comport with R.C. 3937.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">{\u00b6 69} In concluding that appellee\u2019s exclusion did not violate the policies behind R.C. 3937.18, the trial court failed to engage in an analysis of the language of the statute. Rather, it arrived at its decision solely through an application of the reasoning in <em>Davidson, </em>supra. While the trial court\u2019s reasoning is novel and creative, we hold that <em>Davidson </em>does not apply to the issue at bar. First, the issue in <em>Davidson </em>was whether a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy was transformed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>into a motor vehicle liability policy and therefore subject to UM/UIM coverage because it provided limited liability coverage for a \u201cmotorized conveyance designed for recreational use.\u201d By contrast, we are asked to resolve whether a limitation on UM/UIM coverage is valid pursuant to R.C. 3937.18 as it existed under H.B. 261. Both policies at issue on this appeal are motor vehicle liability policies. Therefore, UM/UIM coverage is presumptively required, subject to the limitations and exceptions set forth in the H.B. 261 version of R.C. 3937.18. The concerns animating the issues in <em>Davidson </em>are, in effect, nonissues for our purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">{\u00b6 70} We believe that the trial court erred as a matter of law when it resolved the current issue on the basis of <em>Davidson. </em>\u201cIt is well established that \u2018in construing a statute, a court\u2019s paramount concern is the legislative intent in enacting the statute.* * * In determining legislative intent, the court first looks to the language in the statute and the purpose to be accomplished.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>Davidson, </em>while indicating that UM/UIM coverage should be limited to vehicles designed for highway use, was interpreting a pre-H.B. 261 version of R.C. 3937.18. Hence, in order to determine whether the exclusion itself is congruent with the policies behind R.C. 3937.18 as it existed under H.B. 261, a court must observe whether the exclusion contradicts or is outside the scope of the language of the statute and the case law surrounding H.B. 261. The trial court\u2019s judgment entry fails to reflect any such consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">{\u00b6 71} Therefore, we hold that the trial court erred in awarding appellee summary judgment because the exclusions to the insurance policies at issue are contrary to the language of and policies behind R.C. 3937.18 as it existed under H.B. 261. To the extent that the exclusions do not comply with R.C. 3937.18, appellants were entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">{\u00b6 72} For the above reasons, appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error are sustained.

The legislature intended financial responsibility laws and the UM/UIM statute \u201cto apply only to policies that insure against liability arising from the ownership or operation of \u2018vehicles\u2019 that can be used for transportation <em>on the highway.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Davidson v. Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 262, 269, 744 N.E.2d 713. Such limitation is logical since the purpose of the UM/UIM statute is the protection of those using the highways from injury caused by other users of the highways who have no or inadequate liability coverage. <em>Cincinnati Indemn. Co. v. Martin </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 604, 608, 710 N.E.2d 677; <em>Martin v. Midwestern Group Ins. Co. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 478, 480, 639 N.E.2d 438. As the court in <em>Davidson </em>correctly noted, vehicles designed for and used on public highways are the focus of statutory UM/UIM coverage requirements. Id. at 268, 744 N.E.2d 713. With this in mind, the state statute does not have to expressly exempt go-carts, dirt bikes, and off-road vehicles from the statutory UM/UIM mandates because these vehicles are <em>not </em>designed for highway use. The trial court is correct \u2014 excluding vehicles not intended for operation on highways does not violate the policies behind R.C. 3937.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">{\u00b6 75} Under the majority\u2019s analysis, individuals harmed on walking trails by recreational vehicles or, on a golf course by a golf cart, or injured by a go-cart at a go-cart track can seek UM/UIM coverage compensation. The risk of such injury is incalculable since most of those vehicles do not require registration or are outside the regulatory scheme. This open-ended, incalculable, outside-the-scope-of-the-written policy expansion of automobile liability insurance coverage is reminiscent of the flawed analysis in <em>Scott-Pontzer v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 660, 710 N.E.2d 1116.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">{\u00b6 76} In this case, appellant\u2019s loss is tragic. However, appellee\u2019s policy did not provide UM/UIM coverage for motor vehicles \u201c[djesignated for use off public roads while not on public roads.\u201d Appellants did not dispute that the vehicle involved in this tragic accident was an off-road vehicle. Thus, this accident did not fall within appellee\u2019s policy coverage. Since this vehicle was not designed for highway use, that policy exclusion is not an invalid restriction under R.C. 3937.18. See <em>Davidson, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 269, 744 N.E.2d 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">{\u00b6 77} For these reasons, the judgment of the Lake County Court of Common Pleas should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
