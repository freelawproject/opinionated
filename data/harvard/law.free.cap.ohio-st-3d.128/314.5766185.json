Gallagher, from proceeding in the underlying criminal case against him. Bandarapalli claims that his indictment is defective. Bandarapalli has adequate remedies in the ordinary course of law by motion to dismiss the indictment and, in the event he is convicted based on the alleged defective indictment, by appeal. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Parker v. Cuyahoga Cty. Court of Common Pleas </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 351, 352, 15 O.O.3d 435, 402 N.E.2d 508; <em>State ex rel. Johnson v. Talikka </em>(1994), 71 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Ohio St.3d 109, 111, 642 N.E.2d 353; <em>Pishok v. Kelly, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 292, 2009-Ohio-3452, 910 N.E.2d 1033, \u00b6 1. Bandarapalli\u2019s reliance on <em>State v. Cimpritz </em>(1953), 158 Ohio St. 490, 49 O.O. 418, 110 N.E.2d 416, paragraph six of the syllabus, to contend that he may raise a claim that his indictment is defective in a collateral proceeding like prohibition is misplaced because we later clarified <em>Cimpritz </em>by holding that a defective-indictment claim could be raised only by direct challenge in the ordinary course of law rather than in a collateral attack by extraordinary writ. See <em>State v. Wozniak </em>(1961), 172 Ohio St. 517, 522-523, 18 O.O.2d 58, 178 N.E.2d 800, and <em>Midling v. Perrini </em>(1968), 14 Ohio St.2d 106, 43 O.O.2d 171, 236 N.E.2d 557, syllabus.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AYV\">Rajpal Bandarapalli, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Apg\">William D. Mason, Cuyahoga County Prosecuting Attorney, and James E. Moss, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">{\u00b6 2} Bandarapalli\u2019s remaining prohibition claim \u2014 that Judge Gallagher cannot preside over his criminal trial because she ruled on the state\u2019s motion under Crim.R. 16 to withhold witnesses\u2019 names and addresses and to prevent contact between Bandarapalli and the witnesses \u2014 is reviewable on appeal for harmless error. See <em>State v. Gillard </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 226, 229-230, 533 N.E.2d 272, reversed on other grounds by <em>State v. McGuire </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 390, 686 N.E.2d 1112.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">{\u00b6 3} Based on the foregoing, Bandarapalli\u2019s claims allege, at best, errors in the exercise of the court\u2019s jurisdiction rather than a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. See <em>State ex rel. Mosier v. Fornof, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 47, 2010-Ohio-2516, 930 N.E.2d 305, \u00b6 7. Therefore, the court of appeals properly dismissed his complaint for extraordinary relief in prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b447-7\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
