The Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline adopted the agreement of the parties in its entirety. Because it is an appropriate sanction in this case, we accept the board\u2019s recommendation and impose a one-year stayed suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-14\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b491-15\">{\u00b6 4} The stipulated facts of this case show that from March 2007 through December 2008, respondent deposited into his client trust account both client and personal funds, including attorney fees and retainers, and money from his Public Employees Retirement System account. From June 2005 through March 2009, respondent wrote checks to himself, his wife, and his creditors, using his client trust account as though it were a personal bank account and law-office operating account.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>{\u00b6 5} Respondent submitted a timely response to relator\u2019s initial letter of inquiry. But when relator requested copies of his 2005 to 2008 income tax returns, respondent assured him that he would provide them and then failed to do so in a timely fashion. He did, however, provide those documents to relator prior to the execution of the consent-to-discipline agreement, and relator states that there is no evidence suggesting that respondent used his client trust account in an effort to shield funds from creditors or the Internal Revenue Service.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">{\u00b6 6} The parties have stipulated that respondent\u2019s conduct prior to February 1, 2007,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> violated DR 1-102(A)(6) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law) and 9-102(A) (requiring the preservation of the identity of client funds), that his conduct after that date violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(a) (requiring a lawyer to hold property of clients separate from the lawyer\u2019s own property) and 8.4(h) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law), and that his failure to provide information requested by relator violated Prof.Cond.R. 8.1(b) (prohibiting a lawyer from knowingly failing to respond to a demand for information by a disciplinary authority during an investigation), 8.4(d) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice), and 8.4(h) and Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G) (requiring a lawyer to cooperate with a disciplinary investigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">{\u00b6 7} When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we consider relevant factors, including the ethical duties that the lawyer violated and the sanctions imposed in similar cases. <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 16. In making a final determination, we also weigh evidence of the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B). <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Broeren, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 473, 2007-Ohio-5251, 875 N.E.2d 935, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">{\u00b6 8} Neither the parties nor the board has identified any aggravating factors weighing in favor of a greater sanction, but we find that the respondent has engaged in a pattern of misconduct. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(c). The parties have stipulated and the board agrees that respondent\u2019s lack of a prior disciplinary record, the absence of a dishonest or selfish motive, and his character and reputation are mitigating factors weighing in favor of a lesser sanction. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a), (b), and (e).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"aus-dedup-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Jonathan E. Coughlan, Disciplinary Counsel, and Stacy Solochek Beckman, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AY_\">Thomas J. Simon, pro se.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b493-3\">{\u00b6 9} In <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Johnston, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 403, 2009-Ohio-1432, 904 N.E.2d 892, \u00b6 16, we imposed a one-year suspension stayed on the conditions that the attorney complete one year of monitored probation and six hours of continuing legal education in law-office management and accounting. Like the respondent in this case, Johnston had impermissibly commingled his personal and client funds and used his client trust account to pay his personal and business expenses. Id. at \u00b6 7. But Johnston\u2019s conduct was more serious than respondent\u2019s because he had overdrawn his client trust account 22 times in a two-year period. Id. at \u00b6 8. In contrast, there is no evidence that respondent\u2019s trust account was ever overdrawn or that any client was harmed as a result of his conduct. Thus, we agree that a one-year stayed suspension is an appropriate sanction for respondent\u2019s misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">{\u00b6 10} Therefore, on the board\u2019s recommendation, we accept the consent-to-discipline agreement. For violations of DR 1 \u2014 102(A)(6) and 9-102(A), Prof. Cond.R. 1.15(a), 8.1(b), 8.4(d), and 8.4(h), and Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G), we hereby suspend Thomas John Simon from the practice of law for one year but stay that suspension on the condition that he commit no further misconduct. If respondent fails to comply with this condition, the stay will be lifted and respondent will serve the entire one-year suspension. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b493-6\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b492-8\">.
