However, well after the expiration of the time period for making a motion for acquittal under Crim.R. 29(C), Ross filed a supplemental memorandum urging the trial court to grant him an acquittal. The trial court then purported to grant what it characterized as Ross\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the court\u2019s previous order denying Ross\u2019s motion for acquittal. The state appealed, contending that the court of common pleas lacks jurisdiction to grant an untimely Crim.R. 29(C) motion for acquittal because Crim.R. 45(B) bars any extension of time not expressly provided for by Crim.R. 29(C), and any order purporting to grant acquittal outside the confines of Crim.R. 29(C) is void and unenforceable. The court of appeals affirmed. <em>State v. Ross, </em>184 Ohio App.3d 174, 2009-Ohio-3561, 920 N.E.2d 162, \u00b6 25. We granted review. <em>State v. Ross, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 1472, 2010-Ohio-354, 921 N.E.2d 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-15\">I. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b415-16\">{\u00b6 3} In 1999, a Summit County grand jury indicted Denny Ross for the kidnapping, rape, murder, and aggravated murder of Hanna Hill and for tamper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>ing with evidence and abuse of a corpse. The indictment, as supplemented, alleged two aggravating circumstances \u2014 committing murder during a rape and committing murder during a kidnapping \u2014 making Ross eligible for the death penalty. See R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). During Ross\u2019s trial, the court granted in part Ross\u2019s motion for acquittal under Crim.R. 29(A), ordering dismissal of the kidnapping charge and the related death-penalty specification. At the close of all evidence, Ross again moved for acquittal on the remaining charges under Crim.R. 29(A), but that motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">{\u00b6 4} Before the jury trial concluded, the trial judge granted a mistrial because of juror misconduct. The jury was discharged on October 28, 2000. The trial court then discovered that the jury had filled out some of the verdict forms to acquit (with regard to the charges of aggravated murder, murder, and rape), but the court did not accept those verdicts because the jury already had been discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">{\u00b6 5} Within 14 days of the trial court\u2019s discharge of the jury, Ross renewed his motion for acquittal, under Crim.R. 29(C), on the remaining charges of aggravated murder, murder, rape, tampering with evidence, and abuse of a corpse. He also filed a motion to perfect the verdicts of acquittal and a motion to dismiss the case on double-jeopardy grounds. A different judge was appointed to preside over the case after the recusal of Judge Bond, the original trial judge. The new trial judge granted the motion to dismiss on double-jeopardy grounds and declined to rule on the other motions, including the Crim.R. 29(C) motion for acquittal. On direct appeal of the trial court\u2019s double-jeopardy ruling, the court of appeals reversed and remanded the case for retrial. <em>State v. Ross, </em>9th Dist. No. 20980, 2002-Ohio-7317, 2002 WL 31890088.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">{\u00b6 6} On September 10, 2003, after the court of appeals\u2019 decision and before the federal courts\u2019 final resolution of Ross\u2019s separate challenge to the mistrial in federal habeas corpus proceedings, the common pleas court in a one-page order denied Ross\u2019s motions for acquittal and to perfect the jury verdicts and scheduled the case for trial on November 17, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>{\u00b6 7} On September 12, 2003, almost three years after the jury had been discharged after the mistrial, Ross filed a document entitled \u201cdefendant\u2019s supplemental memorandum in support of his motion to perfect the three unanimous verdicts of acquittal.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On October 3, 2003, the trial court issued an order to grant the state additional time to respond to Ross\u2019s September 12, 2003 filing and to permit oral argument and a hearing on the merits of Ross\u2019s motion to perfect the verdicts. In its October 3, 2003 entry, the trial court characterized Ross\u2019s September 12, 2003 filing as a motion to reconsider its order of September 10, 2003. A week later, the trial court issued an order granting Ross\u2019s motion to continue the trial and setting a scheduling conference for October 15, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">{\u00b6 8} On November 6, 2003, Ross filed a supplemental memorandum in support of his renewed motion for judgment of acquittal pursuant to Crim.R. 29. This was the first time after the September 10, 2003 order denying his motion for acquittal that Ross sought to renew his acquittal motion. In this filing, Ross urged dismissal of the rape charge and the aggravating circumstance of killing the victim in the course of committing a rape and requested the court to consider the state\u2019s recent posttrial notice of additional evidence, pursuant to <em>Brady v. Maryland </em>(1963), 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215, which cast doubt on some of the state\u2019s expert testimony at trial regarding the apparent bite marks found on the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">{\u00b6 9} The trial court held a hearing on Ross\u2019s motions, including his renewed motion for acquittal, on November 12, 2003. At that hearing, and in a written response to Ross\u2019s renewed motion, the state objected to the trial court\u2019s consideration of Ross\u2019s renewed motion on the ground that it was filed well after the 14-day deadline for such motions in Crim.R. 29(C). On November 26, 2003, Ross filed a second supplemental memorandum in support of his renewed motion for acquittal pursuant to Crim.R. 29. The trial court issued a written opinion purporting to reconsider its previous denial of Ross\u2019s motion for acquittal and acquitting Ross of the rape charge and the related death-penalty specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">{\u00b6 10} The state filed both an appeal as of right and a motion for leave to appeal. In the motion, the state sought leave to appeal the judgment entry <em>\u201cgranting Defendant\u2019s Motion to Reconsider the court\u2019s Previous Denial of Defendant\u2019s Criminal Rule 29 Motion for Judgment of Acquittal, </em>and specifically granting the Defendant Judgment of Acquittal of the offense of Rape and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Death Specification.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) The court of appeals, in a brief order, granted without discussion the state\u2019s motion for leave to appeal under R.C. 2945.67(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">{\u00b6 11} After the federal appellate court rejected Ross\u2019s double-jeopardy claims in his habeas petition, the Ninth District Court of Appeals considered the state\u2019s appeal of the order reconsidering denial of Ross\u2019s acquittal motion. The court of appeals held that the trial court\u2019s initial denial of Ross\u2019s motion for acquittal under Crim.R. 29(C) was not a final judgment under R.C. 2505.02(B) and because the denial was an interlocutory order, the motion could be reconsidered and granted. 184 Ohio App.3d 174, 2009-Ohio-3561, 920 N.E.2d 162, \u00b6 12, 17, 25. The state appealed from that decision, and we granted review. 124 Ohio St.3d 1472, 2010-Ohio-354, 921 N.E.2d 244. The state asserts the following proposition of law: \u201cThe Court of Common Pleas lacks jurisdiction to grant an untimely Crim.R. 29(C) motion for acquittal because Crim.R. 45(B) bars \u2018any action\u2019 not expressly provided for by Crim.R. 29(C), and any order purporting to grant acquittal outside the confines of Crim.R. 29(C) is void and unenforceable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">{\u00b6 12} This appeal requires us to determine whether a trial court may reconsider a timely made, but previously denied, motion for acquittal pursuant to Crim.R. 29(C), if the defendant, after the 14-day deadline in that rule, renews the motion. Before we discuss that question, we address whether the state\u2019s appeal of the trial court\u2019s order reconsidering its denial of Ross\u2019s motion for acquittal was proper under R.C. 2945.67(A), which addresses state appeals in criminal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">\n<em>A</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">{\u00b6 13} The first question presented in this appeal is whether the trial court\u2019s order purporting to reconsider and grant Ross an acquittal on the rape charge and related death-penalty specification is an order from which the state may appeal pursuant to R.C. 2945.67(A). The state contends that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter an acquittal, so the trial court\u2019s order was not a \u201cfinal verdict\u201d that R.C. 2945.67(A) prohibits the state from appealing. R.C. 2945.67(A) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cA prosecuting attorney * * * may appeal as a matter of right any decision of a trial court in a criminal case, * * * which decision grants a motion to dismiss all or any part of an indictment, complaint, or information, a motion to suppress evidence, or a motion for the return of seized property or grants post conviction relief pursuant to sections 2953.21 to 2953.24 of the Revised Code, <em>and may appeal by leave of the court to which the appeal is taken any other decision, except the final verdict, of the trial court in a criminal case.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>1</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">{\u00b6 15} In addition to the orders that the statute specifies are appealable as of right, R.C. 2945.67(A) allows the state, by leave of court, to appeal \u201cany other decision\u201d in a criminal case \u201cexcept the final verdict.\u201d In <em>State v. Keeton </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 379, 18 OBR 434, 481 N.E.2d 629, paragraph two of the syllabus, this court concluded that a \u201cdirected verdict of acquittal by the trial judge in a criminal case is a \u2018final verdict\u2019 within the meaning of R.C. 2945.67(A) which is not appealable by the state as a matter of right or by leave to appeal pursuant to that statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">{\u00b6 16} In <em>State ex rel. Yates v. Court of Appeals for Montgomery Cty. </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 30, 512 N.E.2d 343, syllabus, we held that a judgment of acquittal entered by the trial court pursuant to Crim.R. 29(C) is a final verdict within the meaning of R.C. 2945.67 and is not appealable by the state as a matter of right or by leave to appeal pursuant to that statute. That was so even though the jury in that case had returned a guilty verdict so that a reversal of the acquittal, and resulting retrial of the defendant, would not have been prohibited by the Double Jeopardy Clause. Id. at 31-32, citing <em>United States v. Scott </em>(1978), 437 U.S. 82, 98 S.Ct. 2187, 57 L.Ed.2d 65; <em>United States v. Wilson </em>(1975), 420 U.S. 332, 95 S.Ct. 1013, 43 L.Ed.2d 232. See also <em>United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co. </em>(1977), 430 U.S. 564, 571, 97 S.Ct. 1349, 51 L.Ed.2d 642 (an acquittal is an order that \u201crepresents a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged\u201d). The court in <em>Yates </em>explained: \u201cThe issue under Ohio law is not one of double jeopardy but rather whether a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Crim.R. 29(C) is a final verdict.\u201d 32 Ohio St.3d at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">{\u00b6 17} In <em>Yates, </em>this court granted a writ of prohibition to prevent the court of appeals from exercising jurisdiction over the state\u2019s attempted appeal of the acquittal. Because the appellate court was patently and unambiguously \u201cwithout jurisdiction to act\u201d to consider the state\u2019s appeal, the availability of a remedy by appeal did not prevent issuance of a writ of prohibition. See id. at 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">{\u00b6 18} Among orders that are included within \u201cany other decision, except the final verdict,\u201d and which the state may appeal by leave of court under R.C. 2945.67(A), are certain evidentiary rulings, see <em>State v. Arnett </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 186, 22 OBR 272, 489 N.E.2d 284, syllabus; orders granting a new trial on motion of a defendant, see <em>State v. Matthews </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 375, 691 N.E.2d 1041, syllabus; and \u201csubstantive law rulings made in a criminal case which result in a judgment of acquittal so long as the judgment itself is not appealed,\u201d see <em>State v. Bistricky </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 157, 555 N.E.2d 644, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">{\u00b6 19} In <em>Bistricky, </em>the trial court dismissed drug-trafficking charges against five police officers on the basis that they were entitled to the exemption in R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>3719.14(B) (police officer is exempt from drug-sale prohibitions when the sale is a job duty). The state sought leave to appeal the determination that R.C. 3719.14(B) is not an affirmative defense and the trial court\u2019s ruling that the statutory exemption covered the sale and delivery of drugs. The state expressly conceded that double-jeopardy principles prohibited the retrial of defendants, but asserted that the court of appeals under R.C. 2945.67(A) could grant leave to appeal the legal bases of the acquittal ruling. The court of appeals dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">{\u00b6 20} On review, this court agreed that double-jeopardy principles prohibited retrial of the defendants, but noted that resolution of the legal issue of whether the appeal was permitted would not affect the bar to retrial. <em>Bistricky, </em>51 Ohio St.3d at 158, 555 N.E.2d 644. We first concluded that the issue of whether a substantive legal determination underlying an acquittal was appealable by the state under R.C. 2945.67(A) was capable of repetition, yet evading review, so it was not moot despite the bar against retrying the defendants. Id. at 159. On the authority of <em>Keeton, </em>18 Ohio St.3d 379, 18 OBR 434, 481 N.E.2d 629, and <em>Arnett, </em>22 Ohio St.3d 186, 22 OBR 272, 489 N.E.2d 284, both of which allowed a state to file a discretionary appeal of certain evidentiary rulings in a criminal case, this court in <em>Bistricky </em>held that the state may seek leave to appeal the legal determination on the application and scope of the exemption statute, R.C. 3719.14, even though that determination led to the defendants\u2019 acquittals. We held that <em>\u201ca </em>court of appeals has discretionary authority pursuant to R.C. 2945.67(A) to decide whether to review substantive law rulings made in a criminal case which results [sic] in a judgment of acquittal so long as the verdict itself is not appealed.\u201d 51 Ohio St.3d at 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">{\u00b6 21} The question here is whether the prosecutor\u2019s appeal of the trial court\u2019s December 22, 2003 order is authorized under R.C. 2945.67(A) as an appeal of \u201cany other decision, except the final verdict.\u201d The state\u2019s motion for leave to appeal provided that the state appealed from the common pleas court\u2019s \u201cJudgment Entry of December 22, 2003, <em>granting Defendant\u2019s Motion to Reconsider the court\u2019s Previous Denial of Defendant\u2019s Criminal Rule 29 Motion for Judgment of Acquittal, </em>and specifically granting the Defendant Judgment of Acquittal of the offense of Rape and the Death Specification.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) The state did not expressly disavow an appeal of the judgment of acquittal itself. To the contrary, the state included the trial court\u2019s order \u201cgranting the Defendant Judgment of Acquittal\u201d within the. description of its appeal and contends that although an acquittal otherwise would be a \u201cfinal verdict\u201d and thus not appealable under R.C. 2945.67(A), here the acquittal order was not a final verdict at all, because the trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter it. Cf. <em>Bistricky, </em>51 Ohio St.3d 157, 555 N.E.2d 644, syllabus. The court of appeals granted the state\u2019s motion for leave to appeal, stating only: \u201cThe motion for leave to appeal is granted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>2</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">{\u00b6 22} The state argues that <em>Carlisle v. United States </em>(1996), 517 U.S. 416, 116 S.Ct. 1460, 134 L.Ed.2d 613, which construes Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(c), shows that the trial court\u2019s order granting Ross an acquittal is without jurisdiction and thus a nullity \u2014 not a true \u201cfinal verdict\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 2945.67(A).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant in <em>Carlisle </em>had filed a postverdict motion for acquittal one day after the federal rule\u2019s seven-day deadline. Id. at 418. The trial court initially denied the motion but, before sentencing, reconsidered the motion and granted it. Id. The United States Supreme Court held that the untimely filed motion for acquittal under Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(c) did not authorize the trial court to grant an acquittal. Id. at 433. But the court in <em>Carlisle </em>did not consider whether a trial court had authority to reconsider an initial denial of a <em>timely </em>filed motion for acquittal under Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(c). In this case, unlike in <em>Carlisle, </em>Ross initially filed a timely motion for acquittal under Crim.R. 29(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">{\u00b6 23} Contrary to the state\u2019s argument, the United States Supreme Court in <em>Carlisle </em>did not cast its ruling in jurisdictional terms. See <em>Kontrick v. Ryan </em>(2004), 540 U.S. 443, 454-455, 124 S.Ct. 906, 157 L.Ed.2d 867 (\u201cthis Court [in Carlisle] did not characterize [Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(c)] as \u2018jurisdictional\u2019 \u201d). <em>Carlisle </em>thus does not support the state\u2019s argument that an order reconsidering a timely filed Crim.R. 29(C) motion is a \u201cnullity\u201d and \u201cvoid and unenforceable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">{\u00b6 24} <em>Eberhart v. United States </em>(2005), 546 U.S. 12, 126 S.Ct. 403, 163 L.Ed.2d 14, sheds further light on the nature of the time limits in Crim.R. 29(C). In <em>Eberhart, </em>the court held that the time periods for motions in Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 and 33 provide \u201crigid claims-processing rules\u201d but not a jurisdictional bar. Id. at 16. In that case, the defendant submitted a supplemental memorandum in support of his pending motion for acquittal or a new trial, including several new grounds for relief. Id. at 13. Eberhart\u2019s supplemental memorandum was filed well after the federal rule\u2019s seven-day time period for such motions. Instead of opposing the supplemental memorandum on untimeliness grounds, the government in the trial court opposed the new memorandum on the merits. The trial court granted a new trial based in part on the new, untimely raised grounds in Eberhart\u2019s supplemental memorandum, but the court of appeals reversed, concluding that the government could raise the untimeliness of the new trial motion for the first time on appeal because the rule\u2019s timelines were jurisdictional.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">{\u00b6 25} The Supreme Court reversed:</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>{\u00b6 26} \u201cRule 33, like <em>Rule 29 * </em>* *, <em>is a claim-processing rule </em>\u2014 one <em>that is admittedly inflexible because of [Fed.R.Crim.P.] 45(b)\u2019s insistent demand for a definite end to proceedings. These claim-processing rules thus assure relief to a party properly raising them, </em>but do not compel the same result if the party-forfeits them. Here, where the Government failed to raise a defense of untimeliness until after the District Court had reached the merits, it forfeited the defense.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">{\u00b6 27} Thus, in <em>Eberhart, </em>the rule\u2019s strict time limitation could have prevented the trial court from considering the untimely supplemental material had the government timely objected to the fact that it had been filed out of rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">{\u00b6 28} The state also contends that <em>United States v. Gupta </em>(C.A.11, 2004), 363 F.3d 1169, shows that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to reconsider and grant Ross\u2019s renewed motion for acquittal. In <em>Gupta, </em>the trial court had initially denied a timely filed Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(c) acquittal motion, but defendants, over a year later, moved to reconsider the denial of that motion, or in the alternative, for a new trial based on information not previously available. Months later, defendants filed supplemental materials in support of their renewed motion for acquittal or a new trial, and a year after that, the trial court granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">{\u00b6 29} The court of appeals in <em>Gupta </em>reasoned that when the trial court denied the timely filed motion for acquittal, \u201cnothing remained to be done,\u201d except sentencing the defendants. Id. at 1174. The court of appeals treated the renewed motion as an untimely filed motion for acquittal or a new trial, which the appellate court concluded was beyond the trial court\u2019s authority to grant. Id. <em>Gupta </em>predated <em>Eberhart, </em>546 U.S. 12, 126 S.Ct. 403, 163 L.Ed.2d 14, which undercuts <em>Gupta\u2019s </em>characterization of Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(c)\u2019s time limitation as jurisdictional.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">{\u00b6 30} The state has not pointed to an independent reason under Ohio law to believe that Crim.R. 29(C)\u2019s time limitations impose a jurisdictional bar as distinct from a rigid claim-processing rule. We accordingly decline to characterize the 14-day time limitation in Crim.R. 29(C) for making a motion for acquittal as jurisdictional.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">{\u00b6 31} Therefore, the state\u2019s contention that the trial court\u2019s acquittal of Ross on the rape charge and related death-penalty specification is a nullity because the trial court was without subject-matter jurisdiction to enter it is incorrect. The question remains whether the state\u2019s appeal in this case was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">{\u00b6 32} As discussed above, an appeal of the judgment of acquittal itself is not authorized under R.C. 2945.67(A). <em>Yates, </em>32 Ohio St.3d 30, 512 N.E.2d 343, syllabus. Additionally, \u201csubjecting the defendant to postacquittal factfinding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>proceedings going to guilt or innocence violates the Double Jeopardy Clause,\u201d and \u201c[w]hen a successful postacquittal appeal by the prosecution would lead to proceedings that violate the Double Jeopardy Clause, the appeal itself has no proper purpose.\u201d <em>Smalis v. Pennsylvania </em>(1986), 476 U.S. 140, 145, 106 S.Ct. 1745, 90 L.Ed.2d 116; see also <em>Martin Linen Supply, </em>430 U.S. at 571, 97 S.Ct. 1349, 51 L.Ed.2d 642 (an acquittal is an order that \u201crepresents a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">{\u00b6 33} The state\u2019s appeal, which is limited pursuant to <em>Bistricky, </em>51 Ohio St.3d 157, 555 N.E.2d 644, syllabus, to the legal issue of the propriety of the trial court\u2019s reconsideration of its denial of a timely motion for acquittal under Crim.R. 29(C) when the motion is renewed after the rule\u2019s 14-day time period, is properly before us. This question is one that is capable of repetition, yet evading review. Id. at 159. The court of appeals exercised its discretion to hear and decide the state\u2019s appeal on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">{\u00b6 34} Accordingly, we will answer the question whether the trial court properly reconsidered its previous decision to deny Ross\u2019s Crim.R. 29(C) motion for acquittal based on Ross\u2019s renewed motion for acquittal submitted more than 14 days after the jury was discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">\n<em>B</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">{\u00b6 35} The court of appeals held that the trial court\u2019s September 10, 2003 order denying Ross\u2019s timely made motion for acquittal under Crim.R. 29(C) was not a final order under R.C. 2505.02, but an interlocutory order. The appellate court reasoned that as an interlocutory order, the order denying the acquittal motion could be reconsidered and granted. <em>Ross, </em>184 Ohio App.3d 174, 2009-Ohio-3561, 920 N.E.2d 162, \u00b6 12, 17, 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">{\u00b6 36} To determine whether a motion for acquittal may be renewed outside the time limitations of Crim.R. 29(C), we begin by examining the language of that rule.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>{\u00b6 37} The divisions of Crim.R. 29 set forth specific times when motions for acquittal may be made and decided. For example, Crim.R. 29(A) provides that the trial court may not reserve ruling on a motion for judgment of acquittal made at the close of the state\u2019s case. Crim.R. 29(B) provides that if a motion for acquittal is made at the close of all evidence, the court may reserve decision on the motion, submit the case to the jury and decide the motion before the jury returns a verdict, or after it returns a verdict of guilty, or after it is discharged without having returned a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">{\u00b6 38} Crim.R. 29(C) provides that if a jury returns a guilty verdict or is discharged without having returned a verdict, \u201ca motion for judgment of acquittal may be made or renewed within fourteen days after the jury is discharged or within such further time as the court may fix during the fourteen day period.\u201d Crim.R. 45(B) further specifies that notwithstanding that rule\u2019s provision allowing trial courts to grant enlargements of time in a criminal case, \u201c[t]he court may not extend the time for taking any action under Rule 23 [demand for a trial by jury], Rule 29 [motions for acquittal], Rule 33 [motions for a new trial], and Rule 34 [motions for arrest of judgment] except to the extent and under the conditions stated in them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">{\u00b6 39} While Crim.R. 29(C) does not expressly preclude reconsideration of an initial denial of a motion for acquittal, it provides a specific, limited (14-day) time frame within which to make a motion for acquittal after the jury is discharged or to renew an acquittal motion previously made during the trial. In conjunction with Crim.R. 45(B), Crim.R. 29(C) provides for enlargement of the 14-day time period specified in the rule for a posttrial motion for acquittal only when the trial court \u2014 acting within that 14-day period \u2014 grants a specific extension of that time period for making such a motion. No specific extension of time was made by the trial court in this case within the 14-day time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">{\u00b6 40} The strict time limitations in Crim.R. 29 and 45(B) convince us that the rules do not permit a defendant to renew, outside Crim.R. 29(C)\u2019s limited time frame, a motion for acquittal when the motion has been previously denied. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>court of appeals in this case concluded otherwise, holding that an original timely filed Crim.R. 29(C) motion, once denied, may be reconsidered and granted because a denial of such a motion is an interlocutory order subject to revision before final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">{\u00b6 41} The court of appeals determined that Crim.R. 57(B) permitted resort to footnote one in <em>Pitts v. Ohio Dept. of Transp. </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 378, 379, 21 O.O.3d 238, 423 N.E.2d 1105, in which we opined that Civ.R. 54(B) allows revision of civil-case interlocutory orders before final judgment. <em>Ross, </em>184 Ohio App.3d 174, 2009-Ohio-3561, 920 N.E.2d 162, \u00b6 17. Crim.R. 57(B) provides: \u201cIf no procedure is specifically prescribed by rule, the court may proceed in any lawful manner not inconsistent with these rules of criminal procedure, and shall look to the rules of civil procedure and to the applicable law if no rule of criminal procedure exists.\u201d In the court of appeals\u2019 view, Crim.R. 29 does not \u201cspecifically authorize\u201d or \u201cprohibit\u201d reconsideration of an initial denial of a Crim.R. 29(C) motion, so <em>Pitts, </em>which authorizes reconsideration of civil interlocutory orders under certain circumstances, applies. <em>Ross </em>at \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">{\u00b6 42} In <em>Pitts, </em>we held that a motion for reconsideration of a final judgment in a civil case is a nullity. A footnote in <em>Pitts </em>noted in dicta that interlocutory civil orders are subject to motions for reconsideration, based on Civ.R. 54(B), which specifies the procedure for judgments in civil cases involving multiple claims or parties. 67 Ohio St.2d at 379, 21 O.O.3d 238, 423 N.E.2d 1105, fn. 1. Civ.R. 54(B) states that absent a determination that there is no just reason for delay, \u201cany order or other form of decision [involving multiple claims or parties], however designated, which adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties, shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims or parties, and <em>the order or other form of decision is subject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">{\u00b6 43} In our view, Crim.R. 29, viewed in conjunction with Crim.R. 45(B), sufficiently specifies the procedure for motions for acquittal so that Crim.R. 57(B) does not permit resort to the Rules of Civil Procedure to fill the gap. For Crim.R. 57(B) to authorize resort to the rules of civil procedure for a particular matter in a criminal case, there must be \u201cno procedure * * * specifically prescribed by [criminal procedural] rule.\u201d See also <em>State v. Schlee, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 153, 2008-Ohio-545, 882 N.E.2d 431, \u00b6 12 (it is not necessary to look to the Civil Rules or other applicable law for guidance pursuant to Crim.R. 57(B) when a procedure \u201cspecifically prescribed by rule\u201d exists). But Crim.R. 29 provides a detailed, specific procedure governing the time that motions for acquittal must be made, and Crim.R. 45(B) does not allow any extensions of time for such motions other than those expressly set forth in Crim.R. 29. Even though Crim.R. 29(C) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>does not specifically address reconsideration of a denial of a motion for acquittal made pursuant to that division of the rule, it can hardly be said that \u201cno procedure is specifically prescribed by rule\u201d regarding the timing of Crim.R. 29(C) motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">{\u00b6 44} The court of appeals\u2019 ruling in this case also provides no endpoint for a trial court\u2019s ability to reconsider its denial of a Crim.R. 29(C) motion for acquittal. Indeed, at oral argument before this court, counsel for Ross answered \u201cyes\u201d when asked if it was his view that a trial court may reconsider its denial of an acquittal motion at any time before the sentencing in the defendant\u2019s second trial. But that result would be at odds with the inflexible time limitations found in Crim.R. 29(C) and Crim.R. 45(B)\u2019s \u201cinsistent demand for a definite end to proceedings.\u201d <em>Eberhart, </em>546 U.S. at 19, 126 S.Ct. 403, 163 L.Ed.2d 14 (construing Fed.R.Crim.P 29(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">{\u00b6 45} We thus conclude that Crim.R. 29 specifies the only time frame within which a motion for acquittal may be made and the procedure by which a trial court considers and rules upon such a motion. Accordingly, Crim.R. 57(B) does not authorize resort to the Rules of Civil Procedure to determine whether reconsideration of an order denying a motion for acquittal is permitted based on a renewed motion filed after the 14-day time period in Crim.R. 29(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">{\u00b6 46} Ross filed his supplemental memorandum in support of his renewed motion for acquittal in November 2003 \u2014 over three years after the jury had been dismissed following the mistrial, and thus well after the 14-day time frame specified in Crim.R. 29(C). The state objected to the untimeliness of the supplemental memorandum and renewed motion. The supplemental memorandum did not relate back to any pending motion for acquittal, because the trial court had denied Ross\u2019s earlier, timely filed motion in September 2003. When the trial court denied that timely filed motion, that motion was no longer pending before the trial court. Cf. <em>Gupta, </em>363 F.3d at 1174.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">{\u00b6 47} In the renewed motion, Ross urged the trial court to determine that information provided by the state after the trial (which cast doubt on the state\u2019s expert testimony at trial concerning bite marks on the victim) undercut the rape charge and the related death-penalty specification. At the November 12, 2003 hearing on the renewed motion for acquittal, defense counsel conceded that the new bite-mark evidence was not relevant to a Crim.R. 29 motion. It is unclear the extent to which Ross\u2019s argument about the new information concerning the bite-mark evidence influenced the trial court to grant the acquittal, but in reciting the evidence presented in support of the rape charge, that court noted in a footnote in the acquittal order that the \u201cstate has since conceded that the bite-mark expert testimony presented at trial was inaccurate.\u201d Regardless of wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>er the new information formed a basis for the trial court\u2019s decision, Ross\u2019s renewed motion presented that new information in a filing well outside Crim.R. 29(C)\u2019s 14-day time limitation. Ross\u2019s earlier timely Crim.R. 29(C) motion had been denied and was no longer pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">{\u00b6 48} We conclude that Ross\u2019s renewed motion for acquittal was effectively a new motion untimely filed outside the 14-day time period in Crim.R. 29(C). Because the state objected to the untimeliness of Ross\u2019s supplemental filings in the trial court, the renewed motion was not properly before the trial court and should have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">{\u00b6 49} Accordingly, the trial court in this case erred in reconsidering its initial denial of Ross\u2019s motion for acquittal under Crim.R. 29(C) based on Ross\u2019s renewed motion filed well after the rule\u2019s 14-day time limitation for motions for acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">{\u00b6 50} For the above reasons, we hold that the trial court erred in granting reconsideration of its initial denial of Ross\u2019s Crim.R. 29(C) motion for acquittal based on a renewed motion filed outside the rule\u2019s time limit. Ross\u2019s supplemental memorandum in support of his renewed motion for acquittal, filed over three years after the jury had been dismissed in his first trial, was a new motion for acquittal filed well outside the 14-days-after-jury-dismissal time limitation in Crim.R. 29(C) for such motions. The motion should have been denied for untimeliness under Crim.R. 29(C). Accordingly, the court of appeals erred to the extent that it concluded that the trial court properly reconsidered Ross\u2019s renewed motion for acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">{\u00b6 51} We have answered the substantive legal question presented in the state\u2019s proposition of law. However, pursuant to <em>Bistricky, </em>51 Ohio St.3d 157, 555 N.E.2d 644, syllabus, and <em>Yates, </em>32 Ohio St.3d 30, 512 N.E.2d 343, syllabus, we do not disturb the trial judge\u2019s acquittal order because that order \u2014 as distinct from the substantive legal rulings underlying it \u2014 is not appealable under R.C. 2945.67(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">{\u00b6 52} Because the trial court granted Ross an acquittal on only some of the charges remaining against him, we remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. See, e.g., <em>Smith v. Massachusetts </em>(2005), 543 U.S. 462, 469, 125 S.Ct. 1129, 160 L.Ed.2d 914, fn. 3 (\u201cour cases establish that jeopardy may terminate on some counts, even as it continues on others\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">Cause remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b428-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, Connor, and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b428-5\">Brown, C.J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b428-6\">Lanzinger, J., dissents and would dismiss the appeal as having been improvidently accepted.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b428-7\">John A.

In federal habeas corpus proceedings, Ross also challenged the decision to grant a mistrial, asserting that any retrial would violate his rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause. The federal district court granted habeas relief, <em>Ross v. Petro </em>(N.D.Ohio 2005), 382 F.Supp.2d 967, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed. See <em>Ross v. Petro </em>(C.A.6, 2008), 515 F.3d 653, certiorari denied, <em>Ross v. Rogers </em>(2009), \u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 906, 173 L.Ed.2d 109. The Sixth Circuit held that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, does not bar reproseeution of Ross after the mistrial. Id. at 671. The Sixth Circuit determined that the Ohio court of appeals\u2019 decision upholding the trial court\u2019s conclusion that there was a manifest necessity for the mistrial did not contravene clearly established federal law.

Any reliance by Ross on statements allegedly made by the trial court judge during an ex parte conversation between counsel for Ross and the judge on September 11, 2003, regarding the court\u2019s direction to file a motion to permit argument on the just-denied motions for acquittal and to perfect verdicts, or to the effect that the trial court characterized its September 10 ruling as inadvertent, is misplaced, because any such statements do not appear in the record as having taken place at a conference or hearing of the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b421-8\">.

Ross, </em>184 Ohio App.3d 174, 2009-Ohio-3561, 920 N.E.2d 162, \u00b6 16. The majority holds that the answer to this inquiry is \u201cno.\u201d I disagree. In my view, the court of appeals correctly recognized that the trial court\u2019s initial denial of a timely filed Crim.R. 29(C) motion (motion for acquittal after verdict or discharge of jury) was an interlocutory order and that the trial court had inherent authority to subsequently reconsider that denial and grant the motion at any time before final judgment. <em>Ross </em>at \u00b6 1. I therefore would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">{\u00b6 54} It has long been the law in Ohio that \u201ca trial court has inherent power and authority to reconsider its own interlocutory rulings.\u201d <em>Goldman v. Transp. Leasing, Inc. </em>(Feb. 19, 1981), Cuyahoga App. No. 42480, citing <em>Wayne Cty. Natl. Bank v. Predmore-Henry Motor Co. </em>(1928), 7 Ohio Law Abs. 425, 1928 WL 2686. See also <em>Olson v. Watson </em>(1936), 22 Ohio Law Abs. 118, 1936 WL 2084. \u201cWhere reconsideration of an interlocutory ruling is in the interests of justice, no rule of law, either statutory or court made, precludes a trial court from reconsidering rulings made during the course of a trial.\u201d <em>Goldman. </em>This long-established doctrine applies to both civil and criminal cases. <em>Stow v. Sexton </em>(Jan. 10, 1996), Summit App. No. 17263, 1996 WL 11985.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">{\u00b6 55} The majority\u2019s analysis focuses on \u201cwhether a renewed motion for acquittal may be made outside the time limitations of Crim.R. 29(C).\u201d But that is not the issue. A timely filed motion for acquittal had been filed in this case, and the court had authority to reconsider its initial ruling on that motion at any time before final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-12\">{\u00b6 56} The fact that the defense filed a renewed defense motion or motion for reconsideration does not change that conclusion. Surely the trial court\u2019s authority to reconsider an interlocutory order cannot be divested simply because a party submits a supplemental written filing \u2014 which the trial court arguably may in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>discretion disregard entirely as not being specifically authorized by the Civil or Criminal Rules. But neither the Civil nor the Criminal Rules bar a trial court from agreeing to consider a motion to reconsider an interlocutory ruling \u2014 to do so is within its inherent authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">{\u00b6 57} Assume, hypothetically, that defense counsel for Ross had suggested orally during a court proceeding, rather than in a written filing, that counsel continued to believe that there was insufficient evidence to prove Ross\u2019s guilt and that the earlier denial of a timely filed motion for acquittal had been wrongly decided. Under the majority\u2019s ruling, the trial court could not thereafter review its previous decision, and it would lack the authority to correct a ruling it believed to be erroneous. In fact, the majority would preclude a trial judge from changing its interlocutory ruling sua sponte to correct what it believes to be a mistake. As a trial judge, I sometimes recognized an error in a previous interlocutory ruling, and in that event, I would bring the matter to the attention of counsel and provide an appropriate correction. In my view, when a trial judge realizes it has erred, it is preferable for the judge to correct its mistake promptly rather than to continue with proceedings only to have that error corrected later by the court of appeals. The majority appears to preclude that result, depriving a trial court of appropriate discretionary authority and failing to promote judicial economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">{\u00b6 58} It is true that pursuant to Crim.R. 45(B), a trial court may not \u201cextend the time for taking any action\u201d authorized by Crim.R. 29. But Crim.R. 29(C) limits only the time for <em>filing </em>a motion, not for ruling on it: \u201c[A] motion for judgment of acquittal may be made or renewed within fourteen days after the jury is discharged or within such further time as the court may fix during the fourteen day period.\u201d Thus, Crim.R. 45\u2019s prohibition against \u201cextend[ing] the time for taking action under * * * Rule 29\u201d means only that a trial court may not enlarge the time for <em>filing </em>a motion. The trial court did no such thing in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">{\u00b6 59} In summary, Crim.R. 29 itself does not provide any time period for ruling on motions. Thus, there is no deadline for ruling that the court is prohibited from extending under Crim.R. 45(B), and trial courts have inherent authority to reconsider interlocutory orders. <em>Pitts v. Ohio Dept. of Transp. </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 378, 21 O.O.3d 238, 423 N.E.2d 1105, fn. 1.
