Bar Assn. v. Gonzalez </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 470, 733 N.E.2d 587.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-14\">{\u00b6 2} In a five count complaint, relator, Disciplinary Counsel, charged respondent with numerous disciplinary violations arising from his conduct while representing clients in four domestic relations cases and one legal malpractice case. A panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline, after having heard testimony for 22 days and having reviewed the evidence, made findings of fact and conclusions of law. As to Count I, the panel found that respondent violated DR 1-102(A)(5) (a lawyer shall not engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice) and 1-102(A)(6) (a lawyer shall not engage in conduct that adversely reflects upon his fitness to practice law) and Prof.Cond.R. 3.4(a) (a lawyer shall not unlawfully obstruct another party\u2019s access to evidence), 3.4(c) (a lawyer shall not knowingly disobey an obligation under the rules of a tribunal), 8.4(d) (a lawyer shall not engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>administration of justice), and 8.4(h) (a lawyer shall not engage in conduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">{\u00b6 3} The panel also concluded that respondent had violated DR 1-102(A)(5) and 1-102(A)(6) as alleged in Count II. The panel recommended dismissal of additional violations charged in Count I and Count II and recommended dismissal of Counts III, IV, and V in their entirety. The panel recommended that this court suspend respondent\u2019s license to practice law in Ohio for 18 months, with 12 months of the suspension stayed. The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings and recommended sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">{\u00b6 4} Both respondent and relator filed objections to the board\u2019s report. For the reasons that follow, however, we overrule those objections, accept the board\u2019s findings of fact and misconduct, but modify the recommended sanction to stay only six months of an 18-month suspension. We will detail the findings of fact as to Counts I and II only, as those are the counts related to the sanction imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">I. Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">\n<em>A. Count I: Obstructing Discovery</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">{\u00b6 5} During an 18-month divorce action between a husband and wife, respondent represented the wife. Respondent filed the divorce action on April 24, 2006, and the case was assigned to Cuyahoga County Domestic Relations Judge Timothy Flanagan. Four attorneys represented the husband throughout the course of the divorce action: Herbert Palkovitz, who represented the husband from May until early September 2006; Paul Kriwinsky, who assisted with the representation during 2006 and 2007; Eric Laubacher, whose representation lasted from early September 2006 until January 2007; and Russell Kubyn, who represented the husband from January 2007 until the divorce was final in November 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">{\u00b6 6} Respondent\u2019s compliance with discovery became an issue during the time that Kriwinsky, Laubacher, and Kubyn represented the husband. At a pretrial conference held on October 30, 2006, the court directed respondent to respond to discovery requests within 11 days. On November 17, 2006, on behalf of his client, Laubacher filed a motion to compel responses to the interrogatories and requests for production of documents. Respondent did not file a response. A judgment entry was issued granting the motion to compel and requiring respondent to provide discovery responses by December 1, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>{\u00b6 7} Laubacher testified that as of December 7, 2006, he still had not received discovery responses from respondent. On that day, Laubacher sent a letter to the judge alerting him to this fact. Respondent telephoned Laubacher upon receiving a copy of the letter and assured him that discovery responses would be forthcoming. Laubacher withdrew as counsel for the husband in January 2007 and testified that as of that date he still had not received discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">{\u00b6 8} Kubyn took over representation of the husband in January and continued to represent him until the divorce decree was entered. At a pretrial conference in March 2007, respondent gave Kubyn and Kriwinsky a number of documents. They, like Laubacher before them, complained that they had not received some of the documents requested and that the interrogatories had not been answered. Accordingly, they sent a letter to respondent on March 26, 2007. Kubyn never received a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">{\u00b6 9} The divorce trial took place during the fall of 2007. One of the contested trial issues was whether the husband was required to pay a portion of the wife\u2019s attorney fees. In an attempt to show that respondent\u2019s fee bills were exaggerated, Kubyn pressed the issue of his discovery noncompliance. Respondent\u2019s client testified that she had indeed completed interrogatory answers, and upon the judge\u2019s request, respondent searched through his file boxes and produced her original, handwritten interrogatory responses. The responses were neither complete nor verified, and contained no objections by respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">{\u00b6 10} Respondent testified during the trial with regard to the attorney fees he charged his client and was cross-examined by Kubyn. The following, consisting of a mere portion of the transcript, shows the flavor of the exchange that took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-8\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cQ: Now, do you recall when this finite period of time was when Mr. Laubacher was on the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-9\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cA: No. Perhaps, if you get a document you would have that period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-10\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cQ: You just don\u2019t recollect?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-11\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cA: I generally don\u2019t take notice of when people come and get off of cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-12\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cQ: Would he have been on the case \u2014 -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-13\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cA: I have no idea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-14\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cQ: I didn\u2019t finish my question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-15\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cA: I told you I didn\u2019t know when he was on or off the case. I know in October of \u201906, he was on the case.

There was no reason to have a duplicative attempt at discovery by Mr. Laubacher.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-13\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cQ: Help me out here, Mr. Stafford.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-14\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cA: Sorry. I\u2019m not here to help you out; I\u2019m here to answer your questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-15\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cQ: The answer will help me out. You indicated you provided discovery to Mr. Laubacher?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-16\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cA: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-17\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cQ: We just noted that a Motion to Compel Discovery was filed by Mr. Laubacher on November 17, 2006, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-18\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cA: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-19\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cQ: On November 17, 2006\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-20\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cA: That\u2019s when he filed the motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-21\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cQ: You are indicating that even though you have been forced to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-22\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cA: I\u2019m sorry? Forced? I don\u2019t think I\u2019m forced to do anything, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqy\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cQ: Even though you were compelled\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-23\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cA: Sir, I\u2019m not a party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-24\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cQ: Let me finish.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-25\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cA: You ask a proper question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-26\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cMR. STAFFORD: I\u2019m not a litigant to this case, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-27\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cTHE COURT: Are you objecting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-28\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cMR.

The board, however, recommends that we dismiss the alleged violation of Prof. Cond.R. 4.1 (in the course of representing a client, a lawyer shall not knowingly make a false statement of material fact or law to a third person), 8.4(c) (a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), and 3.3(a)(1) (a lawyer shall not knowingly make a false statement of fact or law to a tribunal).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-11\">\n<em>B. Objections to Count I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b582-12\">{\u00b6 54} Respondent objects to the board\u2019s findings of misconduct, arguing that relator failed to meet its burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that his conduct violated the Code of Professional Responsibility and the Rules of Professional Conduct. Throughout this disciplinary proceeding, respondent has maintained that the panel and the board simply disagree with his style of practice and that this disagreement is irrelevant as to whether relator established by clear and convincing evidence that he committed disciplinary violations. Relator, on the other hand, objects to the board\u2019s recommendation that we dismiss the additional violations in Count I, arguing that it had presented clear and convincing evidence to find that respondent had committed those additional violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>{\u00b6 55} We do not agree with either party. The clear-and-convincing-evidence standard is actually an intermediate standard \u2014 \u201cmore than a mere preponderance, but not to the extent of such certainty as is required beyond a reasonable doubt as in criminal cases.\u201d <em>Cross v. Ledford </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 469, 477, 53 O.O. 361, 120 N.E.2d 118. \u201cClear and convincing evidence is evidence which shows that the truth of the facts asserted is highly probable.\u201d <em>In re B.D.-Y. </em>(2008), 286 Kan. 686, 187 P.3d 594. In this case, both sides presented evidence to the panel for 22 days, and the evidence was reviewed by the full board. We defer to the board\u2019s assessment of the truth and weight of the evidence with regard to the additional violations alleged in Count I, and in accordance with the board\u2019s recommendation, we dismiss those charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">{\u00b6 56} We have repeatedly held that the practice of law is \u201ca learned profession grounded on integrity, respectability, and candor.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Claflin, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 31, 2005-Ohio-5827, 836 N.E.2d 564, \u00b6 14. It is clear that these attributes were missing from respondent\u2019s conduct: How difficult can it be to show that you sent discovery responses to opposing counsel? For more than a year, respondent confounded three attorneys in their search for discovery documents. His evasive and obstreperous conduct alone is clear and convincing evidence that he violated the rules of professional conduct. Discovery is a critical part of the litigation process, and it often takes up a majority of the time that lawyers spend in litigating a case. \u201c \u2018Our system of discovery was designed to increase the likelihood that justice will be served in each case, not to promote principles of gamesmanship and deception in which the person who hides the ball most effectively wins the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Marsick </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 551, 553, 692 N.E.2d 991, quoting <em>Abrahamsen v. Trans-State </em>Express, <em>Inc. </em>(C.A.6, 1996), 92 F.3d 425, 428-429. Respondent\u2019s lack of diligence in responding to requests for discovery is the equivalent of obstructing discovery. Therefore, as determined by the board, there is clear and convincing evidence that respondent engaged in evasive conduct that was prejudicial to the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">{\u00b6 57} Having determined that respondent\u2019s and relator\u2019s objections to the board\u2019s findings with respect to Count I are meritless, we adopt the board\u2019s findings of fact and misconduct with respect to this count.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">\n<em>C. Count II: Lack of Candor</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">{\u00b6 58} Count II relates to a legal malpractice action that respondent prosecuted on behalf of his client against his client\u2019s former attorney. The complaint alleged that the lawyer\u2019s representation had fallen below the standard of care while he was pursuing a negligence action arising out of an automobile accident. The issues surrounding this count again relate to a discovery dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>{\u00b6 59} The dispute arose in late August 2004, after the first set of interrogatories had been answered by respondent\u2019s client. In a response to a question about damages, respondent\u2019s client had stated that the damages he was seeking in the malpractice case would include \u201call costs associated with the various matters of litigation including the Probate proceedings\u201d and that \u201c[t]he associated costs of litigation have not been finalized. All final damages will be provided.\u201d At a deposition several weeks later, the opposing counsel representing the attorney posed questions to respondent\u2019s client relating to expenses and attorney fees that respondent\u2019s client had incurred. Respondent objected to the questions on the basis of privilege. The presiding judge rejected respondent\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">{\u00b6 60} Less than a month later, respondent\u2019s client was served with a second set of requests for production of documents, asking for \u201c[a]ny and all documents demonstrating and/or evidencing any and all expenses you have incurred or claim to have incurred, including, but not limited to, attorney fee bills from * * * Stafford &amp; Stafford Co., L.P.A. * * * in connection with [specified cases].\u201d Respondent maintained that the documents were not discoverable, because they were protected by attorney-client privilege. Opposing counsel for the attorney then moved to compel respondent\u2019s client to respond to discovery, stating, \u201cDefendants\u2019 Second Request for Production simply asks the Plaintiff to produce the documents that confirm the sort of expenses [the plaintiff] has already testified to\u201d and that \u201cthe Court has already ruled [are] not privileged.\u201d Respondent then filed a motion for a protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">{\u00b6 61} A month later, opposing counsel served a third set of requests for production of documents, which respondent responded to with another motion for a protective order. In an entry dated December 8, 2004, the judge granted the motion to compel and denied respondent\u2019s motions for protective order, but invited respondent\u2019s client to comply with the discovery requests by submitting the requested documents to the court for an in camera inspection. Respondent instead filed a notice of appeal to the Eighth District Court of Appeals. The court of appeals affirmed the trial court, rejecting respondent\u2019s argument that \u201call documents relating to fee agreements, billing, and/or attorney fees paid\u201d are privileged. <em>Muehrcke v. Housel, </em>8th Dist. Nos. 85643 and 85644, 2005-Ohio-5440, 2005 WL 2593551, \u00b6 1 and 17. The court of appeals also pointed out that respondent had made a \u201cblanket assertion of privilege without so much as requesting an in camera inspection.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 20. A request for discretionary review by this court was denied. 108 Ohio St.3d 1489, 2006-Ohio-962, 843 N.E.2d 795.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">{\u00b6 62} Once appeals were exhausted, opposing counsel again asked for the production of all documents previously requested, which the courts had now ordered respondent\u2019s client to produce, including the fee bills from respondent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>firm. Eventually, on May 17, 2006, respondent produced documents, but the documents produced did not include any attorney-fee bills, prompting opposing counsel to renew the attorney\u2019s motion to dismiss and for other sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">{\u00b6 63} In May 2006, respondent disclosed that no fee bills had ever been sent by his firm to his client pertaining to the malpractice action or to the underlying probate proceedings. On May 30, 2006, an associate from respondent\u2019s law firm sent a letter to the judge, attaching attorney-fee bills that had been sent to the client. One bill, dated May 30, 2006, was from respondent\u2019s firm, and all others came from other firms that had represented the client during probate proceedings. The judge turned the fee bills over to opposing counsel. Opposing counsel then sought sanctions on the ground that respondent\u2019s client had failed to disclose that no fee bills from respondent\u2019s firm had existed, notwithstanding the privilege claims. The trial court never ruled on that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">{\u00b6 64} The jury in the attorney-malpractice case returned a verdict in favor of respondent\u2019s client. The court of appeals vacated the judgment but refused to reverse the trial court\u2019s implicit decision not to sanction respondent\u2019s client for frivolous conduct with respect to the fee bills claimed to be privileged. <em>Muehrcke v. Housel, </em>181 Ohio App.3d 361, 2008-Ohio-4445, 909 N.E.2d 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">{\u00b6 65} The board found that respondent had made misrepresentations during the discovery process, specifically in the way he described the documents his firm was refusing to produce on privilege grounds. This misleading conduct caused opposing counsel to reasonably believe that respondent\u2019s firm had actually sent fee bills to its client in the pertinent matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">{\u00b6 66} Upon review of this matter, the board determined that respondent \u201cdid not fulfill his duty of candor toward the trial court or the court of appeals.\u201d The board stated that even though respondent knew \u201cfull well that [Stafford &amp; Stafford] had never sent written fee bills to [the client] for work done on the malpractice action, Stafford <em>&amp; </em>Stafford nevertheless implied in court filings that they had in fact sent such bills to [the client].\u201d As a result, the board found that respondent\u2019s lack of candor warranted a finding that he had violated DR 1-102(A)(5) and 1-102(A)(6). The board based these findings on respondent\u2019s failure to candidly dispel misimpressions created by his firm\u2019s misleading court filings.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">\n<em>D. Objections to Count II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">{\u00b6 67} Relator objects to the board\u2019s findings that the additional violations charged under this count against respondent were not proved by clear and convincing evidence, an argument we reject. Respondent objects to the board\u2019s findings, advancing similar arguments to those he asserted for Count I. He argues primarily that he had a good-faith basis for raising arguments of privilege, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>because those privilege arguments were part of a legal strategy that was bolstered by at least some viable support. Respondent\u2019s other objections are centered on what he perceives as the lack of clear and convincing evidence to support the misconduct findings. Respondent\u2019s arguments are without merit for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">{\u00b6 68} First, the record belies respondent\u2019s good-faith argument. As determined by the panel and board: \u201c[T]he common thread running through [respondent\u2019s] violations is respondent\u2019s palpable indifference to discovery directed at his clients. In each instance, had respondent been even slightly more forthcoming in responding to the discovery * * * he could have spared the courts, his opposing counsel and their clients, and his own clients needless controversy, time, and expense.\u201d Second, because the panel was in the best position to assess the credibility of the witness testimony and rejected respondent\u2019s testimony that he did not intentionally mislead opposing counsel, we defer to that determination. See <em>Cuyahoga Cty. Bar Assn. v. Wise, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 164, 2006-Ohio-550, 842 N.E.2d 35, \u00b6 24 (\u201cUnless the record weighs heavily against a hearing panel\u2019s findings, we defer to the panel\u2019s credibility determinations, inasmuch as the panel members saw and heard the witnesses firsthand\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">{\u00b6 69} After reviewing the record, we overrule both parties\u2019 objections, and instead accept the board\u2019s assessment of the evidence and its findings of fact and conclusions of law on this count. Courts cannot function properly unless the lawyers practicing before them observe their duties of candor. See <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Rohrer, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 65, 2009-Ohio-5930, 919 N.E.2d 180; <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Nienaber </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 534, 687 N.E.2d 678. In this circumstance, respondent did not fulfill his duty of candor toward the trial court or the court of appeals. He could have done so easily, with no prejudice to his client, and could have spared the courts and his own client almost two years of costly litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">II. Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">{\u00b6 70} When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we consider relevant factors, including the ethical duties that the lawyer violated and the sanctions imposed in similar cases. <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 16. In making a final determination, we also weigh evidence of the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in Section 10(B) of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d). <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Broeren, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 473, 2007-Ohio-5251, 875 N.E.2d 935, \u00b6 21. Because each disciplinary case is unique, we are not limited to the factors specified in the rule but may take into account \u201call relevant factors\u201d in determining what sanction to impose. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>\n<em>A. Aggravating and Mitigating Factors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">{\u00b6 71} The board found a number of aggravating factors weighing in favor of a more severe sanction. First, the board found that respondent had committed multiple offenses that were part of a pattern of delaying the discovery process. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(c) and (d). The board further found that this disregard of discovery was done to gain a tactical advantage, which suggests a selfish motive, another aggravating factor. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">{\u00b6 72} The board also found that respondent had been disciplined previously, also an aggravating factor. BCDG Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(a). Respondent received a public reprimand for calling another lawyer an obscene name while the attorneys were in a magistrate\u2019s chambers and then continuing to yell at the other attorney after entering the courtroom (a violation of DR 7-106(C)(6): in appearing in a professional capacity, a lawyer shall not engage in undignified or discourteous conduct that is degrading to a tribunal). <em>Cuyahoga Cty. Bar Assn. v. Gonzalez, </em>89 Ohio St.3d 470, 733 N.E.2d 587. In reviewing respondent\u2019s previous offense, the board found commonality between that offense and the instant violations, which is another aggravating factor to justify enhancement of the sanction. The board noted that his conduct since his public reprimand shows that he remains \u201cinsufficiently mindful and respectful of his distinct role as an officer of the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">{\u00b6 73} As a final aggravating factor, the board found that respondent periodically displayed disrespect for assistant disciplinary counsel throughout the course of the 22-day hearing. It stated that respondent\u2019s conduct evinced an unwarranted disrespect for a fellow officer of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">{\u00b6 74} In evaluating whether there were mitigating factors weighing in favor of a less severe sanction, the board noted that respondent did not formally present evidence of mitigating factors, nor did relator. Instead, the panel observed that over the course of over 22 days of hearings, under intense pressure, respondent behaved \u201cappropriately.\u201d The board, however, found it impossible to credit respondent with a cooperative attitude toward the proceeding because of the personal criticisms of assistant disciplinary counsel noted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">\n<em>B. Choice of Sanction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">{\u00b6 75} In considering its sanction, the board pointed to three disciplinary cases that involved attorneys whose responses to discovery directed at their clients showed indifference or a lack of candor, as opposed to neglect. In <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Wallace </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 496, 700 N.E.2d 1238, the attorney received a public reprimand for engaging in conduct that adversely reflected on her fitness to practice law. At her client\u2019s request, to thwart any effort by his ex-wife to collect past-due child support by placing a lien on his home, the attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>had prepared a quitclaim deed on the property to his wife. Before the deed was executed, the attorney received interrogatories asking for the address of any real property owned by her client and gave them to her client on the same day that he signed the quitclaim deed. The client returned the interrogatories to his attorney several weeks after the deed was recorded. Upon noticing that the question regarding real property had been left blank, the attorney was told by her client to write \u201cnone\u201d as a response, which she did. The interrogatories were returned to opposing counsel unsigned. We held that the attorney had committed misconduct for not disclosing what she knew to opposing counsel. Id. at 500. We also agreed with the panel\u2019s finding that her conduct had not obstructed the discovery process, because the answer was technically true at the time it was made. Id. at 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">{\u00b6 76} In <em>Marsick, </em>81 Ohio St.3d 551, 692 N.E.2d 991, the attorney represented a truck driver who had hit a parked car, killing a passenger and injuring its driver. The attorney repeatedly failed to reveal in discovery responses a tow-truck driver\u2019s statement that the truck driver admitted at the scene that he had dozed off while he was driving. The attorney had maintained his silence even when the truck driver testified at his deposition and at trial that he had swerved to avoid a deer. The jury found the truck driver less than 100 percent responsible, and the judgment was affirmed on appeal. After the attorney revealed the truth during subsequent proceedings on a contribution claim, the judgment was vacated. That attorney, who had no prior disciplinary history, received a six-month actual suspension for this violation. Id. at 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">{\u00b6 77} In <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Finneran </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 428, 687 N.E.2d 405, the attorney flouted his discovery obligations for purposes of delaying the proceedings in multiple cases, even going so far as to dismiss and refile those cases. We stated that the attorney\u2019s \u201ctactics of evasion and delay\u201d reflected \u201ca strategy out of keeping with the purpose and intent of our system of orderly procedures.\u201d Id. at 431. \u201cDilatory practices bring the administration of justice into disrepute.\u201d Id. For this conduct, as well as his lack of cooperation in the disciplinary process, that attorney was suspended indefinitely.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">(\u00b6 78} Relying upon these cases, and noting that respondent\u2019s conduct occurred over several years and involved more than one case, relator asks this court to impose an 18-month actual suspension from the practice of law. Respondent, citing case law, asks the court to sustain his objections and dismiss relator\u2019s complaint in its entirety, with costs taxed to relator.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">(\u00b6 79} The board has adopted the recommendation of the panel and recommends that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for 18 months, with 12 months of the suspension stayed on conditions. Respondent challenges this recommendation as being contrary to the purpose of attorney-discipline proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>ings. He also challenges the use of his prior disciplinary history as an aggravating factor, and he argues that the recommended sanction is punitive and contrary to law. Having carefully considered each of these arguments, we conclude that the board\u2019s findings are amply supported by the record. Accordingly, we overrule respondent\u2019s objections and accept the findings of the panel and board with regard to the aggravating and mitigating factors present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">{\u00b6 80} Respondent also objects to the board\u2019s reliance upon <em>Wallace, Marsick, </em>and <em>Finneran </em>and suggests that his conduct is more akin to that of the attorneys in other cases: <em>Toledo Bar Assn. v. Rust, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 305, 2010-Ohio-170, 921 N.E.2d 1056 (count was dismissed because the attorney initiated an action in good faith and had an \u201carguable basis in law and fact that was not frivolous for filing the claim,\u201d id. at \u00b6 2); <em>Findlay/Hancock Cty. Bar Assn. v. Filkins </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 1, 734 N.E.2d 764 (misconduct was not established by clear and convincing evidence, despite the board\u2019s findings).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">{\u00b6 81} The cases cited by respondent, however, addressed single incidents of misconduct that this court held had not been proved. In contrast, we find that respondent engaged in multiple incidents of misconduct that occurred in two cases spanning several years. Respondent has obstructed and delayed discovery as well as displayed a marked lack of candor. His evident contempt for the discovery process and his lack of respect for other officers of the court demonstrate a profound disrespect for the legal profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">{\u00b6 82} Based upon the foregoing, we agree with the board that \u201crespondent\u2019s obstructive behavior and lack of candor * * * were just as disruptive to the administration of justice as outright misrepresentations would have been\u201d and that \u201chis conduct warrants a sanction tantamount to that mandated for misrepresentations, actual suspension.\u201d We disagree, however, with the length of the actual suspension. Although respondent\u2019s conduct is worse than the conduct that warranted a public reprimand in the <em>Wallace </em>case, it does not rise to the level of warranting an indefinite suspension, as did the conduct in <em>Finneran. </em>We find that an 18-month suspension with six months stayed is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">{\u00b6 83} We emphasize that respondent is not subjected to sanction here because he is a zealous advocate on behalf of clients in the Cuyahoga County Domestic Relations Division of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas. It is that his lack of candor, his disrespect and discourtesy to fellow officers of the court, and his dilatory discovery tactics are unprofessional and interfere with the orderly administration of justice. As we said in <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Trumbo </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 369, 373, 667 N.E.2d 1186, \u201crespect for the law and our legal system is the <em>sine qua non </em>of [the] right to continuance on the rolls\u201d of those admitted to practice law in Ohio.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AgK\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Jonathan E. Coughlan, Disciplinary Counsel, and Lori J. Brown, Chief Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"avd-dedup-1\">Reminger Co., L.P.A., George S. Coakley, and John P. O\u2019Neil, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">{\u00b6 84} Upon our independent review of the evidence, we hold that the appropriate sanction for respondent\u2019s misconduct is suspension from the practice of law for 18 months, with six months of the suspension stayed. We do not agree with the board\u2019s recommendation for monitoring during the suspension period, but if respondent engages in further misconduct during the stayed portion of his suspension, the stay will be lifted, and respondent will serve the entire 18 months as an actual suspension. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b590-6\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b579-10\">. On February 1, 2007, the Rules of Professional Conduct became effective, replacing the Code of Professional Responsibility in Ohio. Respondent\u2019s conduct before February 1, 2007, is governed by the Code of Professional Responsibility, and conduct after that date is governed by the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b582-13\">.
