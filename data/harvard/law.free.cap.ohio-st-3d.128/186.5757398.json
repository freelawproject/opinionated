Because we decline to allow the intent to harm to be inferred as a matter of law in cases in which the harm suffered cannot be deemed an inherent result of the intentional act, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals in part and remand to the trial court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-13\">I. Case Background</p>\n<p id=\"b319-14\">{\u00b6 2} On the evening of November 18, 2005, a group of teenage boys, including Dailyn Campbell, Jesse Howard, and Corey Manns, stole a lightweight Styrofoam target deer typically used for shooting or archery. The boys fastened a piece of wood to the target so that it could stand upright. Along with Carson Barnes, they then placed it just below the crest of a hill in Hardin County on County Road 144, a hilly and curvy two-lane road with a speed limit of 55 miles per hour. They put the target on the road after dark \u2014 between 9:00 and 9:30 p.m. \u2014 in a place in which drivers would be unable to see it until they were 15 to 30 yards away. The boys then remained in the area so that they could watch the reactions of motorists. About five minutes after the boys placed the target in the road, appellee Robert Roby drove over the hill. Roby took evasive action, but ultimately lost control of his vehicle, which left the road, overturned, and came to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>rest in a nearby field. This accident caused serious injuries to both Roby and his passenger, appellee Dustin Zachariah.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">{\u00b6 3} Roby and Zachariah<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed suits in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas against the boys, their parents, and their insurance companies, among others, seeking recovery for the damages sustained in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">{\u00b6 4} Appellants Allstate Insurance Company (\u201cAllstate\u201d), American Southern Insurance Company (\u201cAmerican Southern\u201d), Erie Insurance Exchange (\u201cErie\u201d), and Grange Mutual Casualty Company (\u201cGrange\u201d) filed declaratory judgment actions in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas seeking a declaration that they are under no duty to defend or indemnify their insureds, the juveniles and their parents, in the Roby and Zachariah lawsuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">{\u00b6 5} After consolidating the declaratory judgment actions, the trial court granted the insurance companies\u2019 motions for summary judgment. Although the court did not find that the boys directly intended to cause harm, it inferred their intent as a matter of law, based in part on the finding that their conduct was substantially certain to result in harm. The trial court thus concluded that none of the pertinent insurance policies provided coverage and that none of the insurers had a duty to defend or indemnify its insureds in the pending bodily injury actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">{\u00b6 6} The Tenth District Court of Appeals reversed, holding that genuine issues of material fact exist over whether the boys intended to cause harm when they placed the deer target in the road, whether harm was substantially certain to result from their actions, and whether those actions fall within the scope of their individual insurance policies. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Campbell, </em>Franklin App. Nos. 09AP-306, 09AP-307, 09AP-308, 09AP-309, 09AP-318, 09AP-319, 09AP-320, and 09AP-321, 2009-Ohio-6055, 2009 WL 3823362, \u00b6 53. The court of appeals expressed uncertainty regarding the strength of inferred intent in Ohio but noted that appellate courts have expanded the doctrine beyond the crimes of murder and molestation. Id. at \u00b6 39. The Tenth District Court of Appeals stated that there was no dispute that the boys had acted intentionally; the disputed issue was whether they had intended harm or injury to follow their intentional act. Id. at \u00b6 50. The court concluded that because questions of fact remained over the certainty of harm resulting from the boys\u2019 actions, their conduct did not support an objective inference of an intent to injure as a matter of law. Id. at \u00b6 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">{\u00b6 7} We granted discretionary jurisdiction over the second proposition of law of each insurer, as well as the third proposition of law of Allstate and Grange.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number><em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Campbell, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 1506, 2010-Ohio-799, 922 N.E.2d 969. The insurers\u2019 second proposition of law states that the doctrine of inferred intent as applied to an intentional-act exclusion in an insurance policy is not limited to cases of sexual molestation or homicide but may be applied where undisputed facts establish that harm was substantially certain to occur as a result of the insured\u2019s conduct. Allstate and Grange\u2019s third proposition of law states that their policies\u2019 exclusionary language denotes an objective as opposed to a subjective standard of coverage, rendering an insured\u2019s subjective intent irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">II. Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">\n<em>A. The Language of the Insurance Agreements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cIt is axiomatic that an insurance company is under no obligation to its insured, or to others harmed by the actions of an insured, unless the conduct alleged of the insured falls within the coverage of the policy.\u201d <em>Gearing v. Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 34, 36, 665 N.E.2d 1115. \u201cCoverage is provided if the conduct falls within the scope of coverage defined in the policy, and not within an exception thereto.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">{\u00b6 9} Homeowners\u2019 insurance policies typically provide coverage for harm accidentally caused by their insureds; intentional torts are excluded. Most policies contain an intentional-act exclusion, which states that the insurance company will not be liable for harm intentionally caused by the insured. But when there is no evidence of direct intent to cause harm and the insured denies the intent to cause any harm, the insured\u2019s intent to cause harm will be inferred as a matter of law in certain instances. <em>Gearing, </em>76 Ohio St.3d 34, 665 N.E.2d 1115, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">{\u00b6 10} Although the central question is whether intent to harm should be inferred as a matter of law under the circumstances of this case, insurance coverage is finally determined by the policy language. As a preliminary matter, we recognize that each policy issued by the four insurers contains similar language defining an \u201coccurrence\u201d as an accident and providing coverage for bodily injury arising from an occurrence. Each insurer, however, uses unique exclusionary language.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>1.

American Southern\u2019s exclusionary language for intentional act</p>\n<p id=\"AkG\">{\u00b6 17} American Southern also issued a policy to one of Dailyn Campbell\u2019s parents.

Acceptance of the Doctrine of Inferred Intent</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">{\u00b6 32} The appellant insurers argue that we should expand the rule of inferred intent so that it applies to the circumstances in this case. They suggest that we apply the \u201csubstantially certain\u201d test so that intent to harm will be inferred as a matter of law whenever an insured\u2019s act is substantially certain to cause harm. The appellees argue that application of inferred intent should remain limited and that instead of using the \u201csubstantially certain\u201d test in this case, the trial court should resolve the disputed matter of the boys\u2019 intent like any other issue of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">{\u00b6 33} Before we discuss whether the rule of inferred intent should be extended to all torts where there is a substantial certainty of harm or limit its application, we must explore the line of cases that have accepted the doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-13\">{\u00b6 34} We have already recognized that the rule of inferred intent applies in two specific instances: sexual molestation of a minor and murder. See <em>Gearing, </em>76 Ohio St.3d at 36-38, 665 N.E.2d 1115; <em>Preferred Risk Ins. Co. v. Gill </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 108, 114-115, 30 OBR 424, 507 N.E.2d 1118. Appellants ask us to extend the doctrine to apply in cases like the one currently before us, specifically relying upon the analysis set forth in Justice Cook\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Buckeye Union Ins. Co. v. New England Ins. Co. </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 280, 288-289, 720 N.E.2d 495. In her concurrence, Justice Cook argued that where direct intent does not exist, the insured\u2019s subjective intent is not conclusive on the coverage issue, and courts should instead infer an intent to harm where the insured\u2019s action creates a substantial certainty of harm. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-14\">{\u00b6 35} We acknowledge that the lack of a majority opinion in <em>Buckeye Union </em>has generated uncertainty as to the scope of the doctrine of inferred intent. On one hand, the appellees argue that Justice Pfeifer\u2019s plurality opinion in <em>Buckeye Union </em>\u2014 which limits the doctrine to acts that are \u201cintentionally injurious by definition,\u201d id. at 284, represents the correct view of the doctrine in Ohio. On the other hand, the appellants argue that inferred intent should be applied in a wider variety of cases, as the <em>Buckeye Union </em>concurring opinion suggests. Recogniz<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>ing the need for clarity in this area of the law, we first review our decisions relevant to the doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">1. <em>Preferred Risk Ins. Co. v. Gill</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">{\u00b6 36} The roots of the doctrine of inferred intent in Ohio can be traced back to <em>Gill, </em>30 Ohio St.3d 108, 30 OBR 424, 507 N.E.2d 1118. In <em>Gill, </em>we considered whether an insurance company had a duty to defend or indemnify against claims of wrongful death and negligent infliction of emotional distress an insured who had been convicted of aggravated murder of a child. The insurance policy included language excluding coverage for \u201cbodily injury or property damage \u2018which is expected or intended by the insured.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 113. We held that the insurance company had no duty to defend or indemnify in the underlying wrongful-death claim because the insured\u2019s act \u201cwas indisputably intentional and outside coverage.\u201d Id. at 115. We also concluded that the insurance company had no duty to defend or indemnify in the underlying claim for emotional distress, noting that the behavior of the insured leading to the emotional distress \u201chad its origin in a clearly intentional course of conduct <em>(i.e., </em>the murder) and is so inextricably entwined in time and purpose with the intentional acts leading to the murder, and the murder itself, that it cannot fairly be said to be within coverage.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">2. <em>Physicians Ins. Co. of Ohio v. Swanson</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">{\u00b6 37} We revisited <em>Gill </em>in <em>Physicians Ins. Co. of Ohio v. Swanson </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 189, 569 N.E.2d 906. <em>Swanson </em>considered whether the insurance companies had an obligation to defend and indemnify its insureds, whose son had fired a BB gun towards some teenagers from approximately 70 to 100 feet. The Swansons\u2019 insurance policy said that it \u201cwill not cover Personal Injury or Property Damage caused intentionally.\u201d Id. at 191. In explaining our decision in <em>Gill, </em>we noted, <em>\u201cGill </em>actually stands for the proposition that it is the resultant <em>injury </em>which must be intended for the exclusion to apply to deny coverage.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">{\u00b6 38} In reversing the holding of the court of appeals that the insurers were not obligated to defend and indemnify its insureds, we held, \u201cIn order to avoid coverage on the basis of an exclusion for expected or intentional injuries, the insurer must demonstrate that the injury itself was expected or intended.\u201d Id. at syllabus. This holding was based upon two rationales. First, we determined that the plain language of the policy was in terms of an intentional or expected injury, not an intentional or expected act. Id. at 193. Second, we recognized that many unintended injuries result from intentional acts. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>3. <em>Gearing v. Nationwide Ins. Co.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">{\u00b6 39} While <em>Gill </em>and <em>Swanson </em>can be read as implicitly adopting a form of inferred intent, we first explicitly recognized the doctrine in <em>Gearing, </em>76 Ohio St.3d 34, 665 N.E.2d 1115, paragraph one of the syllabus. <em>Gearing </em>involved a declaratory judgment action in which an insured sought a declaration that the insurance company was obligated to defend him in a civil suit arising from his alleged sexual molestation of three girls. Id. at 34-35. We affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals, holding that the insurance company owed no duty to defend the insured. Id. at 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">{\u00b6 40} In <em>Gearing, </em>the insurance policy had provided an exclusion for bodily injury or property damage that is \u201cexpected or intended by the insured.\u201d Id. at 36. We examined cases from other states in which the doctrine of inferred intent was applied to cases arising from acts of sexual molestation, concluding that \u201cin those cases where an intentional act is substantially certain to cause injury, determination of an insured\u2019s subjective intent, or lack of subjective intent, is not conclusive of the issue of coverage.\u201d Id. at 39. Thus, \u201can insured\u2019s protestations that he \u2018didn\u2019t mean to hurt anyone\u2019 are only relevant where the intentional act at issue is not substantially certain to result in injury.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">{\u00b6 41} We noted that this conclusion is central to <em>Swanson, </em>where we stated, \u201c \u2018 \u201c[Resulting injury which ensues from the volitional act of an insured is still an \u2018accident\u2019 within the meaning of an insurance policy if the insured does not specifically intend to cause the resulting harm <em>or is not substantially certain that such harm will occur.\u201d </em>\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added in <em>Gearing.) </em>Id. at 39-40, quoting <em>Swanson, </em>58 Ohio St.3d at 193, 569 N.E.2d 906, quoting <em>Quincy Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Abernathy </em>(1984), 393 Mass. 81, 84, 469 N.E.2d 797.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">{\u00b6 42} After determining that the arguments in support of inferred intent were persuasive and that the rule was consistent with earlier decisions, we adopted it: \u201cWe accept the premises upon which the inferred intent rule is based, and hold that intent to harm is properly inferred as a matter of law from deliberate acts of sexual molestation of a minor.\u201d <em>Gearing, </em>76 Ohio St.3d at 37, 665 N.E.2d 1115. In applying this holding, we concluded, \u201cIncidents of intentional acts of sexual molestation of a minor do not constitute \u2018occurrences\u2019 for purposes of determining liability insurance coverage, as intent to harm inconsistent with an insurable incident is properly inferred as a matter of law from deliberate acts of sexual molestation of a minor.\u201d Id. at paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">{\u00b6 43} Our decision in <em>Gearing </em>nevertheless left certain issues unresolved. In adopting the doctrine of inferred intent only in the context of sexual-molestation cases, we did not address the question of whether intent may be inferred in cases involving acts other than sexual molestation or murder. Furthermore, as a result of this limited adoption of the rule, we did not enunciate a clear standard for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>courts to apply in determining whether a certain act gives rise to an inference of intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">4. <em>Buckeye Union Ins. Co. v. New England Ins. Co.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">{\u00b6 44} The application of the doctrine of inferred intent to cases beyond those involving murder and sexual molestation first arose in <em>Buckeye Union Ins. Co., 87 </em>Ohio St.3d at 288-289, 720 N.E.2d 495 (Cook, J. concurring). A federal district court had ruled in an underlying case that Buckeye Union Insurance Company had acted in bad faith and with intent to injure in refusing to settle an insurance claim and that this intentional act precluded New England Insurance Company from reimbursing its insured, Buckeye Union, under a professional liability policy. Id. at 281-282. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals certified three questions to this court, the first of which asked whether Buckeye Union\u2019s actions in the underlying case constituted the type of intentional tort that is uninsurable under Ohio law. Id. at 282. We answered that question \u201cno.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">{\u00b6 45} In a plurality opinion, Justice Pfeifer made a distinction. He noted that in both <em>Gill </em>and <em>Gearing, </em>\u201cinsureds were found to have committed wrongful acts, acts that are intentionally injurious by definition.\u201d Id. at 284. Buckeye Union\u2019s act of refusing to settle an insurance claim was not such an intentionally injurious act, Justice Pfeifer explained, because in certain circumstances, insurers may properly refuse to settle claims. Id. He accordingly concluded that it would be improper to extend the doctrine of inferred intent to torts that were based upon a bad-faith refusal to settle an insurance claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">{\u00b6 46} Disagreeing with Justice Pfeifer\u2019s reasoning, Justice Cook argued that <em>Gearing, </em>76 Ohio St.3d 34, 665 N.E.2d 1115, provided an effective means for analyzing coverage issues regarding a wide variety of intentional torts. Id. at 289-290 (Cook, J., concurring). Justice Cook criticized limiting \u201cacts that are intentionally injurious by definition\u201d to murder and sexual molestation, arguing that this categorization does not clarify what other types of actions might reveal intent. Id. at 289-290. She concluded that the proper test would be the objective \u201csubstantial certainty\u201d test set forth in <em>Gearing. </em>Id. at 290-291. A close examination of <em>Gearing, </em>however, reveals that this court has limited the scope of inferred intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">\n<em>C. Application of the Doctrine of Inferred Intent</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AMB\">{\u00b6 47} In <em>Gearing, </em>we noted that the rule of inferred intent \u201cis based on the premise that acts of sexual molestation and the fact of injury caused thereby are \u2018virtually inseparable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gearing, </em>76 Ohio St.3d at 37, 665 N.E.2d 1115, quoting <em>Worcester Ins. Co. v. Fells Acres Day School, Inc. </em>(1990), 408 Mass. 393, 400, 558 N.E.2d 958. In other words, in a ease of sexual molestation, \u201c \u2018to do the act is necessarily to do the harm which is its consequence; and * * * since unquestion<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>ably the act is intended, so also is the harm.\u2019 \u201d (Ellipsis sic.) Id., quoting <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Mugavero </em>(1992), 79 N.Y.2d 153, 160, 581 N.Y.S.2d 142, 589 N.E.2d 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">{\u00b6 48} It is clear that as applied to an insurance policy\u2019s intentional-act exclusion, the doctrine of inferred intent applies only in cases in which the insured\u2019s intentional act and the harm caused are intrinsically tied so that the act has necessarily resulted in the harm. Limiting the scope of the doctrine is appropriate because the rule is needed only in a narrow range of cases \u2014 those in which the insured\u2019s testimony on harmful intent is irrelevant because the intentional act could not have been done without causing harm. Thus, an insured\u2019s intent to cause injury or damage may be inferred only when that harm is intrinsically tied to the act of the insured \u2014 i.e., the action necessitates the harm. The doctrine of inferred intent does not apply only to cases arising from acts of murder or sexual molestation. For example, intent could hypothetically be inferred in certain felonious-assault or rape cases, where the intentional acts necessarily cause harm; however, courts should be careful to avoid applying the doctrine in cases where the insured\u2019s intentional act will not necessarily result in the harm caused by that act.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">{\u00b6 49} <em>Gill </em>and <em>Gearing </em>provide clear examples of cases in which the doctrine applies. In <em>Gill, </em>harm was inherent in the defendant\u2019s act of murder. Harm was similarly inherent in the acts of sexual molestation in <em>Gearing. </em>In each of these cases, the insured could not claim that he was unaware that harm would result from his actions. The doctrine of inferred intent thus applied in those cases, and the insureds\u2019 actions were excluded from coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">{\u00b6 50} The same cannot be said about the actions in <em>Swanson </em>and <em>Buckeye Union. </em>In <em>Swanson, </em>the act of firing a BB gun from a relatively long distance would not necessarily result in harm. Likewise, an insurance company\u2019s bad-faith refusal to settle a claim, as in <em>Buckeye Union, </em>does not necessarily result in compensable damages. In both cases, a factual inquiry was necessary to determine whether the insureds\u2019 actions were excluded from coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">{\u00b6 51} The present case is similar to <em>Swanson </em>and <em>Buckeye Union. </em>We cannot say as a matter of law that the act of placing a target deer in a road in the manner done here necessarily results in harm. Indeed, other cars had passed by and avoided the target. While the boys\u2019 act was ill-conceived and irresponsible and resulted in serious injuries, the action and the harm are not intrinsically tied the way they are in murder and sexual molestation. We accordingly conclude that while the doctrine of inferred intent may apply to actions other than murder or sexual molestation, it does not apply in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">\n<em>D. The \u201cSubstantially Certain\u201d Test</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">{\u00b6 52} Appellants have asked us to use the \u201csubstantially certain\u201d test \u2014 which Justice Cook advocated in <em>Buckeye Union </em>and which was discussed in <em>Swanson </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>and <em>Gearing </em>\u2014 when deciding whether the intentional-act exclusion applies to cases other than murder or sexual assault. Before adopting the rule of inferred intent for Ohio, we had quoted from the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, which characterizes an act that is not expected or intended by the insured: \u201c \u2018the resulting injury which ensues from the volitional act of an insured is still an \u201caccident\u201d within the meaning of an insurance policy if the insured does not specifically intend to cause the resulting harm or is not substantially certain that such harm will occur.\u2019 \u201d <em>Swanson, </em>58 Ohio St.3d at 193, 569 N.E.2d 906, quoting <em>Quincy, </em>393 Mass, at 84, 469 N.E.2d 797. In <em>Swanson, </em>we held that the insurer must demonstrate that \u201cthe injury itself was expected or intended.\u201d Id. at 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">{\u00b6 53} We also quoted Swanson\u2019s \u201csubstantially certain\u201d language when explaining how adoption of the doctrine of inferred intent was consistent with precedent. <em>Gearing, </em>76 Ohio St.3d at 39-40, 665 N.E.2d 1115. \u201c[I]n those cases where an intentional act is substantially certain to cause injury, determination of an insured\u2019s subjective intent, or lack of subjective intent, is not conclusive of the issue of coverage. Rather, an insured\u2019s protestations that he \u2018didn\u2019t mean to hurt anyone\u2019 are only relevant where the intentional act at issue is not substantially certain to result in injury.\u201d Id. at 39. Significantly, nowhere does <em>Gearing </em>state that the \u201csubstantially certain\u201d test should be used to determine whether to infer intent as a matter of law in considering other intentional torts.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">{\u00b6 54} Justice Cook argued that <em>Gearing </em>outlined a two-part analysis. <em>Buckeye Union, </em>87 Ohio St.3d at 289, 720 N.E.2d 495 (Cook, J., concurring). First is a determination whether the insured directly intended the injury. Id. at 288. If no direct intention exists, then the court determines whether the insured\u2019s act was substantially certain to cause injury. Id. That approach is flawed, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">{\u00b6 55} Instead of outlining a two-part analysis, <em>Gearing </em>treats the \u201csubstantially certain\u201d test as being subsumed within the newly adopted rule of inferred intent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Gearing </em>never addressed whether the insured\u2019s action was substantially certain to result in harm. Instead, it concluded that <em>\u201cintent to kai\"m </em>inconsistent with an insurable incident <em>is properly inferred </em>as a matter of law from deliberate acts of sexual molestation of a minor.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Gearing, </em>76 Ohio St.3d at 40, 665 N.E.2d 1115.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">{\u00b6 56} We now clarify that the doctrine of inferred intent applies only in cases in which the insured\u2019s intentional act and the harm caused are intrinsically tied so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>that the act has necessarily resulted in the harm. Because this test provides a clearer method for determining when intent to harm should be inferred as a matter of law, we hold that courts are to examine whether the act has necessarily resulted in the harm \u2014 rather than whether the act is substantially certain to result in harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">\n<em>E. Objective or Subjective Nature of Inferred Intent</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AY6\">{\u00b6 57} In their second propositions of law, Allstate and Grange argue that the exclusionary language used in their policies requires an objective test for whether they must provide coverage. Because we determine that under the circumstances of this case, intent to harm may not be inferred as a matter of law, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals on this point and conclude that the trial court must conduct a factual inquiry on remand to determine whether a duty to defend and indemnify arises from the Allstate, Grange, and Erie policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">{\u00b6 58} The Allstate, Grange, and Erie polices each contain exclusionary language stating that the insurers will not cover harm expected or intended by an insured.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because we do not infer the insureds\u2019 intent to harm as a matter of law and the boys deny that harm was intended or expected, whether the injury was expected or reasonably expected is an issue to be determined by the trier of fact. See <em>Swanson, 58 </em>Ohio St.3d at 193-194, 569 N.E.2d 906.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">{\u00b6 59} An insurer\u2019s motion for summary judgment may be properly granted when intent may be inferred as a matter of law. In cases such as this one, where the insured\u2019s act does not necessarily result in harm, we cannot infer an intent to cause injury as a matter of law. We therefore hold that summary judgment is not proper. In a declaratory action like this, the trier of fact on remand must weigh the facts in evidence to determine whether the boys intended or expected harm and, consequently, whether the insurance agreements provide coverage in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">\n<em>F. American Southern Policy\u2019s Exclusionary Language</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AP6\">{\u00b6 60} The policy issued by American Southern contains exclusionary language that differs from that found in the Allstate, Erie, and Grange policies, as well as the policies at issue in <em>Gill, Swanson, </em>and <em>Gearing. </em>American Southern\u2019s policy states that coverage does not apply to \u201c \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 which results directly or indirectly from * * * an intentional act of any \u2018insured.\u2019 \u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>American Southern policy is written in an extremely broad manner that declares that American Southern is not liable for harm resulting from any intentional act done by an insured. This language stands in stark contrast to the language of the other insurance policies at issue in this case, which exclude from coverage harm that is expected or intended by the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">{\u00b6 61} By using broad exclusionary language excluding coverage for harm caused by any intentional act \u2014 regardless of whether the harm is expected or intended by the insured \u2014 American Southern has worded its policy in a manner that frees it from the line of analysis found in <em>Gill, Swanson, </em>and <em>Gearing. </em>In those three cases, each insurance policy excluded coverage for harm that was \u201ccaused intentionally\u201d or \u201cexpected or intended\u201d by the insured. <em>Gill, </em>30 Ohio St.3d at 113, 30 OBR 424, 507 N.E.2d 1118; <em>Swanson, </em>58 Ohio St.3d at 191, 569 N.E.2d 906; <em>Gearing, </em>76 Ohio St.3d at 36, 665 N.E.2d 1115. While those cases contained exclusions for an intentional or expected <em>injury, </em>American Southern\u2019s policy addresses an intentional <em>act. </em>Given the significantly different and unambiguous language of the American Southern policy, we must conclude that as a matter of law, American Southern is under no duty to defend or indemnify Dailyn Campbell or his family for any liability resulting from his intentional acts in participating in the events at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">{\u00b6 62} We hold that as applied to an insurance policy\u2019s intentional-act exclusion, the doctrine of inferred intent is not limited to cases of sexual molestation or homicide. Nevertheless, the doctrine of inferred intent applies only in cases in which the insured\u2019s intentional act and the harm caused by that act are intrinsically tied so that the harm necessarily results from the act. Because the doctrine of inferred intent does not apply to the circumstances of this case, we further hold that under the Allstate, Erie, and Grange policies, the trier of fact must conduct a factual inquiry on remand to determine whether the boys intended or expected the harm that resulted from their intentional actions. We thus affirm the court of appeals\u2019 judgment that the trial court erred in granting the motions for summary judgment of Allstate, Erie, and Grange.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">{\u00b6 63} We reverse the judgment of the court of appeals as it applies to American Southern and reinstate the finding of the trial court that there is no coverage under the American Southern policy and that American Southern is accordingly under no duty to defend or indemnify Dailyn Campbell and his parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b330-10\">O\u2019Connor, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b331-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>Brown, C.J., and Pfeifer, J., concur in the syllabus and in part of the judgment.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b331-4\">Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, and Cupp, JJ., concur in paragraph one of the syllabus and in part of the judgment.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b320-10\">.

(Emphasis sic.) We conclude that as interpreted in light of <em>Swanson </em>and <em>Gearing, </em>Allstate\u2019s inclusion of the word \u201creasonably\u201d into its exclusionary language does not alter our analysis here, because the issue of whether the harm was intended or could reasonably be expected to result from the an intentional act is a question of fact.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b331-5\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AVs\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">{\u00b6 64} I concur in the majority opinion except for its reversal of the judgment of the court of appeals as it applies to American Southern. I would hold that the exclusionary language in the American Southern policy is not materially different from the language in the other policies and would therefore affirm the decision below.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">{\u00b6 65} The American Southern policy reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">{\u00b6 66} \u201cLiability and Medical Payment Coverage does not apply to \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 which results directly or indirectly from * * * an intentional act of any \u2018insured\u2019 or an act done at the direction of any \u2018insured.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">{\u00b6 67} The exclusion cannot be as broad as envisioned by the majority. Most accidents are the result of intentional acts- \u2014 -it is the result that is unintended. If a homeowner intentionally leaves his rake in the yard with the intention of returning to his gardening after a short water break and a neighbor steps on the rake and punctures his foot and breaks his nose, is there no coverage? Here, as in the other policies, the exclusion applies to instances where the insured intends to cause harm. Otherwise, there would be no coverage for any injury that resulted from any waking, nonreflexive act of an insured.</p>\n<judges id=\"b331-10\">Brown, C.J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b331-11\">O\u2019Donnell, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AjW\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-12\">{\u00b6 68} While I agree with the majority that the doctrine of inferred intent, as applied to an insurance policy\u2019s intentional-act exclusion, is not limited to cases of sexual molestation or homicide, I dissent from the majority\u2019s holding that the doctrine \u201capplies only in cases in which the insured\u2019s intentional act and the harm caused are intrinsically tied so that the act has necessarily resulted in the harm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-13\">Factual Background and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b331-14\">{\u00b6 69} On the evening of November 18, 2005, a group of high school teenagers, Dailyn Campbell, Corey Manns, Josh Lowe, Jesse Howard, and Taylor Rogers, took an artificial deer \u2014 the kind bow hunters use for target practice \u2014 from a property near Campbell\u2019s home. They brought it to Lowe\u2019s house, where they spray-painted profanity and the words \u201chit me\u201d on it and fashioned wooden legs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>so it would stand upright. Two other friends, Carson Barnes and Joey Ramge, arrived at Lowe\u2019s house as they finished painting, and then all except Rogers, who had become ill, drove to County Road 144, a 55-m.p.h. two-lane road in Hardin County. Sometime between 9 and 9:30 p.m., Campbell stood the deer upright in the eastbound lane of C.R. 144 just over the crest of a grade so it could not be seen by approaching motorists until they came within 15 to 30 yards of it. Thereafter, the teens drove back and forth along C.R. 144 to watch the reactions of the drivers as they encountered the deer. Within five to seven minutes after Campbell placed the deer in the roadway, appellee Robert Roby, operating a 2005 Dodge Neon, swerved to avoid hitting the deer but lost control of his vehicle, drove off the road, and rolled his car into a cornfield. Both Roby and appellee Dustin Zachariah, his passenger, were thrown from the vehicle during the crash, and both sustained serious injuries: Roby sustained permanent physical injuries, and Zachariah suffered fractures of his collar bone, sternum, and ribs, a collapsed lung, and bruises to his heart, brain, and other parts of his body. Each filed a personal-injury action in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">{\u00b6 70} Allstate Insurance Company, American Southern Insurance Company, Erie Insurance Exchange, and Grange Mutual Casualty Company all sought declaratory judgment that they had no duty to defend or indemnify their insureds, the teenagers and their parents, in these actions, asserting that the injuries did not result from an \u201coccurrence\u201d within the meaning of the homeowners\u2019 policies and were therefore excluded from coverage pursuant to the policies\u2019 intentional-act exclusions. The policies issued by the four insurance carriers contained similar language providing coverage for bodily injury arising from an \u201coccurrence,\u201d which the policies all defined as an accident. The Allstate, Erie, and Grange policies exclude coverage for bodily injury or property damage \u201cintended by,\u201d or that may reasonably be \u201cexpected\u201d to result from an intentional act, while the American Southern policy excludes coverage for bodily injury or property damage resulting \u201cdirectly or indirectly from\u201d an \u201cintentional act of any \u2018insured.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">{\u00b6 71} The trial court found that the act of placing the deer in the roadway resulted in a substantial certainty of harm and therefore ruled that the doctrine of inferred intent applied to the circumstances of the case. Consequently, the trial court inferred the intent to cause injury or property damage as a matter of law and granted summary judgment in favor of the carriers, concluding that they had no duty to defend or indemnify their insureds in the pending actions. In a split decision, the court of appeals reversed the grant of summary judgment because it determined that questions of fact remained regarding the certainty of harm resulting from the teenagers\u2019 actions, and because it would not infer the intent to cause injury as a matter of law. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Campbell, </em>Franklin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>App. Nos. 09AP-306, 09AP-307, 09AP-308, 09AP-309, 09AP-318, 09AP-319, 09AP-320, and 09AP-321, 2009-Ohio-6055, 2009 WL 3823362, \u00b6 57-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">{\u00b6 72} The carriers appealed, and we accepted jurisdiction to examine two issues: one, whether the doctrine of inferred intent as applied to an intentional-act exclusion in an insurance policy is limited to cases of sexual molestation or homicide, and two, whether Allstate\u2019s and Grange\u2019s policies\u2019 exclusionary language denotes an objective standard of coverage, rendering an insured\u2019s subjective intent irrelevant. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Campbell, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 1506, 2010-Ohio-799, 922 N.E.2d 969.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Doctrine of Inferred Intent</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">{\u00b6 73} In <em>Gearing v. Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 34, 665 N.E.2d 1115, this court examined whether an insurance company is obligated to defend and indemnify an insured in civil litigation arising out of the insured\u2019s sexual molestation of three minors. There we recognized the doctrine of inferred intent and set forth a test for its application, stating that \u201cin those cases where an intentional act is substantially certain to cause injury, determination of an insured\u2019s subjective intent, or lack of subjective intent, is not conclusive as to the issue of coverage. Rather, an insured\u2019s protestations that he \u2018didn\u2019t mean to hurt anyone\u2019 are only relevant where the intentional act at issue is not substantially certain to result in injury.\u201d Id. at 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">{\u00b6 74} Applying the \u201csubstantial certainty\u201d test in <em>Gearing, </em>we determined that intent to harm is properly inferred as a matter of law because the act of molestation is so inherently injurious that it cannot be performed without causing the resulting injury. Id. at 39, 40. Because Gearing\u2019s insurance policy contained an exclusion for bodily injury or property damage \u201cexpected or intended by the insured,\u201d we held that the insurance company was not obligated to defend him in the civil suit arising out of that conduct. Id. at 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">{\u00b6 75} Three years later, <em>Buckeye Union Ins. Co. v. New England Ins. Co. </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 280, 720 N.E.2d 495, presented the question of whether intent could be inferred as a matter of law from an insurance company\u2019s bad-faith refusal to settle a claim. The court noted that it had inferred intent as a matter of law in only two cases, <em>Preferred Risk Ins. Co. v. Gill </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 108, 30 OBR 424, 507 N.E.2d 1118, and <em>Gearing, </em>and that in both cases, the insureds were found to have committed wrongful acts (aggravated murder and sexual molestation, respectively), which are \u201cintentionally injurious by definition.\u201d <em>Buckeye Union, </em>87 Ohio St.3d at 284, 720 N.E.2d 495. Concluding that settling an insurance claim is an act of contract interpretation and that a settlement may be properly refused in certain circumstances, the court declined to infer intent to injure in the case, holding that it would \u201cnot place failure to settle an insurance claim on the[] same plane\u201d as murder and molestation, which \u201cdo not enjoy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>similar sometime rectitude.\u201d Id. However, in an opinion concurring in judgment only, Justice Cook explained that by failing to apply the \u201csubstantial certainty\u201d test, the majority\u2019s analysis misconstrued Ohio law by overlooking the standard set forth in <em>Gearing. </em>Id. at 288 (Cook, J., concurring). Justice Cook further cautioned that the court \u201cought not to depart from <em>Gearing, </em>as the departure does nothing to clarify the analysis of this issue,\u201d and instead \u201cimposes an inadequate subjective test, coupled with an undefined category of inferred intent acts.\u201d Id. at 291-292.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Confusion Regarding the Substantial Certainty Test</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">{\u00b6 76} In my view, the majority today continues the retreat from the substantial-certainty test set forth in <em>Gearing </em>by directing courts to infer intent as a matter of law \u201conly in cases in which the insured\u2019s intentional act and the harm caused are intrinsically tied so that the act has necessarily resulted in the harm.\u201d The majority justifies its adoption of this new test by stating that <em>Gearing </em>\u201cdid not address the question of whether intent may be inferred in cases involving acts other than sexual molestation or murder\u201d and that as a result, \u201c[a] close examination of Gearing * * * reveals that this court has limited the scope of inferred intent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">{\u00b6 77} I disagree with this narrow reading of <em>Gearing </em>and the artificial limitation on the doctrine of inferred intent. <em>Gearing </em>recognized that the substantial-certainty test \u201cis inherent in our past decisions,\u201d 76 Ohio St.3d at 39, 665 N.E.2d 1115, including our decision in <em>Physicians Ins. Co. v. Swanson </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 189, 569 N.E.2d 906, where we held that the intentional shooting of a BB gun would not necessarily have resulted in the injury and approved of the premise that \u201c \u2018resulting injury which ensues from the volitional act of an insured is still an \u201caccident\u201d within the meaning of an insurance policy if the insured does not specifically intend to cause the resulting harm or <em>is not substantially certain that such harm will occur.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id. at 193, quoting <em>Quincy Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Abernathy </em>(1984), 393 Mass. 81, 84 469 N.E.2d 797. Thus, in <em>Gearing, </em>the court contemplated that the test could be applied in circumstances beyond molestation. The court\u2019s lack of speculation as to specific circumstances in which the test would permit an inference of intent as a matter of law is in keeping with the proper role of the court to decide only those issues before it. Opinions should be confined to the facts presented by the case, and therefore, no inference can or should be made from the manner in which the court wrote <em>Gearing </em>with respect to the court\u2019s intent to limit or expand the scope of the doctrine of inferred intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">{\u00b6 78} We adhere to our precedent in conformity with a doctrine known as stare decisis et non quieta movere \u2014 -\u201cto stand by things decided, and not to disturb settled points.\u201d See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (9th Ed.2009) 1537. Our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>prior decisions have established the law of the doctrine of inferred intent, and the courts below applied it. We have a body of case authority designed to deal with circumstances arising from those who engage in conduct that is so inherently injurious that it cannot be performed without causing resulting injury. Intent to injure is properly inferred as a matter of law from the act of placing an obstruction out of the line of sight of a motorist below the crest of a grade at night, in the middle of a lane of eastbound traffic on a 55 m.p.h. highway, because that act is substantially certain to cause injury. Here, the teens anticipated injury because they repeatedly drove past the deer to witness the reactions of oncoming motorists as they encountered the deer, and their deposition testimony is that they witnessed Roby drive past them, and they witnessed the aftermath of the crash. These actions more than suggest that they knew that injury would occur; they anticipated it and waited for it. Our case law applies to these circumstances because these teens knew injury would result from their conduct. Because their deliberate actions were designed to result in injury substantially certain to occur, the injury to Roby and Zachariah was not an accident, and thus not an occurrence as defined by the language in these policies. As a result, the exclusions in each of these policies should apply to the facts of these cases. Accordingly, the insurance companies should have no duty to defend or indemnify their insured because these injuries resulted from an intentional act, and the policies exclude coverage for intentional acts. Thus, I would reverse the judgment of the Tenth District Court of Appeals and reinstate the judgment of the trial court. Because today the majority departs from and confuses our established case law on the doctrine of inferred intent and our holding in <em>Gearing </em>and instead adopts its own preferred test for the application of the inferred-intent rule, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b335-4\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b335-5\">Cupp, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ael-dedup-0\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">{\u00b6 79} I concur in paragraph one of the syllabus, which holds, \u201cAs applied to an insurance policy\u2019s intentional-act exclusion, the doctrine of inferred intent is not limited to cases of sexual molestation or homicide.\u201d I also concur in part in the court\u2019s judgment insofar as it affirms the court of appeals\u2019 judgment that the trial court erred in granting Erie\u2019s and Grange\u2019s motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">{\u00b6 80} I further agree with the court that there is no coverage under the American Southern policy and that American Southern is therefore under no duty to defend or indemnify Dailyn Campbell and his parent.

In contrast to the other policies in this case, which exclude from coverage harm that is expected or intended by the insured, the Allstate policy includes language that excludes coverage for bodily injury or property damage \u201cwhich may reasonably be expected to result from the intentional or criminal acts or omissions of\u2019 an insured. As the majority concludes with regard to the American Southern policy, language that excludes bodily injury or property damage that results from \u201can intentional act\u201d of the insured is broad. The Allstate policy\u2019s addition of the qualifier that the harm must have been \u201creasonably\u201d expected to result from the intentional act, in my view, does not warrant different treatment of the Allstate policy from the American Southern policy. While the car crash that occurred in this case was not \u201ccertain\u201d to occur \u2014 at least in the manner that it did \u2014 it is hard to dispute that such an event could \u201creasonably\u201d be expected to result from the \u201cintentional * * * acts\u201d of the teenagers in this case, a more objective than subjective standard. In my view, there is no genuine issue of material fact with regard to that issue under Allstate\u2019s policy, because under the objective \u201creasonably * * * expected to result\u201d standard in that policy, the boys\u2019 professed subjective intent not to harm anyone is immaterial. Accordingly, I also would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals with regard to Allstate and reinstate the trial court\u2019s summary judgment in favor of Allstate. I would hold that Allstate is under no duty to defend or indemnify Dailyn Campbell\u2019s parent and the parents of Jesse Howard.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Anm\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Paul W.
