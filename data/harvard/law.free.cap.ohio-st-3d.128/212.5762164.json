The issue for our review concerns the patient\u2019s ability to obtain discovery to determine the source of his exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-12\">I. Case Background</p>\n<p id=\"b344-13\">{\u00b6 2} In May 2006, appellee Donald Ward underwent a procedure to replace his heart valve at Summa Health System (\u201cSumma\u201d). Five months later, Summa notified Ward that he may have been exposed to hepatitis B during his time at Summa. After he tested positive for the virus, Ward and his wife filed a complaint against Summa and John Does 1 through 6, alleging various claims, including medical malpractice. The Wards also requested an extension of time to file the affidavit of merit required by Civ.R. 10(D)(2), arguing that discovery was needed because Summa had refused to identify the source of Donald Ward\u2019s exposure to the virus. The trial court granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-14\">{\u00b6 3} In December 2007, the Wards filed a notice of deposition for Donald Ward\u2019s surgeon, appellant Robert F. Debski, M.D., who was not a named party to the action. In response to previous discussions regarding the deposition, Deb-ski\u2019s attorney sent a letter to the Wards\u2019 counsel stating that the doctor would not discuss his own personal medical information but would testify about the surgery he had performed. The Wards refused to limit the scope of the deposition, and Debski filed a motion for a protective order, arguing that the physician-patient privilege protected his right to privacy with regard to his own medical information. The Wards opposed the motion and detailed why they believed that Debski could be the source of exposure. They contended that the physician-patient privilege did not apply, and they explained that they wished to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>ask Debski (1) whether he has ever had hepatitis B and, if so, (2) when he contracted the disease and (3) how and when he became aware that he had the disease. The trial court granted the protective order, finding that the doctor had standing to assert the physician-patient privilege in testifying as to his own medical information and that there had been no waiver of the privilege.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">{\u00b6 4} In the meantime, Summa filed a motion to dismiss because the Wards had not yet filed an affidavit of merit as required by Civ.R. 10(D)(2). The trial court granted the Wards an extension of time to file their affidavit and granted a further extension after their attempt to appeal the protective order was dismissed for lack of a final appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">{\u00b6 5} On December 2, 2008, Summa filed a second motion to dismiss, arguing that dismissal was appropriate because the Wards had failed to comply with the trial court\u2019s order to submit an affidavit of merit. The Wards responded that their effort to obtain an affidavit had been hampered by the trial court\u2019s discovery rulings. They contended that their inability to identify the source of the hepatitis B exposure prevented prospective expert witnesses from determining whether the standard of care had been met. The trial court dismissed the case without prejudice based on the Wards\u2019 failure to state a claim pursuant to Civ.R. 10(D)(2)(d) and their failure to comply with the court\u2019s order under Civ.R. 41(B)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">{\u00b6 6} The court of appeals reversed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The appellate court examined R.C. 2317.02(B)(1) and determined that \u201c[w]hile Dr. Debski is a physician, the testimony being sought concerns his role as a patient: the Wards do not wish to ask Dr. Debski about his patients or their records; the Wards want to ask Dr. Debski about himself. Nothing in the plain language of the statute prohibits this inquiry. The statute does not prevent patients from testifying. Also, while the Wards seek what clearly could be classified as a \u2018communication\u2019 under the statute, they do not seek it from the protected person, the physician; they seek it from an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>unprotected source, the patient.\u201d <em>Ward v. Summa Health Sys., </em>184 Ohio App.3d 254, 2009-Ohio-4859, 920 N.E.2d 421, \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">{\u00b6 7} We accepted jurisdiction of Robert Debski\u2019s discretionary appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">II. Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">{\u00b6 8} This case concerns the ability of the Wards to discover information that could lead to the source of Donald Ward\u2019s hepatitis B exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">\n<em>A. Discovery in General</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">{\u00b6 9} Parties have a right to liberal discovery of information under the Rules of Civil Procedure. See <em>Moskovitz v. Mt. Sinai Med. Ctr. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 638, 661-662, 635 N.E.2d 331. Discovery may be obtained through \u201cdeposition upon oral examination or written questions; written interrogatories; production of documents, electronically stored information, or things or permission to enter upon land or other property, for inspection and other purposes; physical and mental examinations; and requests for admission.\u201d Civ.R. 26(A). Even though Dr. Debski is not a party, he can be compelled to give a deposition, as any witness in a civil case may be. See Civ.R. 30 and 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">{\u00b6 10} The scope of the information that a party may discover is governed by Civ.R. 26(B)(1), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-10\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cParties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, <em>not privileged, </em>which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action, whether it relates to the claim or defense of the party seeking discovery or to the claim or defense of any other party, including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition and location of any books, documents, electronically stored information, or other tangible things and the identity and location of persons having knowledge of any discoverable matter. It is not ground for objection that the information sought will be inadmissible at the trial if the information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">{\u00b6 12} In this case, the Wards subpoenaed Dr. Debski for deposition and at some point indicated that they intended to ask him about his personal medical information. Debski does not dispute the relevancy of the information sought to the Wards\u2019 lawsuit. He nonetheless argues that the Wards are not entitled to discover the information, because it is protected by the physician-patient privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>{\u00b6 13} Ordinarily, a discovery dispute is reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Tracy v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 147, 151-152, 569 N.E.2d 875. However, if the discovery issue involves an alleged privilege, as in this case, it is a question of law that must be reviewed de novo. <em>Med. Mut. of Ohio v. Schlotterer, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 181, 2009-Ohio-2496, 909 N.E.2d 1237, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">{\u00b6 14} We will now examine the scope of the physician-patient privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\"><em>B. Physician-Patient Privilege </em>\u2014 R.C. <em>2817.02(B)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">{\u00b6 15} The physician-patient privilege did not exist at common law. <em>State Med. Bd. v. Miller </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 136, 140, 541 N.E.2d 602; <em>Weis v. Weis </em>(1947), 147 Ohio St. 416, 428-429, 34 O.O. 350, 72 N.E.2d 245. Therefore, being in derogation of the common law, any statutory privilege must be strictly construed against the party seeking to assert it and may be applied only to those circumstances specifically named in the statute. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">{\u00b6 16} The General Assembly established the physician-patient privilege in R.C. 2317.02. It states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-10\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cThe following persons shall not testify in certain respects:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-11\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-12\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c(B)(1) A physician or a dentist concerning a communication made to the physician or dentist by a patient in that relation or the physician\u2019s or dentist\u2019s advice to a patient, except as otherwise provided in this division, division (B)(2), and division (B)(3) of this section, and except that, if the patient is deemed by section 2151.421 of the Revised Code to have waived any testimonial privilege under this division, the physician may be compelled to testify on the same subject.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-13\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-14\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c(5)(a) As used in divisions (B)(1) to (4) of this section, \u2018communication\u2019 means acquiring, recording, or transmitting any information, in any manner, concerning any facts, opinions, or statements necessary to enable a physician or dentist to diagnose, treat, prescribe, or act for a patient. A \u2018communication\u2019 may include, but is not limited to, any medical or dental, office, or hospital communication such as a record, chart, letter, memorandum, laboratory test and results, x-ray, photograph, financial statement, diagnosis, or prognosis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-15\">{\u00b6 22} The physician-patient privilege, however, is not absolute. R.C. 2917.02(B) contains a number of exceptions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For instance, the privilege does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>apply when the patient gives express consent to the release of medical information or when the patient places his medical condition in issue by filing a medical claim or wrongful-death action.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">{\u00b6 23} We have previously discussed the purpose behind the physician-patient privilege:</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cA review of the physician-patient privilege found in R.C. 2317.02(B) indicates that the statute has a specific purpose. It is designed to create an atmosphere of confidentiality, which theoretically will encourage the patient to be completely candid with his or her physician, thus enabling more complete treatment. As this court stated in <em>State v. Antill </em>(1964), 176 Ohio St. 61, 64-65, 26 O.O.2d 366, 368, 197 N.E.2d 548, 551, \u2018 * * * [t]he purpose of this privilege is to encourage patients to make a full disclosure of their symptoms and conditions to their physicians without fear that such matters will later become public. * * * \u2019 In addition, <em>Huzjak v. United States </em>(N.D.Ohio 1987), 118 F.R.D. 61, 63, explains the purpose of the physician-patient privilege:</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c \u2018Under the physician/patient privilege, a treating physician is prohibited from disclosing matters disclosed by the patient to the physician during consultations regarding treatment or diagnosis of the patient. The rationale of this privilege is to promote health by encouraging a patient to fully and freely disclose all relevant information which may assist the physician in treating the patient. <em>Floyd v. Copas, </em>9 [O.O.3d] 298 (1977). If the patient feared that such information could be revealed by the treating doctor, the patient might refrain from, or be inhibited from, disclosing relevant information. The privilege is designed to provide an assurance of confidentiality.\u2019 \u201d <em>Miller, </em>44 Ohio St.3d at 139-140, 541 N.E.2d 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">{\u00b6 26} Dr. Debski claims that because he has not waived the physician-patient privilege and none of the statutory exceptions apply, he cannot be compelled to testify about his personal medical information. Even though the court of appeals found that the information sought by the Wards is a \u201ccommunication\u201d under R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>2317.02(B)(5)(a), the court held that the physician-patient privilege did not apply because the plain language of the statute prohibits only a <em>physician </em>or a <em>dentist </em>from testifying about those communications. It is important to recognize that it is Debski\u2019s status as a patient, rather than his status as a physician, that applies here. The appellate court determined that nothing in the statute gives a <em>patient </em>the right to refuse to testify about his or her own medical information.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">{\u00b6 27} Because we must strictly construe the statutory privilege, we conclude that R.C. 2317.02(B) does not protect a person from having to disclose his or her own medical information when that information is relevant to the subject matter involved in a pending civil action. The court of appeals is correct that the statute does not address whether medical information is discoverable from a patient himself. We are not permitted to read such language into the statute. See <em>State ex rel. Sapp v. Franklin Cty. Court of Appeals, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 368, 2008-Ohio-2637, 889 N.E.2d 500, \u00b6 26 (court cannot add exception when plain language of statute does not contain exception); <em>State v. Hughes </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 424, 427, 715 N.E.2d 540 (\u201cIn construing a statute, we may not add or delete words\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">{\u00b6 28} Although Debski strenuously argues that his status as a nonparty controls the outcome of this case, the reason he was not named as a party is that the Wards do not know whether he is the one who exposed Donald Ward to hepatitis B. A potential tortfeasor cannot use his or her status as a nonparty to prevent discovery of information that could shed light on whether he or she is the actual tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">\n<em>C. Roe and Schlotterer Are Distinguishable</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ahn\">{\u00b6 29} Debski responds that the court of appeals\u2019 holding is contrary to our decisions in <em>Roe v. Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio Region, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 399, 2009-Ohio-2973, 912 N.E.2d 61, and <em>Med. Mut. of Ohio v. Schlotterer, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 181, 2009-Ohio-2496, 909 N.E.2d 1237. He argues that <em>Roe </em>established that the personal medical information of nonparty patients is absolutely privileged and protected from discovery by R.C. 2317.02(B), the physician-patient privilege. But the holding in <em>Roe </em>is not as broad as Debski claims. We have never held that the physician-patient privilege provides absolute protection against the disclosure of medical information.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">{\u00b6 30} In <em>Roe, </em>the plaintiffs sought to discover abuse reports and medical records of nonparties from a health-care provider. <em>Roe </em>at \u00b6 14. The plaintiffs claimed that the disclosure of the medical records was necessary to protect or further a countervailing interest that outweighed the nonparty patients\u2019 interest in confidentiality. Id. at \u00b6 46. No one disputed R.C. 2317.02\u2019s applicability; the <em>Roe </em>plaintiffs sought medical records <em>from a health-care provider. </em>Id. at \u00b6 26. Instead, the question was whether to apply the exception to the privilege that had been created in <em>Biddle v. Warren Gen. Hosp. </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 395, 715 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>N.E.2d 518. We held that the exception should not be applied. The medical records of the nonparties in <em>Roe </em>were not subject to discovery, because (1) R.C. 2317.02(B) prohibited the health-care provider from releasing them, (2) no statutory exception to the privilege applied, and (3) the nonparty patients had not expressly given their consent to the release of their records.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">{\u00b6 31} Debski also argues that in <em>Schlotterer, </em>we reaffirmed Ohio\u2019s longstanding law that the patient is the exclusive holder of the physician-patient privilege and thus the patient is a \u201cprotected source.\u201d 122 Ohio St.3d 181, 2009-Ohio-2496, 909 N.E.2d 1237. But <em>Schlotterer, </em>too, is distinguishable because it also involved a litigant\u2019s ability to obtain discovery of a nonparty\u2019s medical records <em>from a physician. </em>Id. at \u00b6 2 and 12. The case concerned whether the insureds\u2019 consent to release medical information to their insurer permitted release of the insureds\u2019 medical records to their insurer to allow it to pursue a fraud claim against a physician. The facts in <em>Schlotterer </em>fit squarely within R.C. 2317.02(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">\n<em>D. Patients May Still Obtain a Protective Order</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">{\u00b6 32} Although we have determined that the physician-patient privilege does not apply in this case, this does not mean that Debski has no potential recourse. As the appellate court indicated, the trial court must still consider whether the doctor is entitled to a protective order.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court granted a protective order because it believed that the physician-patient privilege applied. Privilege, however, is not the only basis to grant a protective order. As Civ.R. 26(C) indicates, protective orders may be granted when justice requires \u201cto protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense.\u201d Upon remand, the trial court must weigh these factors against the Wards\u2019 right to discover the information.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AIg\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Scanlon &amp; Elliott, Michael J.

Best, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">{\u00b6 33} We therefore hold that under the circumstances of this case, R.C. 2317.02(B), the physician-patient privilege, does not preclude discovery of medical information from a patient. The judgment of the Summit County Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b352-7\">Brown, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b352-8\">O\u2019Donnell, J., dissents and would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b345-9\">. As part of the order, the trial court denied the Wards\u2019 request to compel the production of unusual-occurrence reports from Summa.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b345-10\">. As an initial matter, the appellate court addressed whether there was a final, appealable order. It noted that generally a dismissal without prejudice is not a final, appealable order, but if the order affects a substantial right and in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment, it is a final order. R.C. 2505.02(B)(1); see also <em>Natl. City Commercial Capital Corp. v. AAAA At Your Serv., Inc., </em>114 Ohio St.3d 82, 2007-Ohio-2942, 868 N.E.2d 663. The appellate court found that because the Wards could not produce an affidavit of merit without the denied discovery requests, the dismissal in effect prevented a judgment in their favor and therefore was a final, appealable order. <em>Ward v. Summa Health Sys., </em>184 Ohio App.3d 254, 2009-Ohio-4859, 920 N.E.2d 421, \u00b6 8. No one challenged this determination, and therefore we will not address this aspect of the court of appeals\u2019 ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b346-12\">. The appellate court also reversed the trial court\u2019s order denying the Wards\u2019 motion to compel that they had filed against Summa. We did not accept Summa\u2019s discretionary appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b347-16\">. {\u00b6 a} R.C. 2317.02 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnF\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>{\u00b6 b} \u201cThe testimonial privilege established under this division does not apply, and a physician or dentist may testify or may be compelled to testify, in any of the following circumstances:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aze-dedup-0\">{1i e} \u201c(B)(1)(a) In any civil action, in accordance with the discovery provisions of the Rules of Civil Procedure in connection with a civil action, or in connection with a claim under Chapter 4123. of the Revised Code, under any of the following circumstances:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\">{\u00b6 d} \u201c(i) If the patient or the guardian or other legal representative of the patient gives express consent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">{\u00b6 e} \u201c(ii)If the patient is deceased, the spouse of the patient or the executor or administrator of the patient\u2019s estate gives express consent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">{\u00b6 f} \u201c(iii) If a medical claim, dental claim, chiropractic claim, or optometric claim, as defined in section 2305.113 of the Revised Code, an action for wrongful death, any other type of civil action, or a claim under Chapter 4123. of the Revised Code is filed by the patient, the personal representative of the estate of the patient if deceased, or the patient\u2019s guardian or other legal representative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-8\">{\u00b6 g} \u201c(b) In any civil action concerning court-ordered treatment or services received by a patient, if the court-ordered treatment or services were ordered as part of a case plan journalized under section 2151.412 of the Revised Code or the court-ordered treatment or services are necessary or relevant to dependency, neglect, or abuse or temporary or permanent custody proceedings under Chapter 2151. of the Revised Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-9\">{\u00b6 h} \u201c(c) In any criminal action concerning any test or the results of any test that determines the presence or concentration of alcohol, a drug of abuse, a combination of them, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the patient\u2019s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, mine, or other bodily substance at any time relevant to the criminal offense in question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-10\">{\u00b6 i} \u201c(d) In any criminal action against a physician or dentist.
