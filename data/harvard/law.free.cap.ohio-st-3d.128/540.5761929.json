We hold that an exclusion in a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy for claims \u201carising out of \u201d premises owned by the insured other than the insured location excludes coverage for claims that arise from the quality or condition of the premises and claims based merely upon the insured\u2019s ownership of the property upon which the injury occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-14\">\u25a0 {\u00b6 2} Because the barren record before us does not sufficiently establish whether the claims raised in the underlying action are claims related to the quality or condition of the premises or whether the claims are based on another theory of negligence, we remand the cause to the trial court to make that determination and then apply our holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>Relevant Background</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">{\u00b6 3} Michael and Marilyn Hunter are Ohio residents who reside in a home in Hamilton. The Hunters\u2019 Ohio premises are insured by a homeowner\u2019s policy issued by appellee, Westfield Insurance Company. Westfield\u2019s policy also provides the Hunters with personal liability coverage for damages arising from bodily injury or property damages.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It excludes, however, coverage for claims \u201carising out of \u201d premises owned by an insured that are not an insured location.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">{\u00b6 4} The Hunters own a farm in Indiana that is not a named insured location under the Westfield policy. Rather, the Hunters purchased liability insurance from appellant, Grinnell Mutual Reinsurance Company, to insure the farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">{\u00b6 5} On July 7, 2001, the Hunters\u2019 minor grandchild, Terrell Whicker, and another minor relative, Ashley Arvin, were riding all-terrain vehicles (\u201cATV\u201d) on the farm. Terrell was injured in an accident that he alleged was caused when Ashley drove her vehicle toward Terrell but failed to turn away in time, thereby running over him and his vehicle. Terrell alleges that he suffered fractures to his femurs, ankle, and skull, as well as other injuries, as a result of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">{\u00b6 6} Terrell and his parents brought suit against Ashley, her mother and stepfather (who were present at the farm during the incident), and the Hunters. Insofar as the complaint pertains to Ashley\u2019s mother and stepfather, it pleads a cause of negligent entrustment. And as pleaded against the Hunters, it alleges that they knew of Ashley\u2019s \u201creckless and/or negligent tendencies\u201d and \u201chad the ability and duty to exercise control\u201d over Ashley, but breached that duty, and that as \u201ca proximate and foreseeable result of the negligence\u201d of the Hunters, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Terrell sustained injuries. The complaint is devoid of any allegation that a condition on the property contributed to the incident giving rise to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">{\u00b6 7} Westfield brought a declaratory-judgment action against Grinnell, the Hunters, and the Whickers, seeking a declaration that it had no duty to defend or indemnify the Hunters for the claims asserted in Terrell\u2019s lawsuit. Grinnell answered and counterclaimed, asserting that both insurers were obligated to provide coverage, on a pro rata basis, to the Hunters.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">{\u00b6 8} On cross-motions for summary judgment, the trial court granted West-field\u2019s motion and denied Grinnell\u2019s and the Whickers\u2019. The court reasoned that the claims raised by the Whickers \u201carose out of\u2019 premises that were not insured by Westfield, i.e., the farm, and therefore that Westfield had no obligation to defend or indemnify the Hunters for the Whickers\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">{\u00b6 9} On appeal by Grinnell and the Whickers, the court of appeals affirmed. Like the trial court, it held that there was no coverage for the Hunters under the Westfield policy for the Whickers\u2019 claims because the Hunters\u2019 farm was not an \u201cinsured location\u201d under the Hunters\u2019 homeowner\u2019s policy and, therefore, that coverage was precluded by the \u201cother premises\u201d exclusion. 2009-Ohio-5642, 2009 WL 3415894, \u00b6 36. Grinnell appealed to us for discretionary review and secured an order from the court of appeals certifying that its decision in this case is in conflict with that of another court of appeals. We granted discretionary review, 124 Ohio St.3d 1492, 2010-Ohio-670, 922 N.E.2d 227, and recognized the conflict, 124 Ohio St.3d 1490, 2010-Ohio-670, 922 N.E.2d 226, which presents the following question: \u201cWhen construing an insurance policy exclusion, does an injury \u2018arise out\u2019 of a premises only if some dangerous condition exists on the premises that caused or contributed to the injury, or must the injury only originate in or have a causal connection with the premises?\u201d We answer that question by holding that an exclusion in a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy for claims \u201carising out of\u201d premises owned by the insured other than the insured location excludes coverage for premises-based liability claims, such as those that arise from the quality or condition of the premises. Moreover, although the exclusion does not bar coverage of claims that arise from the insured\u2019s alleged negligence if that negligence is unrelated to the quality or condition of the premises, it does exclude coverage for claims based upon the insured\u2019s ownership of the property upon which the injury occurred. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">\n<em>A</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">{\u00b6 10} At the outset, we reiterate some well-settled principles of insurance law that guide us here.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>{\u00b6 11} Ambiguous provisions in an insurance policy must be construed strictly against the insurer and liberally in favor of the insured. See, e.g., <em>King v. Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 208, 519 N.E.2d 1380, syllabus. This is particularly true when considering provisions that purport to limit or qualify coverage under the policy. <em>Am. Fin. Corp. v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. </em>(1968), 15 Ohio St.2d 171, 174, 44 O.O.2d 147, 239 N.E.2d 33. \u201c \u2018[A]n exclusion in an insurance policy will be interpreted as applying only to that which is <em>dearly </em>intended to be excluded.\u2019 (Emphasis sic.) <em>Hybud Equip. Corp. v. Sphere Drake Ins. Co., Ltd. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 657, 665, 597 N.E.2d 1096.\u201d <em>Sharonville v. Am. Emps. Ins. Co., </em>109 Ohio St.3d 186, 2006-Ohio-2180, 846 N.E.2d 833, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">{\u00b6 12} With those guiding principles set forth, we proceed with our review of the courts\u2019 decisions on summary judgment. We apply the de novo standard of review to a decision granting or denying summary judgment based on interpretation of an insurance contract. <em>Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Guman Bros. Farm </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 107, 108, 652 N.E.2d 684.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">\n<em>B</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">{\u00b6 13} The issue here is to what degree a negligence claim must be connected to the premises in order for the exclusion to be triggered. As the Massachusetts Appeals Court phrased the inquiry, \u201c[t]he question is whether the exclusion ought to be read as pertaining to anything that occurs on the off-policy premises or whether the exclusion is limited to accidents that occur because of a condition of the off-policy premises, such as a hole in the walkway, a loose step, defective plumbing, or faulty electric wiring.\u201d <em>Callahan v. Quincy Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>(2000), 50 Mass.App.Ct. 260, 261, 736 N.E.2d 857.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">{\u00b6 14} As the court of appeals in this case recognized, we have not interpreted the exclusion for claims \u201carising out of\u201d other property in the context of homeowner\u2019s policies. And the Ohio appellate courts that have considered the question have reached different results.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">{\u00b6 15} The Eighth District Court of Appeals interprets the exclusion broadly. It holds that \u201c \u2018[ajrising out of means generally \u2018flowing from\u2019 or \u2018having its origin in\u2019 \u201d and that in order for coverage to be excluded, there need only be some causal link to the property rather than a showing that the premises were the proximate cause of the injury. <em>Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Turner </em>(1986), 29 Ohio App.3d 73, 77, 29 OBR 83, 503 N.E.2d 212, quoting <em>Ins. Co. of N. Am. v. Royal Indemn. Co. </em>(C.A.6, 1970), 429 F.2d 1014, 1017. The court of appeals in this ease followed the rationale of <em>Turner.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">{\u00b6 16} A narrower view of the exclusion was adopted by the Second District Court of Appeals in a more recent case, <em>Am. States Ins. Co. v. Guillermin </em>(1996), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>108 Ohio App.3d 547, 671 N.E.2d 317. <em>Guillermin </em>holds that an injury arises out of the premises, and coverage is therefore excluded, only if there is a dangerous condition on the premises that causes or contributes to the bodily injury for which coverage is sought. Id. at 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">{\u00b6 17} Although both approaches are understandable, for the reasons that follow, we hold that the <em>Guillermin </em>rule is better reasoned and that the exclusion in Westfield\u2019s policy is narrow enough to permit coverage for claims like that presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">\n<em>C</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">{\u00b6 18} The broader rule set forth in <em>Turner </em>is based on the belief that the term \u201c \u2018[ajrising out of means generally \u2018flowing from\u2019 or \u2018having its origin in.\u2019 <em>Ins. Co. of North America v. Royal Indemn. Co. </em>(C.A.6, 1970), 429 F.2d 1014 [1017]. The phrase generally indicates a causal connection with the insured property, not that the insured premises be the proximate cause of the injury.\u201d <em>Turner, </em>29 Ohio App.3d at 77, 29 OBR 83, 503 N.E.2d 212. We think that the understanding of the exclusion set forth in <em>Turner </em>is too sweeping. Indeed, under the construction adopted in <em>Turner, </em>any claim for injury that occurs on premises owned by the insured other than the insured homeowner\u2019s primary residence would be denied, and the insured would not have liability coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">{\u00b6 19} The better-reasoned interpretation of the exclusion is that adopted by the court in <em>Guillermin </em>and, before it, by the Kentucky Supreme Court in <em>Eyler v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(Ky.1992), 824 S.W.2d 855.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">{\u00b6 20} In <em>Eyler, </em>the court faced an exclusion similar, but not identical, to the one at issue here. It recognized that the phrase \u201carising out of\u201d is one that \u201csuggests the necessity for a causal connection between the premises and the injury. Ordinarily, \u2018arising out of \u2019 does not mean merely occurring on or slightly connected with but connotes the need for a direct consequence or responsible condition. As we view it, to satisfy the \u2018arising out of \u2019 exclusion in the policy, it would be necessary to show that the premises, apart from the insured\u2019s conduct thereon, was causally related to the occurrence.\u201d Id. at 857. We agree, as do other courts that have considered the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">{\u00b6 21} For example, in <em>Lititz Mut. Ins. Co. v. Branch </em>(Mo.App.Ct.1977), 561 S.W.2d 371, the court confronted an exclusion that denied coverage for bodily injuries \u201carising out of any premises, other than [the] insured premises, owned, rented or controlled by any insured.\u201d Id. at 373, fn. 1. After the insured\u2019s dog bit a child while both the dog and the child were on the insured\u2019s commercial property, the child\u2019s parents sought coverage for the injuries. The court held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>that the exclusion did not apply. In so concluding, it recited the dictionary definition of \u201cpremises\u201d and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-5\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cIt is apparent that \u2018premises\u2019 in common parlance and in the policy itself contemplates the land and more or less permanently affixed structures contained thereon. * * * A dog, whether permanently kenneled or tethered on the property, is not part of the premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-6\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cIt cannot therefore be said that a dog bite arises out of[,] originates from, grows out of, or flows from the premises. That it occurs upon the premises does not establish a causal connection between the bite and the premises.\u201d Id. at 373.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">{\u00b6 24} More recently, the Massachusetts Appeals Court reached the same conclusion in a case that is apposite here. In <em>Callahan, </em>the insureds kept a dog, Harley, for protection. 50 Mass.App.Ct. at 263, 736 N.E.2d 857. The insureds had a homeowner\u2019s policy for property they owned in New Hampshire, and Harley traveled with his masters between New Hampshire and another home they kept in Marshfield, Massachusetts, which was insured by an insurer different from the insurer that covered the New Hampshire property. Harley bit an invitee on the Marshfield property, and the insurer for the New Hampshire property denied coverage and a defense to the homeowners, asserting that the exclusion for claims for bodily injury \u201c \u2018arising out a premises} ] owned by an insured * * * that is not an insured location\u2019 \u201d applied. Id. at 261. The trial court agreed, but the appellate court reversed. It stated, \u201cThe point is, Harley was not a condition of the Marshfield premises, as a protective electric fence would be. Harley\u2019s bite was no more connected to the Marshfield real estate than had Callahan spilled hot coffee on a guest on those premises. It happened there, but did not \u2018arise out of,\u2019 as the phrase is understood.\u201d Id. at 263. The appellate court concluded that Callahan\u2019s liability stemmed from his \u201cpersonal\u201d tortious conduct in harboring Harley, not from any condition of the Marshfield property. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">{\u00b6 25} We believe that the rationale of <em>Branch </em>and <em>Callahan </em>is the better reasoned one for analyzing claims alleging that the injury occurred as a result of the insured\u2019s negligence when the negligence is unrelated to the quality or condition of the property, solely because the insured owned the property where the injury occurred. We therefore hold that an exclusion in a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy for claims \u201carising out of \u201d premises owned by the insured other than the insured location excludes coverage for premises-based liability claims, such as those that arise from the quality or condition of the premises. Moreover, although the exclusion does not bar coverage of claims that arise from the insured\u2019s alleged negligence if that negligence is unrelated to the quality or condition of the premises, it does exclude coverage for claims based upon the insured\u2019s ownership of the property upon which the injury occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>{\u00b6 26} The Whickers\u2019 claims in this case appear to be grounded on the theory that the Hunters failed to exercise control over Ashley\u2019s use of an ATV on the property. The complaint is devoid of any mention of the quality or condition of the land upon which the accident took place. Necessarily then, our inquiry must focus on the insureds\u2019 alleged negligence in permitting Ashley to operate the ATV in a negligent or reckless manner, which has no causal link to the quality or condition of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">{\u00b6 27} The simple fact that Ashley\u2019s misconduct took place on land is a matter of the law of gravity, not the law of insurance. As the court recognized in <em>Eyler, </em>\u201c[w]hile most of the endeavors of mankind occur upon the surface of the earth and without it, harm could not occur, the law nevertheless imposes liability for negligent personal conduct upon the recognition that, in most cases, human behavior is the primary cause of the harm and the condition on earth only secondary.\u201d 824 S.W.2d at 857. If the Whickers\u2019 complaint is based on the theory that the Hunters failed to properly supervise Ashley while she was on the Hunters\u2019 property and that that failure gave rise to Terrell\u2019s injuries, then the exclusion does not bar coverage in this case. But if the theory of negligent supervision is a subterfuge to avoid the \u201cother premises\u201d exclusion because the Whickers\u2019 claims are based on the Hunters\u2019 ownership of the property, then the coverage is not available. On the scant record before us, we cannot make that determination. Accordingly, we remand this cause to the trial court for further proceedings to ascertain the nature and factual basis for the Whickers\u2019 claims against the Hunters. On remand, the trial court should determine whether the Whickers\u2019 theory of liability is that the Hunters breached a personal duty that the Hunters assumed for the care and control of Terrell and Ashley, in which case the exclusion would not apply, or whether the Whickers\u2019 claims are based only on the fact that the Hunters owned the property where the injuries occurred, in which case the exclusion does apply. We do not believe that our holding in this case leaves insurers without means to restrict coverage. An insurer can use other exclusionary language to effectuate a broader bar to coverage. Indeed, other insurers evidently have done so for decades. <em>Hanson v. Gen. Acc. Fire &amp; Life Ins. Corp. </em>(Fla.App.1984), 450 So.2d 1260, 1261 (\u201cFor instance, it was noted in <em>Jackson v. Lajaunie, </em>270 So.2d 859 (La.1972), that a clause excluding accidents that happen \u2018in connection with\u2019 owned, but uninsured, premises excludes more broadly than a clause excluding accidents that \u2018arise of out of\u2019 such premises\u201d). Insurers are free to draft exclusions to more fully preclude coverage for occurrences like that at issue in this litigation, but the use of the causal phrase \u201carising out of\u201d in the exclusion is insufficient to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Pfeifer and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b679-5\">Cupp, J., concurs in syllabus and judgment.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b679-6\">Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, and Lanzinger, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b673-8\">. {\u00b6 a}The policy issued by Westfield states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-9\">{\u00b6 b}\u201cIf a claim is made or a suit brought against an insured for damages because of bodily injury * * * caused by an occurrence to which this coverage applies, we will:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-10\">{\u00b6 c}\u201cl.

I therefore concur only in the syllabus and judgment and write separately to explain my view of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">{\u00b6 29} In their decision-making, each of the lower courts relied heavily on the Eighth District\u2019s decision in <em>Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Turner </em>(1986), 29 Ohio App.3d 73, 29 OBR 83, 503 N.E.2d 212, to support the determination that in the policy at issue in this case, the exclusion for claims \u201carising out of\u201d the Hunters\u2019 Indiana premises applies to relieve appellee, Westfield Insurance Company, of the obligation to defend or indemnify the Hunters.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">{\u00b6 30} In my opinion, however, <em>Turner </em>is distinguishable from the situation presented here in a fundamental way. Rather than interpreting a policy <em>exclusion, </em>as exists in this case, <em>Turner </em>interpreted as a <em>coverage </em>provision a similar phrase at issue therein: \u201carising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of the real * * * property.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-11\">{\u00b6 31} In the area of liability-insurance law, very different standards apply to the interpretation of a coverage provision than apply to the interpretation of an exclusion, although both are construed against the insurer. A liability <em>coverage </em>provision is interpreted broadly, and a general presumption in favor of coverage must be overcome in order for coverage to be denied. See, e.g., <em>Stickovich v. Cleveland </em>(2001), 143 Ohio App.3d 13, 37, 757 N.E.2d 50 (recognizing that the phrase \u201c \u2018arising out of in a liability insurance policy affords very broad coverage\u201d and citing <em>Turner </em>as one of the cases that reached that conclusion).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-12\">{\u00b6 32} On the other hand, an <em>exclusion </em>is interpreted narrowly in order not to defeat coverage that would apply absent the exclusion. The general presumption in favor of coverage operates to make an exclusion barring coverage applicable only if it is clearly expressed. <em>Sharonville v. Am. Emps. Ins. Co., </em>109 Ohio St.3d 186, 2006-Ohio-2180, 846 N.E.2d 833, \u00b6 6. See 7 Russ &amp; Segalla, Couch on Insurance (3d Ed.2010), Section 101:52, which explains that when an insurance policy employs language such as \u201carising out of\u201d in describing the coverage provided, the phrase is given a broad and comprehensive meaning, but if the phrase is used \u201cin an exclusionary provision rather than a grant of coverage,\u201d it \u201cwill be interpreted narrowly against the insurer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>{\u00b6 33} Because the situation in <em>Turner </em>differs from the situation in this case (coverage in <em>Turner </em>versus exclusion of coverage here), I view <em>Turner </em>as inapposite to the case we now decide. Neither the trial court nor the court of appeals recognized this coverage-versus-exclusion distinction when each relied on Turner\u2019s analysis to support its ruling. In fact, <em>Turner </em>is inapplicable to the resolution of this case. In addition, the cases on motor vehicle insurance relied on by the lower courts are also inapposite for reasons that include the fact that they involved the interpretation of coverage provisions rather than exclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">{\u00b6 34} Because of the coverage-versus-exclusion distinction, the <em>Turner </em>decision, which involves an issue of coverage, and the Second District\u2019s decision in <em>Am. States Ins. Co. v. Guillermin </em>(1996), 108 Ohio App.3d 547, 671 N.E.2d 317, which involves an exclusion, are not in conflict with each other. The bottom line, then, is that it is evident that the courts below have relied on cases clearly distinguishable from the one now before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">{\u00b6 35} Because <em>Turner </em>and <em>Guillermin </em>are not conflicting decisions, the appellate decision in this case (which erroneously followed Turner) and <em>Guiller-min </em>are not truly in conflict either. I therefore do not approach this case from the perspective of answering the conflict issue as certified. However, any obstacles to resolving the issues of this case are obviated by the fact that this court accepted a discretionary appeal as well as the certified conflict, and therefore the issues are properly presented to us for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">{\u00b6 36} The key question to be resolved is whether the exclusion for claims arising out of the premises should apply to exclude coverage for the claims at issue under the Hunters\u2019 policy with Westfield. If the exclusion is inapplicable in the facts and circumstances involved here, then coverage exists under that policy pursuant to its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">{\u00b6 37} A Missouri appellate court in <em>Lititz Mut. Ins. Co. v. Branch </em>(Mo.App. 1977), 561 S.W.2d 371, 374, succinctly explained the proper scope of this exclusion as it relates to the essentials of a homeowner\u2019s policy in the following often cited passage:</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cThe personal liability insured against [by a homeowner\u2019s policy] is of two kinds: first, that liability which may be incurred because of the condition of the premises insured; secondly, that liability incurred by the insured personally because of his tortious personal conduct, not otherwise excluded, which may occur at any place on or off the insured premises. The insurance company may well limit (and has by [the relevant exclusion]) its liability for condition of the premises to the property insured for which a premium has been paid. It is reasonable that the company may not provide for liability coverage on \u2018conditions\u2019 which cause injury on other uninsured land. * * * It is to be expected, therefore, that the company\u2019s liability for condition of the premises would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>restricted to accidents happening on or in close proximity to the insured premises, and that premiums would be charged with that in mind. It would be unreasonable to allow an insured to expand that coverage to additional land and structures owned, rented or controlled by him which are unknown and not contemplated by the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cThe company has not chosen to geographically limit the coverage provided for tortious personal conduct of the insured. If it had so intended, it could simply have provided that the exclusion ran to an accident \u2018occurring on\u2019 other owned premises. There appears to be little reason to exclude personal tortious conduct occurring on owned but uninsured land, as little correlation exists between such conduct and the land itself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">{\u00b6 40} As this passage accurately points out, a standard homeowner\u2019s insurance policy, such as the Westfield policy at issue in this case, includes at least two essential types of liability coverage. One type is for occurrences that happen on or in close proximity to insured premises owned by the insured. A second type of liability coverage, distinct from the first type, is for tortious personal conduct. This second type not only applies to occurrences related to the insured premises, but also provides liability coverage to the insured anywhere, unless an exclusion in the policy clearly limits this broad personal liability coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">{\u00b6 41} This second type of homeowner\u2019s liability coverage covers \u201ca broad range of liabilities which have nothing to do with the insured\u2019s residence but to which most individuals are exposed as a matter of their routine existence. * * * [M]ost non-automobile related accidents * * * occurring away from the insured\u2019s residence, for which an insured is liable on account of negligence, will be covered under the liability provisions of a homeowners policy.\u201d 2 Rowland H. Long and Peter M. Lencsis, The Law of Liability Insurance (2008), Section 9.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">{\u00b6 42} I agree with the logic underlying the analysis in <em>Lititz Mut. Ins. Co. v. Branch, </em>which is consistent with the analysis in <em>Guillermin. I </em>am therefore in agreement with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the exclusion for claims arising out of the premises does not serve to defeat coverage for all occurrences on an insured\u2019s other owned property. Rather, it is the character or nature of the claim asserted for which coverage is sought that determines the scope of coverage. If coverage is sought for a claim that has no connection to a particular property other than that it happened to occur there, then the exclusion for claims arising out of the premises does not apply, because the claim does not \u201carise out of the premises\u201d but, instead, arises out of the unrelated conduct of the policyholder. On the other hand, if coverage is sought for a claim that has a direct causal relationship to the property, then the exclusion does apply. In the latter situation, the claim is essentially one of premises-based liability and falls within the scope of the exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>{\u00b6 43} In addition to the considerations regarding the quality or physical condition of the premises discussed in the above-quoted passage, the duties arising from ownership of the property can also, in some situations, correlate sufficiently with the claim asserted to support the exclusion\u2019s applicability. If the claim for which coverage is sought directly flows from or has its foundation in the ownership of the property for which the exclusion is asserted, then it may be said that the claim arises out of that property in such situations, too. A useful question to ask is: If the circumstances giving rise to the claim had taken place off both the other owned property and the policy\u2019s listed \u201cinsured location,\u201d would the exclusion apply to bar coverage? If the claim in such circumstances would not be excluded from coverage, then it also is likely that the exclusion would not apply to prevent coverage for the event that, by coincidence, occurred on the other owned property rather than someplace else.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">{\u00b6 44} The trial court resolved this case based on an overly expansive interpretation of the exclusion in the homeowner\u2019s policy for claims arising out of the other owned premises, and the court of appeals erroneously affirmed that overly expansive interpretation. The majority of this court, in reversing, correctly concludes that the exclusion should be interpreted more narrowly.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">{\u00b6 45} On the meager record in this case, it is impossible to determine whether the exclusion should apply here to bar coverage. The plaintiffs in the underlying lawsuit, the Whickers, assert in their merit brief before this court that the location of the accident was irrelevant to their claims and that \u201c[t]he accident could have happened anywhere other than the farm property and the claims against the Hunters would still be the same,\u201d in support of their argument that the exclusion at issue here does not bar coverage. Appellant, Grinnell Mutual Reinsurance Company, makes similar assertions in its merit brief, including stating that the allegations in the underlying complaint \u201cgo to the Hunters\u2019 conduct and status as people able to control a minor tortfeasor, not to their status as landowners.\u201d Conversely, appellee Westfield repeatedly asserts in its merit brief that the claims against the Hunters exist only because the Hunters owned the property where the accident occurred and that the exclusion should therefore apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">{\u00b6 46} The parties raised these same points before the trial court, but that court did not address this disagreement in granting summary judgment in favor of Westfield based on its overly broad interpretation of the exclusion. This case turns on that question, i.e., whether the claims arise out of the ownership of the premises. But the question is unanswerable from a review of the record before us. Therefore, upon remand, the record must be further developed to allow for consideration of the exclusion\u2019s applicability, under the standards that properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>govern the exclusion\u2019s reach.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b683-8\">. Appellant, Grinnell Mutual Reinsurance Company, attempts to argue through its second proposition of law in its merit brief in this court that the Indiana farm is an \u201cinsured location\u201d under the Westfield policy. However, this argument is outside the scope of the issue that the court of appeals certified a conflict on and that this court agreed to review, and it is also outside the scope of the only proposition of law raised by Grinnell in its memorandum in support of jurisdiction that this court accepted for review. Grinnell could have raised this issue for this court\u2019s jurisdictional consideration, but did not do so. Consequently, Grinnell has not properly preserved the issue regarding whether the farm is an insured location. It must therefore be accepted, as an established fact, that the farm is not an insured location for purposes of this appeal. Cf. <em>Meyer v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., </em>122 Ohio St.3d 104, 2009-Ohio-2463, 909 N.E.2d 106, \u00b6 8, fn. 3. Moreover, this fact should also be taken as established for purposes of the trial court\u2019s consideration upon remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b683-3\">O\u2019Donnell, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AqGW\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">{\u00b6 47} This matter is presented to us as a conflict between appellate districts on the following question: \u201cWhen construing an insurance policy exclusion, does an injury \u2018arise out\u2019 of a premises only if some dangerous condition exists on the premises that caused or contributed to the injury, or must the injury only originate in or have a causal connection with the premises?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">{\u00b6 48} The Second District Court of Appeals held in <em>Am. States Ins. Co. v. Guillermin </em>(1996), 108 Ohio App.3d 547, 671 N.E.2d 317, that an injury arises out of a premises only if some dangerous condition exists on the premises that caused or contributed to the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">{\u00b6 49} In conflict with that holding, the Twelfth District Court of Appeals here cited a case from the Eighth Appellate District, <em>Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Turner </em>(1986), 29 Ohio App.3d 73, 77, 29 OBR 83, 503 N.E.2d 212, which held, \u201c \u2018Arising out of \u2019 means generally \u2018flowing from\u2019 or \u2018having its origin in.\u2019 The phrase generally indicates a causal connection with the insured property, not that the insured premises be the proximate cause of the injury.\u201d (Citation omitted.) After recognizing federal court authority to the same effect, the Twelfth District used the causal connection test and determined that the ATV accident arose out of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">{\u00b6 50} The majority opinion correctly characterizes this case as one of contract interpretation of the phrase \u201carising out of\u201d; in my view, the Twelfth District Court of Appeals properly interpreted this phrase in this policy. That court stated, \u201cAs the policy reads, the exclusion applies to bodily injury \u2018arising out of a premises,\u2019 not arising out of a <em>condition on </em>a premises.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Hunter, </em>Butler App. Nos. CA2009-05-134 and CA2009-06-157, 2009-Ohio-5642, 2009 WL 3415894, \u00b6 20. The court emphasized that the view <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>taken in <em>Guillermin </em>changes the language in the policy to require that the injury must arise out of <em>a condition on </em>the premises, here, a dangerous condition. But these words are not part of the policy and not part of the contract \u2014 in effect, the court in <em>Guillermin </em>added additional language to the policy that is not part of the policy; the better view is as expressed by the appellate court here, citing the Eighth Appellate District and the federal district court of appeals, employing the causal connection test.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">{\u00b6 51} Although this is a matter of first impression for our court in the context of a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy, we have previously considered the phrase \u201carising out of \u201d in <em>Kish v. Cent. Nat. Ins. Group of Omaha </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 41, 21 O.O.3d 26, 424 N.E.2d 288, and in <em>Lattanzi v. Travelers Ins. Co. </em>(1995) 72 Ohio St.3d 350, 650 N.E.2d 430, and in both instances interpreted \u201carising out of\u201d to require a causal connection. In my view, we should adhere to our precedent and make a similar interpretation in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">{\u00b6 52} Because the majority strays from this path, I respectfully dissent and would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b684-8\">Lanzinger, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"aak-dedup-1\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">{\u00b6 53} I respectfully dissent. The exclusion within the insurance contract plainly states that there will be no coverage for \u201cbodily injury or property damage: * * * e. Arising out of a premises: (1) Owned by an insured * * * that is not an insured location.\u201d By modifying the phrase to read \u201carising] from the quality or condition of the premises\u201d owned by an insured, the majority rewrites the contract, circumvents the parties\u2019 intent, and creates an illogical result for similar language within the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">I. Expressed Intent of the Parties</p>\n<p id=\"b684-11\">{\u00b6 54} Michael and Marilyn Hunter purchased two policies. Westfield Insurance Company insured the Hunters\u2019 residence along with a rental property. Grinnell Mutual Reinsurance Company insured the Hunters\u2019 Indiana farm. Westfield\u2019s policy contained an exclusion from liability coverage for bodily injuries \u201c[a]rising out of a premises * * * [o]wned by an insured * * * that is not an insured location.\u201d Grinnell\u2019s policy contained a similar exclusion. The very existence of the two policies, each obtained by the Hunters to provide coverage for their respective premises, makes clear that the parties intended to exclude coverage for injuries occurring at premises they own that are not insured locations under the respective policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-12\">{\u00b6 55} We have held:</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>{\u00b6 56} \u201cWhen confronted with an issue of contractual interpretation, the role of a court is to give effect to the intent of the parties to the agreement. We examine the insurance contract as a whole and presume that the intent of the parties is reflected in the language used in the policy. We look to the plain and ordinary meaning of the language used in the policy unless another meaning is clearly apparent from the contents of the policy. When the language of a written contract is clear, a court may look no further than the writing itself to find the intent of the parties. As a matter of law, a contract is unambiguous if it can be given a definite legal meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">{\u00b6 57} \u201cOn the other hand, where a contract is ambiguous, a court may consider extrinsic evidence to ascertain the parties\u2019 intent. A court, however, is not permitted to alter a lawful contract by imputing an intent contrary to that expressed by the parties.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, at \u00b6 11-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">{\u00b6 58} I do not agree that the term \u201carising out of\u2019 is ambiguous. The court of appeals and two other courts have stated that \u201c \u2018 \u201c[a]rising out of \u201d means generally \u201cflowing from\u201d or \u201chaving its origin in\u201d \u2019 \u201d and that in order for coverage to be excluded, there need only be some causal link to the property rather than a showing that the premises were the proximate cause of the injury. <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Hunter, </em>2009-Ohio-5642, 2009 WL 3415894, \u00b6 12, quoting <em>Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Turner </em>(1986), 29 Ohio App.3d 73, 77, 29 OBR 83, 503 N.E.2d 212, quoting <em>Ins. Co. of N. Am. v. Royal Indemn. Co. </em>(C.A.6, 1970), 429 F.2d 1014, 1017.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">{\u00b6 59} The majority rejects this causal-connection definition, the lead opinion saying that it means that \u201cany claim for injury that occurs on premises owned by the insured other than the insured homeowner\u2019s primary residence would be denied, and the insured would not have liability coverage.\u201d Lead opinion, \u00b6 18. But that is exactly what was bargained for in this homeowner\u2019s policy. Westfield collected premiums for the premises listed on the declarations page, which also included rental property owned by the Hunters. Grinnell collected its premiums to provide coverage for the Hunters\u2019 Indiana farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">{\u00b6 60} The only reason the Hunters are being sued is that they own the Indiana farm property and allegedly breached a duty of care owed to the children on the property. The personal liability that is claimed arises out of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">{\u00b6 61} Insurance involves the transfer of risk from insured to insurer. Here Westfield agreed to assume the risk of liability for injuries occurring at, flowing from, having their origin in, or having a causal connection with the Hunters\u2019 Hamilton, Ohio residence or the neighboring rental property. Westfield was paid to assume those risks. Westfield further specified that it would not provide liability coverage for injuries arising out of other premises that were owned by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>the insureds but were not an insured location. Grinnell similarly agreed to assume risks of injuries occurring at, flowing from, having their origin in, or having a causal connection with the Hunters\u2019 Indiana farm while excluding injuries arising out of other premises owned by the insureds that are not an insured location, and Grinnell was paid premiums for that coverage. The complementary nature of these policies supports reading the plain language of the policies as providing coverage for injuries arising from the insured location and excluding coverage for injuries arising out of other premises owned by the insured that are not an insured location.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">II. Creation of Illogical Results</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">{\u00b662} The phrase \u201carising out of\u201d is used multiple times throughout the Westfield policy. By reading the phrase \u201carising out of \u201d to require proof that a dangerous condition on the land was the proximate cause of damage, the majority renders this phrase meaningless where it is used elsewhere in the policy. In fact, this term is used to introduce the following exclusions in Westfield\u2019s policy: business engaged in by the insured; a rental of premises by an insured; rendering of or failure to render professional services; ownership, maintenance, or use of a motorized vehicle, watercraft, or aircraft; transmission of a communicable disease; sexual molestation, corporal punishment, or physical or mental abuse; or the use, sale, or manufacture of a controlled substance. An interpretation of the term \u201carising out of \u201d to mean \u201carising out of a dangerous condition\u201d creates an illogical result for these other exclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">{\u00b6 63} Moreover, the Westfield policy explicitly limits its coverage for medical payments to conditions of the premises. In the policy\u2019s \u201cMedical Payments Coverage,\u201d on the very same page of the policy where the \u201cother owned premises\u201d exclusion appears, the policy provides: \u201cAs to others, this coverage applies only: * * * 2. To a person off the insured location, if the bodily injury: a. Arises out of a condition on the insured location or the ways immediately adjoining.\u201d Thus, the very language that the majority wishes to insert in one place within the policy has already been used by the parties elsewhere in the policy. This surely shows an intent to distinguish between \u201carising out of\u201d premises and \u201carising out of a condition on\u201d premises. If the exclusion was to be linked to a condition, the drafters added it; it should not be for this court to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">{\u00b6 64} I would answer the certified question by holding that in the context of an insurance policy exclusion, an injury arises out of premises if the injury originates in or has a causal connection with the premises. Here, the injury giving rise to the suit occurred at the Indiana farm, premises that the Hunters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>owned but did not insure with Westfield. The only basis for suit against them is their ownership and control of the farm. Any personal liability therefore arises out of the premises that are owned by the insureds and are not an insured location and are accordingly excluded from coverage under its policy. I would affirm the Twelfth District Court of Appeals and hold that Grinnell alone is obligated to defend and indemnify in this case.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AoB\">Isaac, Brant, Ledman &amp; Teetor, L.L.P., James H.
