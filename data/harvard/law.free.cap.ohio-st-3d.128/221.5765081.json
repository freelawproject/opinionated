Chapter 2744 governs political-subdivision immunity. Pursuant to R.C. 2744.02(C), orders denying employees of a political subdivision immunity from liability under any provision of law are final, appealable orders. R.C. 2744.01(D) defines the term \u201claw\u201d to include federal laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-14\">{\u00b6 3} R.C. 2744.09 sets forth exceptions to the applicability of R.C. Chapter 2744. Pursuant to R.C. 2744.09(E), the chapter does not apply to civil claims based upon alleged violations of the federal constitution or statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-15\">{\u00b6 4} R.C. 2744.02(C) and 2744.09(E) conflict inasmuch as the former specifically applies to immunity allowed under any provision of law, including federal law, while the latter precludes application of the chapter to civil actions premised on alleged violations of federal law. As the more recent and more specific statute, R.C. 2744.02(C) prevails over R.C. 2744.09(E). Accordingly, we hold that an order denying a motion for summary judgment in which an employee of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>political subdivision sought federal qualified immunity from claims brought under Section 1983, Title 42, U.S.Code is a final, appealable order pursuant to R.C. 2744.02(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Relevant Background</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">{\u00b6 5} Appellants Adam Pape and Corey Hall are police officers for appellant city of Forest Park, Ohio. On September 15, 2005, Officers Pape and Hall responded to a 9-1-1 telephone call from appellee, Leola Summerville, who reported that her husband, Roosevelt Summerville, may have committed suicide. Officer Pape saw Mr. Summerville stab himself in the chest multiple times with what looked like a knife. He ordered Mr. Summerville to stop stabbing himself, and when Mr. Summerville refused to comply with the order, Officer Pape deployed his taser. The taser did not subdue Mr. Summerville, who lunged at Officer Pape with the knife. Officers Pape and Hall simultaneously shot Mr. Summerville. He died as a result of the gunshot wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">{\u00b6 6} On September 6, 2007, Mrs. Summerville, individually and in her capacity as administrator of her husband\u2019s estate, filed a complaint against Forest Park, Police Chief Kenneth Hughes, and Officers Pape and Hall, asserting causes of action for (1) excessive use of force under Section 1983, (2) deliberate indifference in failing to provide adequate medical care under Section 1983, (3) deliberate indifference in failing to adequately train under Section 1983, (4) wrongful death under R.C. 2125.01, (5) negligent infliction of emotional distress, and (6) loss of consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">{\u00b6 7} Appellants and Police Chief Hughes moved for summary judgment on all claims. They argued that they were entitled to immunity on the state-law claims pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2744. Hughes, Pape, and Hall also claimed that they were entitled to federal qualified immunity<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for the alleged violations of Section 1983. Forest Park did not claim immunity relating to Summerville\u2019s Section 1983 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>claims. Instead, the city argued that the doctrine of respondeat superior did not apply, and therefore it was not liable for the officers\u2019 conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">{\u00b6 8} The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellants on the state-law claims and the Section 1983 claim for deliberate indifference in failing to provide adequate medical care. The court also granted summary judgment in favor of Police Chief Hughes on all claims. The trial court denied summary judgment to Officers Pape and Hall with respect to Summerville\u2019s Section 1983 claim for excessive force and to the city on the Section 1983 claim for deliberate indifference in failing to adequately train.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">{\u00b6 9} Appellants appealed the trial court\u2019s denial of summary judgment on the Section 1983 claims to the First District Court of Appeals. The notice of appeal was filed pursuant to the authority of R.C. 2744.02(C), because the appeal related to the denial of qualified immunity to Officers Pape and Hall. The city requested that the court of appeals exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction over its claimed errors because \u201cthe issues involving the City of Forest Park\u2019s appeal [were] inextricably intertwined with the issues relating to the appeal of defendants, Adam Pape and Corey Hall.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">{\u00b6 10} Summerville moved to dismiss the appeal. She argued that R.C. Chapter 2744 did not apply to claims brought pursuant to Section 1983, and therefore, the trial court\u2019s denial of summary judgment was not a final, appeal-able order. The court of appeals granted Summerville\u2019s motion and dismissed the appeal without issuing an opinion. We accepted discretionary review of appellants\u2019 sole proposition of law, which states: \u201cA trial court\u2019s decision overruling a Motion for Summary Judgment in which a political subdivision or its employee sought immunity from claims brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 is an order denying \u2018the benefit of an alleged immunity\u2019 and is, therefore, a final appealable order under R.C. 2744.02(C).\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Summerville v. Forest Park, 124 </em>Ohio St.3d 1473, 2010-Ohio-354, 921 N.E.2d 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c \u2018It is well-established that an order must be final before it can be reviewed by an appellate court. If an order is not final, then an appellate court has no jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hubbell v. Xenia, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 77, 2007-Ohio-4839, 873 N.E.2d 878, \u00b6 9, quoting <em>Gen. Acc. Ins. Co. v. Ins. Co. of N. Am. </em>(1989), 44 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>St.3d 17, 20, 540 N.E.2d 266. The denial of summary judgment generally is not a final, appealable order. Id., citing <em>State ex rel. Overmeyer v. Walinski </em>(1966), 8 Ohio St.2d 23, 24, 37 O.O.2d 358, 222 N.E.2d 312. However, appellants argue that pursuant to R.C. 2744.02(C), the denial of a motion for summary judgment in which a political subdivision or its employee sought federal qualified immunity from claims brought under Section 1983 is a final, appealable order and, therefore, is an exception to the general rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">{\u00b6 12} Under R.C. 2744.02(C), \u201c[a]n order that denies a political subdivision or an employee of a political subdivision the benefit of an alleged immunity from liability as provided in this chapter or any other provision of the law is a final order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">{\u00b6 13} In <em>Hubbell, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 77, 2007-Ohio-4839, 873 N.E.2d 878, at \u00b6 2, we held that pursuant to R.C. 2744.02(C), \u201cwhen a political subdivision or its employee seeks immunity, an order that denies the benefit of an alleged immunity is a final, appealable order.\u201d In that case, we reversed the dismissal of an appeal from the denial of summary judgment on a claim of state-law immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">{\u00b6 14} We expanded upon <em>Hubbell </em>in <em>Sullivan v. Anderson Twp., </em>122 Ohio St.3d 83, 2009-Ohio-1971, 909 N.E.2d 88, stating: \u201cR.C. 2744.02(C) * * * makes final an order denying a political subdivision the benefit of an alleged immunity from liability. * * * Therefore, there is no reason for a trial court to certify under Civ.R. 54(B) that \u2018there is no just cause for delay.\u2019 When the denial of political-subdivision immunity is concerned, the trial court has no discretion to determine whether to separate claims or parties and permit an interlocutory appeal.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 12, citing <em>Hubbell </em>at \u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">{\u00b6 15} Although <em>Hubbell </em>and <em>Sullivan </em>involved state-law immunity, R.C. 2744.02(C) expressly applies to the denial of the benefit of an alleged immunity as provided in any provision of law. R.C. 2744.01(D) defines the term \u201claw\u201d for purposes of R.C. Chapter 2744 and provides that \u201claw\u201d means \u201cany provision of the constitution, statutes, or rules of the United States or of this state.\u201d Accordingly, the express terms of R.C. 2744.01(D) and 2744.02(C) render the denial of immunity afforded under state or federal law a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">{\u00b6 16} However, pursuant to R.C. 2744.09(E), R.C. Chapter 2744 does not apply to \u201c[cjivil claims based upon alleged violations of the constitution or statutes of the United States, except that the provisions of section 2744.07 of the Revised Code shall apply to such claims or related civil actions.\u201d This case involves a civil action, and the allegations in question are based upon federal law-Section 1983. And Officers Pape and Hall claim federal qualified immunity. Appellee argues that because R.C. 2744.09(E) renders R.C. Chapter 2744 inapplicable to civil actions based on alleged violations of federal laws, R.C. 2744.02(C) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>does not apply, and the trial court\u2019s denial of appellants\u2019 motion for summary judgment is not a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">{\u00b6 17} We must construe the statutes to determine whether R.C. 2744.09(E) renders R.C. 2744.02(C) inapplicable to this case. We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">\n<em>Statutory Interpretation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cWe must first look to the plain language of the statute itself to determine the legislative intent.\u201d <em>Hubbell, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 77, 2007-Ohio-4839, 873 N.E.2d 878, \u00b6 11, citing <em>State ex rel. Burrows v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 78, 81, 676 N.E.2d 519. \u201cWe apply a statute as it is written when its meaning is unambiguous and definite.\u201d Id., citing <em>Portage Cty. Bd. of Commrs. v. Akron, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 106, 2006-Ohio-954, 846 N.E.2d 478, \u00b6 52; see also <em>State ex rel. Savarese v. Buckeye Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 543, 545, 660 N.E.2d 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cHowever, where a statute is found to be subject to various interpretations, a court called upon to interpret its provisions may invoke rules of statutory construction in order to arrive at legislative intent.\u201d <em>Cline v. Ohio Bur. of Motor Vehicles </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 93, 96, 573 N.E.2d 77, citing <em>Meeks v. Papadopulos </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 187, 190, 16 O.O.3d 212, 404 N.E.2d 159. \u201cThe primary rule in statutory construction is to give effect to the legislature\u2019s intention.\u201d Id. at 97, 573 N.E.2d 77, citing <em>Carter v. Youngstown </em>(1946), 146 Ohio St. 203, 32 O.O.184, 65 N.E.2d 63, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">\n<em>R.C. 2711.02(C) and R.C. 2711.09(E) Conflict</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">{\u00b6 20} The parties argue that the statutory provisions in this case are clear and unambiguous. However, each side sets forth a conflicting interpretation of the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">{\u00b6 21} Appellants argue that R.C. 2744.02(C) clearly allows an immediate appeal from the denial of immunity pursuant to any provision of the law, including federal laws. They argue that if the General Assembly had intended that R.C. 2744.02(C) apply only to the denial of immunity pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2744, it would not have added the language \u201cor any other provision of the law\u201d to that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">{\u00b6 22} Conversely, appellee argues that R.C. 2744.09(E) plainly forbids the application of R.C. Chapter 2744, including R.C. 2744.09(C), to civil claims brought pursuant to federal law and, therefore, the denial of federal qualified immunity is not a final, appealable order. Appellee contends that the clarity of the statutory scheme is evidenced by the fact that appellate courts across Ohio have uniformly refused to apply R.C. Chapter 2744 to federal causes of action under Section 1983. <em>W.P. v. Dayton, </em>Montgomery App. No. 22549, 2009-Ohio-52, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>2009 WL 50150, \u00b6 12; <em>Campbell v. Youngstown, </em>Mahoning App. No. 06 MA 184, 2007-Ohio-7219, 2007 WL 4696963, \u00b6 15; and <em>Patton v. Wood Cty. Humane Soc., </em>154 Ohio App.3d 670, 2003-Ohio-5200, 798 N.E.2d 676, \u00b6 33. Appellee correctly notes that pursuant to R.C. 2744.09(E), the courts of appeals in these cases refused to grant immunity under R.C. Chapter 2744 in actions alleging violations of federal rights that were brought under Section 1983. However, these cases are inapposite because they deal with the grant of immunity. These cases did not consider the interplay between R.C. 2744.02(C) and 2744.09(E) for determining whether the denial of immunity is a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">{\u00b6 23} Moreover, contrary to appellee\u2019s argument, Ohio courts of appeals have applied R.C. 2744.02(C) as authority to review denials of immunity in relation to claims brought under Section 1983. See <em>Hunt v. Morrow Cty., </em>Morrow App. No. 08 CA 13, 2009-Ohio-4313, 2009 WL 2602204, \u00b6 22-23, 53-61 (noting that the trial court\u2019s denial of summary judgment was a final, appealable order pursuant to R.C. 2744.02(C) and reversing the trial court\u2019s denial of summary judgment based on the appellants\u2019 claim of qualified immunity for alleged violations of Section 1983); <em>Paul C. Harger Trust v. Morrow Cty. Regional Planning Comm., </em>Morrow App. No. 03-CA-19, 2004-Ohio-6643, 2004 WL 2847797, \u00b6 24, 29-30 (stating that the trial court\u2019s denial of the appellants\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings was final and appealable pursuant to R.C. 2744.02(C), but affirming the denial because under R.C. 2744.09(E), appellants were not entitled to state-law immunity on the appellees\u2019 Section 1983 claims); <em>Chaney v. Norwood, </em>189 Ohio App.3d 124, 2010-Ohio-3434, 937 N.E.2d 634, \u00b6 3, 9 (concluding that the court had jurisdiction over the appeal because pursuant to R.C. 2744.02(C), the denial of appellants\u2019 motion for summary judgment was a final, appealable order and holding that because the appellees\u2019 complaint alleged federal claims, including alleged violations of Section 1983, the appellants were not entitled to state-law immunity pursuant to R.C. 2744.09(E)). However, like the cases cited by appellee, these courts did not expressly consider the interplay between R.C. 2744.02(C) and 2744.09(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">{\u00b624} \u201cIt is a well-settled rule of statutory interpretation that statutory provisions be construed together and the Revised Code be read as an interrelated body of law.\u201d <em>State v. Moaning </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 126, 128, 666 N.E.2d 1115. When construed together, R.C. 2744.02(C) and 2744.09(E) conflict. Accordingly, we must resort to statutory interpretation and construe the statutes so as to give effect to the legislature\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">\n<em>The More Recent and Specific Statute Prevails</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">{\u00b6 25} Appellants argue that as the more recent and more specific statute, R.C. 2744.02(C) prevails over R.C. 2744.09(E). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>{\u00b6 26} \u201cUtilizing the rules of statutory construction contained in R.C. 1.12,1.51, and 1.52, a specific statute, enacted later in time than a preexisting general statute, will control where a conflict between the two arises.\u201d <em>Davis v. State Personnel Bd. of Rev. </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 102, 105, 18 O.O.3d 345, 413 N.E.2d 816.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">{\u00b6 27} Pursuant to R.C. 1.51, \u201c[i]f a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision, they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general provision prevail.\u201d R.C. 1.52(A) provides: \u201cIf statutes enacted at the same or different sessions of the legislature are irreconcilable, the statute latest in date of enactment prevails.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">{\u00b628} We have already determined that a conflict exists between R.C. 2744.02(C) and 2744.09(E). R.C. 1.51 requires that initially, we attempt to reconcile the statutes, if possible, to give effect to both. <em>In re Petition to Annex 320 Acres to S. Lebanon </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 585, 594, 597 N.E.2d 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">{\u00b6 29} Appellants attempt to reconcile the statutes by arguing that R.C. 2477.09(E) means only that the immunities set forth in R.C. Chapter 2744 do not apply to federal claims and that the section does not apply to procedural dictates set forth in the chapter, including the final-and-appealable-order provision contained in R.C. 2744.02(C). Appellants\u2019 argument ignores the clear statutory language in R.C. 2477.09(E) that states that the entire chapter (with the exception of R.C. 2744.07<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>) does not apply to civil actions based on alleged violations of federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">{\u00b6 30} Appellee attempts to harmonize the provisions by explaining that although R.C. 2744.02(C) will generally render orders denying alleged immunity to political subdivisions and their employees immediately appealable, the provision does not apply to the class of cases that the General Assembly excluded from the dictates of R.C. Chapter 2744 by virtue of the language in R.C. 2744.09. Appellee contends that such an interpretation would not render meaningless the \u201cany other provision of the law\u201d language in R.C. 2744.02(C), because \u201cfederal claims are far from the only potential source of immunity from liability for political subdivisions.\u201d By way of example, appellee cites R.C. 2305.34 (providing immunity from certain tort liability for water-supply operators) and R.C. 2305.39 (providing immunity from liability for damages by persons responding to oil discharges). Appellee\u2019s attempt to reconcile the statutes fails. Appellee\u2019s inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>pretation of the statutes would preclude application of R.C. 2744.02(C) to claims brought under federal law. This interpretation ignores the fact that R.C. 2744.02(C) expressly applies to immunity available under any provision of law and that R.C. 2744.01(D) defines the term \u201claw\u201d to include federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">{\u00b6 31} By virtue of the definition set forth in R.C. 2744.01(D), R.C. 2744.02(C) expressly applies to the denial of immunity under federal law. At the same time, R.C. 2744.09(E) forbids the application of the chapter (including R.C. 2744.02(C) and 2744.01(D)) to civil actions based on federal law. These statutes cannot be reconciled and applied so as to give effect to both. Accordingly, we must continue with the analysis under R.C. 1.51 and 1.52.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">{\u00b6 32} Applying the rules of statutory construction set forth in R.C. 1.51 and 1.52, we note that a specific statute will prevail unless the general statute can be shown to be the later adoption of the two and the manifest intent of the General Assembly was to have the general provision control. <em>In re Petition to Annex, </em>64 Ohio St.3d at 594, 597 N.E.2d 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">{\u00b6 33} R.C. 2744.02(C) is both the more recent and the more specific statutory provision. R.C. 2744.02(C) was enacted in 2003.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Am.Sub.S.B. No. 106, 149 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3500. R.C. 2744.09(E) was enacted almost two decades earlier, in 1985. Am.Sub.H.B. No. 176, 141 Ohio Laws, Part I, 1699. Further, R.C. 2744.09(E) generally states that the chapter does not apply to any civil action based on alleged violations of federal law; by contrast, R.C. 2744.02(C) specifically provides that an order denying an employee of a political subdivision the benefit of an alleged immunity from liability under any provision of law (including federal law by virtue of R.C. 2744.01(D)) is a final, appealable order. Pursuant to R.C. 1.51 and 1.52, as the more recent and specific statute, R.C. 2744.02(C) prevails. Accordingly, a trial court\u2019s decision denying a motion for summary judgment in which an employee of a political subdivision sought qualified immunity from claims brought pursuant to Section 1983 is a final, appealable order under R.C. 2744.02(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">\n<em>The Maxim Expressio Unius Est Exclusio Alterius Does Not Apply</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">{\u00b6 34} Appellee argues that under the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius, a statute that specifies one exception to a general rule is assumed to exclude all other exceptions. See <em>Thomas v. Freeman </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 221, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>224-225, 680 N.E.2d 997. Applying this maxim, appellee argues that because R.C. 2744.09 lists one exception to the rule that R.C. Chapter 2744 does not apply to civil claims based upon alleged violations of federal law \u2014 that the provisions of R.C. 2744.07 apply to such claims \u2014 the General Assembly\u2019s failure to list any other exceptions illustrates its intent that no other exceptions apply to the general prohibition. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c[T]he canon <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>does not apply to every statutory listing or grouping; it has force only when the items expressed are members of an \u2018associated group or series,\u2019 justifying the inference that items not mentioned were excluded by deliberate choice, not inadvertence.\u201d <em>Barnhart v. Peabody Coal Co. </em>(2003), 537 U.S. 149, 168, 123 S.Ct. 748, 154 L.Ed.2d 653, citing <em>United States v. Vonn </em>(2002), 535 U.S. 55, 65, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90. The United States Supreme Court explained in <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Echazabal </em>(2002), 536 U.S. 73, 81, 122 S.Ct. 2045, 153 L.Ed.2d 82:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cJust as statutory language suggesting exclusiveness is missing, so is that essential extrastatutory ingredient of an expression-exclusion demonstration, the series of terms from which an omission bespeaks a negative implication. The canon depends on identifying a series of two or more terms or things that should be understood to go hand in hand, which is abridged in circumstances supporting a sensible inference that the term left out must have been meant to be excluded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">{\u00b6 37} We are not persuaded by appellee\u2019s argument that by including one exception to the broad language in R.C. 2744.09(E), the legislature intended to preclude all other exceptions. R.C. 2744.09(E) does not contain a series of exceptions that illustrates the General Assembly\u2019s intent that terms left out must have been intentionally excluded. Further, R.C. 2744.02(C) was enacted almost two decades after R.C. 2744.09(E). The legislature did not specifically exclude R.C. 2744.02(C) from the prohibition of R.C. 2744.09(E), because the provision did not yet exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">\n<em>Legislative Policy Considerations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">{\u00b6 38} Our holding is consistent with legislative policy considerations. The General Assembly enacted R.C. Chapter 2744, stating that \u201cthe protections afforded to political subdivisions and employees of political subdivisions by this act are urgently needed in order to ensure the continued orderly operation of local governments and the continued ability of local governments to provide public peace, health, and safety services to their residents.\u201d Am.Sub.H.B. No. 176, Section 8, 141 Ohio Laws, Part 1,1733. We noted in <em>Hubbell, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 77, 2007-Ohio-4839, 873 N.E.2d 878, that \u201c \u2018[t]he manifest statutory purpose of R.C. Chapter 2744 is the preservation of the fiscal integrity of political subdivisions.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 23, quoting <em>Wilson v. Stark Cty. Dept. of Human Servs. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 450, 453, 639 N.E.2d 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>{\u00b6 39} We also note that judicial economy is better served by a plain reading of R.C. 2744.02(C). Id. at \u00b6 24. \u201c \u2018[Djetermination of whether a political subdivision is immune from liability is usually pivotal to the ultimate outcome of a lawsuit. Early resolution of the issue of whether a political subdivision is immune from liability pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2744 is beneficial to both of the parties. If the appellate court holds that the political subdivision is immune, the litigation can come to an early end, with the same outcome that otherwise would have been reached only after trial, resulting in a savings to all parties of costs and attorney fees. Alternatively, if the appellate court holds that immunity does <em>not </em>apply, that early finding will encourage the political subdivision to settle promptly with the victim rather than pursue a lengthy trial and appeals. Under either scenario, both the plaintiff and the political subdivision may save the time, effort, and expense of a trial and appeal, which could take years.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. at \u00b6 25, quoting <em>Burger v. Cleveland Hts. </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 188, 199-200, 718 N.E.2d 912 (Lundberg Stratton, J., dissenting). \u201c \u2018As the General Assembly envisioned, the determination of immunity could be made prior to investing the time, effort, and expense of the courts, attorneys, parties, and witnesses * * *.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 26, quoting <em>Burger </em>at 200 (Lundberg Stratton, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">{\u00b6 40} These policy considerations apply equally whether the immunity in question is based on R.C. Chapter 2744 or another provision of the law, including federal qualified immunity. Indeed, federal courts have applied a similar rationale in holding that orders denying a public official the benefit of qualified immunity are final and appealable. See, e.g., <em>Mitchell v. Forsyth </em>(1985), 472 U.S. 511, 525-530, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411. Qualified immunity \u201cis an <em>iwinunity from suit </em>rather than a mere defense to liability; * * * it is effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. at 526. Qualified immunity provides immunity not only from liability but from the \u201cconsequences\u201d of a suit, including \u201c \u2018the general costs of subjecting officials to the risks of trial \u2014 distraction of officials from their governmental duties, inhibition of discretionary action, and deterrence of able people from public service.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald </em>(1982), 457 U.S. 800, 816, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396. Failure to give effect to the language of R.C. 2744.02(C) by barring immediate appeal of denials of qualified immunity for alleged violations of Section 1983 would defeat the purpose for which the immunity exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">{\u00b6 41} Pursuant to R.C. 2744.02(C), an order that denies an employee of a political subdivision immunity from liability under any provision of law is a final order. Although this section conflicts with R.C. 2744.09(E), R.C. 2744.02(C) prevails as the more recent and specific statute. Accordingly, an order denying a motion for summary judgment in which a political subdivision or its employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>sought federal qualified immunity from claims brought under Section 1983 is a final, appealable order pursuant to R.C. 2744.02(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">{\u00b6 42} The court of appeals erred in dismissing the officers\u2019 appeal.

In addition to the proposition of law that this court accepted for review, appellants now ask us to adopt the pendent-appellate-jurisdiction doctrine to allow immediate appeals of claims against municipal defendants when they are closely intertwined with the claims of qualified immunity.

Because the statute governing the appealability of an order denying a political subdivision or its employee the benefit of immunity from liability does not apply to civil claims based upon alleged violations of federal statutes, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">{\u00b6 44} R.C. 2744.02(C) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-11\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cAn order that denies a political subdivision or an employee of a political subdivision the benefit of an alleged immunity from liability as provided in this chapter or any other provision of the law is a final order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-12\">{\u00b6 46} Appellants claim that the phrase, \u201cor any other provision of the law,\u201d means that the statute applies to actions brought under federal law, including Section 1983 actions in Ohio courts. Appellants bolster their argument with the definition of \u201claws\u201d in R.C. 2744.01(D), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-13\">{\u00b6 47} \u201c \u2018Law5 means any provision of the constitution, statutes, or rules of the United States or of this state * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-14\">{\u00b6 48} Thus, according to appellants, the phrase \u201cor any other provision of the law\u201d in R.C. 2744.02(C) expressly includes federal laws, such as Section 1983, by operation of the definition of \u201claw\u201d in R.C. 2744.01(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-15\">{\u00b6 49} However, R.C. 2744.09(E) prohibits application of any statute in R.C. Chapter 2744, including R.C. 2744.02(C), to a cause of action under federal law, such as the federal statutory causes of action at issue here. R.C. 2744.09(E) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-16\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cThis chapter does not apply to, and shall not be construed to apply to, the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqZ\">{\u00b6 51} \u201c ***</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>{\u00b6 52} \u201c(E) Civil claims based upon alleged violations of the constitution or statutes of the United States, except that the provisions of section 2744.07 of the Revised Code shall apply to such claims or related civil actions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">{\u00b6 53} Thus, under the express terms of R.C. 2744.09, the chapter does not apply to claims brought under federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">{\u00b6 54} I recognize that there is a tension between these two statutes, but unlike the majority, I do not find these two statutes irreconcilable. A reasonable construction of these two statutes would be a harmonizing construction, under which an order denying immunity may be appealed immediately under R.C. Chapter 2744 or any other provision of law, except those provisions expressly exempted from the chapter by R.C. 2744.09(E). Accordingly, R.C. Chapter 2744 and its procedural dictates do not apply to civil claims based upon alleged violations of federal constitutional or statutory law. This reading is reasonable, harmonizes both statutes, and avoids the majority\u2019s resort to a rule of statutory construction that renders the language of R.C. 2744.09(E) meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">{\u00b6 55} Accordingly, we should apply the ordinary rules regarding final, appeal-able orders to this case. For an order to be appealable, it must satisfy both R.C. 2505.02 and Civ.R. 54. Under the general rules, a court of appeals first applies R.C. 2505.02(B)(1) to determine whether the order \u201caffects a substantial right and whether it in effect determines an action and prevents a judgment.\u201d <em>Wisintainer v. Elcen Power Strut Co. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 352, 354, 617 N.E.2d 1136. If the trial court order is determined to be \u201cfinal\u201d under R.C. 2505.02, the court of appeals looks for certifying language from the trial court as required by Civ.R. 54(B) that \u201cthere is no just reason for delay.\u201d Id. The trial court\u2019s use of Civ.R. 54(B) certification is a matter of discretion. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">{\u00b6 56} The order in this case is not a final order under R.C. 2505.02 and Civ.R. 54, because it is lacking the certification required by Civ.R. 54. Thus, it fails to meet the procedural criteria of the final order analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">{\u00b6 57} And the order fails to qualify in substance as a final order under R.C. 2505.02 as well. As a number of courts of appeals have already determined, an order denying qualified immunity under Section 1983 on a motion for summary judgment is not a final order, because it \u201cmerely postpones the final disposition of both the immunity claim and the merits of the case until trial.\u201d <em>Martynyszyn v. Budd, </em>7th Dist. No. 03-MA-250, 2004-Ohio-4824, 2004 WL 2029320, \u00b6 17; <em>Ohio Civ. Serv. Emp. Assn. v. Moritz </em>(1987), 39 Ohio App.3d 132, 133, 529 N.E.2d 1290; <em>Shane v. Tracy, </em>(Aug. 24, 2000), 8th Dist. No. 77025, 2000 WL 1222016. Thus, the order is not final under R.C. 2505.02(B)(1), because it does not \u201cdetermine} ] the action and prevent} ] a judgment.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Adr\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Law Offices of Marc Mezibov and Marc D.

In my view, the phrase \u201cany other provision of the law\u201d in R.C. 2744.02(C) is limited to those provisions of law that apply to the chapter under R.C. 2744.09(E).
