The appellants, the Office of the Ohio Consumers\u2019 Counsel (\u201cOCC\u201d) and Industrial Energy Users-Ohio (\u201cIEU\u201d), raise 13 propositions of law. We hold that the commission committed reversible error on three grounds, affirm on all other issues, and remand the order to the commission for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>I. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">{\u00b6 2} In 2008, the General Assembly enacted Senate Bill 221, 2008 Am.Sub.S.B. No. 221 (\u201cS.B. 221\u201d), which substantially revised the regulation of electric service in Ohio. Before S.B. 221, there was Senate Bill 3. Adopted in 1999, Senate Bill 3, 148 Ohio Laws, Part IV, 7962, was designed \u201cto facilitate and encourage development of competition in the retail electric market.\u201d <em>AK Steel Corp. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(2002), 95 Ohio St.3d 81, 765 N.E.2d 862. Competition, however, \u201cfail[ed] * * * to develop according to expectations.\u201d <em>Ohio Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>114 Ohio St.3d 340, 2007-Ohio-4276, 872 N.E.2d 269, \u00b6 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">{\u00b6 3} This failure followed a nationwide trend. Soon after several states passed deregulatory laws, \u201ctwo tumultuous events \u2014 the crisis of electric power in California and the collapse of the world\u2019s largest electric trading corporation, Enron\u201d \u2014 \u201ccast something of a cloud over the deregulation movement, which had been almost the signature cause of the 1980s and 1990s.\u201d Cudahy, Whither Deregulation: A Look at the Portents (2001), 58 N.Y.U. Ann.Surv.Am.Law 155, 155. Beyond these particular crises, \u201cthe cost of generating power increased significantly, due primarily to increases in the costs of the underlying fuel sources.\u201d Van Nostrand, Constitutional Limitations on the Ability of States to Rehabilitate Their Failed Electric Utility Restructuring Plans (2008), 31 Seattle U.L.Rev. 593, 593-594. Several states experimenting with deregulation found, as did Ohio, that \u201cthe anticipated competition did not develop.\u201d Id. at 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">{\u00b6 4} Faced with a lack of competition, rising electricity prices, and unpalatable market-based rates, the commission and utilities responded with various rate plans not expressly contemplated by statute. In reviewing these plans, we recognized the possibility that additional legislative action might be required. In <em>Ohio Consumers\u2019 Counsel, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 340, 2007-Ohio-4276, 872 N.E.2d 269, \u00b6 41, we observed, \u201c[A]s we continue to see the rate-stabilization plans appealed from the commission, we presume that the commission is sharing its evaluations and reports on the effectiveness of competition with the legislature, * * * so that it can continue to evaluate the need for further legislative action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">{\u00b6 5} \u201c[F]urther legislative action\u201d arrived with S.B. 221. The bill addressed several areas of concern with electric markets. Pertinent here, it established new standards to govern generation rates. See R.C. 4928.141 through 4928.144. Broadly speaking, the new regulatory regime requires electric-distribution utilities to provide consumers with \u201ca standard service offer of all competitive retail electric services necessary to maintain essential electric service to consumers, including a firm supply of electric generation service.\u201d R.C. 4928.141(A). The utility may provide the offer in one of two ways: through a \u201cmarket-rate offer\u201d under R.C. 4928.142 or through an \u201celectric security plan\u201d under R.C. 4928.143. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>The market-rate offer, as the name implies, sets rates using a competitive-bidding process to harness market forces.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">{\u00b6 6} AEP applied for the second option, an electric security plan (\u201cESP\u201d). It filed its application on July 31, 2008, and multiple parties intervened. A hearing was held from November to December 2008, briefing was completed over the holidays, and on March 18, 2009, the commission issued a 77-page opinion and order modifying and approving the plan. Two rounds of rehearing applications followed, resolved by entries on July 23 and November 4. OCC and IEU appealed. AEP has intervened in support of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">{\u00b6 7} The appellants have raised 13 propositions of law, which we have reduced to ten issues. We begin with the three issues in which the appellants have demonstrated error.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">\n<em>A. OCC Propositions of Law 1, 2, and 3: The commission violated the law by granting a retroactive rate increase, but OCC is not entitled to a monetary refund</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">(\u00b6 8} In its first three propositions of law, OCC argues that the commission unlawfully granted AEP a $63 million retroactive rate increase, in violation of R.C. 4928.141(A), as well as the rule established in <em>Keco Industries, Inc. v. Cincinnati &amp; Suburban Bell Tel. Co. </em>(1957), 166 Ohio St. 254, 2 O.O.2d 85, 141 N.E.2d 465. We agree with OCC on the merits: the commission unlawfully granted a retroactive rate increase. For reasons discussed, however, OCC has not established that it is entitled to its requested remedy of a refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">\n<em>1. The commission unlawfully granted AEP a retroactive rate increase</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">{\u00b6 9} AEP had sought a rate increase effective January 2009, but the commission did not issue an order until mid-March. Thus, from January through March, AEP collected less revenue than it would have if the application had been approved before January 1. In response to this delay in rate relief, the commission set AEP\u2019s rates at a level \u201cintended to permit the companies to recover 12 months of revenue over a 9-month period.\u201d The additional increase totaled $63 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">{\u00b6 10} This was retroactive ratemaking. Although the commission did not authorize AEP to rebill customers for usage from January through March, it reached the same financial result by setting rates from April through December 2009 at a level sufficient to recover lost revenues from January through March. In AEP\u2019s words, \u201cthe Commission\u2019s decision * * * yield[s] a similar financial impact as would have occurred if a decision had been issued by December 28, 2008 * * *.\u201d By approving rates that recouped losses due to past regulatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>delay, the commission violated this court\u2019s case law on retroactive ratemaking, as well as provisions of S.B. 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">{\u00b6 11} A rate increase making up for revenues lost due to regulatory delay is precisely the action that we found contrary to law in <em>Keco. </em>\u201c[A] utility may not charge increased rates during proceedings before the commission seeking same[,] and losses sustained thereby\u201d \u2014 that is, while the case is pending \u2014 \u201cmay not be recouped.\u201d <em>Keco, </em>166 Ohio St. at 259, 2 O.O.2d 85, 141 N.E.2d 465. Likewise, in <em>Lucas Cty. Commrs. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 344, 348, 686 N.E.2d 501, we ruled that \u201cutility ratemaking * * * is prospective only\u201d and that R.C. Title 49 \u201cprohibit[s] utilities from charging increased rates during the pendency of commission proceedings and appeals.\u201d Id. These cases make plain that present rates may not make up for dollars lost \u201cduring the pendency of commission proceedings.\u201d Id. That is exactly what occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">{\u00b6 12} The appellees respond by arguing that Keco\u2019s rule does not apply in proceedings under the new statutes of S.B. 221. We need not decide whether <em>Keco </em>continues to apply, as the ruling also violates a provision of S.B. 221 itself, under R.C. 4928.141(A). That section specifically prescribes the applicable rates if a new standard service offer has not been approved by January 1, 2009: preexisting rates <em>\u201cshall </em>continue * * * until a standard service offer is first authorized under section * * * 4928.143.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 4928.141(A); see R.C. 4928.01(A)(33) (\u201c \u2018Rate plan\u2019 means the standard service offer in effect on the effective date of the amendment of this section by S.B. 221 of the 127th general assembly, July 31, 2008\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">{\u00b6 13} This section rules out retroactive rate increases. The requirement to continue existing rates is mandatory. Although the statute does not expressly prohibit a retroactive rate increase, the express remedy (to \u201ccontinue\u201d existing rates until new rates are approved) rules out nonexpress remedies (such as tracking and restoring the difference between old and new rates if approval is delayed). See, e.g., <em>Myers v. Toledo, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 218, 2006-Ohio-4353, 852 N.E.2d 1176, \u00b6 24 (\u201cthe express inclusion of one thing implies the exclusion of the other\u201d). This statutory and case law concerning retroactive ratemaking spans nearly 50 years. Cf. <em>Clark v. Scarpelli </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 271, 278, 744 N.E.2d 719 (\u201cIt is presumed that the General Assembly is fully aware of any prior judicial interpretation of an existing statute when enacting an amendment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">{\u00b6 14} Thus, under either the case law or under R.C. 4928.141(A), the commission violated the law when it granted AEP additional rates to make up for the regulatory delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">\n<em>2. OCC did not avail itself of the remedy provided by law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">{\u00b6 15} This conclusion leads to the more difficult question: What remedy is available for OCC? The unlawful rate increase lasted until the end of 2009 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>has been fully recovered, so reversing the retroactive increase will not reduce ongoing rates. The rule against retroactive rates, however, also prohibits refunds.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">{\u00b6 16} OCC argues that the commission should have made the entire rate increase subject to refund but cites no authority under which the commission could have done so. As OCC recognizes, under <em>Keco, </em>we have consistently held that the law does not allow refunds in appeals from commission orders. As we stated only two years ago, \u201cany refund order would be contrary to our precedent declining to engage in retroactive ratemaking.\u201d <em>Ohio Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>121 Ohio St.3d 362, 2009-Ohio-604, 904 N.E.2d 853, \u00b6 21; see also, e.g., <em>Green Cove Resort I Owners\u2019 Assn. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>103 Ohio St.3d 125, 2004-Ohio-4774, 814 N.E.2d 829, \u00b6 27 (\u201cNeither the commission nor this court can order a refund of previously approved rates, however, based on the doctrine set forth in <em>Keco </em>* * * \u201d); <em>Keco, </em>166 Ohio St. 254, 2 O.O.2d 85, 141 N.E.2d 465, paragraph two of the syllabus (R.C. Title 49 \u201caffords no right of action for restitution of the increase in charges collected during the pendency of the appeal\u201d). These precedents remain good law and still apply to these facts, thus prohibiting the granting of a refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">{\u00b6 17} We recognize that the no-refund rule transforms OCC\u2019s win on the merits into a somewhat hollow victory. Any apparent unfairness, however, remains a policy decision mandated by the larger legislative scheme. As <em>Keco </em>and other cases have noted, the statutes protect against unlawfully high rates by allowing stays. R.C. 4903.16 authorizes the court to stay execution of commission orders. This section makes \u201cclear that the General Assembly intended that a public utility shall collect the rates set by the commission\u2019s order, giving, however, to any person who feels aggrieved by such order a right to secure a stay of the collection of the new rates after posting a bond.\u201d <em>Keco, </em>166 Ohio St. at 257, 2 O.O.2d 85, 141 N.E.2d 465. The stay remedy \u201ccompletely abrogated\u201d the form of refund (a restitution order) sought in that case. Id. at 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">{\u00b6 18} The difficulty for OCC is that to obtain such a stay, it must \u201cexecute an undertaking * * * conditioned for the prompt payment by the appellant of all damages caused by the delay in the enforcement of the order.\u201d R.C. 4903.16; see also <em>Office of Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 396, 403\u2014404, 575 N.E.2d 157 (the bond requirement applies to OCC under \u201cR.C. 4903.16, and this court\u2019s interpretation thereof\u2019). OCC acted with diligence and speed to secure a financial remedy in this case: it filed an action in prohibition, a quick \u2014 and premature \u2014 appeal, an action for a writ of procedendo, and a motion to suspend the order in this case. Critically, however, OCC did not seek to post a bond \u2014 in fact, it affirmatively sought to avoid doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>{\u00b6 19} OCC concedes that it failed to post bond, but asserts that it is \u201cnot financially capable of posting any bond other than a nominal amount,\u201d a circumstance that makes \u201ca stay * * * truly an illusory remedy at best unless the Court relieves OCC from filing a bond.\u201d To the degree that the bond requirement poses a barrier, however, it is one that must be cured by the General Assembly. Unquestionably, it is the prerogative of the General Assembly to establish the bounds and rules of public-utility regulation. See, e.g., <em>Akron v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1948), 149 Ohio St. 347, 359, 78 N.E.2d 890 (\u201cthe legislative branch of the state government may confer upon\u201d the commission \u201cvery broad [powers]\u201d for the \u201csupervision, regulation and, in a large measure, control of the operation of public utilities\u201d). And our \u201crevisory jurisdiction\u201d over agency proceedings is limited to that \u201cconferred by law.\u201d Section 2(d), Article IV, Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">{\u00b6 20} The legislature has seen fit to attach a significant requirement to the court\u2019s stay power: the posting of a bond sufficient to protect the utility against damage. R.C. 4903.16. If the General Assembly so desired, it could remove or loosen this condition on the stay power. It has not done so, despite decades of cases refusing to grant a refund. At bottom, then, the statutory scheme creates OCC\u2019s problem. We understand the difficulty a public agency such as OCC faces in dealing with the bond requirement. Nevertheless, the statute is clear, and it clearly applies. Whether it is wise to apply the bond requirement to OCC is a matter for the General Assembly to consider, not this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">{\u00b6 21} For these reasons, we hold that the commission\u2019s decision to authorize a retroactive rate increase was unlawful, but we deny OCC\u2019s refund request.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">\n<em>B. IEU Proposition of Law 3; OCC 5: In approving a provider-of-last-resort charge, the commission relied on a justification lacking any record support</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">{\u00b6 22} The commission approved the recovery of roughly $500 million in provider-of-last-resort (\u201cPOLR\u201d) charges over the three years of the plan. OCC and IEU attack the charge on several grounds, including that the commission lacked record support.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">{\u00b623} Under Ohio law, customers may purchase generation service from a competitive supplier. If such a supplier fails to provide service, \u201cthe supplier\u2019s customers * * * default[ ] to the utility\u2019s standard service offer * * * until the customer chooses an alternative supplier.\u201d R.C. 4928.14. This obligation to stand ready to accept returning customers makes the utility the \u201cprovider of last resort,\u201d or \u201cPOLR.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Constellation NewEnergy, Inc. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>104 Ohio St.3d 530, 2004-Ohio-6767, 820 N.E.2d 885, \u00b6 39, fn. 5 (\u201cPOLR costs are those costs incurred by [the utility] for risks associated with its legal obligation as the default provider, or electricity provider, of last resort, for customers who shop and then return to [the utility] for generation service\u201d). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>other reviews of POLR charges, we have admonished the commission to \u201ccarefully consider what costs it is attributing\u201d to \u201cPOLR obligations.\u201d <em>Ohio Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>114 Ohio St.3d 340, 2007-Ohio-4276, 872 N.E.2d 269, \u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">{\u00b6 24} Below, the commission approved a POLR charge totaling over $500 million over the term of the ESP. It described the charge as cosi-based. \u201c[T]he POLR rider will be based on <em>the cost </em>to the Companies to be the POLR and carry the risks associated therewith * * (Emphasis added.) Likewise, it stated that it was allowing recovery of \u201cestimated POLR <em>costs.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Again on rehearing, the commission stated that it had \u201cdetermined that the Companies should be compensated for the <em>cost </em>of carrying the risk associated with being the POLR provider.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This characterization of the POLR charge as cost-based lacks any record support; therefore, we reverse the portion of the order approving the POLR charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">{\u00b6 25} We have carefully reviewed the record, and we can find no evidence suggesting that AEP\u2019s POLR charge is related to any costs it will incur. AEP derived its charge using a mathematical formula created to price exchange-traded options. The company analogized an option to buy and sell securities to the statutory right to shop for power, changed some variables, and applied the formula. This formula, called \u201cthe Black-Scholes model\u201d after two of its creators, is the only evidence AEP presented in support of its POLR charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">{\u00b6 26} Contrary to the order, this formula simply does not reveal \u201cthe cost to the Companies to be the POLR and carry the risks associated therewith.\u201d The record shows that the model does not even purport to estimate costs, but instead tries to quantify \u201cthe value of the optionality [to shop for power] that is provided to customers under Senate Bill 221.\u201d Value to customers (what the model shows) and cost to AEP (the purported basis of the order) are simply not the same thing. AEP\u2019s own witness made this clear \u2014 \u201c[t]rying to recover the <em>costs of the Companies\u2019 POLR obligation </em>retrospectively would fail, because it ignores the very nature of the POLR obligation. The <em>value of the customers\u2019 right to switch </em>under S.B. 221 comes from the option customers are given to switch suppliers, while still having the safety net of the ESP rate * * *.\u201d (Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">{\u00b6 27} Even assuming that AEP accurately priced the option, we fail to see how the amount a customer would be willing to pay for the right to shop necessarily establishes AEP\u2019s costs to bear the attendant risks. The order does not explain the relationship between the two. And witnesses for other parties confirmed that the POLR charge was not based on cost. A witness for OCC testified that AEP has \u201cnot identified any specific costs they are incurring related to the POLR obligation.\u201d Another witness agreed that AEP does \u201cnot appear to have an actual out of pocket expense.\u201d Along similar lines, a member of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>commission\u2019s staff stated that \u201ca POLR charge, if one is considered appropriate, would be significantly below what AEP is requesting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">{\u00b6 28} Other facts in the record further call into question the accuracy of AEP\u2019s POLR theory. The record showed that AEP has had \u201cvirtually no\u201d shopping in the last eight years, including no residential shoppers. No countervailing evidence predicted an uptick in shopping. No witness testified that more switching could be expected in the future, and AEP performed no \u201cactual customer surveys\u201d or \u201cstudies apart from the Black-Scholes model\u201d to determine whether shopping was likely to increase. On the contrary, the commission\u2019s own economist testified that \u201cthere are many reasons to think that substantial migration will not quickly occur, even if the market price falls below the SSO [standard service offer] price.\u201d Even AEP\u2019s witness testified that \u201c[d]esire to switch, in [his] view, will be when there\u2019s an economic advantage,\u201d but that \u201ctoday,\u201d there is \u201cno economic advantage.\u201d Accordingly, AEP did not even \u201chave a plan to purchase\u201d options to hedge its own POLR risk. At the very least, all this evidence raises doubts about the proposition that AEP would justifiably expend $500 million to bear the POLR risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">{\u00b6 29} In short, the manifest weight of the evidence contradicts the commission\u2019s conclusion that the POLR charge is based on cost. In contrast with our recent admonition that the commission must \u201ccarefully consider what costs it is attributing\u201d to \u201cPOLR obligations,\u201d <em>Ohio Consumers\u2019 Counsel, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 340, 2007-Ohio-4276, 872 N.E.2d 269, \u00b6 26, no evidence supports the commission\u2019s characterization of this charge as based on cost. Ruling on an issue without record support is an abuse of discretion and reversible error. See, e.g., <em>Indus. Energy Users-Ohio v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>117 Ohio St.3d 486, 2008-Ohio-990, 885 N.E.2d 195, \u00b6 30. Therefore, we reverse the provisions of the order authorizing the POLR charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">{\u00b6 30} On remand, the commission may revisit this issue. To be clear, we express no opinion on whether a formula-based POLR charge is per se unreasonable or unlawful, and the commission may consider on remand whether a non-cost-based POLR charge is reasonable and lawful. Alternatively, the commission may consider whether it is appropriate to allow AEP to present evidence of its actual POLR costs. However the commission chooses to proceed, it should explain its rationale, respond to contrary positions, and support its decision with appropriate evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">\n<em>C. OCC Proposition of Law 6: The commission erred in determining that ESPs may include items not specifically authorized by statute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">{\u00b6 31} In its sixth proposition of law, OCC argues that R.C. 4928.143(B)(2) does not permit AEP to recover certain carrying costs associated with environmental investments. That section states, \u201cThe [electric security] plan may provide for or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>include, without limitation, any of the following,\u201d and then lists nine categories of cost recovery. OCC argues that this section permits plans to include <em>only listed </em>items; the commission and AEP argue that (B)(2) permits <em>unlisted </em>items. We agree with OCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">{\u00b6 32} By its terms, R.C. 4928.143(B)(2) allows plans to include only \u201cany of the following\u201d provisions. It does not allow plans to include \u201cany provision.\u201d So if a given provision does not fit within one of the categories listed \u201cfollowing\u201d (B)(2), it is not authorized by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">{\u00b6 33} The commission believes that the phrase \u201cwithout limitation\u201d allows unlisted items, asserting that the nine categories are \u201cillustrative, * * * not exhaustive.\u201d But this phrase does not allow unlisted items. Rather, it allows unlimited inclusion of listed items. The list limits <em>the type </em>of categories a plan may include, while the phrase \u201cwithout limitation\u201d allows as <em>many or as much </em>of the listed categories as the commission finds reasonable' \u2014 subject to any other applicable limits, which we do not consider here.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">{\u00b6 34} The plain language of the statute controls, and this interpretation leads to a reasonable result. However, the appellees\u2019 interpretation would remove any substantive limit to what an electric security plan may contain, a result we do not believe the General Assembly intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">{\u00b6 35} For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the commission\u2019s legal determination that R.C. 4928.143(B)(2) permits ESPs to include unlisted items. On remand, the commission may determine whether any of the listed categories of (B)(2) authorize recovery of environmental carrying charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">\n<em>D. IEU Proposition of Law 1: The commission did not lose jurisdiction over the case when the 150-day approval deadline expired</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">{\u00b6 36} In its first proposition of law, IEU argues that the commission \u201clost jurisdiction over AEP-Ohio\u2019s July 31, 2008 ESP Application when it failed to authorize an ESP within the 150-day time frame required by R.C. 4928.143.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">{\u00b6 37} \u201c \u2018As a general rule, a statute which provides a time for the performance of an official duty will be construed as directory so far as time for performance is concerned, especially where the statute fixes the time simply for convenience or orderly procedure.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Davis </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 520, 522, 705 N.E.2d 1219, quoting <em>State ex rel. Jones v. Farrar </em>(1946), 146 Ohio St. 467, 471\u2014472, 32 O.O. 542, 66 N.E.2d 531. \u201cThis is so \u2018unless the nature of the act to be performed or the phraseology of the statute or of other statutes relating to the same subject-matter is such that the designation of time must be considered a limitation upon the power of the officer.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>State ex rel. Smith v. Barnell </em>(1924), 109 Ohio St. 246, 255, 142 N.E. 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>{\u00b6 38} Under this principle, deadlines concerned with \u201cthe prompt conduct of the public business\u201d should be considered \u201cdirectory,\u201d not mandatory. <em>Jones </em>at 472. The use of the word \u201cshall\u201d to institute the deadline does not change this. See <em>Davis </em>at 522 (\u201ceven with \u2018shall\u2019 as the operative verb, a statutory time provision may be directory\u201d). And a deadline provision that does not \u201cmandate any particular result if the * * * decision is untimely\u201d further supports a directory interpretation. <em>State ex rel. Larkins v. Wilkinson </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 477, 479, 683 N.E.2d 1139; see also, e.g., <em>Davis </em>at 522 (a deadline was directory where it did \u201cnot include any expression of intent to restrict the jurisdiction of the court for untimeliness\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">{\u00b6 39} Applying these standards, we hold that R.C. 4928.143(C)(l)\u2019s 150-day deadline is directory and that the commission retained jurisdiction over the case when the deadline expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">{\u00b6 40} R.C. 4928.143(C)(1) provides: \u201cThe commission shall issue an order under this division for an initial application under this section not later than one hundred fifty days after the application\u2019s filing date and, for any subsequent application by the utility under this section, not later than two hundred seventy-five days after the application\u2019s filing date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">{\u00b6 41} Considering the act as a whole, we find it plain that the General Assembly enacted the 150-day deadline to ensure prompt review of initial ESP applications. To begin with, that is how we generally interpret such provisions, <em>In re Davis, </em>84 Ohio St.3d at 522, 705 N.E.2d 1219, and numerous provisions of S.B. 221 confirm that the general rule applies here. For example, the introductory section of S.B. 221 requires electric distribution utilities to provide a standard service offer by a specific date, January 1, 2009. R.C. 4928.141(A). Given that the law took effect July 31, 2008, the utilities and the commission had not quite six months to have new rates put into effect. Six months is a comparatively short amount of time for a major rate proceeding; the commission is given almost twice as much time (275 days) to resolve a distribution-rate proceeding, see R.C. 4909.42, and later ESP proceedings. See R.C. 4928.143(C)(1). Moreover, the statute expressly permits utilities to file their applications \u201cprior to the effective date of any rules the commission may adopt for the purpose of this section.\u201d R.C. 4928.143(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">{\u00b6 42} All this suggests that the General Assembly meant to hasten the filing and review of initial ESPs, not set a jurisdictional bar. IEU points to no factors that suggest the opposite. For example, R.C. 4928.143 does not impose any consequence for exceeding the 150-day deadline. It does not mandate dismissal and refiling. Notably, this consequence is required in other scenarios, but not for expiration of the 150-day deadline. See R.C. 4928.143(C)(2)(a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>{\u00b6 43} R.C. 4928.143(C)(l)\u2019s deadline effectuates \u201cthe proper, orderly, and prompt\u201d resolution of initial ESP applications. <em>Jones, </em>146 Ohio St. at 472, 32 O.O. 542, 66 N.E.2d 531. The deadline is not jurisdictional, and we reject IEU\u2019s first proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">\n<em>E. IEU Proposition of Law 2: IEU has not shown error in AEP\u2019s acceptance and appeal of its ESP</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">{\u00b6 44} In its second proposition of law, IEU argues that the commission should have \u201cprohibit[ed] AEP-Ohio from accepting the benefits of the higher rates approved in the ESP while simultaneously preserving the right to withdraw and terminate the approved ESP.\u201d This argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">{\u00b6 45} Under R.C. 4928.143(C)(1), the commission must do one of three things when an ESP is filed: it must \u201capprove,\u201d \u201cmodify and approve,\u201d or \u201cdisapprove\u201d the application. \u201cIf the commission modifies and approves an application,\u201d the utility \u201cmay withdraw the application, thereby terminating it, and may file a new standard service offer.\u201d R.C. 4928.143(C)(2)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">{\u00b6 46} In this case, the commission modified and approved the ESP. AEP filed tariffs instituting the new rates but stated in its cover letter, \u201cThe Companies do not waive * * * their right under \u00a7 4928.143(C)(2), Ohio Rev.Code, regarding withdrawal of their Application.\u201d According to IEU, AEP \u201chas never formally accepted its approved ESP, is still taking the benefits of the ESP, and has filed an appeal of its ESP to this Court.\u201d IEU contends that a utility \u201ccannot accept the benefits of the rates approved in an ESP while simultaneously preserving the right to withdraw and terminate the ESP.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">{\u00b6 47} IEU has not met its burden of showing error. The law permits utilities to withdraw modified ESPs, but does not require it, R.C. 4928.143(C)(2)(a), and IEU cites no authority requiring \u201cformal acceptance\u201d of an ESP. The fact that AEP has neither withdrawn nor formally accepted its application does not show error.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">{\u00b6 48} We will not weigh in on whether AEP could collect ESP rates for some period of time and then withdraw the plan. AEP has not done so, and we do not address hypothetical questions. See <em>State ex rel. Elyria Foundry Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 88, 89, 694 N.E.2d 459; <em>Cincinnati Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>103 Ohio St.3d 398, 2004-Ohio-5466, 816 N.E.2d 238, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">{\u00b6 49} IEU has failed to demonstrate legal error, and we reject its second proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-11\">\n<em>F. OCC Proposition of Law U: The commission adequately explained why it was not following prior decisions in allowing AEP to keep the proceeds of \u201coff-system sales\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b654-12\">{\u00b6 50} In its fourth proposition of law, OCC argues that the order departed from precedent without sufficient explanation. The commission allowed AEP to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>keep all proceeds from \u201coff-system sales,\u201d meaning unregulated sales to other resellers and not to retail customers, rather than requiring AEP to give the net profits of those sales as a rate credit to consumers. OCC asserts that in past cases, the commission required utilities to share with customers the revenue from such sales. According to OCC, the commission has departed from this precedent without sufficient explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">{\u00b6 51} At the outset, we note that OCC does <em>not </em>argue that the underlying decision was <em>substantively </em>unlawful and unreasonable. In fact, OCC concedes that the law \u201cdoes not require profits from off-system sales to be included in the ESP rates\u201d that is, shared with customers. Its argument is procedural and limited to whether the commission \u201cfailed to explain why it was departing from precedent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">{\u00b6 52} It is true that we have instructed the commission to \u201crespect its own precedents in its decisions to assure the predictability which is essential in all areas of the law, including administrative law.\u201d <em>Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 403, 431, 71 O.O.2d 393, 330 N.E.2d 1, superseded on other grounds by statute as recognized in <em>Babbit v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1979), 59 Ohio St.2d 81, 89, 13 O.O.3d 67, 391 N.E.2d 1376. This does not mean that the commission may never revisit a particular decision, only that if it does change course, it must explain why. See, e.g., <em>Util. Serv. Partners, Inc. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>124 Ohio St.3d 284, 2009-Ohio-6764, 921 N.E.2d 1038, \u00b6 18; <em>Office of Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1985), 16 Ohio St.3d 21, 21-22, 16 OBR 371, 475 N.E.2d 786 (\u201cA few simple sentences in the commission\u2019s order in this case would have sufficed\u201d to explain why a previous order had been overruled). The new course also must be substantively reasonable and lawful, but OCC, as noted, has not placed that at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">{\u00b6 53} Here, the commission explained why it did not follow the cases cited by OCC as precedent. None of them arose under the applicable body of law, S.B. 221. And the commission further concluded that the applicable law now in place does not even require OCC\u2019s requested treatment, a point that OCC concedes.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">{\u00b6 54} The commission adequately explained why it did not follow the cases cited by OCC. As this is the only basis on which OCC attacks the commission\u2019s treatment of off-system sales, we reject its fourth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">\n<em>G. IEU Proposition of Law p. IEU fails to show error concerning the approval of charges related to a pair of generation stations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">{\u00b6 55} In its fourth proposition of law, IEU argued that the commission should not have allowed recovery of charges associated with a pair of generation stations. According to IEU, the commission \u201ccannot use traditional <em>cost-based ratemaking </em>selectively to increase rates where it believes particular categories of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number><em>competitive generation </em>costs are not currently reflected in rates.\u201d (Emphases sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">{\u00b6 56} \u201c \u2018[A] party who contends\u2019 \u201d that rates and charges are unreasonable \u201c \u2018has the burden on appeal to the Supreme Court under Section 4903.13, Revised Code, of showing that they are unjust, unreasonable or unlawful.\u2019 \u201d <em>AT &amp; T Communications of Ohio, Inc. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 150, 154, 555 N.E.2d 288, quoting <em>Columbus v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1959), 170 Ohio St. 105, 10 O.O.2d 4, 163 N.E.2d 167, paragraph two of the syllabus. IEU fails to carry its burden here. At no point does appellant even purport to cite a specific legal authority that prohibits cost-based rates in an ESP. Several times, it asserts that S.B. 221 prohibits the commission\u2019s action. S.B. 221, however, is over 50 pages long, so this general citation does not provide enough guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">{\u00b6 57} Conclusory assertions that the commission cannot do something fall well short of demonstrating reversible error. IEU\u2019s argument in its fourth proposition is inadequately developed, and we reject it on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">\n<em>H. IEU Proposition of Law 5: IEU fails to show error in the approval of AEP\u2019s vegetation-management and smart-grid programs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">{\u00b6 58} In its fifth proposition of law, IEU challenges the commission\u2019s approval of parts of AEP\u2019s proposed enhanced-vegetation-management<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and smart-grid programs. Neither challenge succeeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">{\u00b6 59} Regarding the vegetation-management program, IEU faults the commission for inconsistency \u2014 it approved this distribution charge but not others that had been requested. AEP had proposed four types of charges related to distribution service. The commission decided not to address three of the four, finding it better to examine those charges in \u201ca distribution rate case where all components of distribution rates are subject to review.\u201d Nevertheless, it allowed recovery of an \u201cenhanced vegetation initiative,\u201d based on its findings that \u201ca specific need exists\u201d for the initiative and that the charges were necessary to expand the current program.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">{\u00b6 60} IEU asserts that this decision to approve some but not all distribution charges was unexplained. That is not true. The commission did explain why it considered one distribution program but not the others \u2014 \u201cAEP-Ohio has demonstrated in the record of this proceeding that it faces increased costs for vegetation management and that a specific need exists for the implementation of the enhanced vegetation initiative * * *.\u201d IEU does not explain in any further detail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number><em>what else </em>the commission should have explained, so this portion of its argument is settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">{\u00b6 61} In the other part of its fifth proposition, IEU argues that the commission approved AEP\u2019s \u201cgridSMART\u201d proposal \u201cwithout any showing that [it] satisfied the cost-effectiveness requirements of R.C. 4928.02(D).\u201d The provision cited by IEU states that \u201cit is the policy of the state\u201d to \u201c[e]ncourage innovation and market access for cost-effective supply- and demand-side retail electric service including, but not limited to, demand-side management, time-differentiated pricing, and implementation of advanced metering infrastructure.\u201d IEU has not demonstrated legal error.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">{\u00b6 62} To begin with, and contrary to IEU\u2019s assumption, R.C. 4928.02(D) does not impose strict \u201ccost-effectiveness requirements\u201d on any given program\u2014 indeed, by its terms, it does not <em>require </em>anything. It simply expresses state policy. As we have held, such policy statements are \u201cguideline[s] for the commission to weigh\u201d in evaluating utility proposals to further state policy goals, and it has been \u201cleft * * * to the commission to determine how best to carry [them] out.\u201d <em>Ohio Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>125 Ohio St.3d 57, 2010-Ohio-134, 926 N.E.2d 261, \u00b6 39-40. The commission plainly weighed this policy consideration in reviewing the programs. That alone is grounds to reject IEU\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">{\u00b6 63} In any event, the commission acted in step with the policy of R.C. 4928.02(D). By approving the initiation of the smart-grid program, the commission \u201c[e]ncourage[d] innovation and market access\u201d for \u201csupply- and demand-side retail electric services,\u201d specifically including \u201cimplementation of advanced metering infrastructure.\u201d R.C. 4928.02(D). As to cost-effectiveness, the commission imposed several requirements to ensure prudent spending: \u201cseparate accounting for gridSMART, an opportunity to approve and update the plan each year, assurance that expenditures are made before cost recovery occurs, and an opportunity to audit expenditures prior to recovery.\u201d Moreover, the commission cut in half the proposed cost-recovery and required AEP to seek federal stimulus funding. These provisions reduced costs and imposed mechanisms to protect consumers from unwarranted spending.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">{\u00b6 64} For the foregoing reasons, we reject IEU\u2019s fifth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">\n<em>I. IEU Proposition of Law 6: IEU has not demonstrated error in the commission\u2019s setting of AEP\u2019s fuel-cost baseline</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">{\u00b6 65} ESPs may provide for \u201c[a]utomatic recovery\u201d of \u201cthe cost of fuel used to generate the electricity supplied under the offer,\u201d \u201cprovided the cost is prudently incurred.\u201d R.C. 4928.143(B)(2)(a). In its sixth proposition of law, IEU asserts that the commission violated the prudently-incurred-eost requirement when it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>used certain estimated fuel-cost figures in establishing AEP\u2019s base rate. This argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">{\u00b6 66} We note up front that IEU does not attack the use of an estimate <em>per se, </em>but merely the commission\u2019s <em>choice of </em>what estimate to use. IEU, AEP, and the commission\u2019s staff each proposed fuel-cost estimates; the commission adopted the staffs. And we further note, because the record confirms, that no matter which estimate was used, only actual costs were to be recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">{\u00b6 67} IEU argues that the commission\u2019s choice of estimate violates R.C. 4928.143(B)(2)(a). That section authorizes \u201c[ajutomatic recovery\u201d of \u201cthe cost of fuel\u201d \u201cprovided the cost is prudently incurred.\u201d The commission complied with this section. As noted above, only actual costs will be recovered, and as the commission stated in its order, they will be subject to prudence review (\u201cthe FAC [fuel adjustment clause] mechanism includes a quarterly reconciliation to actual FAC costs incurred,\u201d and the staff recommendation was adopted for \u201can annual prudency and accounting review\u201d of the FAC).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">{\u00b6 68} Moreover, IEU points to no legal authority that speaks to how the commission should determine or estimate fuel-cost baselines. Any lack of statutory guidance on that point should be read as a grant of discretion. See, e.g., <em>Payphone Assn. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>109 Ohio St.3d 453, 2006-Ohio-2988, 849 N.E.2d 4, \u00b6 25 (\u201cWhen a statute does not prescribe a particular formula, the PUCO is vested with broad discretion\u201d). IEU simply has not shown an abuse of discretion. It asserts that the commission\u2019s estimate has the effect of \u201cpushing too much money associated with the FAC into the deferral bucket.\u201d But while IEU explains why it does not like that decision, it neither cites legal authority prohibiting the commission\u2019s approach nor persuasively explains how the order was objectively unreasonable. That is not enough to demonstrate reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">{\u00b6 69} We reject IEU\u2019s sixth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\"><em>J. IEU Proposition of Law 7: IEU fails to demonstrate any violation of R.C. </em>1903.09''s <em>requirement of a reasoned explanation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">{\u00b6 70} Last, in its seventh proposition of law, IEU alleges that the commission violated R.C. 4903.09 by failing to sufficiently detail \u201cthe reasons prompting the decisions arrived at.\u201d R.C. 4903.09. IEU lodges this objection at a fatally high level of generality. Had the commission issued a one-page summary order to resolve this case, it might suffice to assert simply that \u201cthe Orders omit the required documentation of the Commission\u2019s reasoning.\u201d But the order and entries on rehearing fill 140 pages \u2014 while we do not equate breadth with depth, IEU must do more to show error.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Afdk\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>Janine L.

IEU\u2019s nonspecific allegations establish none of these points. (The only example developed by IEU concerns the POLR charge, which we have already discussed.)</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">{\u00b6 72} IEU has not specifically explained how the commission failed to explain itself. On that basis, we reject its seventh proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">{\u00b6 73} Some of the issues raised are best left to the General Assembly, which has the responsibility to monitor the development and implementation of the new regulatory regime. We can resolve legal disputes, but we cannot fill gaps. While our goal is always to determine the intent of the General Assembly, we also recognize that our decisions may reveal gaps unintended by that body. If that occurs, or the law otherwise fails to achieve its policy objectives, the legislature is the appropriate body to determine those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">{\u00b6 74} For the foregoing reasons, we reverse in part, affirm in part, and remand this case to the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">Order affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b659-10\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b656-10\">. \u201cVegetation management\u201d refers to trimming trees, clearing rights-of-way, and other activities necessary to keep wires clear.
