Varnau, be entitled to the office. Because the court of appeals erred in holding that previous administrative determinations of the Brown County Board of Elections precluded the quo warranto action, we reverse the judgment and remand the cause to the court of appeals for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>Wenninger has been the Brown County sheriff since January 2001, having won elections in 2000, 2004, and 2008. The board of elections certified that he met the applicable qualifications to be a sheriffs candidate for each of the elections, but it never made a decision on the merits of his qualifications following a protest contesting his candidacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">{\u00b6 3} In 2004, Sandra Martin protested Wenninger\u2019s candidacy for sheriff, but she withdrew the protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">{\u00b6 4} In 2008, Varnau, an independent candidate for sheriff, filed a protest against Wenninger\u2019s candidacy for sheriff. The board of elections denied the protest because, among other reasons, it was not \u201cfiled by a member of the appropriate party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-12\">{\u00b6 5} Varnau then sought a writ of mandamus to compel the board of elections to accept as valid the protest he filed against Wenninger\u2019s candidacy. The Brown County Court of Common Pleas dismissed the mandamus action because, among other reasons, \u201cthe extraordinary remedy of mandamus is not appropriate in that there is a legal remedy at law through a quo warranto action\u201d and Varnau\u2019s protest was not \u201cfiled by a \u2018qualified elector who is a member of the same political party as the candidate and who is eligible to vote at the primary election for the candidate whose declaration of candidacy the elector objects to,\u2019 pursuant to R.C. 3513.05.\u201d The court of appeals affirmed the dismissal, finding: \u201cShould Wen-ninger be elected and take office, [Varnau] has other legal remedies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-13\">{\u00b6 6} In February 2009, following the election victory by Wenninger, Varnau filed a complaint in the court of appeals for a writ of quo warranto to oust Wenninger from the office of sheriff and to place Varnau in that office. Varnau claimed that because he was the only lawful sheriffs candidate at the November <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>2008 election, he is entitled to the office. Wenninger moved to dismiss the complaint and attached his affidavit to the motion. The court of appeals converted the motion for dismissal to a motion for summary judgment, Varnau moved for summary judgment, and the parties submitted evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">{\u00b6 7} On August 16, 2010, the court of appeals granted Wenninger\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied the writ. <em>State ex rel. Varnau v. Wenninger, </em>Brown App. No. CA2009-02-010, 2010-Ohio-3813, 2010 WL 3212016.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">{\u00b6 8} This cause is now before the court upon Varnau\u2019s appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c \u2018[Q]uo warranto is the exclusive remedy by which one\u2019s right to hold a public office may be litigated.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Deiter v. McGuire, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 384, 2008-Ohio-4536, 894 N.E.2d 680, \u00b6 20, quoting <em>State ex rel. Battin v. Bush </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 236, 238-239, 533 N.E.2d 301. \u201cFor a writ of quo warranto to issue, \u2018a relator must establish (1) that the office is being unlawfully held and exercised by respondent, and (2) that relator is entitled to the office.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Newell v. Jackson, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 138, 2008-Ohio-1965, 886 N.E.2d 846, \u00b6 6, quoting <em>State ex rel. Paluf v. Feneli </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 138, 141, 630 N.E.2d 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">{\u00b6 10} The court of appeals determined that <em>\u201cbecause the Board previously determined [that] Wenninger satisfied the necessary requirements to be elected Brown County Sheriff in 2000, 200J, and 2008 as statutorily required by R.C. 311.01(F)(2), </em>we find that, based upon the record before us, there is no genuine issue of material fact, reasonable minds can reach only one conclusion which is adverse to Varnau, and Wenninger is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Varnau, </em>2010-Ohio-3813, 2010 WL 3212016, at \u00b6 10. In essence, the court of appeals held that the prior administrative certifications by the board were conclusive on the issue whether Wenninger met the applicable sheriffs qualifications and barred Varnau from relitigating the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cRes judicata, whether claim preclusion or issue preclusion, applies to quasi-judicial administrative proceedings.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Schachter v. Ohio Pub. Emps. Retirement Bd., </em>121 Ohio St.3d 526, 2009-Ohio-1704, 905 N.E.2d 1210, \u00b6 29; <em>State ex rel. Tremmel v. Erie Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 452, 2009-Ohio-5773, 917 N.E.2d 792, \u00b6 16. We have defined quasi-judicial authority as \u201cthe power to hear and determine controversies between the public and individuals that <em>require </em>a hearing resembling a judicial trial.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State ex rel. Wright v. Ohio Bur. of Motor Vehicles </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 184, 186, 718 N.E.2d 908.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">{\u00b6 12} On three separate occasions, the board of elections certified pursuant to R.C. 311.01(F)(2) that Wenninger\u2019s candidacy for sheriff met the qualifications in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>R.C. 311.01(B) and (C). But this statute did not require the board of elections to conduct a hearing resembling a judicial trial in making its determination, and there is no evidence that it did so. \u201cWhen no statute or other pertinent law <em>requires </em>the board of elections to conduct a hearing resembling a judicial trial, the board does not exercise quasi-judicial authority regardless of whether protests have been filed.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>State ex rel. Wright v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 92, 2008-Ohio-5553, 896 N.E.2d 706, \u00b6 8; see also <em>State ex rel. Scherach v. Lorain Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 245, 2009-Ohio-5349, 915 N.E.2d 647, \u00b6 23 (court denies writ of prohibition to prevent board of elections from placing candidate on general-election ballot, in election to fill unexpired term of city law director who had resigned, because board did not exercise judicial or quasi-judicial authority in certifying name of candidate to ballot).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">{\u00b6 13} Moreover, although a board of elections does exercise quasi-judicial authority in denying protests filed pursuant to statute, see, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Murray v. Scioto Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 280, 2010-Ohio-5846, 939 N.E.2d 157, \u00b6 31, and R.C. 3501.39(A)(2), the protest filed against Wenninger in 2004 was withdrawn before the board could exercise its quasi-judicial authority and the protest filed against him in 2008 by Yarnau was denied because, among other reasons, Varnau lacked standing under the applicable statute to file the protest due to the fact that he was not a member of the same political party as Wenninger. See <em>Zukowski v. Brunner, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 53, 2010-Ohio-1652, 925 N.E.2d 987, \u00b6 9 (Republican Party member lacked standing to protest the candidacies of Democratic Party candidates); R.C. 3513.05 (\u201cProtests against the candidacy of any person filing a declaration of candidacy for party nomination or for election to an office or position, as provided in this section, may be filed by any qualified elector who is a member of the same political party as the candidate * * * \u201d). Consequently, the board also did not exercise quasi-judicial authority for these protests.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">{\u00b6 14} Finally, the court of appeals\u2019 reliance on our prior holding that \u201c[bjoards of elections are obligated to weigh evidence of a candidate\u2019s qualifications, and courts should not substitute their judgment for that of the board,\u201d <em>State ex rel. Kelly v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 413, 414, 639 N.E.2d 78, to support its holding is also misplaced. <em>Kelly </em>and the other cases cited by the court of appeals for this proposition were all cases in which the boards of elections conducted quasi-judicial hearings upon properly filed protests. See also <em>State ex rel. O\u2019Beirne v. Geauga Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 176, 685 N.E.2d 502; <em>State ex rel. Herdman v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 593, 621 N.E.2d 1204. That did not happen here.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ajn-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>Thomas G. Eagle Co., L.P.A., and Thomas G. Eagle, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"a0i-dedup-0\">Gary A. Rosenhoffer, L.L.C., and Gary A. Rosenhoffer; and Patrick L. Gregory, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">{\u00b6 15} Therefore, the court of appeals erred in holding that the board\u2019s previous administrative determinations barred Varnau from challenging Wen-ninger\u2019s qualifications to remain sheriff in his quo warranto case. These determinations were not res judicata as to these issues, because the board did not exercise quasi-judicial authority in rendering them.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">{\u00b6 16} Based on the foregoing, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals denying the writ of quo warranto. Because the court of appeals failed to address the substance of Varnau\u2019s claim for extraordinary relief based on its erroneous rationale, a remand of the cause to that court for further proceedings based on the parties\u2019 motions and evidence is appropriate. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Sawicki v. Lucas Cty. Court of Common Pleas, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 507, 2009-Ohio-1523, 905 N.E.2d 1192, \u00b6 32. We deny appellant\u2019s request for oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b497-7\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
