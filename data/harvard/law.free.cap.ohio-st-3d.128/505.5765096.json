Terry, for reconsideration as a motion for relief from judgment, granting it, and denying the request of appellant, Houssam Albourque, for a writ of mandamus to compel Judge Terry to issue a new sentencing entry in Albourque\u2019s criminal ease to comply with Crim.R. 32(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-12\">{\u00b6 2} The judge\u2019s motion was styled \u201cApplication for Reconsideration.\u201d App.R. 26(A)(1) allows for such motions only in \u201cany cause or motion submitted on appeal.\u201d The instant action was filed originally in the court of appeals. Thus, App.R. 26(A)(1) is not applicable. But the court of appeals did not abuse its discretion by treating the judge\u2019s application as a Civ.R. 60(B) motion for relief from judgment. See, generally, <em>Pete\u2019s Auto Sales v. Conner </em>(Aug. 24, 2000), Cuyahoga App. No. 77014, 2000 WL 1222015, *3, and eases cited therein (\u201cIt has long been recognized that trial courts have been allowed some discretion to treat a motion for reconsideration as a motion to vacate under Civ.R. 60(B)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-13\">{\u00b6 3} Nor did the court of appeals abuse its discretion in granting the judge\u2019s motion and denying the writ. See <em>Eubank v. Anderson, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 349, 2008-Ohio-4477, 894 N.E.2d 48, \u00b6 4 (applying an abuse-of-discretion standard of review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>for an appeal from a Civ.R. 60(B) determination). When it originally granted Albourque\u2019s writ, the appellate court held that the 2006 order was not final and appealable because it failed to dispose of Count 5 of the indictment. In his motion, the judge included a certified copy of the indictment establishing that a codefendant \u2014 not Albourque \u2014 was charged in Count 5. Although it is true, as Albourque asserts, that Civ.R. 60(B) cannot be used as a substitute for a timely appeal, see <em>State ex rel. Manuel v. Stenson, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 52, 2010-Ohio-2673, 930 N.E.2d 310, \u00b6 1, the judge\u2019s claim was premised on an evidentiary submission, which would have normally been precluded in an appeal. See <em>Dzina v. Celebrezze, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 385, 2006-Ohio-1195, 843 N.E.2d 1202, \u00b6 16 (\u201cWe cannot, however, add matter to the record before us that was not part of the court of appeals\u2019 proceedings and then decide the appeal on the basis of the new matter\u201d).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A7Io\">Houssam Albourque, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"avi-dedup-0\">William D. Mason, Cuyahoga County Prosecuting Attorney, and James E. Moss, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">{\u00b6 4} Therefore, the March 21, 2006 sentencing entry issued by Judge Terry fully complied with Crim.R. 32(C). It included the finding of the court upon which his conviction was based, the sentence, the judge\u2019s signature, and the stamp showing journalization. Thus, it was final and appealable, and Albourque was not entitled to the requested extraordinary relief in mandamus to compel the issuance of a new sentencing entry. See <em>State ex rel. Cunningham v. Lindeman, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 481, 2010-Ohio-4388, 935 N.E.2d 393, \u00b6 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b638-7\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
