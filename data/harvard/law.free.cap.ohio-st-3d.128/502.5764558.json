We affirm the dismissal, albeit for different reasons than the rationale stated by the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">{\u00b6 2} The court of appeals dismissed the Vaughns\u2019 petition on the rationale that it lacked \u201cjurisdiction over the child custody decisions and proceedings of the Common Pleas Court of Lucas County, Ohio, Juvenile Court Division.\u201d The court of appeals apparently credited Wyrembek\u2019s argument in support of his unopposed motion to dismiss that the court lacked jurisdiction over the habeas corpus petition because under R.C. 2151.23(A)(3), the Lucas County Juvenile Court had \u201cexclusive original jurisdiction under the Revised Code * * * [t]o hear and determine any application for a writ of habeas corpus involving the custody of a child.\u201d Courts of appeals, however, have been given original jurisdiction in habeas corpus actions by Section 3(B)(1)(c), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution. \u201cThe General Assembly is without power to limit or alter the original jurisdiction of Courts of Appeals in habeas corpus actions.\u201d <em>In re Black </em>(1973), 36 Ohio St.2d 124, 65 O.O.2d 308, 304 N.E.2d 394, paragraph two of the syllabus. Therefore, notwithstanding R.C. 2151.23(A)(3), \u201c[a] Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to entertain a petition for a writ of habeas corpus involving the custody of a child.\u201d Id. at paragraph three of the syllabus; see also <em>Hughes v. Scaffide </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 85, 86, 7 O.O.3d 175, 372 N.E.2d 598, fn. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">{\u00b6 3} In addition, although R.C. 2725.03 limits the jurisdiction over habeas corpus cases involving inmates of state benevolent or correctional institutions to \u201cthe courts or judges of the county in which the institution is located,\u201d see <em>Knecht v. Tate </em>(Dec. 10, 1991), Franklin App. No. 91 AP-207, 1991 WL 268340, there is no comparable statutory limitation on child-custody habeas corpus cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>{\u00b6 4} Furthermore, the Vaughns\u2019 habeas corpus petition was based on their institution of an adoption proceeding in Franklin County pursuant to R.C. 3107.04(A) (\u201cA petition for adoption shall be filed in the court in the county in which the person to be adopted was born * * * or in which the agency having the permanent custody of the person to be adopted is located\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">{\u00b6 5} Wyrembek argues on appeal that under the jurisdictional-priority rule, the court of appeals lacked jurisdiction over the habeas corpus case because the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction was invoked first to decide the custody matter. But although the issues in the cases are similar, the cause of action in the court of appeals case \u2014 habeas corpus \u2014 is not the same as the cause of action in the juvenile court \u2014 custody in the context of a parentage proceeding. See <em>State ex rel. Brady v. Pianka, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 147, 2005-Ohio-4105, 832 N.E.2d 1202, \u00b6 13, quoting <em>State ex rel. Shimko v. McMonagle </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 426, 429, 751 N.E.2d 472 (\u201c \u2018In general, the jurisdictional priority rule applies when the causes of action are the same in both cases, and if the first case does not involve the same cause of action or the same parties as the second case, the first case will not prevent the second\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">{\u00b6 6} Therefore, the Court of Appeals for Franklin County had general subject-matter jurisdiction over the Vaughns\u2019 habeas corpus petition, and the court erred in not so holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">{\u00b6 7} Nevertheless, we will not reverse a correct judgment simply because it was based in whole or in part on an incorrect rationale. <em>State ex rel. Galloway v. Cook, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 332, 2010-Ohio-3780, 933 N.E.2d 807, \u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">{\u00b6 8} First, the Vaughns have or had an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law by appeal from the Lucas County Juvenile Court\u2019s orders granting custody of the child to Wyrembek. \u201cLike other extraordinary-writ actions, habeas corpus is not available when there is an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.\u201d <em>In re Complaint for Writ of Habeas Corpus for Goeller, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 427, 2004-Ohio-5579, 816 N.E.2d 594, \u00b6 6. \u201cThis principle applies equally to child custody actions, where habeas corpus relief is the exception rather than the general rule.\u201d <em>Rammage v. Saros, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 430, 2002-Ohio-6669, 780 N.E.2d 278, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">{\u00b6 9} Second, insofar as the Vaughns raise a jurisdictional claim that they either raised or could have raised in their previous, unsuccessful extraordinary-writ actions, see <em>State ex rel. Vaughn v. Cubbon, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 1487, 2009-Ohio-3830, 910 N.E.2d 1040; <em>State ex rel. Vaughn v. Cubbon, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 1471, 2010-Ohio-354, 921 N.E.2d 243; and <em>State ex rel. </em>Vaughn<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>v. Cubbon, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 1577, 2010-Ohio-4542, 934 N.E.2d 351, res judicata \u201cbars all subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>actions based upon any claim arising out of the transaction or occurrence that was the subject matter of the previous action.\u201d <em>Grava v. Parkman Twp. </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 379, 382, 653 N.E.2d 226. \u201cThe previous action is conclusive for all claims that were or that could have been litigated in the first action.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Schachter v. Ohio Pub. Emps. Retirement Bd., </em>121 Ohio St.3d 526, 2009-Ohio-1704, 905 N.E.2d 1210, \u00b6 27.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Aobm\">Voorhees &amp; Levy, L.L.C., and Michael R. Voorhees, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">{\u00b6 10} Third, as we held in the Vaughns\u2019 appeal from a judgment of the Lucas County Court of Appeals affirming the Lucas County Probate Court\u2019s dismissal of their petition to adopt the child, \u201c \u2018[w]hen an issue concerning parenting<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of a minor is pending in the juvenile court, a probate court must refrain from proceeding with the adoption of that child.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Adoption of G.V., </em>126 Ohio St.3d 249, 2010-Ohio-3349, 933 N.E.2d 245, \u00b6 8, certiorari denied, <em>Vaughn v. Wyrembek </em>(2011), \u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 1610, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-, quoting <em>In re Adoption of Pushcar, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 332, 2006-Ohio-4572, 853 N.E.2d 647, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">{\u00b6 11} Finally, dismissal of the Vaughns\u2019 habeas corpus petition was appropriate because they did not comply with the pleading requirements of R.C. 2725.04. See <em>In re Bailey, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 309, 2003-Ohio-859, 784 N.E.2d 109, \u00b6 13; <em>Holloway v. Clermont Cty. Dept. of Human Servs. </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 128, 132, 684 N.E.2d 1217. Although the Vaughns\u2019 petition challenges a Lucas County Juvenile Court order compelling them to transfer custody of the child to Wyrembek, they did not attach a copy of that order to their petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">{\u00b6 12} Based on the foregoing, dismissal of the Vaughns\u2019 habeas corpus petition was appropriate, albeit for different reasons than those expressed by the court of appeals. Therefore, we affirm the judgment dismissing the petition. We deny Wyrembek\u2019s motion for sanctions, however, because the Vaughns\u2019 appeal was not frivolous insofar as the court of appeals\u2019 rationale was incorrect. See S.Ct.Prac.R. 14.5(A) (\u201cAn appeal * * * shall be considered frivolous if it is not reasonably well-grounded in fact or warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b636-10\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b636-11\">Pfeifer, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"A83j\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>The McQuades Co., L.P.A., and Alan J.
