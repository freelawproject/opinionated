A sentence that does not include the statutorily mandated term of postre-lease control is void, is not precluded from appellate review by principles of res judicata, and may be reviewed at any time, on direct appeal or by collateral attack. Although the doctrine of res judicata does not preclude review of a void sentence, res judicata still applies to other aspects of the merits of a conviction, including the determination of guilt and the lawful elements of the ensuing sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">Relevant Background</p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">{\u00b6 2} In 2002, a judge sentenced appellant, Londen K. Fischer, to an aggregate term of 14 years\u2019 imprisonment for aggravated robbery, felonious assault, having a weapon while under disability, and two counts of aggravated burglary, all with firearms specifications. A timely direct appeal followed, and his convictions were affirmed by the court of appeals. <em>State v. Fischer, </em>Summit App. No. 20988, 2003-Ohio-95, 2003 WL 118470 (rejecting sufficiency-of-the-evidence claims and <em>Batson </em>challenges).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-14\">{\u00b6 3} Several years later, Fischer successfully moved pro se for resentencing after this court issued its decision in <em>State v. Bezak, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 94, 2007-Ohio-3250, 868 N.E.2d 961 (holding that a sentence that omits a statutorily mandated postrelease term is void) because he had not been properly advised of his postrelease-control obligations. Thereafter, the trial court properly notified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>Fischer of those obligations and reimposed the remainder of the sentence. Fischer appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">{\u00b6 4} On appeal, he asserted that because his original sentence was void, his first direct appeal was \u201cnot valid\u201d and that this appeal is in fact \u201chis first direct appeal\u201d in which he may raise any and all issues relating to his conviction. <em>State v. Fischer, </em>181 Ohio App.3d 758, 2009-Ohio-1491, 910 N.E.2d 1083, \u00b6 4 and 5. The court of appeals rejected his claim, holding that the appeal was precluded by the law-of-the-case doctrine. Id. at \u00b6 7-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">{\u00b6 5} We granted discretionary review of a single proposition arising from the appeal: whether a direct appeal from a resentencing ordered pursuant to <em>State v. Bezak </em>is a first appeal as of right. <em>State v. Fischer, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 1410, 2009-Ohio-5031, 914 N.E.2d 206. We hold that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">{\u00b6 6} We begin with simple premises. \u201cIn general, a void judgment is one that has been imposed by a court that lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over the case or the authority to act. <em>State v. Payne, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 502, 2007-Ohio-4642, 873 N.E.2d 306, \u00b6 27. Unlike a void judgment, a voidable judgment is one rendered by a court that has both jurisdiction and authority to act, but the court\u2019s judgment is invalid, irregular, or erroneous.\u201d <em>State v. Simpkins, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 420, 2008-Ohio-1197, 884 N.E.2d 568, at \u00b6 12. But those statements of law have sparked a recurrent and increasingly divisive debate in our case law on sentences that fail to properly impose postrelease control in accordance with the terms mandated by the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">{\u00b6 7} The crux of our debate arises from the fact that in the normal course, sentencing errors are not jurisdictional and do not render a judgment void. <em>State ex rel. Massie v. Rogers </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 449, 449-450, 674 N.E.2d 1383; <em>Majoros v. Collins </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 442, 443, 596 N.E.2d 1038. Rather, void sentences are typically those in which a court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the defendant. <em>Payne.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">{\u00b6 8} But in the modern era, Ohio law has consistently recognized a narrow, and imperative, exception to that general rule: a sentence that is not in accordance with statutorily mandated terms is void. See, e.g., <em>Simpkins, </em>at \u00b6 14; <em>State v. Bezak, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 94, 2007-Ohio-3250, 868 N.E.2d 961; <em>State v. Jordan, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 21, 2004-Ohio-6085, 817 N.E.2d 864; <em>State v. Beasley </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 74, 75, 14 OBR 511, 471 N.E.2d 774; <em>Colegrove v. Burns </em>(1964), 175 Ohio St. 437, 25 O.O.2d 447, 195 N.E.2d 811. See also <em>Woods v. Telb </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 504, 733 N.E.2d 1103.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>{\u00b6 9} Although our case law on void judgments was rooted in cases in which courts lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, it evolved beyond those roots over the years. By the time we decided <em>Beasley, </em>it had developed into the principle that \u201c[a]ny attempt by a court to disregard statutory requirements * * * renders the attempted sentence a nullity or void.\u201d Id., 14 Ohio St.3d at 75, 14 OBR 511, 471 N.E.2d 774. And although <em>Beasley </em>may be recognized more for the principle that jeopardy does not attach to a void sentence, and thus the correction of a void sentence would not constitute double jeopardy, id., its underlying principles governing void sentences formed the basis for our holding in <em>Jordan, </em>a postre-lease-control case.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">{\u00b6 10} In <em>Jordan, </em>we recognized that \u201c[t]he court\u2019s duty to include a notice to the offender about postrelease control at the sentencing hearing is the same as any other statutorily mandated term of a sentence. And based on the reasoning in <em>Beasley, </em>a trial court\u2019s failure to notify an offender at the sentencing hearing about postrelease control is error.\u201d <em>Jordan, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 21, 2004-Ohio-6085, 817 N.E.2d 864, at \u00b6 26. We held that \u201c[b]ecause a trial court has a statutory duty to provide notice of postrelease control at the sentencing hearing, any sentence imposed without such notification is contrary to law. As a general rule, if an appellate court determines that a sentence is clearly and convincingly contrary to law, it may remand for resentencing. See R.C. 2953.08(G)(2). Furthermore, where a sentence is void because it does not contain a statutorily mandated term, the proper remedy is, likewise, to resentence the defendant. <em>State v. Beasley </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 74, 14 OBR 511, 471 N.E.2d 774.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Jordan </em>at \u00b6 23. We then vacated the entire sentence and remanded for resentencing. Id. at \u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">{\u00b6 11} Three years after <em>Jordan, </em>we issued our decision in <em>Bezak, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 94, 2007-Ohio-3250, 868 N.E.2d 961. <em>Bezak </em>is significant in that it was the most divisive decision by the court in the contexts of void and voidable judgments and nonconforming postrelease-control sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">{\u00b6 12} There, a majority held that when a court of appeals remands a case for resentencing because of the trial court\u2019s failure to inform the offender at the sentencing hearing that he may be subject to postrelease control, the court must conduct a new sentencing hearing in its entirety rather than a hearing limited to reimposing the original sentence with proper notice of postrelease control. Id. at \u00b6 6. In so holding, the majority in <em>Bezak </em>indicated that it found <em>Jordan </em>dispositive. Id. at \u00b6 12. But the majority also relied heavily on <em>Romito v. Maxwell </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 266, 267-268, 39 O.O.2d 414, 227 N.E.2d 223, for the proposition that the effect of a void judgment is that the judgment is a nullity, and the parties are in the same position as if there had been no judgment. <em>Bezak </em>at \u00b6 12-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>{\u00b6 13} <em>Romito, </em>a habeas case from 1967, was in many ways inapposite to <em>Bezak. </em>Romito was a habeas petitioner and recidivist offender who had been convicted of armed robbery and repeated instances of burglary between 1941 and 1957. All of those offenses led to imprisonment, as well as an indictment as a habitual criminal, to which he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 15 years, \u201cthat being the statutory maximum for his last prior conviction for burglary.\u201d <em>Romito </em>at 266. The habitual-criminal enhancement was declared void, however, and he then sought habeas relief and release from confinement on the underlying burglary sentence, which he asserted had also been voided. Id. Although Romito remained in custody lawfully under a prior valid sentence for other offenses, the court agreed that \u201c[t]he vacation of the prior burglary sentence in the instant case was an integral part of the habitual criminal proceedings, and when such habitual criminal proceedings were declared void the vacation of the burglary sentence was also voided.\u201d Id., 10 Ohio St.2d at 267-268, 39 O.O.2d 414, 227 N.E.2d 223.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">{\u00b6 14} The court in <em>Romito </em>supported that conclusion by relying on <em>Tari v. State </em>(1927), 117 Ohio St. 481, 159 N.E. 594, and <em>Hill v. Hill </em>(1945), 299 Ky. 351, 185 S.W.2d 245. Though different from each other, both <em>Tari </em>and <em>Hill </em>presented quintessential jurisdictional questions. Thus, <em>Romito </em>represents the historic, narrow view of void judgments, which is limited to the class of cases in which jurisdiction, rather than statutory sentencing mandates, is implicated. See <em>State v. Holcomb, </em>184 Ohio App.3d 577, 2009-Ohio-3187, 921 N.E.2d 1077, \u00b6 4-7 (noting early Ohio Supreme Court cases treating sentences that did not conform to mandatory prison terms as voidable rather than void).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">{\u00b6 15} Based on the language from <em>Romito, </em>the majority in <em>Bezak </em>rejected the appellate court\u2019s ruling that the sentence in <em>Bezak </em>should be remanded to the trial court so that the defendant \u201c \u2018may be advised that he is subject to post-release control.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bezak, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 94, 2007-Ohio-3250, 868 N.E.2d 961, at \u00b6 13, quoting <em>State v. Bezak, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 84008, 2004-Ohio-6623, 2004 WL 2830799, \u00b6 41. In doing so, it quoted and applied the language from <em>Romito </em>and held that the effect of vacating the sentence was to position the parties in the same place as if there had been <em>no </em>sentence. Id. at \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">{\u00b6 16} That conclusion required the majority to distinguish the decision in <em>State v. Saxon, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 176, 2006-Ohio-1245, 846 N.E.2d 824, which holds that a sentencing hearing on remand is limited to the issue found to be in error on the appeal. Id. at paragraph three of the syllabus. To do so, the majority narrowly read <em>Saxon </em>to apply only to multiple-offense cases and not to defendants such as Bezak, who had been convicted of only one offense. Yet the majority still applied <em>Romito, </em>a far more complicated case than <em>Saxon, </em>and one that arose from multiple convictions for multiple offenses. Id. at \u00b6 13. Notwith<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>standing that analytical inconsistency, the majority in <em>Bezak </em>then summarily concluded, \u201cTherefore, Bezak\u2019s entire sentence was vacated upon the court of appeals\u2019 decision to sustain his one assignment of error.\u201d Id. It dispensed with any applicability of <em>Saxon </em>to the issue presented in <em>Bezak. </em>Nor did it consider cases or doctrines that reflected the rationales at issue in <em>Saxon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">{\u00b6 17} As the first dissenting opinion in <em>Bezak </em>observed, \u201c[j]ust as <em>Saxon </em>held that a complete resentencing is not required when a defendant on appeal prevails on a challenge only as to one offense in a multiple-offense case, a complete de novo resentencing is not required when a defendant prevails only as to the postrelease-control aspect of a particular sentence. In this situation, the postrelease-control component of the sentence is fully capable of being separated from the rest of the sentence as an independent component, and the limited resentencing must cover only the postrelease control. It is only the postrelease-control aspect of the sentence that is void and that must be rectified. The remainder of the sentence, which the defendant did not successfully challenge, remains valid under the principles of res judicata. See <em>Saxon </em>[109 Ohio St.3d 176, 2006-Ohio-1245, 846 N.E.2d 824], at \u00b6 17-19.\u201d <em>Bezak, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 94, 2007-Ohio-3250, 868 N.E.2d 961, at \u00b6 21-22 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting, joined by Lundberg Stratton, J.). See also id. at \u00b6 31 (Lanzinger, J., dissenting) (\u201cI believe this holding [in <em>Bezak\\ </em>undermines the principles of res judicata that we discussed in <em>[Saxon]\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">{\u00b6 18} Although neither the majority nor the dissents in <em>Bezak </em>discussed it at the time, the scope of the remand in <em>Bezak </em>was a critical aspect of void judgments. And so it is at this juncture that we revisit that law before proceeding further.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">{\u00b6 19} As described at the outset of our analysis, our debate over whether the failure of a sentencing judge to comply with a statutory mandate renders the ensuing judgment void arises from our disagreement over the narrow, historic view that limits void judgments to cases in which the court acts without jurisdiction. See generally <em>Simpkins, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 420, 2008-Ohio-1197, 884 N.E.2d 568, at \u00b6 42-43 (Lanzinger, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">{\u00b6 20} But in the modern era, in which we have a more sophisticated understanding of individual rights, we have not so severely limited the notion of void judgments to only those judgments that arise from jurisdictional cases. See, e.g., <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, \u00b6 103-104. The historic, narrow view does not adequately address the constitutional infirmities of a sentence imposed without statutory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>{\u00b6 21} The majority\u2019s decision to include sentences that disregard legislatively imposed mandates within a narrow class of void judgments reflects a fundamental understanding of constitutional democracy: judges are not imperial. We recognize that our authority to sentence in criminal cases is limited by the people through the Ohio Constitution and by our legislators through the Revised Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">{\u00b6 22} Judges have no inherent power to create sentences. Griffin &amp; Katz, Ohio Felony Sentencing Law (2008) 4, Section 1:3, fn. 1. See also Woods <em>v. Telb, </em>89 Ohio St.3d at 507-509, 733 N.E.2d 1103 (describing the legislative intent behind a new, comprehensive sentencing structure, including postrelease control). Rather, judges are duty-bound to apply sentencing laws as they are written. See <em>State v. Thomas </em>(1996), 111 Ohio App.3d 510, 512, 676 N.E.2d 903. \u201c[T]he only sentence which a trial court may impose is that provided for by statute. A court has no power to substitute a different sentence for that provided for by statute or one that is either greater or lesser than that provided for by law.\u201d <em>Colegrove, </em>175 Ohio St. at 438, 25 O.O.2d 447, 195 N.E.2d 811. The failure to impose a statutorily mandated period of postrelease control is more than administrative or clerical error. It is an act that lacks both statutory and constitutional authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">{\u00b6 23} No court has the authority to impose a sentence that is contrary to law. <em>Colegrove, </em>175 Ohio St. at 438, 25 O.O.2d 447, 195 N.E.2d 811. We reaffirm that vital principle today and reiterate that a judge must conform to the General Assembly\u2019s mandate in imposing postrelease-control sanctions as part of a criminal sentence. Although the interests in finality of a sentence are important, they cannot trump the interests of justice, which require a judge to follow the letter of the law in sentencing a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">{\u00b6 24} Other states\u2019 courts hold similarly, using the voidness doctrine as well as a related theory, the illegal-sentence doctrine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Summers v. State </em>(Tenn.2007), 212 S.W.3d 251, 256 (describing a sentence imposed in direct contravention of a statute as illegal and subject to correction at any time); <em>State v. Gayden </em>(2006), 281 Kan. 290, 292-293, 130 P.3d 108 (\u201cA sentence for which no statutory authority exists does not conform to statutory provisions and is, therefore, within the definition of an illegal sentence\u201d); <em>Sullivan v. State </em>(2006), 366 Ark. 183, 234 S.W.3d 285 (\u201cWhere the law does not authorize the particular sentence pronounced by a trial court, the sentence is unauthorized and illegal\u201d); <em>Mizell v. State </em>(Tex.Crim.App.2003), 119 S.W.3d 804, 806 (\u201cA sentence that is outside the maximum or minimum range of punishment is unauthorized by law and therefore illegal\u201d); <em>United States v. Greatwalker </em>(C.A.8, 2002), 285 F.3d 727, 729 (\u201cA sentence is illegal when it is not authorized by the judgment of conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>or when it is greater or less than the permissible statutory penalty for the crime\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cA motion to correct an illegal sentence \u2018presupposes a valid conviction and may not, therefore, be used to challenge alleged errors in proceedings that occur prior to the imposition of sentence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Edwards v. State </em>(1996), 112 Nev. 704, 708, 918 P.2d 321, quoting <em>Allen v. United States </em>(D.C.1985), 495 A.2d 1145, 1149. It is, however, an appropriate vehicle for raising the claim that a sentence is facially illegal at any time. Id. The scope of relief based on a rule, like Fed.R.Crim.P. 35, is likewise constrained to the narrow function of correcting only the illegal sentence. It does not permit reexamination of all perceived errors at trial or in other proceedings prior to sentencing. See, e.g., <em>Hill v. United States </em>(1962), 368 U.S. 424, 430, 82 S.Ct. 468, 7 L.Ed.2d 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">{\u00b6 26} We similarly hold that when a judge fails to impose statutorily mandated postrelease control as part of a defendant\u2019s sentence, that <em>part </em>of the sentence is void and must be set aside.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Neither the Constitution nor common sense commands anything more.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">{\u00b6 27} This principle is an important part of the analysis of void sentences that we have not focused upon in prior cases involving postrelease control, including <em>Bezak, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 94, 2007-Ohio-3250, 868 N.E.2d 961. Thus, we reaffirm the portion of the syllabus in <em>Bezak </em>that states \u201c[w]hen a defendant is convicted of or pleads guilty to one or more offenses and postrelease control is not properly included in a sentence for a particular offense, the sentence for that offense is void,\u201d but with the added proviso that only the offending portion of the sentence is subject to review and correction.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">{\u00b6 28} However, we now modify the second sentence in the <em>Bezak </em>syllabus as ill-considered. That sentence states that the offender is entitled to a new sentencing hearing for the offense for which postrelease control was not imposed properly. 114 Ohio St.3d 94, 2007-Ohio-3250, 868 N.E.2d 961. It does not recognize a principle that we overlooked in <em>Bezak: </em>when an appellate court concludes that a sentence imposed by a trial court is in part void, only the portion that is void may be vacated or otherwise amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">{\u00b6 29} Therefore, we hold that the new sentencing hearing to which an offender is entitled under <em>Bezak </em>is limited to proper imposition of postrelease control. In so holding, we come more into line with legislative provisions concerning appellate review of criminal sentences. R.C. 2953.08(G)(2)(b) permits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>an appellate court, upon finding that a sentence is clearly and convincingly contrary to law, to remand for resentencing. But a remand is just one arrow in the quiver. R.C. 2953.08(G)(2) also provides that an appellate court may \u201cincrease, reduce or otherwise modify a sentence * * * or may vacate the sentence and remand the matter to the sentencing court for resentencing.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Correcting a defect in a sentence without a remand is an option that has been used in Ohio and elsewhere for years in cases in which the original sentencing court, as here, had no sentencing discretion. See, e.g., <em>State v. Winters </em>(July 22, 1982), Cuyahoga App. No. 42799, 1982 WL 2499, *3; <em>State v. Coughlin, </em>Ashtabula App. No. 2006-A-0026, 2007-Ohio-897, 2007 WL 635286; <em>State v. Gimbrone, </em>Montgomery App. No. 23062, 2009-Ohio-6264, 2009 WL 4268576; <em>People v. Kelly </em>(1965), 66 Ill.App.2d 204, 211, 214 N.E.2d 290; <em>State v. Sheppard </em>(A.D.1973), 125 N.J.Super. 332, 336, 310 A.2d 731; <em>Harness v. State </em>(2003), 352 Ark. 335, 339, 101 S.W.3d 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">{\u00b6 30} Correcting the defect without remanding for resentencing can provide an equitable, economical, and efficient remedy for a void sentence. Here, we adopt that remedy in one narrow area: in cases in which a trial judge does not impose postrelease control in accordance with statutorily mandated terms. In such a case, the sentence is void. Principles of res judicata, including the doctrine of the law of the case, do not preclude appellate review. The sentence may be reviewed at any time, on direct appeal or by collateral attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">{\u00b6 31} Our decision today is limited to a discrete vein of cases: those in which a court does not properly impose a statutorily mandated period of postrelease control. In cases involving postrelease control, we will continue to adhere to our narrow, discrete line of cases addressing the unique problems that have arisen in the application of that law and the underlying statute. In light of the General Assembly\u2019s enactment of R.C. 2929.191, it is likely that our work in this regard is drawing to a close, at least for purposes of void sentences. Even if that is not the case, however, we would be ill-served by the approach advocated by the dissent, which is premised on an unpalatable and unpersuasive foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">{\u00b6 32} With the law and scope of the question before us today now clarified, we turn to the specific question posed in this appeal, as reframed in our new language: is a direct appeal from a resentencing on a remand from an appeal finding that a sentence was void the \u201cfirst\u201d direct appeal as of right because the first appeal was a \u201cnullity\u201d? Like the court of appeals, we answer that question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>{\u00b6 33} The court of appeals correctly ruled that Fischer, having already had the benefit of one direct appeal, could not raise any and all claims of error in a second, successive appeal. 181 Ohio App.3d 758, 2009-Ohio-1491, 910 N.E.2d 1083. The court of appeals based its decision on the law-of-the-case doctrine, which provides that \u201cthe decision of a reviewing court in a case remains the law of that case on the legal questions involved for all subsequent proceedings in the case at both the trial and reviewing levels.\u201d <em>Nolan v. Nolan </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 1, 3, 11 OBR 1, 462 N.E.2d 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">{\u00b6 34} Other state supreme courts have used the law-of-the-case doctrine in cases of illegal sentences. See, e.g., <em>Brittingham v. State </em>(Del.1998), 705 A.2d 577, 579. The doctrine retains its vitality in Ohio. In discussing the doctrine, we have held that it \u201cprecludes a litigant from attempting to rely on arguments at a retrial which were fully pursued, or available to be pursued, in a first appeal\u201d and noted that \u201c[n]ew arguments are subject to issue preclusion, and are barred.\u201d <em>Hubbard ex rel. Creed v. Sauline </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 402, 404-405, 659 N.E.2d 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">{\u00b6 35} The law-of-the-case doctrine is rooted in principles of res judicata and issue preclusion, and we have expressly disfavored applying res judicata to sentences that do not conform to statutory postrelease-control mandates. <em>Simpkins, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 420, 2008-Ohio-1197, 884 N.E.2d 568, \u00b6 30. We also reject the application of issue preclusion to sentences that do not comply with statutory mandates, as those sentences are illegal and subject to collateral attack or direct appeal by any party.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">{\u00b6 36} But other than <em>Bezak, </em>the ease law has thus far focused only on whether a defendant is barred from raising claims about a void sentence rather than on the remedy therefor. We do not disturb that precedent. Instead, our decision today revisits only one component of the holding in <em>Bezak, </em>and we overrule only that portion of the syllabus that requires a complete resentencing hearing rather than a hearing restricted to the void portion of the sentence. In light of our holding, the court of appeals in this case correctly held that Fischer\u2019s remaining claims, which did not involve a void sentence or judgment, were barred by res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">{\u00b6 37} In so holding, we reject Fischer\u2019s claim that there was no final, appealable order in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">{\u00b6 38} Fischer\u2019s theory is that because the trial court did not properly apply postrelease-control sanctions, his sentence was void under <em>Bezak. </em>Because his sentence was void, he contends, there was no sentence, and without a sentence, no conviction and no final order. See <em>State v. Whitfield, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 319, 2010-Ohio-2, 922 N.E.2d 182 (\u201ca \u2018conviction\u2019 consists of a guilty verdict <em>and </em>the imposition of a sentence or penalty\u201d [emphasis sic]); <em>State v. Baker, </em>119 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>St.3d 197, 2008-Ohio-3330, 893 N.E.2d 163, syllabus (to be a final, appealable order, a judgment of conviction must include the sentence). In Fischer\u2019s view, the absence of a conviction means the absence of a final, appealable order, and the absence of such an order deprived the court of appeals of its jurisdiction over the initial appeal, thereby rendering that appeal invalid. The argument, though creative, fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">{\u00b6 39} Nothing in <em>Baker </em>discusses void or voidable sentences. Rather, the syllabus speaks only to the requirement that the judgment of conviction set forth \u201cthe sentence\u201d in addition to the other necessary aspects of the judgment. The judgment in this case did set forth the sentence. The fact that the sentence was illegal does not deprive the appellate court of jurisdiction to consider and correct the error. In fact, R.C. 2953.08(G)(2)(b) expressly authorizes a reviewing court to modify or vacate any sentence that is \u201ccontrary to law.\u201d Clearly, no such authority could exist if an unlawful sentence rendered a judgment nonfinal and unappealable. Thus, <em>Baker </em>does not avail Fischer.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">{\u00b6 40} Our intention today is to provide a clear, simple, and more workable solution to a vexing issue without compromising the interests of fairness. In balancing those interests here, we have carefully considered the law in a combined effort to craft the most equitable solution. We therefore hold that void sentences are not precluded from appellate review by principles of res judicata and may be reviewed at any time, on direct appeal or by collateral attack. We further hold that although the doctrine of res judicata does not preclude review of a void sentence, res judicata still applies to other aspects of the merits of a conviction, including the determination of guilt and the lawful elements of the ensuing sentence. The scope of an appeal from a resentencing hearing in which a mandatory term of postrelease control is imposed is limited to issues arising at the resentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b234-9\">Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b234-10\">Lanzinger, J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b234-11\">Brown, C.J., not participating.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b230-7\">.

Unless we were to frankly overrule the aberrant cases on void sentences, I would accept the appellant\u2019s proposition of law and reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">{\u00b6 42} The majority holds that void sentences are \u201cnot precluded from appellate review by principles of res judicata and may be reviewed at any time, on direct appeal or by collateral attack.\u201d But it holds further that \u201c[although the doctrine of res judicata does not preclude review of a void sentence, res judicata still applies to other aspects of the merits of a conviction, including the determination of guilt and the lawful elements of the ensuing sentence.\u201d In other words, a sentence that is \u201cvoid\u201d because of an error in imposing postrelease control is now only \u201cpartially void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">{\u00b6 43} Consequently, an appeal may be taken of any postrelease-control error at any time, but apparently the court of appeals is to correct only the erroneous portion of the sentence, rather than conduct a de novo sentencing hearing. This holding effectively overrules the second sentence of the syllabus in <em>State v. Bezak, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 94, 2007-Ohio-3250, 868 N.E.2d 961.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">{\u00b6 44} I respectfully dissent because I believe that it would be more sensible for us to completely abandon <em>Bezak, </em>and its progeny and instead hold that these errors are correctable on direct appeal within the usual time for appellate review. This approach honors Ohio legal precedent, promotes judicial economy, and treats both the state and defendants equally and fairly.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">I. The Majority Has Redefined the Term \u201cVoid\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">{\u00b6 45} Before the line of cases starting a mere three years ago with <em>Bezak, </em>this court repeatedly held that sentencing errors are nonjurisdictional and that these errors are properly corrected on appeal. See <em>State ex rel. Shackleford v. Moore, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 310, 2007-Ohio-6462, 878 N.E.2d 1035, \u00b6 5; <em>Childers v. Wingard </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 427, 428, 700 N.E.2d 588; <em>Majoros v. Collins </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 442, 443, 596 N.E.2d 1038; <em>Blackburn v. Jago </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 139, 529 N.E.2d 929. A sentence is not \u201cvoid ab initio\u201d if a mistake was made during its imposition; it is voidable. \u201cVoid\u201d and \u201cvoidable\u201d are fundamental legal terms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>In 2007, we set forth clear definitions of those terms in <em>State v. Payne, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 502, 2007-Ohio-4642, 873 N.E.2d 306, \u00b6 27.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">{\u00b6 46} Within the past year, a unanimous United States Supreme Court also had no trouble in defining the term \u201cvoid\u201d: \u201cA void judgment is a legal nullity. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1822 (3d ed.1933); see also <em>id., </em>at 1709 (9th ed.2009). Although the term \u2018void\u2019 describes a result, rather than the conditions that render a judgment unenforceable, it suffices to say that a void judgment is one so affected by a fundamental infirmity that the infirmity may be raised even after the judgment becomes final. See Restatement (Second) of Judgments 22 (1980); see generally <em>id., </em>\u00a7 12.\u201d <em>United Student Aid Funds, Inc. v. Espinosa </em>(2010), \u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 1367, 1377, 176 L.Ed.2d 158. The court\u2019s opinion continues: \u201c <em>A judgment is not void, \u2019 for example, \u2018simply because it is or may have been erroneous.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., quoting <em>Hoult v. Hoult </em>(C.A.1, 1995), 57 F.3d 1, 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">{\u00b6 47} Redefinition of the term \u201cvoid\u201d to include sentences containing errors in postrelease control is an entirely unnecessary reaction to the consequences of the \u201cmodern era\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> cases relied on in the majority opinion. According to these recent cases, a sentence is void, i.e., a nullity, and everything that occurs after the sentence is also a nullity, until a valid sentencing occurs. See <em>State v. Simpkins, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 420, 2008-Ohio-1197, 884 N.E.2d 568, \u00b6 14-21. Logically, then, the void-sentence doctrine should allow defendants to pursue a second direct appeal after a resentencing, since the resentencing is the first \u201cvalid\u201d sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">{\u00b6 48} A more troublesome part of the majority\u2019s holding is that although the sentence remains \u201cvoid,\u201d a defendant will not receive the benefit of the resentenc-ing mandated by R.C. 2929.19, which protects defendants\u2019 due process rights.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>II. Sentencing Errors Are Correctable on Direct Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">{\u00b6 49} An approach that deems certain sentences \u201cillegal\u201d or \u201cpartially void\u201d is ill-suited for Ohio law. A close reading of cases from other jurisdictions cited in the majority opinion reveals that the cited cases arise from a variety of factual circumstances and procedural postures far removed from a judge\u2019s error in imposing postrelease control. Many of these jurisdictions rely upon statutes or rules that give their courts the power to review erroneous or \u201cillegal\u201d sentences at any time. The majority\u2019s approach has been rejected by the federal courts, which now correct sentencing errors with the method used by Ohio prior to <em>Bezak.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">{\u00b6 50} More than two decades ago, language was eliminated from the federal rules that allowed courts to correct an \u201cillegal sentence\u201d at any time. P.L. No. 98-473, 98 Stat. 2015. Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a) now provides, \u201cWithin 14 days after sentencing, the court may correct a sentence that resulted from arithmetical, technical, or other clear error.\u201d However, if a federal sentencing error is not correctable under this rule or under Fed.R.Crim.P. 36 as a clerical error, it may be corrected only on direct appeal or, in limited cases, by a writ of habeas corpus under Section 2255, Title 28, U.S.Code. See generally <em>United States v. Collins </em>(Apr. 26, 2010), N.D.Ill. No. 04 CR 709, 2010 WL 1727852. Rather than follow a system rejected by the federal courts, it would be more \u201cpalatable\u201d to follow the current federal system that has been in place since 1987.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">{\u00b6 51} Ohio\u2019s rules and statutes currently do not allow for correction of sentences \u201cat any time.\u201d Thus, sentencing errors must be corrected on direct appeal. Indeed, this method is consistent with the statute governing appellate review of sentences. R.C. 2953.08(G) does allow appellate courts a number of options to correct sentences that fail to comply with statutory requirements. But that statute also properly limits these options so that courts may exercise them only on <em>direct appeal. </em>This ensures finality in sentencing while still allowing for the correction of any errors as part of an appeal as of right, either by the defendant or the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">III. A Return to Historical Distinctions Will Promote Justice and Finality</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">{\u00b6 52} It is time to return to the historic, narrow, and accurate view of void judgments as being those rendered without jurisdiction. See <em>Ex parte Winslow </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>(1915), 91 Ohio St. 328, 330, 110 N.E. 539 (if a court did not act under a statute, the sentence was erroneous and voidable, not void); <em>Stahl v. Currey </em>(1939), 135 Ohio St. 253, 14 O.O. 112, 20 N.E.2d 529 (jail sentence imposed by a magistrate who is not statutorily authorized to impose such a sentence is not void, but only voidable, because the magistrate did not wholly lack jurisdiction to impose a sentence); <em>Carmelo v. Maxwell </em>(1962), 173 Ohio St. 569, 570, 20 O.O.2d 170, 184 N.E.2d 405 (a sentence imposed contrary to the terms of a statute is not void). Limiting the term \u201cvoid\u201d to cases in which a court acts without jurisdiction is a deeply rooted concept in this court\u2019s decisions and was the law of Ohio in regard to sentencing errors as recently as 2007. This approach' \u2014 not a repackaging of the void-sentence doctrine \u2014 honors Ohio precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">{\u00b6 53} The real question here is \u201cWhat is the proper remedy when a judge makes a sentencing mistake?\u201d Our sentencing statutes recognize the possibility that a judge may err in sentencing by allowing parties 30 days to appeal sentences on grounds that they are contrary to law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Allowing for challenges to sentencing error on direct appeal gives the state and the defense ample opportunity to draw attention to any potential postrelease-control error, thus satisfying any constitutional concerns arising from an imperfect sentence. Licensed attorneys should be competent to perform their duties during a sentencing hearing, and it is not unreasonable for prosecutors and defense counsel to review the judgment issued in a case to ensure that the sentence complies with Ohio law. <em>This </em>approach is the pragmatic approach \u2014 equitable, economical, and efficient. Most importantly, it is the approach contained in Ohio\u2019s sentencing scheme, which provides for direct appeal by either party in a criminal case. See R.C. 2953.08.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">{\u00b6 54} The majority has essentially elevated postrelease-control mistakes to the level of \u201csuper-error\u201d to allow untimely challenges to parts of the sentence that could very easily be brought on direct appeal and corrected as other sentencing errors are. While it is critical that sentences comply with statutory mandates, any concern over mistakes omitting mandatory postrelease control could easily be obviated if all prosecutors and defense attorneys attended the sentencing hearings and reviewed the sentencing entries in their cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">{\u00b6 55} The General Assembly has created a prospective remedy for the problem of postrelease-control notification by enacting R.C. 2929.191, but according to our holdings in <em>State v. Singleton, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 173, 2009-Ohio-6434, 920 N.E.2d 958, the rules announced today apply to sentences imposed before July 11, 2006.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b239-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Sherri Bevan Walsh, Summit County Prosecuting Attorney, and Heaven DiMartino, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b239-7\">Timothy Young, Ohio Public Defender, and Claire R.

Ingram, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, urging affirmance for amicus curiae Ohio Prosecuting Attorneys Association.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b239-3\">{\u00b6 56} It is hoped that this decision today is truly limited to a discrete vein of cases: those \u201cin which a court does not properly impose a statutorily mandated period of postrelease control,\u201d in other words, only those cases in which the state has not obtained a mandatory monitoring period in addition to a defendant\u2019s prison sentence. My fear is that the broad language in the majority opinion has the potential to apply to other statutory mandates, creating other \u201cvoid\u201d sentences that may be infinitely appealable, and then modified without a full rehearing under R.C. 2929.19(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">{\u00b6 57} We can easily correct the problems arising from the void-sentence doctrine by simply clarifying that mistakes in imposing sentences make the sentence merely voidable, that is, subject to being reversed on direct appeal. I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b235-11\">. Notably, this also overrules paragraph one of the syllabus in last year\u2019s decision in <em>State v.
