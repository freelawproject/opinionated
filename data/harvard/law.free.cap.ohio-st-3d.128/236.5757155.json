Because the judge patently and unambiguously lacked jurisdiction to remedy a Crim.R. 32(C) defect by granting a judgment of acquittal, <em>we </em>reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and grant the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-14\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b368-15\">\n<em>Criminal Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b368-16\">{\u00b6 2} In 1994, a jury convicted Nancy Smith and Joseph Allen of numerous sex offenses involving children enrolled in the Lorain Head Start Program. In the Lorain County Court of Common Pleas\u2019 sentencing entries for Smith and Allen, the court noted that they had appeared in court for sentencing \u201cafter having been found guilty\u201d of the various offenses. The sentencing entries did not specify the manner of the convictions \u2014 that Smith and Allen had been found guilty by a jury. Smith and Allen were both sentenced to lengthy prison terms. On appeal, the Court of Appeals for Lorain County affirmed the convictions and sentences. See <em>State v. Smith </em>(Jan. 24, 1996), Lorain App. No. 95CA006070, 1996 WL 27908, and <em>State v. Allen </em>(Feb. 7, 1996), Lorain App. No. 94CA005944, 1996 WL 48550.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>{\u00b6 3} In 2008, Smith filed a motion for reconsideration of her sentence. In 2009, Allen filed a motion for resentencing. The defendants claimed that their August 1994 sentencing entries did not comply with Crim.R. 32(C) and thus did not constitute final, appealable orders. Appellee, Lorain County Court of Common Pleas Judge James M. Burge, who succeeded the judge who had sentenced the defendants to prison, granted the motions and vacated the convictions and sentences. Judge Burge ruled that the court\u2019s jurisdiction included \u201cthe preparation of a corrected sentencing entry or, in the court\u2019s discretion, a resentencing.\u201d On June 24, 2009, Judge Burge entered judgments of acquittal pursuant to Crim.R. 29(C) for both Smith and Allen, discharged them, and ordered the Lorain County Sheriffs Department to remove them from the sex-offender registration and notification system.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">\n<em>Prohibition Cases</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">{\u00b6 4} In December 2009, appellants, Richard Cordray, who was the Ohio Attorney General at the time,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Lorain County Prosecuting Attorney Dennis Will, filed complaints in the Court of Appeals for Lorain County for writs of prohibition to compel Judge Burge to vacate his orders acquitting the defendants and to order their return to prison. Judge Burge filed motions for judgment on the pleadings and for leave to file answers instanter.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">{\u00b6 5} The court of appeals dismissed the prohibition claim concerning Smith\u2019s acquittal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. <em>State ex rel. Cordray v. Burge, </em>Lorain App. Nos. 09CA009723 and 09CA009724, 2010-Ohio-3009, 2010 WL 2622506, \u00b6 29, 36. The court of appeals determined that Judge Burge did not patently and unambiguously lack jurisdiction to reconsider the court\u2019s earlier denial of Smith\u2019s timely Crim.R. 29(C) motion for acquittal. Id. The court of appeals did, however, issue a writ of prohibition vacating Judge Burge\u2019s acquittal of Allen because, unlike Smith, Allen had not filed a timely motion for acquittal pursuant to Crim.R. 29(C). Id. at \u00b6 30, 34, 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">{\u00b6 6} This cause is now before the court upon the appeal as of right by the attorney general and the prosecuting attorney regarding the court of appeals\u2019 refusal to issue a writ in relation to Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">\n<em>Prohibition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">{\u00b6 7} To be entitled to the requested writ of prohibition vacating Smith\u2019s acquittal, the appellants were required to show that Judge Burge patently and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>unambiguously lacked jurisdiction to enter the judgment of acquittal. <em>State ex rel. Mayer v. Henson, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 276, 2002-Ohio-6323, 779 N.E.2d 223, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">\n<em>Crim.R. 32(C)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">{\u00b6 8} Crim.R. 32(C) provides that a \u201cjudgment of conviction shall set forth the plea, the verdict, or findings upon which each conviction is based, and the sentence.\u201d In <em>State v. Baker, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 197, 2008-Ohio-3330, 893 N.E.2d 163, syllabus, we explained this requirement by holding that a \u201cjudgment of conviction is a final appealable order under R.C. 2505.02 when it sets forth (1) the guilty plea, the jury verdict, or the finding of the court upon which the conviction is based; (2) the sentence; (3) the signature of the judge; and (4) entry on the journal by the clerk of court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">{\u00b6 9} Appellants initially assert that Judge Burge patently and unambiguously lacked jurisdiction to vacate Smith\u2019s convictions and sentence because the original sentencing entry complied with Crim.R. 32(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">{\u00b6 10} For the following reasons, appellants\u2019 assertion lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">{\u00b6 11} First, according to the court of appeals\u2019 opinion, the state agreed that Smith\u2019s sentencing entry did not constitute a final, appealable order. See <em>State v. Smith, </em>Lorain App. Nos. 09CA009634 and 09CA009635, 2010-Ohio-3007, 2010 WL 2622932, \u00b6 3 (\u201cthe parties briefed the question and the State conceded that the 1994 judgment of conviction was not final\u201d). A \u201c \u2018party is not permitted to take advantage of an error that he himself invited or induced the court to make.\u2019 \u201d <em>Webber v. Kelly, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 440, 2008-Ohio-6695, 900 N.E.2d 175, \u00b6 7, quoting <em>Davis v. Wolfe </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 549, 552, 751 N.E.2d 1051.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">{\u00b6 12} Second, appellants themselves, in their complaint for extraordinary relief in prohibition, requested that Judge Burge \u201cissue a corrected sentence pursuant to <em>State v. Baker, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 197, 2008-Ohio-3330 [893 N.E.2d 163].\u201d Again, appellants thus invited any error by the court of appeals in holding that Smith\u2019s sentencing entry did not comply with Crim.R. 32(C) and <em>Baker. Webber </em>at \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">{\u00b6 13} Finally, Smith\u2019s sentencing entry did not comply with Crim.R. 32(C). In <em>Baker, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 197, 2008-Ohio-3330, 893 N.E.2d 163, at \u00b6 14, we found that under Crim.R. 32(C), \u201ca trial court is required to sign and journalize a document memorializing the sentence <em>and the manner of the conviction: </em>a guilty plea, a no contest plea upon which the court has made a finding of guilt, a finding of guilt based upon a bench trial, or a guilty verdict resulting from a jury trial.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Smith\u2019s sentencing entry recited only that she had been found guilty of the various offenses and did not disclose that she had been found guilty by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>{\u00b6 14} Contrary to appellants\u2019 assertion, our holding in <em>State ex rel. Barr v. Sutula, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 193, 2010-Ohio-3213, 931 N.E.2d 1078, does not require a different result. In that case, we held that a sentencing entry in a criminal case in which the defendant had been found guilty by the court after a bench trial complied with Crim.R. 32(C) because it contained language that the defendant had been found guilty by the court. By contrast, here, the sentencing entry did not disclose that Smith had been found guilty by a jury. <em>Barr </em>did not overrule <em>Baker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">{\u00b6 15} Therefore, appellants\u2019 first contention lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">\n<em>Remedy for Correcting a Sentencing Entry that Does Not Comply ivith Crim.R. 32(C)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">{\u00b6 16} Appellants next claim that Judge Burge\u2019s jurisdiction to correct the Crim.R. 32(C) deficiency in Smith\u2019s sentencing entry was limited to issuing a nunc pro tunc entry correcting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">{\u00b6 17} Pursuant to Crim.R. 36, \u201c[cjlerical mistakes in judgments, orders, or other parts of the record, and errors in the record arising from oversight or omission, may be corrected by the court at any time.\u201d \u201c[CJourts possess inherent authority to correct clerical errors in judgment entries so that the record speaks the truth.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Cruzado v. Zaleski, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 353, 2006-Ohio-5795, 856 N.E.2d 263, \u00b6 19. \u201c[NJunc pro tunc entries \u2018are limited in proper use to reflecting what the court actually decided, not what the court might or should have decided.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mayer, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 276, 2002-Ohio-6323, 779 N.E.2d 223, \u00b6 14, quoting <em>State ex rel. Fogle v. Steiner </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 158, 164, 656 N.E.2d 1288. A nunc pro tunc entry is often used to correct a sentencing entry that, because of a mere oversight or omission, does not comply with Crim.R. 32(C). See, e.g., <em>State v. Havugiyaremye, </em>Lucas App. No. L-08-1201, 2010-Ohio-4204, 2010 WL 3482546, \u00b6 1, fn. 1; <em>State v. Evans, </em>Medina App. No. 09CA0102-M, 2010-Ohio-2514, 2010 WL 2245587, \u00b6 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">{\u00b6 18} Consistent with the treatment of Crim.R. 32(C) errors as clerical mistakes that can be remedied by a nunc pro tunc entry, we have expressly held that \u201cthe remedy for a failure to comply with Crim.R. 32(C) is a revised sentencing entry rather than a new hearing.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Alicea v. Krichbaum, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 194, 2010-Ohio-3234, 931 N.E.2d 1079, \u00b6 2; see also <em>State ex rel. Culgan v. Medina Cty. Court of Common Pleas, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 535, 2008-Ohio-4609, 895 N.E.2d 805, \u00b6 10-11 (a defendant is entitled to a sentencing entry that complies with Crim.R. 32(C)); <em>Dunn v. Smith, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 364, 2008-Ohio-4565, 894 N.E.2d 312, \u00b6 10 (when a trial court fails to comply with Crim.R. 32(C), \u201cthe appropriate remedy is correcting the journal entry\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>{\u00b6 19} This result is logical. The trial court and the parties all proceeded under the presumption that the sentencing entry for Smith constituted a final, appealable order. Any failure to comply with Crim.R. 32(C) was a mere oversight that vested the trial court with <em>specific, limited jurisdiction </em>to issue a new sentencing entry to reflect what the court had previously ruled and not to issue a new sentencing order reflecting what, in a successive judge\u2019s opinion, the court should have ruled. These circumstances are thus distinguishable from egregious defects, such as an entry that is not journalized, that permit a court to vacate its previous orders. Cf. <em>State ex rel. White v. Junkin </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 335, 337-338, 686 N.E.2d 267. Moreover, the technical failure to comply with Crim.R. 32(C) by not including the manner of conviction in Smith\u2019s sentence is not a violation of a <em>statutorily </em>mandated term, so it does not render the judgment a nullity. Cf. <em>State v. Bezak, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 94, 2007-Ohio-3250, 868 N.E.2d 961, \u00b6 10-12, quoting <em>Romito v. Maxwell </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 266, 267-268, 39 O.O.2d 414, 227 N.E.2d 223; see also <em>State v. Fischer, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 92, 2010-Ohio-6238, 942 N.E.2d 332, \u00b6 39 (\u201cfact that the sentence was illegal does not deprive the appellate court of jurisdiction to consider and correct the error\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">{\u00b6 20} Contrary to Judge Burge\u2019s assertion, <em>McAllister v. Smith, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 163, 2008-Ohio-3881, 892 N.E.2d 914, \u00b6 9, and <em>Mitchell v. Smith, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 278, 2008-Ohio-6108, 898 N.E.2d 47, \u00b6 1, do not warrant a different result. In those cases, we observed that the appropriate remedy for a violation of Crim.R. 32(C) is \u201cresentencing.\u201d But we did not suggest that this term encompassed anything more than issuing a corrected sentencing entry that complies with Crim.R. 32(C). And by granting judgments of acquittal that the previous trial court judge had not, Judge Burge did far more than simply \u201cresentence\u201d Smith and Allen.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">{\u00b6 21} Based on the foregoing, Judge Burge patently and unambiguously lacked jurisdiction to vacate Smith\u2019s convictions and sentence when his authority was limited to issuing a corrected sentencing entry that complies with Crim.R. 32(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">\n<em>Judge Burge\u2019s Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">{\u00b6 22} Judge Burge, in his appellate brief, asserts that the court of appeals erred in granting a writ of prohibition vacating his acquittal of Allen. The judge, however, did not appeal from this judgment, and his argument is thus not properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">{\u00b6 23} The court of appeals erred in dismissing appellants\u2019 prohibition claim against Judge Burge concerning Smith\u2019s criminal case. We reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and grant the writ of prohibition to compel Judge Burge to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>vacate his acquittal of Smith and to issue a corrected sentencing entry that complies with Crim.R. 32(C).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ae-dedup-0\">Michael DeWine, Attorney General, Benjamin C.
