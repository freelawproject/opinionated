Because those addresses are not records for purposes of R.C. 149.43, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">{\u00b6 2} DeGroot is a retired member of the Cincinnati Retirement System. According to DeGroot, she has been adversely affected by the city\u2019s changes to the healthcare benefits of its retirees. DeGroot requested that Tilsley provide \u201ccopies of the names and addresses of all persons eligible to receive a ballot for the election of a Retiree-Trustee of the Board of Trustees of the Cincinnati Retirement System.\u201d DeGroot initially wanted the names and home addresses of city retirees to communicate with them about the changes to their healthcare benefits and about the September 2010 election of the retiree-trustee of the retirement system\u2019s board of trustees. Tilsley and the city provided DeGroot with the names of the retirees, but not their home addresses.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">{\u00b6 3} In May 2010, DeGroot filed in the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County a petition, which was subsequently amended, for a writ of mandamus to compel Tilsley and Cincinnati to provide her with access to home addresses of city retirees. Appellees filed a motion to dismiss the amended petition, and DeGroot filed a memorandum in opposition. In DeGroot\u2019s amended petition and memorandum, she relied on R.C. 149.43. The court of appeals granted appellees\u2019 motion and dismissed the amended petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">{\u00b6 4} This cause is now before the court upon DeGroot\u2019s appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">{\u00b6 5} DeGroot asserts that the court of appeals erred in dismissing her mandamus petition. Dismissal of the petition under Civ.R. 12(B)(6) is appropriate if, after all factual allegations of the petition are presumed true and all reasonable inferences are made in DeGroot\u2019s favor, it appears beyond doubt that she can prove no set of facts entitling her to the requested writ of mandamus. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number><em>State ex rel. Carnail v. McCormick, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 124, 2010-Ohio-2671, 931 N.E.2d 110, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">{\u00b6 6} Dismissal was appropriate because the home addresses of city retirees are not records under R.C. 149.011(G) so as to be subject to disclosure under R.C. 149.43. R.C. 149.011(G) defines \u201crecords\u201d for purposes of the Public Records Act as \u201cany document, device, or item, regardless of physical form or characteristic, including an electronic record as defined in section 1306.01 of the Revised Code, created or received by or coming under the jurisdiction of any public office of the state or its political subdivisions, which serves to document the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">{\u00b6 7} In <em>State ex rel. Dispatch Printing Co. v. Johnson, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 160, 2005-Ohio-4384, 833 N.E.2d 274, syllabus, we held, \u201cState-employee home addresses are generally not \u2018records\u2019 under R.C. 149.011(G) and are thus not subject to disclosure under R.C. 149.43, the Public Records Act.\u201d We concluded that home addresses of public employees do not document the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities because, at best, home addresses represent contact information used as a matter of administrative convenience. Id. at \u00b6 25. Disclosure of home addresses of public employees would thus \u201c \u2018reveal little or nothing about the employing agencies or their activities.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 27, quoting <em>United States Dept. of Defense v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth. </em>(1994), 510 U.S. 487, 497, 114 S.Ct. 1006, 127 L.Ed.2d 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">{\u00b6 8} Although <em>Dispatch Printing </em>involved state-employee home addresses rather than the home addresses of retired municipal employees, the same rationale applies. Consequently, the home addresses of Cincinnati retirees are, at best, contact information used for administrative purposes and reveal nothing about the city or its retirement system.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">{\u00b6 9} Moreover, insofar as DeGroot raises a new argument on appeal \u2014 that she is entitled to access to the requested home addresses based on the city civil service commission\u2019s duty under R.C. 124.09 and 124.40 to allow inspection of its roster, including the addresses, of all persons in the city\u2019s classified service \u2014 she has waived our consideration of it by failing to raise it in the court of appeals. See <em>McGhan v. Vettel, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 227, 2009-Ohio-2884, 909 N.E.2d 1279, \u00b626 (in appeal from judgment denying writ of prohibition, appellant waived argument that she did not raise in the court of appeals); <em>State ex rel. Ohio Civ. Serv. Emps. Assn., AFSCME, Local 11, AFL-CIO v. State Emp. Relations Bd., </em>104 Ohio St.3d 122, 2004-Ohio-6363, 818 N.E.2d 688, \u00b6 10 (in appeal from judgment granting writ of mandamus, appellant waived argument that it did not raise in the court of appeals).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AjB\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Ely M.T. Ryder, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b446-8\">John R. Curp, Cincinnati City Solicitor, and Richard Ganulin and Paula Boggs Muething, Assistant City Solicitors, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"aqp-dedup-0\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">{\u00b6 10} Therefore, the court of appeals did not err in dismissing DeGroot\u2019s amended petition for a writ of mandamus, and we affirm the court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b446-6\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b444-10\">. Although the addresses sought by DeGroot in her petition were not restricted to <em>home </em>addresses, her argument on appeal mentions only home addresses. Therefore, our opinion is likewise limited to her request for home addresses of retired public employees. See <em>State ex rel. Asti v. Ohio Dept. of Youth Servs., </em>107 Ohio St.3d 262, 2005-Ohio-6432, 838 N.E.2d 658, \u00b6 17, fn. 1; cf. <em>State ex rel. Ohio Liberty Council v. Brunner, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 315, 2010-Ohio-1845, 928 N.E.2d 410, \u00b6 61 (court need not address request contained in relators\u2019 complaint for writ of mandamus when they failed to include any argument in support of their request in their initial merit brief).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
