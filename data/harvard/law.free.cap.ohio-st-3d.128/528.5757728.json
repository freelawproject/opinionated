Barb Jr., for verdict forms and lists of prospective jurors in criminal cases involving his brother, inmate Danny Barb. Res judicata barred Herbert from instituting his own mandamus action seeking some of the same records that his brother requested because \u2014 as Danny\u2019s designee \u2014 he was in privity with him. <em>State ex rel. Barb v. Cuyahoga Cty. Jury Commr., </em>124 Ohio St.3d 238, 2010-Ohio-120, 921 N.E.2d 236; <em>State ex rel. Roberson v. Mason, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 91783, 2009-Ohio-1884, 2009 WL 1089802, \u00b6 8-9. And Danny cannot circumvent the requirement of R.C. 149.43(B)(8), which requires a finding by his sentencing judge or the judge\u2019s successor that the requested information is necessary to support what appears to be a justiciable claim, by designating his brother to request the records for him. As the court of appeals concluded, \u201cHerbert may not do indirectly what Danny is prohibited from doing directly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b660-11\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"aru-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>William D.
