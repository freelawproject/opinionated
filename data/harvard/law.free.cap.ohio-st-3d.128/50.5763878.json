Chapter 3314. We address the issue of whether a treasurer of a community school is a public official who may be strictly liable to the state for public funds lost when the school accepted public funds that it was not entitled to receive. We hold that an officer, employee, or duly authorized representative or agent of a community school is a public official and may be held strictly liable to the state for the loss of public funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-15\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b182-16\">{\u00b6 2} The International Preparatory School (\u201cTIPS\u201d), a nonprofit corporation organized under R.C. Chapter 1702, operated as a community school pursuant to R.C. Chapter 3314. Defendant-appellee Hasina Shabazz and her now-deceased husband, Da\u2019ud Abdul Malik Shabazz, were members of the board of TIPS. Pursuant to R.C. Chapter 3314, a community school is operated by a governing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>authority, pursuant to a contract with a state-approved sponsor. TIPS was sponsored by the Lucas County Educational Service Center (\u201cLCESC\u201d). As a community school, TIPS received state funding based largely upon the number of students enrolled at the school as reported to the Ohio Department of Education. R.C. 3314.08.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">{\u00b6 3} On October 18, 2005, TIPS ceased operating as a community school. On October 20, 2005, the state petitioned the trial court for, among other relief, a temporary restraining order and the appointment of a receiver to secure TIPS\u2019s assets. The trial court issued a temporary restraining order that same day and appointed a receiver in January 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">{\u00b6 4} On January 30, 2007, the state auditor issued a report of an audit of TIPS for July 1, 2004, through October 18, 2005. The auditor determined that TIPS had improperly sought and received $1,407,983 from the Department of Education by submitting inflated enrollment figures. The auditor issued a finding in favor of the Department of Education against TIPS as an entity and against Shabazz and her husband individually. In her finding for recovery, the auditor stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">{\u00b6 5} \u201c[TIPS] permanently closed and ceased its operation as a community school in October 2005. Between July 1, 2004 and October 18, 2005, [TIPS] was over funded by the Ohio Department of Education in the amount of $1,407,983, which was deposited into [TIPS\u2019s] account. The Ohio Department of Education calculated the amount overpaid for the year ended June 30, 2005 was $361,446 and for the year ended June 30, 2006 was $1,046,537. Since [TIPS] was not eligible for these funds, the funds were due the Ohio Department of Education and should have been returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cIn accordance with the foregoing facts, and pursuant to Ohio Rev.Code Section 117.28, a Finding for Recovery for public funds due the State that has not been remitted is hereby issued against [TIPS], Hasina Shabazz, Treasurer and the estate of Da\u2019ud Abdul Malik [sic], Chairman of the Board of Trustees, jointly and severally, and in favor of the Ohio Department of Education in the amount of $1,407,983.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">{\u00b6 7} R.C. 117.28 and 117.36 authorize the state to institute a civil action to reduce to judgment any audit findings that show the misuse of public funds. On August 3, 2007, the state filed an amended complaint against Shabazz and her husband\u2019s estate. In her answer to the complaint, Shabazz claimed to have been \u201ctreasurer of the International Preparatory School Corporate Board,\u201d and she continues to argue before this court that she was not the treasurer of the school, but treasurer only of the board of directors of TIPS.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">{\u00b6 8} Shabazz and the state filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Sha-bazz argued that two statutes shield her from liability: R.C. 1702.55, under which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>\u201cmembers, the directors, and the officers of a corporation shall not be personally liable for any obligation of the corporation,\u201d and R.C. 3314.071, which states that \u201c[n]o officer, director, or member of the governing authority of a community school incurs any personal liability by virtue of entering into any contract on behalf of the school.\u201d The trial court found Shabazz\u2019s reliance on the statutes misplaced, found her personally liable for the public funds at issue, and granted the state\u2019s motion for summary judgment against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">{\u00b6 9} Shabazz appealed to the Eighth District Court of Appeals. On May 21, 2009, the appellate court reversed the trial court\u2019s summary judgment. The court held that Shabazz was not a \u201cpublic official\u201d under the ordinary meaning of that term and therefore could not be held personally, strictly liable for the overpayments to TIPS. <em>Cordray v. Internatl. Preparatory School, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 91912, 2009-Ohio-2364, 2009 WL 1419484, \u00b6 31-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">{\u00b6 10} Further, the court held that since R.C. 3314.03(A)(1) mandated that community schools be established as nonprofit corporations under R.C. Chapter 1702, the officers and directors of community schools are protected by R.C. 1702.55. Id. at \u00b6 36. However, the court held that Shabazz could be liable if the state could prove that she had breached her fiduciary duty as a director of a publicly funded corporation or if the state could prove personal wrongdoing sufficient to pierce the corporate veil. Id. at \u00b6 41. The court thus held that there were genuine issues of material fact regarding whether Shabazz caused the improper payment of public money to TIPS, and it remanded the matter to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">{\u00b6 11} The cause is before this court upon the acceptance of a discretionary appeal. <em>Cordray v. Internatl. Preparatory School, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 1470, 2009-Ohio-5704, 915 N.E.2d 1253.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">Law and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">{\u00b6 12} That public officials are liable for the public funds they control is firmly entrenched in Ohio law. In <em>Crane Twp. ex rel. Stalter v. Secoy </em>(1921), 103 Ohio St. 258, 259-260, 132 N.E. 851, this court stated that it is \u201cpretty well settled under the American system of government that a public office is a public trust, and that public property and public money in the hands of or under the control of such officer or officers constitute a trust fund, for which the official as trustee should be held responsible to the same degree as the trustee of a private trust fund.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">{\u00b6 13} In <em>Seward v. Natl. Sur. Co. </em>(1929), 120 Ohio St. 47, 49, 165 N.E. 537, this court stated, \u201cIt has been the general policy, not only with government employees and appointees, but with state officers, county officers, township <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>officers, and all other public officials, to hold the public official accountable for the moneys that come into his hands * *</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">{\u00b6 14} The liability for public officials is strict: \u201cOver the years, this court has held public officials liable for the loss of public funds, even though illegal or otherwise blameworthy acts on their part were not the proximate cause of the loss of public funds.\u201d <em>State v. Herbert </em>(1976), 49 Ohio St.2d 88, 96, 358 N.E.2d 1090.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">{\u00b6 15} Although, as this court stated in <em>Herbert, </em>applying strict liability seems harsh, id., it is necessary from a public-policy standpoint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-6\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c \u2018[IJt would be distinctly against public policy not to require a public officer to account for and disburse according to law moneys that have come into his hands by virtue of his being such public officer; that it would open the door very wide for the accomplishment of the grossest frauds if public officials were permitted to present as the defense, when called on to disburse the money according to law, that it had been (performed) or destroyed by some deputy, or other subordinate, connected with the public office.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 96-97, quoting <em>Seward, </em>120 Ohio St. at 50, 165 N.E. 537.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">{\u00b6 17} The state asserts that Shabazz, as treasurer of a community school, is a public official who should be liable for funds illegally collected by TIPS. In determining whether a community-school treasurer is a public official, we look to the Revised Code for guidance. R.C. 9.39 represents a codification of Ohio common law imposing strict liability on public officials for the loss of public funds with which they have been entrusted. The statute reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-8\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cAll public officials are liable for all public money received or collected by them or their subordinates under color of office.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">{\u00b6 19} R.C. 9.38(1) provides that for the purposes of R.C. 9.39, the definitions of \u201cpublic official,\u201d \u201cpublic office\u201d and \u201ccolor of office,\u201d are the same as those contained in R.C. 117.01. R.C. 117.01(E) states, \u201c \u2018Public official\u2019 means any officer, employee, or duly authorized representative or agent of a public office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AAR\">{\u00b6 20} Thus, an officer, employee, or duly authorized representative of a charter school is a public official only if a community school is a \u201cpublic office.\u201d R.C. 117.01(D) defines \u201cpublic office\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c \u2018Public office\u2019 means any state agency, public institution, political subdivision, other organized body, office, agency, institution, or entity established by the laws of this state for the exercise of any function of government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AS3\">{\u00b6 22} Community schools fall within the definition of public office because they are entities \u201cestablished by the laws of this state for the exercise of [a] function of government.\u201d As this court held in <em>State ex rel. Ohio Congress of Parents &amp; Teachers v. State Bd. of Edn., </em>111 Ohio St.3d 568, 2006-Ohio-5512, 857 N.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>1148, \u00b6 32, community schools are legislatively created as a part of Ohio\u2019s constitutionally required system of common schools:</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cThe Ohio Constitution requires establishment of a system of common schools. This requirement is grounded in the state\u2019s interest in ensuring that all children receive an adequate education that complies with the Thorough and Efficient Clause. To achieve the goal of improving and customizing public education programs, the General Assembly has augmented the state\u2019s public school system with public community schools. The expressed legislative intent is to provide a chance of educational success for students who may be better served in their educational needs in alternative settings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">{\u00b6 24} The General Assembly made clear in R.C. 3314.01(B) that community schools are <em>public </em>schools: \u201cA community school created under this chapter is a public school, independent of any school district, and is part of the state\u2019s program of education.\u201d Thus, as entities \u201cestablished by the laws of this state for the exercise of any function of government,\u201d community schools are public offices pursuant to R.C. 117.01(D). In turn, an officer, employee, or duly authorized representative of a community school is a public official pursuant to R.C. 117.01(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">{\u00b6 25} Returning to R.C. 9.39, that statute provides that \u201cpublic officials are liable for all public money received or collected by them or by their subordinates under color of office.\u201d We have already determined that an officer, employee, or duly authorized representative of a community school is a public official. R.C. 117.01(A) defines \u201ccolor of office\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-8\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c \u2018Color of office\u2019 means actually, purportedly, or allegedly done under any law, ordinance, resolution, order, or other pretension to official right, power, or authority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">{\u00b6 27} Under R.C. 117.01, public money received pursuant to the community-school-funding scheme set forth in R.C. 3314.08 would meet the R.C. 9.39 element of \u201cpublic money received or collected * * * under color of office.\u201d Those payments were made by the state to TIPS due to the requirements of Ohio\u2019s community-school-funding laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">{\u00b6 28} A factual question remains, however. In order for the state to establish Shabazz\u2019s liability, it must show that she or her subordinates received <em>or collected </em>public money under color of office. Shabazz disputes that she was the treasurer of TIPS; she claims that she was the treasurer of the board of directors of TIPS. She claims that other people were hired as treasurer for the school, but also admits that she occasionally filled in as interim treasurer when the school lacked a treasurer.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b187-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>Richard Cordray, Attorney General, Benjamin C.

We remand the matter to the trial court for a determination of whether Shabazz\u2019s responsibilities at TIPS included the receipt or collection of public money, or whether she supervised employees who received or collected public money under color of office. We note that R.C. 3314.011 requires every community school to have a \u201cdesignated fiscal officer,\u201d whom the state auditor may require to be bonded.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">{\u00b6 30} Finally, we hold that R.C. 1702.55 offers no protection for public officials. Public officials are personally liable for public funds. Thus, R.C. 1702.55, which protects members, directors, and officers of corporations from the debts of the corporation, does not protect public officials from liability for lost public funds. Liability attaches to a public official by virtue of the public office he or she holds. It is his or her own obligation to \u201caccount for and disburse according to law moneys that have come into his hands by virtue of his being such public officer.\u201d <em>Seward, </em>120 Ohio St. 47, 50, 165 N.E. 537. Any liability that arises therefrom is not a corporate debt \u2014 it is the official\u2019s own debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">{\u00b6 31} Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals that summary judgment was inappropriate, although for different reasons, and we remand the cause to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">Judgment affirmed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b187-9\">Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzingbr, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"ay-dedup-0\">Brown, C.J., not participating.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>Eastman &amp; Smith, Ltd., Albin Bauer II, and Amy J.
