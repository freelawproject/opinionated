Matia and Mansfield Correctional Institution Warden Keith Smith, to convey Briscoe back to the common pleas court for further proceedings in his criminal case. Briscoe asked to be readjudicated consistent with the court of appeals\u2019 judgment in his previous appeal, <em>State v. Briscoe, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 89979, 2008-Ohio-6276, 2008 WL 5084720.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirmed at 124 Ohio St.3d 117, 2009-Ohio-6540, 919 N.E.2d 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">{\u00b6 2} Briscoe was convicted of murder and two counts of aggravated robbery and various specifications and was sentenced to an aggregate prison term of 28 years to life. <em>Briscoe, </em>2008-Ohio-6276, 2008 WL 5084720, at \u00b6 3-5. On appeal, the court of appeals affirmed Briscoe\u2019s convictions and sentence for murder, one of the aggravated-robbery counts, and the related specifications to these charges, reversed Briscoe\u2019s convictions and sentence for the remaining aggravated-robbery count and related specifications, and remanded the cause for further proceedings consistent with its opinion. Id. at \u00b6 20-21, 29, 35. On further appeal, we affirmed. <em>State v. Briscoe, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 117, 2009-Ohio-6540, 919 N.E.2d 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">{\u00b6 3} On remand, Judge Matia vacated the aggravated-robbery charge and related specifications that had been reversed by the court of appeals in <em>Briscoe, </em>2008-Ohio-6276, 2008 WL 5084720. Briscoe\u2019s aggregate prison sentence remained the same \u2014 28 years to life. Briscoe appeared in court for the resentenc-ing in May 2010 and for the court\u2019s correction of a clerical error in sentencing in August 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">{\u00b6 4} When Briscoe was not transferred to the Cuyahoga County sheriff for a new trial, he filed a petition in the court of appeals for a writ of mandamus to compel appellees to transfer him pursuant to R.C. 2953.13, which directs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-7\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cIf a new trial is ordered or the case is remanded, the warden shall forthwith cause the defendant to be conveyed to the jail of the county in which the defendant was convicted, and committed to the custody of the sheriff of that county.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">{\u00b6 6} The court of appeals denied and dismissed Briscoe\u2019s writ claim. <em>State ex rel. Briscoe v. Matia, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 95414, 2010-Ohio-4144, 2010 WL 3441979.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ABH\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Harry Briscoe, pro se.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">{\u00b6 7} In this appeal, instead of claiming entitlement to the writ of mandamus requesting that he be conveyed to the common pleas court under RiC. 2953.13, Briscoe seeks the writ to \u201ccompel the trial court to provide [him] with a new trial\u201d or \u201cdismiss the case * * * entirely\u201d because of structural error. Briscoe waived these claims because he failed to plead them in his petition. See <em>State ex rel. Scruggs v. Sadler, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 160, 2004-Ohio-2054, 807 N.E.2d 357, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">{\u00b6 8} Moreover, nothing in the court of appeals\u2019 opinion in <em>Briscoe, </em>2008-Ohio-6276, 2008 WL 5084720, required either a new trial or a dismissal of all the crimes for which Briscoe was convicted and sentenced. In fact, the court of appeals affirmed Briscoe\u2019s convictions and sentence for murder and for one of the aggravated-robbery counts with related specifications, and we affirmed that judgment. <em>Briscoe, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 117, 2009-Ohio-6540, 919 N.E.2d 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">{\u00b6 9} Briscoe also had an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law by way of appeal from Judge Mafia\u2019s judgment on remand to raise these claims. See <em>State ex rel. Voleck v. Powhatan Point, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 299, 2010-Ohio-5679, 939 N.E.2d 819, \u00b6 7 (\u201cMandamus will not issue when the relators have an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law\u201d); R.C. 2731.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">{\u00b6 10} Finally, insofar as Briscoe\u2019s claim for the dismissal of his entire criminal case essentially seeks release from prison, habeas corpus, and not mandamus, is the appropriate action. <em>State ex rel. Gordon v. Murphy, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 329, 2006-Ohio-6572, 859 N.E.2d 928, \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">{\u00b6 11} Therefore, Briscoe\u2019s appeal lacks merit, and we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals. Our disposition of this appeal renders Judge Mafia\u2019s motion to strike Briscoe\u2019s merit brief moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b499-10\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b498-9\">. The court of appeals subsequently recognized that based on our decision in <em>State v. Horner, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 466, 2010-Ohio-3830, 935 N.E.2d 26, the pertinent portion of its holding in <em>Briscoe </em>was no longer viable. See <em>State v. Segines, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 89915, 2010-Ohio-5112, 2010 WL 4132220, \u00b6 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
