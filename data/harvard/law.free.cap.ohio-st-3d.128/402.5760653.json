The commission defends its decision on the merits, and it also asserts that we lack jurisdiction to consider this matter because CSP failed to preserve these issues for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-13\">{\u00b6 2} We have jurisdiction in this matter; CSP timely applied for rehearing and thereby preserved its right to appeal. On the merits, however, CSP has not shown that the commission\u2019s decision was unreasonable or unlawful. Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-14\">I. Relevant Background</p>\n<p id=\"b534-15\">{\u00b6 3} As amended in 2008, R.C. 4928.17(E) requires an electric-distribution utility to \u201cobtain[ ] prior commission approval\u201d before it may \u201csell or transfer any generating asset it wholly or partly owns.\u201d Before it was amended, this section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>allowed a utility to \u201cdivest itself of any generating asset at any time without commission approval.\u201d Am.Sub.S.B. No. 3, 148 Ohio Laws, Part IV, 7962, 8020.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">{\u00b6 4} On July 31, 2008, CSP (along with its sister utility, Ohio Power Company) filed an application seeking commission approval of an electric security plan. See R.C- 4928.143. As part of that application, CSP sought \u201cauthority to sell or transfer two recently acquired generating facilities.\u201d Although requesting authority to sell, the company made clear that it had \u201cno immediate plan to sell or transfer those facilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">{\u00b6 5} The application did not include a request for increased rates to recover the costs of operating these facilities. Later in the proceedings, however, in rebuttal testimony, a CSP witness stated that cost recovery would be appropriate as an alternate remedy: \u201cIf the Companies through a Commission order are prohibited from transferring these plants or entitlements then any expense not recovered by [a particular charge] should be recovered in [a different] rate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">{\u00b6 6} In its initial order, the commission denied the request for authority to transfer the facilities, finding it premature. But the commission granted CSP the alternative relief of cost recovery \u2014 roughly $51 million a year. Apparently satisfied with this resolution, the company did not seek rehearing on this particular issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">{\u00b6 7} Industrial Energy Users-Ohio sought rehearing of the cost-recovery issue, however, and the commission reversed course. The commission agreed that CSP had \u201cnot demonstrated that [its] current revenue is inadequate to cover the costs associated with the generating facilities\u201d and directed the company \u201cto modify its [electric security plan] and remove the annual recovery of $51 million.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">{\u00b6 8} CSP <em>then </em>sought rehearing, which the commission denied. It again directed CSP to file an application when it \u201cestablished a plan to exercise [its] authority to sell or transfer the facilities.\u201d CSP\u2019s appeal to this court followed. The Ohio Energy Group, Office of the Ohio Consumers\u2019 Counsel (\u201cOCC\u201d), and Industrial Energy Users-Ohio (\u201cIEU\u201d) intervened in support of the commission<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (collectively with the commission, \u201cthe appellees\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">{\u00b6 9} This appeal presents two sets of issues: one set is jurisdictional; the other, substantive. We consider both.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">\n<em>A. CSP Preserved Its Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b535-12\">{\u00b6 10} The appellees raise several arguments asserting that CSP failed to preserve its right to appeal. All lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>{\u00b6 11} The appellees first argue that CSP never filed a timely rehearing application regarding the denial of its request to sell or transfer the generation facilities. If that is true, then we lack jurisdiction over that issue. In its first order, the commission denied CSP\u2019s request for transfer authority, but granted cost recovery instead. CSP did not seek rehearing of this determination within 30 days of the first order. According to the commission, this means CSP forfeited its appeal of the issue. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">{\u00b6 12} Pursuant to R.C. 4903.10, a party \u201cmay apply for a rehearing in respect to any matters determined in the proceeding.\u201d Applications for rehearing must be filed within 30 days after the entry of the initial order. Id. The statute, however, provides that \u201c[a]n order made after such rehearing, abrogating or modifying the original order, shall have the same effect as an original order.\u201d Id. Parties thus receive a new 30-day period to challenge entries on rehearing that modify earlier orders. As we have held, R.C. 4903.10 \u201cpermits an application for rehearing after <em>any </em>order.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Senior Citizens Coalition v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 329, 333, 533 N.E.2d 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">{\u00b6 13} CSP preserved this issue for appeal. It had asked for one of two things concerning the generation plants: transfer authority or cost recovery. In the initial order, the commission granted the latter. This ruling was not adverse to CSP. It was given what it had asked for. There was no reason to seek rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">{\u00b6 14} Then, in its first entry on rehearing, the commission revisited the issue and denied both transfer authority and cost recovery. This modification of the order was the first ruling adverse to CSP, and CSP applied for rehearing within 30 days of it. CSP\u2019s application was timely, and we have jurisdiction over the transfer issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">{\u00b6 15} The commission\u2019s second jurisdictional argument is plainly wrong. It claims that CSP failed to challenge the \u201cdecision on the recovery of costs\u201d in its July 31 rehearing application. On the contrary, CSP specifically stated in that document that \u201c[i]t is unreasonable to force CSP to keep these generating units and not be able to recover any costs associated with these units.\u201d The cost-recovery issue is also preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">{\u00b6 16} Finally, and more narrowly, OCC argues that CSP failed to raise a specific argument below that it raises here \u2014 namely, that the commission cannot consider traditional rate-making principles when reviewing an electric security plan. Assuming arguendo that CSP did not raise this argument below, it was before the commission due to IEU\u2019s argument. In its first application for rehearing, IEU argued that \u201cgeneration rates are no longer cost-based\u201d and that the commission \u201ccannot use traditional cost-based ratemaking selectively to increase rates.\u201d Because this argument was raised before the commission on rehearing, we may consider it. \u201cR.C. 4903.10 does not require that [an] error be alleged in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number><em>appellant\u2019s </em>application for rehearing; it can be in an application for rehearing filed by a <em>nonappellant </em>intervening party.\u201d (Emphases added.) <em>Cincinnati Bell Tel. Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 177, 180, 749 N.E.2d 262. This argument therefore is properly before this court. See id. at 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">{\u00b6 17} Having found that we have jurisdiction over the entire appeal, we turn to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">\n<em>B. CSP Has Not Shown that the Order Was Unlawful or Unreasonable</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">{\u00b6 18} In its only proposition of law, CSP argues that in an electric-security-plan proceeding, \u201cit is unlawful for the Commission to deny the authority to sell or transfer [generation] assets and at the same time refuse to allow * * * an adjustment for costs associated with maintaining and operating those same assets.\u201d We disagree and hold that both decisions \u2014 the denial of CSP\u2019s request to sell and the denial of cost recovery \u2014 were reasonable and lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">1. The Commission Reasonably Withheld Authority to Sell</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">{\u00b6 19} The commission found that CSP\u2019s request to sell was premature. CSP had stated in its application that it had \u201cno immediate plan to sell or transfer [the generation] facilities.\u201d It merely offered that if the commission authorized it to sell, it would \u201cnotify the Commission prior to any such transaction.\u201d The commission denied the request but instructed CSP to \u201cfile a separate application, in accordance with the Commission\u2019s rules, at the time that it wishes to sell or transfer these generation facilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">{\u00b6 20} Our standard of review of this issue is deferential. R.C. 4928.17(E) provides, \u201cNo electric distribution utility shall sell or transfer any generating asset it wholly or partly owns at any time without obtaining prior commission approval.\u201d The statute empowers the commission to approve or reject transfer applications, but gives no direction to the commission concerning how it should exercise that power, effectively making the decision a discretionary one. See, e.g., <em>Util. Serv. Partners v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>124 Ohio St.3d 284, 2009-Ohio-6764, 921 N.E.2d 1038, \u00b6 13; <em>Weiss v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 15, 17-18, 734 N.E.2d 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">{\u00b6 21} The commission did not abuse its discretion by withholding review of CSP\u2019s request to sell until CSP submitted a concrete proposal. If nothing else, R.C. 4928.17(E) shows that the General Assembly made a policy judgment restricting the freedom of utilities to sell or transfer generation units. Although CSP plainly does not find this restriction salutary, the company did not challenge the statute, and the commission is obligated to follow its legislative mandate. In light of the General Assembly\u2019s intent that sales of generation assets receive commission scrutiny, the commission reasonably deferred reviewing CSP\u2019s request. CSP did not offer any information regarding the sale price, terms, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>conditions, or public impact \u2014 or even whether there would be a sale. Requiring CSP to reapply when it had such information was a reasonable application of R.C. 4928.17(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">2. The Commission Did Not Err in Denying Cost Recovery</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">{\u00b6 22} CSP asserts that if the commission denies transfer authority, then it must grant cost recovery instead. But the company has not shown that this is true.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">{\u00b6 23} The governing statute, R.C. 4928.17(E), does not support CSP\u2019s position that the commission must grant a rate increase if it denies a request to sell. The statute empowers the commission to approve or reject the sale of generation assets, but says nothing about cost recovery. It certainly does not guarantee cost recovery to utilities if they are denied authority to sell. Thus, CSP has not shown that the commission violated R.C. 4928.17(E) when it denied the rate increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">{\u00b6 24} We further note that CSP has not shown that the commission\u2019s factual basis for denying cost recovery was unsound. The commission held that CSP had not demonstrated that its rates were inadequate to cover the costs of operating the plants. CSP adduces no evidence suggesting that this conclusion was factually inaccurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">{\u00b6 25} Rather than argue that its rates are in fact inadequate, CSP asserts that the commission never should have considered CSP\u2019s cost of service. The commission\u2019s \u201creference to the adequacy of current revenues,\u201d CSP claims, \u201cis uniquely based in the traditional cost-of-service/rate of return on investment rate making concepts of R.C. Chapter 4909\u201d and \u201chas no place in evaluating\u201d an electric security plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">{\u00b6 26} If it is true that cost of service \u201chas no place\u201d in evaluating an electric security plan, then why does CSP ask for a rate to \u201crecover the costs\u201d of running these facilities? This question need not be answered, because CSP\u2019s argument lacks merit. CSP cites no authority that expressly prohibits the commission from considering cost of service or adequacy of revenue when reviewing an electric security plan. On the contrary, numerous subsections of the electric-security-plan statute implicitly require the commission to consider certain costs. See R.C. 4928.143(B)(2)(a) through (d) and (f) through (i). Whether the commission generally <em>must </em>consider cost of service we need not and do not decide. We simply hold that nothing in the statute generally <em>forbids </em>such consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">{\u00b6 27} CSP seems to assert that the standard to be applied here does not involve any consideration of cost. It argues in its brief that \u201c[t]he proper standard under [Am.Sub.] SB 221 [the bill that enacted R.C. 4928.143] for determining whether to revoke the previously authorized recovery of revenue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>related to these generating facilities would have been for the Commission to decide whether, with the allowance of the revenue recovery, the [electric security plan], in the aggregate, was not more favorable than the result expected under [a market-rate offer] at the time the Commission issued its original Opinion and Order.\u201d As we understand this sentence, CSP is saying that the commission cannot reduce the rates set forth in an electric security plan on rehearing unless the plan\u2019s rates exceed expected market rates. Put differently, if the plan\u2019s rates are under market, the commission may not make them any lower, for any reason. But the statute contradicts that claim. The electric-security-plan statute expressly allows the commission to modify plans, and it does not prohibit modifications based on the utility\u2019s cost of service. R.C. 4928.143(C)(1). Moreover, while it is true that the commission must approve an electric security plan if it is \u201cmore favorable in the aggregate\u201d than an expected market-rate offer, id., that fact does not bind the commission to a strict price comparison. On the contrary, in evaluating the favorability of a plan, the statute instructs the commission to consider \u201cpricing <em>and all other terms and conditions.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id. Thus, the commission must consider more than price in determining whether an electric security plan should be modified.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AbE\">Porter, Wright, Morris &amp; Arthur, L.L.P., and Daniel R.
