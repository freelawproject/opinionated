On December 4, 2008, following his conviction and sentencing on ten felony counts involving pandering sexually oriented matter involving a minor, we imposed an interim felony suspension on respondent\u2019s license pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(5)(A)(4). <em>In re Butler, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 1427, 2008-Ohio-6274, 897 N.E.2d 659.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">{\u00b6 2} Based on the conduct underlying respondent\u2019s felony convictions for offenses that occurred in 2004 and 2005, relator, Disciplinary Counsel, has filed a complaint charging respondent with violations of DR 1 \u2014 102(A)(3) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in illegal conduct involving moral turpitude) and 1-102(A)(6) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that adversely reflects upon his fitness to practice law).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">{\u00b6 3} The board has accepted the parties\u2019 stipulation that respondent\u2019s criminal conduct violated DR 1-102(A)(3) and 1-102(A)(6). The board also agrees that respondent\u2019s lack of a prior disciplinary record, full and free disclosure to the board, and cooperative attitude toward the proceedings should be considered in mitigation. See Section 10(B)(2)(a) and (d) of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d). It further concludes that none of the factors in aggravation set forth in BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(a) through (i) are present. Based upon these findings, the board recommends that respondent be indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in Ohio with no credit for time served under his interim suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">{\u00b6 4} We accept the board\u2019s findings of fact and misconduct and agree that the parties\u2019 stipulated sanction of an indefinite suspension with no credit for time served under his interim suspension is an appropriate sanction for respondent\u2019s misconduct. See <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Ridenbaugh, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 583, 2009-Ohio-4091, 913 N.E.2d 443, \u00b6 2, 40-41 (imposing an indefinite suspension with credit for time served under an interim suspension order for misconduct involving acts of voyeurism and use of child pornography).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">{\u00b6 5} Accordingly, we indefinitely suspend Brian 'Jeffrey Butler from the practice of law in Ohio, with no credit for time served under his interim suspension order. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b452-10\">Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b452-11\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and McGee Brown, J., dissent and would permanently disbar respondent.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"A-n\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Jonathan E.
