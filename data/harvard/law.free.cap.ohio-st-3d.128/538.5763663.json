Teodosio, to issue a final, appealable order in his criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-11\">{\u00b6 2} Although Gooden\u2019s original sentence in 2007 may have been defective in the imposition of postrelease control, his 2009 sentence included the correct terms of postrelease control. The 2009 sentence thus constituted a final, appealable order. Cf. <em>State ex rel. Carnail v. McCormick, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 124, 2010-Ohio-2671, 931 N.E.2d 110, \u00b6 32-37 (inmate entitled to writ of mandamus to compel judge to issue sentencing entry that included statutorily required mandatory term of postrelease control after judge denied motion to correct sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-12\">{\u00b6 3} Insofar as Gooden claims that appellee improperly enhanced his 2009 sentence based on Gooden\u2019s violation of his 2007 postrelease control, he had an adequate remedy by way of appeal from the 2009 sentence to raise that issue. See <em>State ex rel. Cunningham v. Lindeman, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 481, 2010-Ohio-4388, 935 N.E.2d 393 (affirming dismissal of claim for writ of mandamus or procedendo to compel trial court judge to issue new sentencing entry because petitioner had an adequate remedy by appeal to raise claimed sentencing errors).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b670-14\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"AYW\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Joe Gooden, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AUfz\">Sherri Bevan Walsh, Summit County Prosecuting Attorney, and Richard S.
