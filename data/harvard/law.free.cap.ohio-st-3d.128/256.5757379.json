Because relator, American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio, Inc. (\u201cACLU\u201d), has not established its entitlement to the requested extraordinary relief, we deny the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-13\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b388-14\">{\u00b6 2} In November 2009, Cuyahoga County voters adopted a county charter that replaces the county\u2019s three-member board of commissioners with an elected county executive and council, changes several county offices from elected to appointed positions, and reorganizes or eliminates certain departments. The charter became effective in January 2010, with the new county government effective in January 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-15\">{\u00b6 3} Under Section 13.07 of the Cuyahoga County Charter, the board of county commissioners created TAG, which had a duty to develop recommendations for the transition to the new county government:</p>\n<p id=\"b388-16\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cThe Board of County Commissioners, not later than March 2010, shall designate three senior administrative officials of the County to act as a Transition Advisory Group, which shall develop recommendations for the orderly and efficient transition to the operation of the County government under the provisions of this Charter and shall work with the newly elected County officials. The Board of County Commissioners shall provide necessary facilities and support for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>the Transition Advisory Group and shall make provision in the budget of the County for the salaries of the elected officers who are to take office in January 2011 and for such other matters as shall be necessary and practicable to provide for the transition. All County officials and employees shall cooperate with the Transition Advisory Group by providing such information and documents as the Transition Advisory Group shall request in connection with the performance of its duties under this section and shall use their best efforts to assist the newly elected County officials and their designees and representatives in implementing the transition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">{\u00b6 5} Pursuant to this section of the charter, on November 19, 2009, the Cuyahoga County Board of Commissioners designated James McCafferty, the county administrator, Gary Holland, the director of the county Department of Justice Affairs, and Joseph Nanni, the county director of human resources, to act as the TAG.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">{\u00b6 6} At a Gund Foundation dinner in early December 2009, both McCafferty and Martin Zanotti, the chairperson of New Cuyahoga Now (\u201cNCN\u201d), a private entity that had drafted the new charter and guided the campaign for its passage, spoke about county-transition issues. Following discussion between McCafferty and Zanotti, TAG invited NCN and the Greater Cleveland Partnership<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (\u201cGCP\u201d) to form a comprehensive civic coalition that would represent and work with all sectors of the community during the transition period and beyond.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">{\u00b6 7} NCN and GCP accepted the invitation and created a steering committee, the TEC, to oversee the creation of workgroups as part of the committee. TEC has eight members, including its cochairpersons, McCafferty and Zanotti. The workgroups comprise community leaders, county employees, and private citizens who volunteered to participate in the transition based on their expertise and interest in the specific subject-matter areas of the workgroups. Thirteen work-groups were ultimately created: Public Engagement Committee, County Government Collaboration Committee, Code of Ethics Workgroup, Finance &amp; Administration Workgroup, Justice Services Workgroup, Human Services Workgroup, Human Resources Workgroup, Human Capital/Quality Places Workgroup, Information Technology Workgroup, Procurement &amp; Public Works Workgroup, Economic Development Workgroup, County Council Planning Workgroup, and Boards <em>&amp; </em>Commissions Workgroup.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">{\u00b6 8} Under the general transition structure, TEC was to review and approve recommendations offered by the workgroups and forward approved recommenda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>tions to TAG for review, approval, and submission to the newly elected county executive and council by November 2010. But TAG is free to disregard any recommendations made by TEC or the workgroups, and TEC and the work-groups retain their independent right to present recommendations directly to the county executive and council notwithstanding TAG\u2019S disapproval.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">{\u00b6 9} Neither the commissioners nor TAG created TEC or the workgroups, and TAG did not delegate any of its charter-mandated duties to TEC or the workgroups. TEC receives no guidance or direction from TAG, and although county employees serve on TEC and various workgroups, they have no official authority to direct or make decisions on behalf of TEC or any workgroup.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">{\u00b6 10} TAG has received $7,000,000 in funding from the county, but none of that money has been allocated to TEC or the workgroups. The only operational assistance provided by the board of commissioners and TAG to TEC and the workgroups was posting information about TAG, TEC, and the workgroups on the county website for the transition and providing meeting space for some of the workgroups. NCN has received money entirely from private sources to support its efforts. In essence, TEC and the workgroups are independent of any government entity or process.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">{\u00b6 11} On February 11, 2010, shortly after media reports that McCafferty and Zanotti had stated that transition workgroups should be able to conduct business in private, TAG issued a press release entitled \u201cTransition Advisory Group Committed to Open Meetings,\u201d in which it \u201creaffirmed the importance of transparency and openness to the formation of a new county government by opening all work group meetings to the public.\u201d As announced in the release, \u201c[m]inutes of the Transition Work Groups and scheduled meeting dates, times and locations will also be posted on the Cuyahoga County Website.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">{\u00b6 12} Consistent with the press release, information about meetings of TAG, TEC, and any committees, subcommittees, or workgroups assembled under TEC, including the dates, times, locations, and minutes of the meetings, has been made available to the public through regular postings on the county\u2019s transition website, http://charter.cuyahogacounty.us/en-US/home.aspx. For example, the meeting dates, locations, agendas, and minutes for all of TEC\u2019s meetings have been posted on the website, and the meetings have been open to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">{\u00b6 13} By letter dated February 17, 2010, relator, American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio, Inc. (\u201cACLU\u201d), submitted a request addressed to the Cuyahoga County Board of Commissioners and County Administrator McCafferty pursuant to R.C. 149.43 and Section 12.06 of the Cuyahoga County Charter for certain records relating to the transition to the new county government, including (1) \u201c[rjecords of whether any members of the Transition Advisory Group (\u2018TAG\u2019), its committees, subcommittees, or workgroups have completed the public records <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>training that is required for elected officials and their designees pursuant to Revised Code Section 109.43,\u201d (2) \u201cpolicies or procedures (official or unofficial) used in the formation of any committees, subcommittees, or workgroups established by or under the TAG,\u201d (3) a \u201clist of the names of each individual/volunteer who is serving or has served on a committee, subcommittee, or workgroup under the TAG,\u201d (4) \u201c[f]ull copies of minutes to all TAG or subcommittee meetings that have already been held,\u201d and (5) \u201c[f]ull copies of any documents or reports created by TAG or any of its subcommittees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">{\u00b6 14} A couple of weeks later, the county prosecutor\u2019s office submitted a response to the ACLU\u2019s records request on behalf of the board and McCafferty. In the response, the county specified that for the second, fourth, and fifth categories of requested records, it would provide access to records of TAG, which it conceded was a public body for purposes of the Sunshine Laws, but it could not provide access to the records of TEC and the various transition workgroups because, inter alia, TAG did not create the workgroups, and the workgroups were \u201cprivate, unincorporated associations\u201d rather than \u201cpublic bodies.\u201d The county stated, \u201c[Njeither the [board of county commissioners] nor Mr. McCafferty can respond * * * to those portions of your letter that are not directed to TAG, but are instead directed to those various voluntary associations formed by interested members of the public to provide community input to the TAG.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">{\u00b6 15} Further, the county noted that it had no records for the first category of requested records \u2014 public-records training for TAG members \u2014 because they were not elected officials or their designees subject to R.C. 109.43. As to the third category of requested records \u2014 lists of persons serving on transition committees, subcommittees, or workgroups \u2014 the county stated that although it did not believe they were public records, it would nevertheless submit the lists to the ACLU. The county provided access to copies of about 7,000 pages of responsive documents to the ACLU. The county\u2019s response included all known nonprivileged, responsive public records of the board and TAG but did not include any records of TEC or its workgroups, which the board and TAG did not have. On March 8, the ACLU retrieved the records provided by the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">{\u00b6 16} About a month and a half later, on April 27, the ACLU filed this action for a writ of mandamus to compel respondents, the board of commissioners and its members, TAG and its members, and TEC and its members, to provide it with access to the \u201cpublic records and meeting minutes of the various county government transition committees and workgroups established by the County to fulfill its responsibilities under Section 13.07 of the new Cuyahoga County Charter.\u201d The ACLU requested \u201ca peremptory writ of mandamus directing the Respondents to make the requested records available for inspection and copying without further delay\u201d and \u201ca peremptory writ of mandamus directing the Respondents to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>prepare, file, and maintain full and accurate minutes and to conduct all meetings in public.\u201d The board, TAG, and their members filed a motion to dismiss, and TEC and its members filed an answer and a motion for judgment on the pleadings. The ACLU filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint and a motion to strike the affidavit in the answer. The ACLU\u2019s amended complaint requested the same relief as its initial complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">{\u00b6 17} On August 25, 2010, we granted the ACLU\u2019s motion for leave to file an amended complaint, denied the motions for judgment on the pleadings, to dismiss, and to strike, and granted an alternative writ. 126 Ohio St.3d 1541, 2010-Ohio-3855, 932 N.E.2d 337. The parties have submitted evidence and briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">{\u00b6 18} This cause is now before the court for our consideration of the merits. In addition, the ACLU has filed a motion for leave to exceed the page limit for its reply brief, and respondents TEC and its members have filed a motion to strike certain newspaper articles relied upon by the ACLU in its merit brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">\n<em>Motion for Leave to Exceed Page Limit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">{\u00b6 19} S.Ct.Prac.R. 6.4(B) provides, \u201cExcept in death penalty appeals of right, the reply brief shall not exceed twenty numbered pages, exclusive of the table of contents, the table of authorities cited, the certificate of service, and any appendix.\u201d Excluding the table of contents, table of authorities, and the certificate of service, the ACLU\u2019s reply brief exceeds the 20-page limit by six pages.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">{\u00b6 20} We have previously granted motions to extend the page limits for briefs. E.g., <em>Cope v. Metro. Life Ins. Co. </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 1402, 684 N.E.2d 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">{\u00b6 21} We exercise our discretion here and grant the ACLU\u2019s motion. As the ACLU notes, it is responding to two sets of respondents\u2019 briefs, which were 35 and 36 pages long, and one of those briefs included a constitutional argument. Under these circumstances, allowing the ACLU to exceed the 20-page limit by a few pages is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-12\">\n<em>Mandamus</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b392-13\">{\u00b6 22} The ACLU requests a writ of mandamus to compel respondents to prepare, file, and maintain full and accurate minutes of meetings of TEC and its transition workgroups, conduct all of these meetings in public, and provide access to their public records and meeting minutes. To be entitled to the writ, the ACLU must establish a clear legal right to the requested relief, a corresponding clear legal duty on the part of respondents, and the lack of an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law. <em>State ex rel. Brown v. Lemmerman, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 296, 2010-Ohio-137, 921 N.E.2d 1049, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>\n<em>Lack of Adequate Remedy in the Ordinary Course of Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">{\u00b6 23} Mandamus will not issue if the relator has an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. R.C. 2731.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">{\u00b6 24} The ACLU bases its entitlement to the requested extraordinary relief on R.C. 121.22 and 149.43. \u201cOhio\u2019s \u2018Sunshine Laws\u2019 govern public records and open meetings.\u201d <em>Dream Fields, L.L.C. v. Bogart, </em>175 Ohio App.3d 165, 2008-Ohio-152, 885 N.E.2d 978, \u00b6 3. For the ACLU\u2019s public-records mandamus claim, \u201c[m]andamus is the appropriate remedy to compel compliance with R.C. 149.43, Ohio\u2019s Public Records Act.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Physicians Commt. for Responsible Medicine v. Ohio State Univ. Bd. of Trustees, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 288, 2006-Ohio-903, 843 N.E.2d 174, \u00b6 6. Relators in public-records mandamus cases need not establish the lack of an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. <em>State ex rel. Morgan v. New Lexington, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 33, 2006-Ohio-6365, 857 N.E.2d 1208, \u00b6 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">{\u00b6 25} For the ACLU\u2019s open-meetings mandamus claim, notwithstanding the county respondents\u2019 contentions to the contrary, the claim is not an ill-disguised claim for a declaratory judgment and prohibitory injunction, and neither a declaratory judgment nor a prohibitory injunction would constitute an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. A declaratory judgment would not be an adequate remedy without a mandatory injunction ordering respondents to prepare, file, and maintain full and accurate meeting minutes of past closed meetings of TEC and its workgroups and to compel them to conduct all TEC and workgroup meetings in public. A mandatory injunction, however, is an extraordinary remedy that does not preclude a writ of mandamus. See <em>State ex rel. Ohio Liberty Council v. Brunner, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 315, 2010-Ohio-1845, 928 N.E.2d 410, \u00b6 28. Similarly, R.C. 121.22(1), which affords mandatory injunctive relief by way of a common pleas court action to enforce the provisions of the Open Meetings Act, does not prevent a mandamus action. See <em>State ex rel. Fairfield Leader v. Ricketts </em>(1990), 56 Ohio St.3d 97, 102, 564 N.E.2d 486. And a prohibitory injunction would not provide the ACLU with the relief it requests: an order to <em>compel </em>respondents to comply with R.C. 121.22 by preparing, filing, and maintaining full and accurate meeting minutes and to hold all of the TEC and workgroup meetings in public. <em>Ohio Liberty Council </em>at \u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">{\u00b6 26} Therefore, the ACLU\u2019s amended complaint properly invokes our original jurisdiction, and a common pleas court action for a declaratory judgment and either a mandatory or a prohibitory injunction would not provide an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law so as to preclude its mandamus claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">\n<em>Clear Legal Right and Clear Legal Duty: Prospective Mandamus Relief</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">{\u00b6 27} In its amended complaint, the ACLU has requested \u201ca peremptory writ of mandamus directing the Respondents to prepare, file, and maintain full and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>accurate minutes and to conduct all meetings in public.\u201d Insofar as the ACLU\u2019s request for relief could be construed as requesting a writ of mandamus to compel compliance with R.C. 121.22 by respondents in the future, they are not entitled to this relief. A \u201cwrit of mandamus will not issue to compel the general observance of laws in the future.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Kirk v. Burcham </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 407, 409, 696 N.E.2d 582.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">{\u00b6 28} Moreover, the evidence establishes that TEC and the transition work-groups are complying with R.C. 121.22 by conducting open meetings and preparing and providing minutes of the meetings. \u201cMandamus will not compel the performance of an act that has already been performed.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Dehler v. Kelly, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 297, 2009-Ohio-5259, 915 N.E.2d 1223, \u00b6 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">{\u00b6 29} For the ACLU\u2019s claim for copies of minutes of past TEC and workgroup meetings that were closed to the public, the Open Meetings Act, \u201cR.C. 121.22, requires the preparation, filing, and maintenance of a public body\u2019s minutes. * * * Once these minutes are prepared, Ohio\u2019s Public Records Act, R.C. 149.43, requires the public body to permit public access to the minutes upon request.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Citizens for Open, Responsive &amp; Accountable Govt. v. Register, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 88, 2007-Ohio-5542, 876 N.E.2d 913, \u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">{\u00b6 30} Nevertheless, the ACLU\u2019s evidence that TEC and the workgroups held private meetings in the past is based on a solitary February 10, 2010 Cleveland Scene newspaper article in which it was reported that McCafferty said that \u201ccommittees have already started working behind closed doors.\u201d By contrast, respondents\u2019 evidence is supported by affidavits establishing that TEC meetings have been open to the public and that information, including meeting minutes, for TEC and the workgroups, has been made available to the public through regular postings on the county\u2019s website. The single newspaper article does not satisfy the ACLU\u2019s burden to establish its entitlement to the preparation and provision of the requested minutes. See <em>State ex rel. Colvin v. Brunner, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 110, 2008-Ohio-5041, 896 N.E.2d 979, \u00b6 59 (court need not consider two newspaper articles as evidence in mandamus case); <em>State ex rel. Miller v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 477, 2004-Ohio-5532, 817 N.E.2d 1, \u00b6 15, quoting <em>State ex rel. Flagner v. Arko </em>(Feb. 5, 1998), Cuyahoga App. Nos. 72779 and 87263, 1998 WL 45342, *3, quoting <em>Heyman v. Bellevue </em>(1951), 91 Ohio App. 321, 326, 48 O.O. 404, 108 N.E.2d 161 (\u201cnewspaper article \u2018cannot be accepted as [summary-judgment] evidence; it is \u201chearsay of the remotest character\u201d \u2019 \u201d); <em>State ex rel. Boccuzzi v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Commrs., </em>112 Ohio St.3d 438, 2007-Ohio-323, 860 N.E.2d 749, \u00b6 20 (newspaper article rejected as evidence in mandamus case). This conclusion renders moot respondents TEC and its members\u2019 motion to strike this and another newspaper article from the ACLU\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>{\u00b6 31} Therefore, the ACLU has established neither a clear legal right to a writ of mandamus directing respondents to prepare, file, and maintain full and accurate minutes and to conduct all meetings in public nor a corresponding clear legal duty on the part of respondents to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">\n<em>Clear Legal Right and Clear Legal Duty: Public-Records Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">{\u00b6 32} The ACLU also claims entitlement to a writ of mandamus to compel respondents to provide access to the public records of TEC and the transition workgroups.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">\n<em>Prior Request for Records</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">{\u00b6 33} The respondents initially assert that the ACLU is not entitled to the requested records because \u201cR.C. 149.43(C) requires a prior request as a prerequisite to a mandamus action.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Taxpayers Coalition v. Lakewood </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 385, 390, 715 N.E.2d 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">{\u00b6 34} Notwithstanding respondents\u2019 assertion to the contrary, if \u2014 as the ACLU alleges \u2014 TEC and its subordinate workgroups are merely committees or subcommittees of TAG and the board of commissioners, serving the records request on the board of commissioners and County Administrator McCafferty, who is also a member of TAG and a cochairperson of TEC, would constitute a sufficient records request. Notably, the county\u2019s response to the ACLU\u2019s request reasoned that the request was proper to the extent that it sought TAG records because McCafferty is a member of TAG, even though he was not named as a TAG member in the records request. Similarly, although McCafferty was not named as a TEC cochairperson and member in the ACLU\u2019s request, the county\u2019s rationale would also support the sufficiency of the request for records of TEC and its workgroups. This result is consistent with our duties to \u201cconstrue the Public Records Act liberally in favor of broad access and resolve any doubt in favor of disclosure of public records.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Rocker v. Guernsey Cty. Sheriff's Office, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 224, 2010-Ohio-3288, 932 N.E.2d 327, \u00b6 6. Therefore, the ACLU\u2019s public-records mandamus claim does not lack merit due to an improper records request.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">\n<em>Public Body Under R.C. 121.22</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">{\u00b6 35} The ACLU next asserts that it is entitled to the requested writ of mandamus because R.C. 121.22 and 149.43 relate to the same subject matter and must be construed in pari materia so that if TEC and the transition workgroups meet the definition of \u201cpublic body\u201d and are subject to the Open Meetings Act, each necessarily satisfies the definition of \u201cpublic office\u201d and is subject to the Public Records Act as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>{\u00b6 36} As noted previously, the court has recognized that R.C. 121.22 and 149.43 are construed in pari materia for purposes of maintaining a record of the proceedings of public bodies and making minutes of those proceedings available to the public. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Long v. Cardington Village Council </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 54, 56, 748 N.E.2d 58 (\u201cConstruing R.C. 121.22, 149.43, and 733.27 <em>in pa\u00f1 materia, </em>respondents, * * * [including] the village clerk * * *, have a duty to prepare, file, and maintain full and accurate minutes for council meetings, and to make them available for public inspection\u201d); <em>White v. Clinton Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 416, 667 N.E.2d 1223, paragraph one of the syllabus (\u201cR.C. 121.22, 149.43, and 305.10, when read together, impose a duty on all boards of county commissioners to maintain a full and accurate record of their proceedings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">{\u00b6 37} R.C. 121.22 and 149.43 are also arguably incorporated by reference in the applicable provisions of the Cuyahoga County Charter regarding open meetings and public records. See Cuyahoga County Charter, Sections 12.05 (\u201cAll meetings of the Council and any committee, board, commission, agency or authority of the County, as well as any similar body created by this Charter or by the Council, shall be open to the public as provided by general law\u201d) and 12.06 (\u201cRecords of the County shall be open to the public as provided by general law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">{\u00b6 38} Nevertheless, we have never expressly held that once an entity qualifies as a public body for purposes of R.C. 121.22, it is also a public office for purposes of R.C. 149.011(A) and 149.43 so as to make all of its nonexempt records subject to disclosure. In fact, R.C. 121.22 suggests otherwise because it contains separate definitions for \u201cpublic body,\u201d R.C. 121.22(B)(1), and \u201cpublic office,\u201d R.C. 121.22(B)(4), which provides that \u201c \u2018[p]ublic office\u2019 has the same meaning as in section 149.011 of the Revised Code.\u201d Had the General Assembly intended that a \u201cpublic body\u201d for purposes of R.C. 121.22 be considered a \u201cpublic office\u201d for purposes of R.C. 149.011(A) and 149.43, it would have so provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">{\u00b6 39} R.C. 121.22(B)(1) defines a \u201cpublic body\u201d subject to the Open Meetings Act to include the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">{\u00b6 40} \u201c(a) Any board, commission, committee, council, or similar decision-making body of a state agency, institution, or authority, and any legislative authority or board, commission, committee, council, agency, authority, or similar decision-making body of any county, township, municipal corporation, school district, or other political subdivision or local public institution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">{\u00b6 41} \u201c(b) Any committee or subcommittee of a body described in division (B)(1)(a) of this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">{\u00b6 42} The parties agree that TAG, which was created by Section 13.07 of the Cuyahoga County Charter as a decision-making body of the county, is a public body. At issue is whether TEC and the transition workgroups are also public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>bodies for purposes of R.C. 121.22. If TEC and the workgroups are committees or subcommittees of TAG, they are public bodies pursuant to R.C. 121.22(B)(1)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">{\u00b6 43} In construing this statute, \u201cour obligation is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature as expressed in the statute.\u201d <em>Hudson v. Petrosurance, Inc., </em>127 Ohio St.3d 54, 2010-Ohio-4505, 936 N.E.2d 481, \u00b6 30. \u201c[W]e determine the legislative intent by reading words and phrases in context and construing them in accordance with rules of grammar and common usage.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Shisler v. Ohio Pub. Emps. Retirement Sys., </em>122 Ohio St.3d 148, 2009-Ohio-2522, 909 N.E.2d 610, \u00b6 18. A \u201ccommittee\u201d is a \u201csubordinate group to which a deliberative assembly or other organization refers business for consideration, investigation, oversight, or action,\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (9th Ed.2009) 309, or \u201ca body of persons delegated to consider, investigate, or take action upon and usu. to report concerning some matter or business,\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) 458. See <em>Berner v. Woods, </em>Lorain App. No. 07CA009132, 2007-Ohio-6207, 2007 WL 4146645, \u00b6 14 (the court applies a comparable dictionary definition to \u201ccommittee\u201d to hold that a \u201ccommunity block grant committee\u201d was a \u201cpublic body\u201d pursuant to R.C. 121.22(B)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">{\u00b6 44} Respondents\u2019 evidence establishes that TEC and the transition work-groups do not fit within the definition of \u201ccommittee\u201d of TAG so as to be a public body as defined in R.C. 121.22(B)(1). Neither the board of commissioners nor TAG referred or delegated business to TEC and the workgroups. Instead, two private entities, NON and GCP, created TEC to oversee the creation of work-groups assembled under it. TAG did not delegate any of its charter-mandated duties to TEC and the workgroups and does not direct them. Although the ACLU cites some language in e-mails between individual TAG members and on the county website that suggests some assistance in providing the structure of the first workgroups, there is no indication that TAG as an entity acted to delegate to TEC and the workgroups its primary charter duty to \u201cdevelop recommendations for the orderly and efficient transition to the operation of County government\u201d under Section 13.07 of the charter. At best, the creation of TEC and the workgroups by NCN and GCP, at the invitation of the county, merely recognized the longstanding and important rights of private citizens to \u201cpetition the Government\u201d pursuant to the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and to \u201calter, reform, or abolish\u201d government \u201cwhenever they may deem it necessary.\u201d Section 2, Article I, Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">{\u00b6 45} The cases cited by the ACLU in support of its mandamus claims are inapposite because in those cases, the evidence was uncontroverted that the entity held to constitute a public body for purposes of the Open Meetings Act had been established or designated by some governmental entity. <em>Berner, </em>2007-Ohio-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>6207, 2007 WL 4146645 (community-block-grant committee created by township board); <em>Wheeling Corp. v.

No comparable evidence is apparent here.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">\n<em>Functional Equivalent of a Public Office</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">{\u00b6 46} For purposes of the Public Records Act, a public office subject to the act \u201cincludes any state agency, public institution, political subdivision, or any other organized body, office, agency, institution, or entity established by the laws of this state for the exercise of any function of government.\u201d R.C. 149.011(A). As a secondary matter, the ACLU argues that if the TEC and the workgroups are private entities, each is the functional equivalent of a public office and is subject to R.C. 149.43.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">{\u00b6 47} Prior to 2006, we used different tests to determine whether a private entity was a public office subject to the Public Records Act. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Fox v. Cuyahoga Cty. Hosp. Sys. </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 108, 529 N.E.2d 443, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>State ex rel. Freedom Communications, Inc. v. Elida Community Fire Co. </em>(1988), 82 Ohio St.3d 578, 579, 697 N.E.2d 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">{\u00b6 48} In <em>State ex rel. Oriana House, Inc. v. Montgomery, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 456, 2006-Ohio-4854, 854 N.E.2d 193, at the syllabus, however, we modified the test for determining a private entity\u2019s status as a public institution under R.C. 149.011(A) by holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-8\">{\u00b6 49} \u201c1. Private entities are not subject to the Public Records Act absent a showing by clear and convincing evidence that the private entity is the functional equivalent of a public office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-9\">{\u00b6 50} <em>\u201c2. </em>In determining whether a private entity is a public institution under R.C. 149.011(A) and thus a public office for purposes of the Public Records Act, R.C. 149.43, a court shall apply the functional-equivalency test. Under this test, the court must analyze all pertinent factors, including (1) whether the entity performs a governmental function, (2) the level of government funding, (3) the extent of government involvement or regulation, and (4) whether the entity was created by the government or to avoid the requirements of the Public Records Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>{\u00b6 51} The ACLU has not established by the requisite clear and convincing evidence that TEC and its subordinate workgroups are the functional equivalent of public offices for purposes of the Public Records Act. They are instead private groups comprising county leaders, county staff, and citizens; they are not performing TAG\u2019s charter-mandated duties but are instead submitting recommendations to TAG and the county in their capacities as coalitions of private citizens; they do not receive any funds or significant support from the county; they receive no guidance or direction from TAG or any other governmental agency and were not created by TAG or the county or to circumvent the requirements of R.C. 149.43. Therefore, the ACLU\u2019s functional-equivalence argument fails for lack of proof. See <em>Oriana House </em>at the syllabus; <em>State ex rel. Repository v. Nova Behavioral Health, Inc., </em>112 Ohio St.3d 338, 2006-Ohio-6713, 859 N.E.2d 936.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">\n<em>Quasi-agency Theory</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">{\u00b6 52} The ACLU finally argues that it is entitled to the public records of TEC and the transition workgroups based on the court\u2019s quasi-agency theory espoused in <em>State ex rel. Mazzaro v. Ferguson </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 37, 550 N.E.2d 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">{\u00b6 53} \u201cR.C. 149.43(C) manifests an intent to afford access to public records, even when a private entity is responsible for the records.\u201d Id. at 39. Therefore, \u201cwhere (1) a private entity prepares records in order to carry out a public office\u2019s responsibilities, (2) the public office is able to monitor the private entity\u2019s performance, and (3) the public office has access to the records for this purpose, a relator in an R.C. 149.43(C) mandamus action is entitled to relief regardless of whether he also shows that the private entity is acting as the public office\u2019s agent.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">{\u00b6 54} The ACLU has not established that TEC and the workgroups carried out TAG\u2019s duty to provide transition recommendations to the county executive and county council, that TAG is able to monitor TEC\u2019s and the workgroups\u2019 performance, or that TAG has access to all of TEC\u2019s and the workgroups\u2019 records so that it could monitor them. Instead, it appears that TAG would have access only to the recommendations and records that TEC and the workgroups, within their discretion, submitted to it at the conclusion of their review process. TEC and the workgroups thus have no duty to provide TAG or the county with access to any of their records.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">{\u00b6 55} The ACLU has not established its entitlement to the requested extraordinary relief in mandamus for its open-meetings and public-records mandamus claims. The ACLU has failed to meet its burden of proving a clear legal right to the requested relief or a corresponding clear legal duty on the part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>respondents to provide it. Therefore, we deny the writ. Based on this holding, we need not address the claim of TEC and its members that holding them subject to the Sunshine Laws would violate their First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and association.
