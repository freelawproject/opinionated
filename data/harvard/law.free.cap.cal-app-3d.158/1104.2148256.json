J.</author>\n<p id=\"AcX\">The state has the duty to preserve and protect wildlife. California State Department of Fish and Game (Fish and Game) agents may without warrants reasonably enter and patrol private open lands where game is present and hunting occurs to enforce Fish and Game laws. We affirm the declaratory relief judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">Plaintiff Joseph C. Betchart is part owner of agricultural range land, and he, his family and guests hunt for deer on the property during deer season. Defendant Richard Macedo and other Fish and Game agents (wardens) routinely patrol the property to enforce provisions of the Fish and Game Code, mostly during deer season, with knowledge that game is present and deer hunting occurs on the property. The wardens have no knowledge of any violation of regulations by plaintiff, his family or guests. The wardens do not have permission to enter the property and have been requested to immediately leave, but have refused to do so until completion of the patrol. Entries are made by way of roads crossing the property; on one occasion a warden on the property climbed over a locked gate to enter other parts of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">California wildlife is publicly owned and is not held by owners of private land where wildlife is present. (Fish &amp; G. Code, \u00a7 1801, subd. (f);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Ex Parte Maier </em>(1894) 103 Cal. 476, 484 [37 P. 402].) It is this state\u2019s policy to conserve and maintain wildlife for citizens\u2019 use and enjoyment, for their intrinsic and ecological values, and for aesthetic, educational and nonappropriative uses. (\u00a7 1801, subds. (a)(b)(c)(d).) It is also the policy to maintain recreational uses of wildlife, including hunting, \u201csubject to regulations consistent with the maintenance of healthy, viable wildlife resources, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>the public safety, and a quality outdoor experience.\u201d (\u00a7 1801, subd. (e).) Wildlife is a renewable, publicly owned resource to be maintained through regulated management. (\u00a7 1801, subd. (f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">Wildlife may not be taken or possessed except as provided by the Fish and Game Code, and hunting is a highly regulated activity. Statutes and regulations specify hunting seasons, bag and possession limits, manner, place, means and hours of taking and possessing; special restrictions relate to animal type, sex, maturity, or other physical distinctions. (\u00a7 3000 et seq.; Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 14, \u00a7 250 et seq.) Deer hunters must carry a deer license tag while hunting and upon the killing must fill out the tag, punch out the kill date, attach one part of the tag to the antlers or ear, have the tag countersigned by an authorized person before transporting the game and mail the other part of the tag to Fish and Game. (\u00a7\u00a7 4336, 4341.) Deer hunters must also possess a hunting license. (\u00a7 3007.)</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">It is undisputed that plaintiff\u2019s agricultural range land consists of \u201copen fields. \u201d (Cf. <em>Hester </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1924) 265 U.S. 57.)  Therefore, under a Fourth Amendment analysis, in asking whether plaintiff \u201chas a \u2018constitutionally protected reasonable expectation of privacy\u2019 \u201d <em>(Oliver </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 170 [80 L.Ed.2d 214, 223; 104 S.Ct. 1735, 1740]) in his open fields, the answer is, no: \u201c[A]n individual has no legitimate expectation that open fields will remain free from warrantless intrusion by government officers.\u201d (At pp.---[80 L.Ed.2d 214, 225-226; 104 S.Ct. 1735, 1742].)</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">However, plaintiff bases his contention on the warrant requirement of article I, section 13 of the California Constitution,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which may on occasion afford \u201c \u2018a broader security against unreasonable searches and seizures than that required by the United States Supreme Court\u2019 [citation] . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Chavers </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 462, 467 [189 Cal.Rptr. 169, 658 P.2d 96].)  Under California law, a claim of illegal warrantless search is measured by a balancing test: \u201cwhether the person has exhibited a reasonable expectation of privacy, and, if so, whether that expectation has been violated by unreasonable governmental intrusion [citation].\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bradley </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 80, 84 [81 Cal.Rptr. 457, 460 P.2d 129].) The <em>Bradley </em>court stated that this test applies in cases involving \u201csearches in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number>open fields.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em> Even under California standards, the warrantless entries by Fish and Game wardens onto plaintiff\u2019s property are permissible.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Plaintiff argues that because he has locked gates restricting access to parts of his property, and because he has requested that wardens who were present on the property apart from the roadways leave, he has \u201cvehemently expressed his desire to exclude government agents from those portions of his property hidden from public view . . .,\u201d and he therefore has an expectation of privacy in the nonpublic parts of the land. However, the fact that plaintiff has expressed his demand for privacy does not mean that his expectation is reasonable; the \u201ctest of reasonableness is dependent upon the totality of facts and circumstances involved in the context of each case. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lovelace </em>(1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 541, 548 [172 Cal.Rptr. 65].)</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">Plaintiff is protected against <em>unreasonable </em>governmental intrusion. Plaintiff submits that the wardens\u2019 warrantless entries onto his property are unreasonable because they are \u201cadministrative\u201d patrols, for which an administrative search warrant is required under Code of Civil Procedure section 1822.50 et seq. He primarily relies on two cases: <em>Vidaurri </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 13 Cal.App.3d 550 [91 Cal.Rptr. 704] and <em>Salwasser Manufacturing Co. </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1979) 94 Cal.App.3d 223 [156 Cal.Rptr. 292].</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\"><em>Vidaurri\u2019s </em>holding that a health inspector from the California Agriculture Department may not enter an enclosed backyard absent a warrant or the owner\u2019s consent <em>(Vidaurri </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>13 Cal.App.3d at pp. 552-553) is not applicable. <em>Vidaurri </em>did not consider whether the inspection would require a warrant if conducted in open fields. Further, Code of Civil Procedure sections 1822.50 through 1822.56 specifically name <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1109\">*1109</page-number>\u201chealth . . . officer\u201d as subject to the inspection warrant requirement. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 553.) Fish and Game wardens are not so named in the inspection warrant statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\"><em>Salwasser Manufacturing Co. </em>states that \u201c[ujnless some recognized exception to the warrant requirement applies (e.g., for a \u2018closely regulated\u2019 business such as the sale of liquor or firearms) an administrative search or inspection must be conducted pursuant to a warrant.\u201d <em>(Salwasser Manufacturing Co. </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>94 Cal.App.3d at p. 229.) The exception referred to in <em>Salwasser Manufacturing Co. </em>was detailed in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Biswell </em>(1972) 406 U.S. 311 [32 L.Ed.2d 87, 92 S.Ct. 1593] (warrantless search of firearms dealer during business hours authorized by the Gun Control Act of 1968 not violative of Fourth Amendment). (See also <em>Colonnade Corp. </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 72 [25 L.Ed.2d 60, 90 S.Ct. 774] [liquor licensee may not refuse warrantless entry by federal inspector].) Plaintiff\u2019s contention that the <em>Biswell </em>exception is inapplicable here because it only relates to highly regulated businesses is too narrow and thus his claim lacks merit. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Firstenberg </em>(1979) 92 Cal.App.3d 570 [155 Cal.Rptr. 80], the court noted that the <em>Biswell </em>exception to the inspection warrant requirement was based on several factors: (1) a \u201cdeep-rooted history of regulation;\u201d (2) \u201cto be effective, inspections to secure compliance with licensing regulations had to be frequent and unannounced;\u201d and (3) \u201c[w]hen a dealer chooses to engage in this pervasively regulated business and to accept a federal license,\u201d he does so with knowledge of being \u201csubject to effective inspection.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 578.) The fact that <em>Biswell </em>dealt with a business is not the sole factor to be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">California\u2019s pervasive scheme of regulating wild game hunting would be a futile pursuit without frequent and unannounced patrols. Certain types of illegal hunting activity must be viewed on the scene; e.g., using lights or infrared sniperscopes (\u00a7 2005), hunting at night (\u00a7 3000), hunting while intoxicated (\u00a7 3001), shooting from a vehicle (\u00a7 3002), herding with a vehicle (\u00a7 3003.5), using a net, trap or poison (\u00a7 3005), or using dogs in hunting deer (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 14, \u00a7 265). Also, wild game, when reduced to possession, can easily be altered as to form and identity, concealed and moved. Of practical necessity, wardens must have the power to reasonably enter open private lands to enforce game regulations.  \u201c \u2018[Governmental officials may exercise such additional powers as are necessary for the due and efficient administration of powers expressly granted by statute, or as <em>may fairly be implied </em>from the statute granting the powers.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Cathey </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 679, 689 [12 Cal.Rptr. 762, 361 P.2d 426].)</p>\n<p id=\"b828-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>Procedural requirements for issuance of administrative inspection warrants are not compatible with enforcement of hunting regulations. Wardens would be required to locate and attempt to seek each landowner\u2019s consent prior to securing a warrant (or justify the failure to do so). (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1822.51.) If consent were refused, at least 24 hours notice would be required prior to execution of the warrant unless a judge found that immediate execution was reasonably necessary under the circumstances. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1822.56.) In dealing with enforcement of game regulations, this process is impractical and cannot be intended to apply to in-the-field checks by wardens.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">Hunters are required to be licensed. By choosing to engage in this highly regulated activity, there is a fundamental premise that there is an implied consent to effective supervision and inspection as directed by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Wild game hunting is not a commercial enterprise (as are the liquor and firearms industries). Nevertheless, hunting takes place in \u201copen fields\u201d whether publicly or privately owned; this is a convincing factor that plaintiff\u2019s expectation of privacy while hunting is unreasonable.  Open field sites are regarded as so public in nature that searches are justifiable without any particular showing of cause or exigency. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dumas </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 871, 882 &amp; fn. 10 [109 Cal.Rptr. 304, 512 P.2d 1208].) \u201cThis hierarchy of protection arises not from the application of differing constitutional standards to various locales, but rather from an application of a single standard of reasonableness to all places in accordance with a fundamental understanding that a particular intrusion into one domain of human existence [such as the home] seriously threatens personal security, while the same intrusion into another domain does not.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 882-883; see also <em>Joseph </em>v. <em>Masonite Corp. </em>(1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 6, 11-12 [195 Cal.Rptr. 629].)</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">The entries by the wardens are for the purpose of regulating and managing a state-owned resource. Thus, the circumstances are even more compelling than the warrantless inspections of privately owned assets authorized in the <em>Biswell </em>line of authority. The Legislature has given Fish and Game supervision over property belonging to the sovereign.  The warrantless entries by authorized fish and game personnel onto open fields constitute only a minimal intrusion into the private use of the property. Such entries are permitted where game is present and hunting occurs. The inspections may not exceed the specific limited purpose of enforcing wild game regulations, absent probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">King, J., and Haning, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b824-11\"> All references are to the Fish and Game Code unless otherwise stated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b825-10\"> California Constitution, article I, section 13, states: \u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable seizures and searches may not be violated; and a warrant may not issue except on probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons and things to be seized.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b826-7\"> California Constitution, article I, section 1 (section adopted Nov. 5, 1974), states: \u201cAll people are by nature free and independent and have inalienable rights.
