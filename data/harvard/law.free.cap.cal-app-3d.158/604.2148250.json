Petitioners were fined $8,000. We issued a writ of certiorari to review the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">This is not the first time petitioners have been enjoined from allowing lewd acts on their premises. This action finds its roots in a preliminary injunction issued against petitioner in 1978 based on a complaint filed pursuant to the Red Light Abatement Act (Pen. Code, \u00a7 11225 et seq.) (Sacramento County Superior Court No. 275319). That injunction enjoined petitioners from \u201callowing the occurrence, continuance or recurrence of acts of lewdness or assignation upon the premises . . . known as the Adult World Bookstore.\u201d That lawsuit was held in abeyance while one defendant in the case appealed the issuance of the preliminary injunction. In July 1980, we upheld that injunction in <em>People </em>v. <em>Adult World Bookstore </em>(1980) 108 Cal.App.3d 404 [166 Cal.Rptr. 519],</p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>On April 23, 1982, the Sacramento County District Attorney\u2019s Office filed a new complaint (Sacramento County Superior Court No. 303062) praying for, inter alia, a new preliminary injunction under California Penal Code sections 11225 through 11235 and Business and Professions Code sections 17200 through 17208<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>. The district attorney dismissed the prior complaint (No. 275319) on July 15, 1982, in order to proceed with the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">After reviewing numerous affidavits describing sordid details of sodomy, assignation, solicitation, oral copulation and other lewd acts occurring regularly on the premises of Adult World, Judge Lloyd A. Phillips, Jr. issued the injunction in this case on September 20, 1982, restraining petitioners \u201cfrom engaging in or in any manner allowing or permitting directly or indirectly the occurrence, continuance or recurrence of acts of lewdness, assignation or prostitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">On October 26, 1982, the district attorney by ex parte motion obtained an order to show cause why petitioners should not be held in contempt of court for violation of the preliminary injunction. Submitted in support of issuance of the order to show cause was an affidavit of officer Bob Gully which outlined in detail lewd acts he witnessed on the premises of Adult World on October 7, 1982. Another affidavit by Deputy District Attorney Terence Brown also alleged violations of the injunction on October 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">A hearing on the alleged contempt was conducted before Judge Phillips. Testimony demonstrated the previous lewd and illegal activity had continued unabated since issuance of the injunction and nothing but a perfunctory effort had been made to curb the activity. Over objection, and without causing the initiating affidavits to be amended (see Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1211.5, subd. (b)), the trial court admitted testimony that petitioners had allowed lewd acts to occur at Adult World on November 24, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>At the conclusion of the contempt hearing, Judge Phillips made an oral finding that defendant Reliable had not taken any reasonable steps to comply with the injunction. The court also filed a written order adjudging Reliable Enterprises, Inc., and its corporate officer, Max Delgadillo, in contempt and finding, inter alia, \u201ceach of the 8 acts of lewd behavior observed on October 7, 1982 and November 24, 1982 by Officer Gully was the result of Defendants\u2019 <em>willful failure </em>to obey the preliminary injunction.....\u201d (Italics added.) Five lewd acts occurred on October 7; three on November 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Petitioners then obtained from this court a writ of certiorari to review the contempt order. They contend the evidence was insufficient to support a finding the violation of the injunction was wilful, the injunction was unlawfully ambiguous, the affidavits in support of the order to show cause were inadequate to establish jurisdiction to adjudicate petitioners\u2019 contempt, and the trial court had no jurisdiction to fine them for eight acts of contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">We conclude petitioners were denied their constitutional rights to reasonable notice of the charges related to conduct on November 24 and we annul the three adjudications of contempt attributable to that conduct; we affirm the five adjudications of contempt attributable to conduct occurring on October 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">Before addressing petitioners\u2019 specific contentions, we set forth some principles generally applicable to this proceeding:</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">Code of Civil Procedure section 1209, subdivision (a)5, provides that disobedience of any lawful judgment, order or process of the court constitutes a contempt of the authority of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">\u201cDirect\u201d contempt is that committed in the immediate view and presence of the court or of the judge in chambers; all other contempts, such as this one, which occur outside the presence of the court, are \u201cindirect.\u201d (See <em>Nierenberg </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 59 Cal.App.3d 611, 616 [130 Cal.Rptr. 847].) A contempt is punishable by a fine not exceeding $1000 or by imprisonment not exceeding five days, or both. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1218.)</p>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">\u201cCalifornia courts have recognized that corporations are proper criminal defendants. As early as 1907 a California court held that \u2018 \u201cPrivate corporations in respect to their liability for the acts of their agents or servants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>stand before the law on the same footing as individuals.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Palermo Land &amp; Water Co. </em>(1907) 4 Cal.App.717, 721 [89 P. 723, 725] (hg. den. Mar. 28, 1907, as reported in 4 Cal.App. at p. 722); see generally, 17 Cal.Jur.3d \u00a7 39, and cases cited therein.)\u201d <em>(Granite Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 465, 467 [197 Cal.Rptr. 3].)</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">A private corporation may be adjudged in contempt for violation of an injunction. <em>(Golden Gate M. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Ct. </em>(1884) 65 Cal. 187, 190 [3 P. 628].)</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">\u201cBecause of the penalties imposed, a proceeding to punish an accused for contempt is criminal in nature, and guilt must be established beyond a reasonable doubt. [Citation.] . . . The power to weigh evidence, however, rests exclusively with the trial court. [Citations.] Accordingly, it is well settled that our responsibility upon review is merely to ascertain whether there existed any substantial evidence to sustain the jurisdiction of the trial court. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re Coleman </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 568, 572-573 [116 Cal.Rptr. 381, 526 P.2d 533], followed in <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 899, 913 [141 Cal.Rptr. 133, 569 P.2d 727].)</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Petitioners contend the evidence did not support a finding of \u201cwilful disobedience.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">An adjudication for indirect contempt requires that the record contain substantial evidence that the contemner wilfully and contemptuously refused to obey the order of the court. <em>(Oliver </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1961) 197 Cal.App.2d 237, 240 [17 Cal.Rptr. 474].) However, intent to violate an order may be inferred from the circumstances. <em>(City of Vernon </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1952) 38 Cal.2d 509, 518 [241 P.2d 243].)</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">The evidence adduced at the hearing demonstrates there was no change in the manner of doing business after the injunction was issued. Sergeant Bob Lyon testified he had been in Adult World 10 to 15 times since the injunction was issued and had seen lewd acts on the premises during each visit. All manner of lewd acts, including sodomy, masturbation, exhibitionism, assignation, prostitution, and oral and anal copulation continued on a daily basis in plain view of anyone walking down the aisles of the bookstore.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>Sergeant Lyon also testified that, on each visit, he found open glory holes;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and he had never been on the premises where he did not see semen on the floor of almost every booth, and several times, he saw human feces, condoms, and underwear. According to Sergeant Lyon, no agent or employee of Reliable did anything to discourage the lewd conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">Petitioner Delgadillo himself testified he visited the premises of Adult World \u201cevery single day.\u201d Occasionally, Delgadillo would visit Adult World two or three times a day, and he would always visit the area of the store where the film booths were located. Delgadillo testified he had a printed sign prepared prohibiting loitering and lewd acts on the premises, but he said the signs were torn down and replaced in what he described as a \u201ccontinuing process.\u201d However, Sergeant Lyon never saw the sign described by petitioner. Delgadillo also had three of his employees sign a memo explaining the terms of the injunction, but he apparently did nothing more to see to it that employees of the corporation would do anything to discourage lewd acts on the premises. For example, clerks were not required to visit the areas where lewd acts were occurring regularly.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Further evidence of petitioners\u2019 wilful disregard of the injunction is found in the testimony of Thomas E. Rutkowski, who worked as a clerk at Adult World between August and October 25, 1982. After issuance of the injunction, Rutkowski noticed semen constantly on the floor and males \u201ccruising\u201d regularly on the premises. Rutkowski also observed condoms, underwear and human feces on the floor of film viewing booths. Rutkowski complained to petitioner Delgadillo that semen was constantly on the floor of film viewing booths. However, Delgadillo took no action on Rutkowski\u2019s complaints and told him he would get back to him at a later date. Delgadillo never got back to Rutkowski to talk about the conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">During his 90 days as an employee of defendants, and while the injunction was in effect, Rutkowski saw the \u201cglory holes\u201d being boarded up on two occasions. On each occasion, the holes were closed for about two days and then were allowed to remain open. Rutkowski finally quit his job when he could no longer stand the conditions on the premises, on a day when he observed two males masturbating in a film booth.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Delgadillo\u2019s own testimony that he was on the premises every day, coupled with Rutkowski\u2019s testimony, demonstrates that petitioner Delgadillo, and therefore Reliable, had actual knowledge of numerous lewd acts occurring on the premises on a daily basis and that petitioners made only transparently token efforts to comply with the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>The record discloses wilful disobedience in repeated violations of the injunction. Substantial evidence supports the violations cited in the contempt order that occurred on October 7. (See <em>City of Vernon </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>38 Cal.2d at pp. 517-518.)</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Petitioners also contend the order of contempt was \u201cfatally\u201d defective because it assertedly failed to state facts upon which a finding of wilfulness was based.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">In a case of <em>direct </em>contempt, the court must make an order reciting the facts constituting the contempt. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1211; <em>In re Smith </em>(1976) 65 Cal.App.3d 291, 297-298 [135 Cal.Rptr. 5].)  However, in a case of <em>indirect </em>contempt, the court need not state evidentiary facts supporting an ultimate finding of wilful violation of an order. Such a finding will be upheld in a case of indirect contempt if it is supported by substantial evidence. (See <em>In re Morelli </em>(1970) 11 Cal.App.3d 819, 851 [91 Cal.Rptr. 72]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Loar) </em>(1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 600, 622, fn. 11 [104 Cal.Rptr. 876]; <em>In re Gould </em>(1961) 195 Cal.App.2d 172, 175 [15 Cal.Rptr. 326].) Here, the court made an appropriate ultimate finding that defendants\u2019 conduct was wilful.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Petitioners\u2019 reliance on <em>In re Ny </em>(1962) 201 Cal. App.2d 728 [20 Cal.Rptr. 114] is misplaced. There, the court adjudged the petitioner in contempt based upon an affidavit that asserted Mrs. Ny had violated a court order by refusing to deliver her children to their father, her ex-husband. (P. 731.) The court ruled that because Mrs. Ny had delivered the children to prospective adoptive parents, she did not have custody of the children; therefore, \u201ca finding of ability to perform has no evidentiary support.\u201d (P. 732.) Here, the record contains ample evidentiary support for the trial court\u2019s ultimate finding of wilful violation of the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">Finally, petitioners note that the order of contempt refers to Reliable and Delgadillo by name at the outset but later refers collectively to \u201cdefendants.\u201d Petitioners apparently contend the reference to \u201cdefendants\u201d is ambiguous and voids the order. Since only two defendants are named in the order, the plural reference to \u201cdefendants\u201d is clearly to Reliable and Delgadillo.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">Petitioners also claim the preliminary injunction is fatally ambiguous in its use of the words \u201callowing or permitting.\u201d When the injunction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>was issued, petitioners indicated on the record the injunction was \u201cfair;\u201d they first assert a claim of unfair ambiguity in their challenge to the contempt order.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">Petitioners correctly cite the following rule: \u201c\u2018To hold a person guilty of contempt for violating an injunction, the acts constituting the contempt must be clearly and specifically prohibited by the terms of the injunction. [Citations.] The party bound by an injunction must be able to determine from its terms what he may and may not do; he cannot be held guilty of contempt for violating an injunction that is uncertain or ambiguous <em>(Ibid.), </em>just as he may not be held guilty of violating a criminal statute that fails to give him adequate notice of the prohibited acts.\u2019 <em>(Brunton </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1942) 20 Cal.2d 202, 205 [124 P.2d 831].)\u201d <em>(Sorensen </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1969) 269 Cal.App.2d 73, 78 [74 Cal.Rptr. 597].)</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Conness </em>(1906) 150 Cal. 114 [88 P. 821], petitioners then argue, \u201cIt would appear that the words \u2018allow\u2019 and \u2018permit\u2019 connotate assent on the part of Petitioners. . . . The Respondent seems to have announced a strict liability interpretation of these words to require prevention. Respondent could have required prevention explicitly in his September 20, 1982 order, but did not do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The premise of the argument is correct: <em>Conness </em>does stand for the proposition that the words \u201callow\u201d and \u201cpermit\u201d imply some sort of assent on the part of the actor to be charged with criminal conduct. <em>(Conness, supra, </em>150 Cal. at p. 121.) The problem with petitioners\u2019 argument is that even if their proposed restrictive definition of \u201callowing or permitting\u201d is adopted so that assent is a necessary ingredient, there is ample evidence on the record to show petitioners assented to the lewd conduct occurring on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">As we have noted, substantial evidence shows petitioner Delgadillo had actual knowledge lewd acts were occurring daily in the area of the film viewing booths. According to Delgadillo, it was petitioners\u2019 practice to require patrons to purchase tokens from the cashier to gain admittance to the film booth area. Petitioners\u2019 actual knowledge of ongoing lewd conduct by patrons who paid money to petitioners, coupled with their inaction in light of this knowledge, constituted an \u201cactive wish,\u201d \u201cwillingness,\u201d or \u201csomething more than mere indifference\u201d to the lewd conduct. (See <em>Conness, supra, </em>150 Cal. at p. 121.)</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Due process requires only that the law give sufficient warning so that citizens may conduct themselves so as to avoid that which is forbidden. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number><em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(.Hartway) (1977) 19 Cal.3d 338, 345 [138 Cal.Rptr. 66, 562 P.2d 1315].)</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Since petitioners\u2019 conduct violated even their proposed definition of \u201callowing or permitting,\u201d they may not complain of vagueness in the injunction.

The statute obviously represents the Legislature\u2019s desire that contempt proceedings be adjudicated and reviewed on the merits and that contempt judgments not be set aside because of technical defects in an initiating affidavit. (See <em>Mossman </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1972) 22 Cal.App.3d 706, 710 [99 Cal.Rptr. 638] [under Code of Civil Procedure section 1211.5, defects in affidavit did not void contempt proceedings <em>ab </em>initio].) Thus, for example, subdivision (a) of section 1211.5 provides that if no objection is made to the sufficiency of an affidavit, subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>matter jurisdiction \u201cmay be established by the facts found by the trial court to have been proved at [the] hearing . . . .\u201d Petitioners made no objection in the trial court to the initiating affidavits on the grounds asserted above. We conclude the facts found by the trial court establish jurisdiction.

However, that omission did not \u201cprejudice a substantial right of the person accused on the merits.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1211.5, subd. (c).) Subdivision (c) of Code of Civil Procedure section 1211.5 provides in pertinent part, \u201cNo . . . judgment of conviction of contempt shall be set aside ... for any error as to any matter of pleading in such affidavit . . . unless, after an examination of the entire cause, including the evidence, the court shall be of the opinion that the error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d (See fn. 6, <em>ante.) </em>The failure of initiating affidavits to state a wilful violation of petitioners\u2019 ability to comply did not constitute a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Petitioners also argue that only lewd acts that occurred on October 7, 1982, were referred to in the affidavits whereas, over objection, the People were allowed to present evidence of lewd acts that occurred on the premises on November 24, 1982,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the Wednesday preceding the hearing. The affidavits were not amended, as required by subdivision (b) of Code of Civil Procedure section 1211.5.

Rather, the prosecution explicitly disavowed that the evidence was offered for that purpose. Yet the court\u2019s remarks suggest the evidence was being admitted for the purpose of establishing additional contempts.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (See fn. 8, <em>ante.) </em>This ambiguity between the purpose for which the evidence was offered and the purpose for which it was apparently admitted was not resolved until the conclusion of the hearing when the court in fact held petitioners in contempt for allowing three lewd acts on November 24. Had the court followed the required statutory procedure of amending the affidavit (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1211.5, subd.

While some American cases have departed from the rule that a sworn affidavit must be used to initiate indirect contempt proceedings, to our knowledge the cases have uniformly insisted the accused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>be presented with a writing setting forth the alleged contempt.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (See, e.g., <em>In re Morelli, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.3d at pp. 828-829; <em>Ex Parte Winfree </em>(1953) 153 Tex. 12 [263 S.W.2d 154, 41 A.L.R.2d 1259]; <em>Sheets </em>v. <em>City of Hagerstown </em>(1954) 204 Md. 113] [102 A.2d 734]; <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>State </em>(1948) 251 Ala. 11 [37 So.2d 276]; <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1921) 151 Ga. 365 [106 S.E. 907]; see generally Annot., Necessity of affidavit or sworn statement as foundation for constructive contempt (1955) 41 A.L.R.2d 1263.)</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">We do not reach the question whether, in a case of indirect contempt, an affidavit may be properly amended during trial to allege wholly new offenses that occurred after filing of the accusatory pleading (the affidavit). (But see <em>People </em>v. <em>Berkowitz </em>(1977) 68 Cal.App.3d Supp. 9 [137 Cal.Rptr. 313].) Due process requires that an accused be given reasonably clear notice of whether he is being charged with criminal conduct.  Here, the failure to amend the affidavit resulted in prejudicial uncertainty as to the purpose for which the November 24 evidence was admitted. Because petitioners were not given reasonably clear notice of the charges relating to November 24, their constitutional rights to due process of law were violated under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States and article I, section 7, subdivision (a) of the California Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">For present purposes, we assume arguendo the error is not per se reversible but is rather subject to the <em>Chapman </em>test of harmless error. (See <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710-711, 87 S.Ct. 824, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065]; see generally <em>Connecticut </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1983) 460 U.S. 73, [74 L.Ed.2d 823, 103 S.Ct. 969].) Because the ambiguity in notice of the charges was not resolved until the conclusion of the hearing, we have no way to gauge the effect of defective notice on petitioners\u2019 ability to defend against the charges. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>McNeill </em>(1980) 112 Cal.App.3d 330, 336 [169 Cal.Rptr. 313].) We must therefore conclude the constitutional violations constitute a miscarriage of justice requiring annulment of the three contempt adjudications related to conduct on November 24. (See <em>In re Robert G. </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 437, 445 [182 Cal.Rptr. 644, 644 P.2d 837]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lohbauer </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 364, 370, 373 [173 Cal.Rptr. 453, 627 P.2d 183]; <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>386 U.S. at p. 24 [17 L.Ed.2d at pp. 710-711]; Code Civ.

(c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">Petitioners argue they may not be adjudged in contempt for each lewd act shown by the evidence to have occurred on a single day; rather, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>petitioners contend that, at most, they can be adjudged of having committed one contempt per day. We conclude that, on these facts, petitioners are incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">Contempt is a disobedience of court by acting in opposition to its authority, justice or dignity. <em>(Raskin </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1934) 138 Cal.App. 668, 670 [33 P.2d 35].)  Every separate act of disobedience of an injunction is a separate contempt. <em>(Donovan </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1952) 39 Cal.2d 848, 855 [250 P.2d 246]; <em>Golden Gate M. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Ct., supra, </em>65 Cal. at p. 192; see generally <em>In re Stafford </em>(1958) 160 Cal.App.2d 110, 113 [324 P.2d 967], discussing cases.)</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">We believe the crucial question is whether separate adjudications of contempt were based upon separate insults to the authority of the court, not whether the insults happened to occur on the same or different days. (See 5 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Enforcement of Judgment, \u00a7 172, p. 3533.)</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Case law has sanctioned the imposition of separate punishments for contempt where the contemner has engaged in separate insults to the authority of the court on the same day. Thus, for example, in <em>Hume </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 506, at pages 515-517 [110 P.2d 669], our Supreme Court upheld an adjudication of two counts of contempt against an attorney who filed a contumacious amended complaint and a contumacious affidavit on the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">In <em>In re Coleman, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d 568, the trial court, on August 24, 1972, issued a temporary restraining order enjoining a union and its members and agents from committing any acts of harassment or intimidation against those who continued to deal with a hospital. (P. 571.) The union\u2019s business agent, one Flagg, and the union were adjudged guilty of having committed 28 separate contempts between August 24, 1972, and September 15, 1972. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Flagg was found to have thrown ice and paint, to have spit on various hospital representatives, and to have \u201ctailgated\u201d the vehicle of a nonstriking nurse. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The Supreme Court refused to issue a writ of habeas corpus as to Flagg and the union.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Although the question of multiple contempts was not raised, simple mathematical calculation reveals that both the union and Flagg had to commit multiple contempts on some days in order to commit 28 contempts between August 24 and September 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>Petitioners rely on <em>In re Keller </em>(1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 663 [123 Cal.Rptr. 223], where the court held the refusal of a witness to answer six separate questions constituted but one contempt. (See also <em>Yates </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1957) 355 U.S. 66 [2 L.Ed.2d 95, 78 S.Ct. 128]; <em>Ex parte Stice </em>(1886) 70 Cal. 51 [11 P. 459]; Annot., Power to base separate contempt prosecutions or punishments on successive refusals to respond to same or similar questions (1964) 94 A.L.R.2d 1246.) The rule of <em>Keller, </em>however, is premised on the peculiar unfairness inherent in allowing a questioner to pile contempt upon contempt by asking a series of questions within an area of inquiry about which the witness has already indicated an unwillingness to answer: \u201cWe should not leave it to counsel to devise questions that might stand up as separate contempts or permit the recalling of a witness several days running and finding each refusal to testify to be a separate contempt. These are mere devices to permit effective punishment and are unfitting to the dignity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>(In re Keller, supra, </em>49 Cal.App.3d at p. 671; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Costello </em>(2d Cir. 1952) 198 F.2d 200, 204, cert. den. 344 U.S. 874 [97 L.Ed. 677, 73 S.Ct. 166].)</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Here, unlike <em>Keller, </em>petitioners\u2019 contempts were not generated by the conduct of others, acting beyond petitioners\u2019 control. Contrary to petitioners\u2019 contention, they were not adjudged in contempt simply because numerous lewd acts involving others occurred on the premises of Adult World. Rather, they were held multiply in contempt because they took no reasonable steps to discourage lewd acts occurring regularly on the premises and observable by any reasonable person. Unlike a recalcitrant witness, petitioners were reasonably in control of the conduct on October 7 that led to their several adjudications of contempt. The recalcitrant witness cases are therefore inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">By their citation to <em>In re Farr </em>(1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 605 [134 Cal.Rptr. 595], petitioners apparently contend punishment for more than one contempt per day is precluded by Penal Code section 654.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Farr </em>is not precisely on point, because it held section 654\u2019s preclusion of multiple <em>prosecutions </em>applicable to contempt proceedings. <em>(Farr, supra, </em>at p. 613.)  However, it is generally recognized that section 654\u2019s prohibition of multiple <em>punishments </em>applies to penal provisions found in codes other than the Penal Code. (See, e.g., <em>In re Adams </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 629, 633 [122 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>Cal.Rptr. 73, 536 P.2d 473]; <em>In re Hayes </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 604, 605 [75 Cal.Rptr. 790, 451 P.2d 430]; 2 Witkin, Cal. Crimes (1963) \u00a7 948, p. 901.)  We therefore conclude Penal Code section 654\u2019s preclusion of multiple punishments applies to punishments for contempt under Code of Civil Procedure, section 1218. Regrettably, this conclusion plunges us into the dark waters of Penal Code section 654\u2019s prohibition on multiple punishments.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">We believe two things may be said with certainty about this statutory ban on multiple punishments.  One is that, \u201cThe purpose of this legislative protection against punishment for more than one violation arising out of an \u2018act or omission\u2019 is to insure that a defendant\u2019s punishment will be commensurate with his culpability. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Perez </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 545, 550-551 [153 Cal.Rptr. 40, 591 P.2d 63].) The other is, \u201cBecause of the many differing circumstances wherein criminal conduct involving multiple violations may be deemed to arise out of an \u2018act or omission,\u2019 there can be no universal construction which directs the proper application of section 654 in every instance. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Beamon </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 625, 636 [105 Cal.Rptr. 681, 504 P.2d 905].) Rather, each case must be determined upon its own facts. <em>(In re Adams, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d at p. 633.)</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">We perceive two different tests for determining whether section 654 should apply to preclude multiple punishments in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The first is the famous test of <em>Neal </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1960) 55 Cal.2d 11, at page 19 [9 Cal.Rptr. 607, 357 P.2d 839]; \u201cWhether a course of criminal conduct is divisible and therefore gives rise to more than one act within the meaning of section 654 depends on the intent and objective of the actor. If all of the offenses were incident to one objective, the defendant may be punished for any one of such offenses but not for more than one.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">The <em>Neal </em>test has not been without problems.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Later cases recognized a defendant could commit any number of separate horrid acts in pursuit of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>single objective, but a facial application of the <em>Neal </em>test would limit that defendant\u2019s punishment to the same punishment as would be imposed on a defendant who committed but one unlawful act. Some cases have responded by constricting the objective of the defendant as is appropriate to achieve a just measure of culpability.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Thus, for example, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Perez, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d 545, defendant was convicted of multiple forcible sex crimes committed during a brutal 45-minute attack on the victim. (Pp. 548-549.) On an appeal by the People, defendant contended the trial court had properly stayed all but one sex-crime sentence under <em>Neal, </em>because defendant\u2019s intent and objective was to obtain sexual gratification. \u201cWe disagree,\u201d said the court. \u201cSuch an intent and objective is much too broad and amorphous to determine the applicability of section 654. Assertion of a sole intent and objective to achieve sexual gratification is akin to an assertion of a desire for wealth as the sole intent and objective in committing a series of separate thefts. To accept such a broad, overriding intent and objective to preclude punishment for otherwise clearly separate offenses would violate the statute\u2019s purpose to insure that a defendant\u2019s punishment will be commensurate with his culpability. [Citation.] It would reward the defendant who has the greater criminal ambition with a lesser punishment. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Perez, supra, </em>at p. 552; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Ratcliffe </em>(1981) 124 Cal.App.3d 808, 818-819 [177 Cal.Rptr. 627]; compare <em>In re Adams, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d 629 [transportation of various kinds of illegal narcotics constituted but one unlawful act].)</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">A similar theme is found in <em>People </em>v. <em>Neder </em>(1971) 16 Cal.App.3d 846 [94 Cal.Rptr. 364], where defendant was convicted of three counts of forgery after having forged a signature on three credit-card purchase slips in connection with three separate purchases of merchandise in the same Sears store on the same day. Acknowledging, \u201cit might be said that the offenses were incident to the fundamental objective of taking goods from Sears by use of the credit card and by forging the sales slips\u201d (pp. 853-854), nonetheless the court found separate objectives because \u201cwe have three separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>forgeries, each directed to the obtaining of different property and none playing a part in the accomplishment of the end of the others. We do not believe that section 654 should make it a matter of indifference whether defendants, on entering the Sears store with the intention to obtain goods fraudulently by means of forgery, carried out the intention one or three times. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 854; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Richardson </em>(1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 853, 867-868 [148 Cal.Rptr. 120].)</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">We follow <em>Perez </em>and <em>Neder </em>here. The record before us shows patrons visited Adult World to participate in lewd acts there. It might be said petitioners\u2019 objective in allowing or permitting numerous lewd acts to occur on the premises each day was generally to make money from amounts charged patrons. Petitioners\u2019 objective is more accurately characterized, however, as the desire to maximize income from as many patrons as possible. That objective, in turn, means that petitioners\u2019 specific criminal objectives were to allow many separate lewd acts involving many different patrons to occur daily on the premises.  Whether petitioners maintained multiple criminal objectives is primarily a question of fact for the trial court, whose finding will be upheld on appeal if there is any substantial evidence to support it. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Goodall </em>(1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 129, 148 [182 Cal.Rptr. 243], and authorities cited therein.)  Here, substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s implied finding petitioners intended that each separate lewd act on October 7 occur, so that multiple punishment is not precluded by the <em>Neal </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">A somewhat different test of impermissible multiple punishment was adopted in <em>People </em>v. <em>Bauer </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 368 [82 Cal.Rptr. 357, 461 P.2d 637, 37 A.L.R.3d 1398], certiorari denied 400 U.S. 927 [27 L.Ed.2d 187, 91 S.Ct. 190]. There defendant robbed three elderly ladies and stole their car to make his escape. He was sentenced for robbery and auto theft. However, the Supreme Court held he could not be multiply punished, because the crimes constituted \u201ca course of conduct comprising an indivisible transaction.\u201d (P. 377; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 36, 65 [201 Cal.Rptr. 782, 679 P.2d 433].)</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Justice Kaus, then sitting on Division Five of the Second District Court of Appeal, wrote of <em>Bauer. </em>\u201cIn <em>Bauer </em>the Supreme Court stresses a far more objective test: does the evidence show multiple crimes which are part of \u2018a course of conduct comprising an indivisible transaction. \u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bauer, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at p. 377.) Granted that, even so, a record made for the purpose of proving the defendant guilty is still a poor vehicle for determining an entirely different issue, the \u2018indivisible transaction\u2019 test at least gets away from speculative inquiries into defendant\u2019s overall objectives. Furthermore, the \u2018intent and objective\u2019 test appears to place a pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>mium on \u2018thinking big\u2019 when planning a crime wave, a perverse notion which we should not attribute to the Legislature.\u201d <em>(.People </em>v. <em>Venegas </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 814, 827-828 [89 Cal.Rptr. 103], conc. opn. of Kaus, J., fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">By the so-called \u201cobjective test\u201d we conclude petitioners\u2019 conduct was not part of an indivisible transaction. The lewd acts themselves were committed by different people. None was necessary to the commission of any other. (Compare <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d at p. 65.) Each participating patron presumably paid money to petitioners. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Heder, supra, </em>16 Cal.App.3d at pp. 854-855.) Petitioners could have allowed one lewd act or a hundred. Their allowance of multiple acts was in no sense an \u201cindivisible\u201d transaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Having worked through the <em>Neal </em>and <em>Bauer </em>tests, we confess we find them relatively unhelpful. Presumably, the tests were designed to aid lower courts by setting forth guidelines for the application of Penal Code section 654. Yet we question whether these abstract tests of \u201csubjective\u201d intent or \u201cobjective\u201d \u201cindivisibility\u201d of a \u201ctransaction\u201d serve their purpose. For the most part, the cases manipulate the tests to arrive at a suitable level of culpability and consequent punishment. The tests are like the gluttonous butler: designed to help but often a burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">We believe any uncertainty in application of the <em>Neal </em>and <em>Bauer </em>tests is best resolved by a return to basic principles of culpability. If, for example, we ask, \u201cWho is deserving of the greater punishment, the citizen who violates an injunction by allowing a lewd act or the citizen who violates it by allowing five separate lewd acts?\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> we suggest the obvious answer is the citizen who allows five lewd acts, because he has caused more harm to the public good. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Ramos </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 553, 589 [180 Cal.Rptr. 266, 639 P.2d 908]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Perez, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at p. 553; <em>People </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(1977) 18 Cal.3d 873, 885 [135 Cal.Rptr. 654, 558 P.2d. 552].)</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Petitioners\u2019 punishment for five counts of contempt is not precluded by Penal Code section 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">Petitioner Delgadillo apparently contends he cannot be adjudged multiply in contempt, because he had no actual knowledge of the lewd acts that occurred on October 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>However, where a defendant intends to cause criminal harm, \u201cThe precise consequence need not have been foreseen; it is enough that the defendant should have foreseen the possibility of some harm of the kind which might result from his act.\u201d (1 Witkin, Cal. Crimes (1963) \u00a7 84, p. 82; compare <em>People </em>v. <em>Spring </em>(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 1199 [200 Cal.Rptr. 849]; see generally Kenny, <em>Intention and Purpose in Law, </em>in Essays in Legal Philosophy (Summers edit. 1976) p. 146.) Thus in <em>People </em>v. <em>Gaither </em>(1959) 173 Cal.App.2d 662 [343 P.2d 799], defendant thoughtfully mailed a box of candy to his ex-wife at her address in Los Angeles. The candy consisted of four cute Easter bunnies and some peanut brittle. Defendant\u2019s ex-wife did not eat any candy. However, four people living in the house with her ate the candy and got sick, because the candy contained enough arsenic to kill 75 people. Two other people were also living in the house but did not eat the candy. (P. 666.) Since the evidence showed defendant wanted to cause harm and expected the candy might be eaten by seven people, he was properly convicted of seven counts of attempted poisoning. (Pp. 668, 672.)</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">Here petitioner Delgadillo intended that lewd acts should occur on the premises. He knew numerous lewd acts were occurring each day, including October 7. It was therefore readily foreseeable that petitioner\u2019s failure to discourage the lewd conduct would result in the commission of at least five lewd acts on October 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Each separate lewd act wilfully allowed by petitioner constituted a separate violation of the injunction. Petitioner\u2019s culpability is not lessened simply because he did not know the precise number of lewd acts that occurred on the day in question. One who is subject to an injunction issued by the superior court cannot intend that multiple violations of the injunction occur and then escape full responsibility by claiming, like the proverbial monkey, that his eyes were shielded from the full extent of his wrong.

There, without citation to authority or further explanation, the court for some reason volunteered: \u201cIt has been held by this court and other courts, with entire unanimity, that when the contempt is a constructive contempt, namely, committed without the presence of the court, the affidavit of facts forming the basis of judicial action must show upon its face a case of contempt; and, if it does not, then the court is wanting in jurisdiction, and the order of contempt is void.\u201d (P. 284.)

The subsequent cases have simply elaborated the confusion that existed in <em>Neal </em>itself. There are two primary sources of ambiguity. First, it has never been clear to what extent <em>Neal </em>abandoned the \u2018single act\u2019 formula. As a result, many of the cases have proceeded as if the only important question were the presence or absence of distinct criminal acts on the part of the defendant. Other cases have held or implied that it makes no difference how many distinct acts were involved, if they were all incident to a single intent and objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>live. [K] The second source of ambiguity is the \u2018single intent and objective\u2019 test itself. The California supreme court has never given a coherent explanation of what this concept means, except that it is clearly designed to prevent punishment for both a preparatory crime and for the completed crime which is its object. Whether it has any broader meaning is hard to say. The court has occasionally indicated that a series of distinct criminal acts that are part of some larger transaction may not be subjected to separate punishments, but at other times it has forcefully rejected any such idea. The court is understandably wary of expanding the \u2018single intent and objective\u2019 test, because the test has very little to do with any rational criterion that might govern the appropriate degree of punishment. A defendant who commits several crimes is not necessarily less culpable or less dangerous if all the crimes were intended to further a single ultimate purpose.\u201d (Johnson, <em>Multiple Punishment and Consecutive Sentences: Reflections on the Neal Doctrine </em>(1970) 58 Cal.L.Rev. 357, 377-378, fns. omitted.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b464-10\"> This characterization is charitable to petitioners.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADq\">Concurring and Dissenting.\u2014I concur in part and dissent in part. I would affirm all eight judgments of contempt, including the three arising out of conduct on November 24, 1982. The majority con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>eludes that the failure to amend the affidavits to conform to the testimony at the hearing alleging these three incidents substantially prejudiced the rights of petitioners. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">It is true the affidavits were not amended to conform to the proof admitted concerning three additional lewd acts on November 24, 1982, introduced as testimony at the hearing by Detective Gully. The trial court admitted proof of the additional evidence over objection. Although the affidavits were not amended, I do not think it is a fatal error. Code of Civil Procedure, section 1211.5, subdivision (c)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, allows reversal only where an error results in a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">In assessing whether a miscarriage occurred, I would first note that the order to show cause, served on petitioners, charged that petitioners refused to obey the injunction, and, thus, they had notice to defend themselves. Petitioners cannot be surprised to have to defend themselves from evidence admitted in proof when (1) the order alleging disobedience of an injunction was served on petitioners September 21, with a hearing scheduled for November 29, and (2) petitioners did offer general denials that lewd acts <em>ever </em>occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Furthermore, petitioners failed to counter the allegations concerning November 24 with any defense witness, testimony, legal theory or fact. I may infer that their offer of nothing more than a general denial regarding other incidents and other days means they had no specific defense to prepare for other incidents and other days. In fact, they did not preserve their objection to testimony for one of those days; they failed to move for a mistrial or for a continuance to prepare additional defense or to obtain witnesses. Petitioners now contend the failure to provide fair warning precluded an opportunity to prepare a defense, but they failed to take steps at the hearing to request any such opportunity. Finally, they have offered neither the trial court nor this court what that defense would have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Nor do I believe it is controlling here whether the People offered evidence of acts on November 24 for any purpose other than establishing additional contempts. There was no ambiguity between the purpose for which the evidence was offered and for which it was admitted; the trial court stated for the record, and quite correctly, that the court was not limited to considering the lewd incidents specified in the affidavit. The court made it per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>fectly clear all the incidents were to be used. Thus, there was no element of surprise. The only error is the court\u2019s failure to conform the affidavits to the proof adduced at trial. I believe that error did not prejudice any substantial right of petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">I have examined the record of the entire cause, and the evidence admitted at the hearing provided overwhelming proof of their wilful disobedience of the injunction, all the time, day after day. They cannot be surprised at the hearing to have to defend themselves from allegations of violations on days other than the specific day noted in Gully\u2019s affidavit. No other conceivable result could have been forthcoming from this hearing than a contempt order for all eight violations. There was no miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">I would affirm the contempt order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b466-8\"> Code of Civil Procedure section 1211.5, subdivision (c), provides in part: \u201c(c) <em>. . .
