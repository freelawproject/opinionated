J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ap-z\">County of Orange (County) appeals an order requiring it to disclose to The Register Division of Freedom Newspapers, Inc. (The Register), certain documents regarding a secret settlement agreement reached between the County and Michael T. Clemens, a tort claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">Clemens filed a claim against the County in accordance with section 945.4 of the Government Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He alleged his throat was slashed by a fellow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>inmate while incarcerated at the Orange County Jail. Clemens, a convicted child molester, charged the County negligently transferred him from his protective custody cell into a cellblock with other inmates where it was likely he would be harmed. County counsel referred his claim to the county administrative office\u2019s risk management staff who in turn asked the sheriff to investigate the claim. In September of 1982, Clemens\u2019 attorney wrote to the County requesting settlement, and attached copies of Clemens\u2019 medical records. Upon completion of the investigation, the claim was referred to the County\u2019s claims settlement committee<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which discussed and approved the settlement offer at a secret meeting held on October 11, 1982. Subsequently, several warrant stubs were issued to Clemens by the county controller\u2019s office. On October 22, 1982, Clemens signed a document releasing the County of \u201call claims\u201d against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">In January of 1983, The Register requested access to the settlement documents, but was refused. It then petitioned the superior court for an order compelling disclosure of the records pursuant to the California Public Records Act (hereafter CPRA). (\u00a7\u00a7 6250-6265.) The petition also asked the court to declare a constitutional right of public access to the records based on First and Fourteenth Amendment grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The court ordered the County to provide The Register with copies of each of the documents contained in the settlement file, as described in the County\u2019s response.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The disclosure order was based on <em>both </em>constitutional (U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>Const., 1st and 14th Amends.) and statutory grounds. (CPRA and Brown Act.).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">County argues the trial court erroneously relied upon constitutional grounds and ignored statutory exemptions from disclosure under section 6254<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for certain documents: The sheriff investigation and crime reports (docs. 5 &amp; 6, \u00a7 6254, subds. (f) and (k)); Clemens\u2019 medical records enclosed with his attorney\u2019s settlement request letter (doc. 8, \u00a7 6254, subd. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>(c)); and the rough undated notes made by risk management staff (doc. 16, \u00a7 6254, subd. (a)). County further asserts the minutes of the claims settlement committee meeting (doc. 10) are exempt from disclosure under section 54957.2 of the Brown Act,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> while the remaining settlement documents\u2014 pertaining to the annuity policy (docs. 7, 9 &amp; 15), request for warrants and warrant stubs (docs. 11 &amp; 13), and confirmation of settlement and settlement agreement (docs. 12 &amp; 14)\u2014are exempt from disclosure under section 6255<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> since the public interest in disclosure is outweighed by the public interest in nondisclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Lastly, County argues the trial court failed to inspect all the settlement documents <em>in camera </em>prior to ordering their disclosure and thus abused its discretion under the provisions of section 6259.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">We find that a newspaper has no special constitutional right of access to the settlement records of the County. No California or federal judicial decision has ever attributed accessibility to public records upon First Amendment freedoms of speech or press. <em>(San Gabriel Tribune </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 762, 774 [192 Cal.Rptr. 415]; see also <em>Estate of Hearst </em>(1977) 67 Cal.App.3d <em>111, </em>785-786 [136 Cal.Rptr. 821]; Accord, <em>Houchins </em>v. <em>KQED, Inc. </em>(1978) 438 U.S. 1, 15 [57 L.Ed.2d 553, 565].) Thus, to the extent the lower court\u2019s disclosure order was grounded on First Amendment considerations, it was erroneous. The court, however, also based its ruling on the CPRA and Brown Act. We now turn to these statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>The CPRA, enacted in 1968, was intended to safeguard the accountability of government to the public. <em>(San Gabriel Tribune </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>143 Cal.App.3d at p. 771.) Section 6250 of the act declares: \u201c[i]n enacting this chapter, the Legislature, mindful of the right of individuals to privacy, finds and declares that access to information concerning the conduct of the people\u2019s business is a fundamental and necessary right of every person in this state.\u201d The general policy of the CPRA favors disclosure. <em>(Cook </em>v. <em>Craig </em>(1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 773, 781 [127 Cal.Rptr. 712].) Accordingly, support for a claim of nondisclosure \u201cmust be found, if at all, among the specific exceptions to the general policy that are enumerated in the Act.\u201d <em>(State of California </em>ex rel. <em>Division of Industrial Safety </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 43 Cal.App.3d 778, 783 [117 Cal.Rptr. 726].)</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The CPRA defines \u201cpublic records\u201d as \u201cany writing containing information relating to the conduct of the public\u2019s business prepared, owned, used, or retained by any state or local agency regardless of physical form or characteristics.\u201d (\u00a7 6252, subd. (d).) \u201cLocal agency\u201d is defined to include \u201ca county; city . . .; political subdivision; or any board, commission or agency thereof; ....\u201d(\u00a7 6252, subd. (b).) Thus, the County\u2019s claims settlement committee is a \u201clocal agency\u201d under the CPRA and the documents relating to settlement of a private personal injury claim with public funds constitute \u201cwritings\u201d containing information regarding \u201cthe conduct of the public business,\u201d subject to public inspection and disclosure under the CPRA. (\u00a7\u00a7 6253, 6256.)</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">To determine a claim of exemption from the CPRA\u2019s disclosure provisions, the court may but is <em>not </em>required to examine the disputed records <em>in camera. </em>Section 6259 provides the \u201ccourt shall decide the case after examining the record <em>in camera, if permitted by subdivision (b) of Section 915 of the Evidence Code, </em>papers filed by the parties and such oral argument and additional evidence as the court may allow.\u201d (Italics added.) However, the <em>in camera </em>hearing provisions of Evidence Code section 915, subdivision (b) are permissive.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Biggs) </em>(1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 522, 531 [97 Cal.Rptr. 118].) Thus, under section 6259 <em>\u201cin camera </em>inspection of the record in question is not required as a matter of law, but is trusted to the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>(Yarish </em>v. <em>Nelson </em>(1972) 27 Cal.App.3d 893, 904 [104 Cal.Rptr. 205].) Guided by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>these principles, we examine each of County\u2019s exemption claims and whether the court\u2019s failure to conduct an <em>in camera </em>inspection of each of the disputed settlement documents constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">A. <em>Medical Records</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Clemens\u2019 medical records were appended to a letter written by Clemens\u2019 attorney to the County requesting settlement of the claim (doc. 8).  County claims they are exempt from disclosure under subdivision (c) of section 6254 (fn. 5, <em>ante), </em>since they were submitted to substantiate Clemens\u2019 personal injury claim and not for the purpose of making them public. Thus disclosure of these records would constitute \u201can unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d within the meaning of section 6254, subdivision (c). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">CPRA provisions evidence legislative concern with \u201ctwo fundamental if somewhat competing societal concerns\u2014prevention of secrecy in government and protection of individual privacy.\u201d <em>(Black Panther Party </em>v. <em>Kehoe </em>(1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 645, 651 [117 Cal.Rptr. 106]; see \u00a7 6250.) While the \u201cright to know\u201d is centered upon the need for openness in the management of governmental affairs, \u201c[s]ocietal concern for privacy focuses on minimum exposure of personal information collected for governmental purposes.\u201d (Ib<em>id.) </em>The purpose of the exemption for private records embodied in subdivision (c) of section 6254 is to \u201c. . . \u2018protect information of a highly personal nature which is on file with a public agency . . . [to] typically apply to public employee\u2019s personnel folders or sensitive personal information which individuals <em>must </em>submit to government.\u2019 \u201d <em>(San Gabriel Tribune </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>143 Cal.App.3d at p. 777, citing A Final Rep. Cal. Statewide Information Policy Com. Rep. (Mar. 1970) pp. 9-10, 1 Appen. to J. of the Assem. (1970, Reg. Sess.), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">The medical records enclosed in Clemens\u2019 letter requesting settlement, although private in nature, were <em>voluntarily </em>submitted to substantiate Clemens\u2019 personal injury claim. Their disclosure was to further his private interest, to settle the case, not to accomplish any governmental purpose or goal. By making his personal injury claim, Clemens placed his alleged physical injuries, and medical records substantiating the same, in issue. Furthermore, by voluntarily submitting these records to the County for the purpose of reaching a settlement on his claim, Clemens tacitly <em>waived </em>any expectation of privacy regarding these medical records. Similarly, the County utilized these supporting medical records in arriving at its decision to settle the claim. It cannot now hide behind Clemens\u2019 \u201cprivacy\u201d claim to justify its concealment of these records from public scrutiny. (Cf. <em>San Ga</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number><em>briel Tribune </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>143 Cal.App.3d 762, 778, holding section 6254, subdivision (k) inapplicable to private utility company\u2019s financial data serving as the basis for governmental decision to approve a rate increase benefiting the company.)</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">We hold the \u201cmedical records\u201d exemption under section 6254, subdivision (c) does not apply. In so holding we note the trial court did not abuse its discretion by failing to examine these records <em>in camera, </em>since it was uncontroverted the records related only to Clemens\u2019 allegations of personal injury stemming from the jail incident.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">B. <em>Investigation Reports</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">County claims two documents prepared by the sheriff\u2019s office (docs. 5 &amp; 6) are protected from disclosure under subdivisions (f) and (k) of section 6254. (Fn. 5, <em>ante.) </em>One contains the sheriff\u2019s investigation report regarding the throat slashing incident requested by the County\u2019s risk management office; the other document is a crime report of attempted homicide on the incident. We first address County\u2019s exemption claim under subdivision (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">Subdivision (f) exempts from disclosure records of complaints or investigations conducted \u201cfor correctional, law enforcement or licensing purposes.\u201d It also provides, however, exceptions <em>allowing </em>disclosure of specific information contained in investigative files as follows: (1) Specified information from records of incidents involving bodily injury, property damage or loss must be disclosed to the victims (or their authorized representative), to an insurance carrier against whom a claim is made, and to any person suffering the resulting injury; (2) specified information regarding every arrest made by law enforcement agencies; (3) specified information regarding all \u201ccomplaints or requests for assistance\u201d received by these agencies. Disclosure under these exceptions is <em>not </em>required, however, if it \u201cwould endanger the safety of a person involved in the investigation, or . . . the successful completion of the investigation or a related investigation. . . .\u201d Moreover, \u201cdisclosure of that portion of. . . investigative files which reflect the analysis or conclusions of the investigating officer\u201d is not allowed. (\u00a7 6254, subds. (f),(l)(2); see 65 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 563, 566-567 (1982).)</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">The Register claims the sheriff\u2019s investigation report does not fall within subdivision (f)\u2019s exemption because it was <em>not </em>conducted for \u201ccor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>rectional, law enforcement or licensing purposes,\u201d but was instead conducted at the request of the County\u2019s risk management office primarily for the purpose of ascertaining the facts in much the same way investigations are undertaken by insurance company claim adjustors. Thus, the sheriff\u2019s investigation was not for law enforcement purposes, but rather to discover the facts upon which to determine the County\u2019s civil liability stemming from the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">We agree. The record reflects the sheriff\u2019s investigation <em>was </em>undertaken at the County\u2019s instance to determine the validity of Clemens\u2019 tort liability claim. Thus, the sheriff\u2019s report does <em>not </em>fall within the \u201ccorrectional, law enforcement or licensing\u201d exemption under subdivision (f). Moreover, even assuming arguendo the sheriff\u2019s report <em>might </em>have law enforcement implications, subdivision (f) is applicable <em>only </em>when the prospect of law enforcement is \u201cconcrete and definite.\u201d <em>(Uribe </em>v. <em>Howie </em>(1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 194, 212, 213 [96 Cal.Rptr. 493]; see also <em>State of California </em>ex rel. <em>Division of Industrial Safety </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>43 Cal.App.3d at p. 784.) No such showing was made below.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">We now turn to subdivision (f)\u2019s applicability to the disputed crime report of attempted homicide. While this report falls within subsection (f)\u2019s \u201claw enforcement\u201d exempted category, it, however, also falls within one of subdivision (f)\u2019s enumerated exceptions, requiring disclosure of information regarding \u201ccomplaints or requests for assistance ... to the extent such information regarding crimes alleged or committed ... is recorded. . . .\u201d (\u00a7 6254, subd. (f)(2).) Thus the crime report should be made public insofar as it contains the specified crime information listed in subdivision (f)(2)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> provided disclosure does not \u201cendanger the safety of a person involved in [the] investigation or . . . endanger the successful completion of the investigation or a related investigation.\u201d (\u00a7 6254, subd. (f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">The trial court ordered the crime report disclosed without first determining whether disclosure would endanger the safety of an investigator or hamper completion of the instant or a related investigation. We find <em>in camera </em>inspection of the disputed crime report is necessary in order to make this determination. Accordingly, we remand for such a factual determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">County additionally argues the disputed sheriff and crime reports are exempted from disclosure under subdivision (k) of section 6254 which protects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>disclosure of records already exempted under federal or state law, including records privileged under the Evidence Code. (Fn. 5, <em>ante.) </em>County specifically claims the investigation reports contained in the settlement file fall within the \u201cofficial information\u201d privilege provided by section 1040 of the Evidence Code.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It maintains the reports are either absolutely privileged under section 1040, subdivision (b)(1), or conditionally privileged under section 1040, subdivision (b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Preliminarily, we note section 1040 of the Evidence Code \u201crepresents the <em>exclusive means </em>by which a public entity may assert a claim of governmental privilege based on the necessity for secrecy.\u201d <em>(Pitchess </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 531, 540 [113 Cal.Rptr. 897, 522 P.2d 305], italics added.) \u201cIt essentially establishes two different privileges\u2014an absolute privilege if disclosure is forbidden by a federal or state statute (subd. (b)(1)), and a conditional privilege in all other cases pursuant to which privilege attaches when the court determines, in accordance with precise statutory standards, that disclosure is against the public interest (subd. (b)(2).)\u201d <em>(Shepherd </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 107, 123 [130 Cal.Rptr. 257, 550 P.2d 161].) Moreover, either privilege is applicable only to \u201cinformation acquired in confidence.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1040, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">County\u2019s claim of absolute privilege is based on its view section 6254, subdivision (f) of the CPRA (fn. 5, <em>ante) </em>constitutes a statutory enactment forbidding disclosure of the investigation report. We disagree.  The exemptions from disclosure provided by section 6254 are \u201cpermissive, <em>not </em>mandatory; they permit nondisclosure but do not prohibit disclosure.\u201d <em>(Black Panther Party </em>v. <em>Kehoe, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.3d at p. 656, italics added.) The permissive nature of section 6254\u2019s exemptions is clearly evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>denced by its last paragraph which states: \u201cNothing in this section is to be construed as preventing any agency from opening its records concerning the administration of the agency to public inspection, unless disclosure is otherwise prohibited by law.\u201d We hold section 6254 of the CPRA does <em>not forbid </em>disclosure of the subject investigation reports. Since disclosure is not otherwise forbidden by any state or federal laws, subsection (b)(1)\u2019s absolute privilege is unavailable to the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">County claims the necessity for preserving the confidentiality of the investigation reports outweighs the necessity for disclosure. It asserts confidentiality is necessary to insure cooperation by public employees with similar internal investigations in the future. However, we find disclosure of the sheriff\u2019s investigation reports to be necessary in evaluating the County\u2019s decision to settle the claim with public funds. Further, in determining whether disclosure of the reports is against public interest the interest of the public entity as a party in the outcome may not be considered. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1040, subd. (b)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">County argues since it has the burden to show the \u201cofficial information\u201d privilege (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1040) to be applicable, and an <em>in camera </em>hearing pursuant to Evidence Code section 915, subdivision (b) is the <em>only </em>means available to it to meet its burden, failure to hold such a hearing constitutes an abuse of discretion. <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>Winter </em>(1982) 127 Cal.App.3d 435, 440 [179 Cal.Rptr. 585]; see also <em>In re Muszalski </em>(1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 475, 483 [125 Cal.Rptr. 286].) We are not persuaded that an <em>in camera </em>hearing was the <em>only </em>means by which County could meet its burden. The record shows the trial court was sufficiently apprised of the County\u2019s reasons for claiming the privilege; an <em>in camera </em>inspection of the investigation reports would have apprised the court of the reports\u2019 actual contents but would <em>not </em>have changed the County\u2019s reasons for claiming the privilege. The instant case does <em>not </em>involve a claim of privilege otherwise inarticulable without actual disclosure of the privileged information. Accordingly, County\u2019s arguments in this regard are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">C. <em>Minutes of the Claims Settlement Committee Meeting</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">County next claims that the minutes containing the deliberations of the claims settlement committee meeting held on October 11, 1982, are exempt from disclosure under section 54957.2 of the Brown Act. (Fn. 6, <em>ante, </em>see \u00a7\u00a7 54950-54961.) We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">The Brown Act, enacted in 1953, insured actions taken and deliberations conducted by local legislative bodies be openly performed. Section 54950 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>declares: \u201cThe people of this State do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies which serve them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know. The people insist on remaining informed so that they may retain control over the instruments they have created.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Section 54953 of the Brown Act provides: \u201c[a]ll meetings of the legislative body of a local agency shall be open and public, and all persons shall be permitted to attend any meeting of the legislative body of a local agency, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.\u201d Legislative bodies within the meaning of the act include \u201cpermanent boards or commissions of a local agency.\u201d (\u00a7 54952.5.) Thus, the county\u2019s claims settlement committee is a \u201clegislative body\u201d under the act. Closed sessions of local legislative bodies are allowed <em>only </em>in the following instances: meetings called for the purpose of deciding whether to grant or renew a license to an applicant with a criminal record (\u00a7 54956.7), and meetings called for the purpose of discussing public security matters or regarding \u201c. . . appointment, employment, evaluation of performance, or dismissal ... or to hear . . . charges brought against ...\u201d a public employee. (\u00a7 54957.) It also provides minutes taken of closed sessions under the act do not constitute a public record under the CPRA and are to be kept confidential. (\u00a7 54957.5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The County\u2019s claims settlement committee discussed the Clemens\u2019 settlement in a session closed to the public. The Brown Act does not, however, authorize the holding of closed sessions by legislative bodies for the purpose of discussing settlement claims. Thus, the committee\u2019s secret meeting was in clear violation of the Brown Act. County\u2019s argument that the closed session minutes are exempt under section 54957.5 is also unfounded as that section does <em>not </em>apply to closed sessions held in violation of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">County further argues the minutes of the claim\u2019s settlement committee meeting should be protected from disclosure by attorney-client privileges because county counsel was present as both legal counsel and committee member. While the Brown Act has been interpreted to allow closed sessions for the purpose of confidential attorney-client consultation <em>(Sacramento Newspaper Guild </em>v. <em>Sacramento County Bd. of Suprs. </em>(1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 41, 58 [69 Cal.Rptr. 480]), the mere presence of county counsel at a meeting will <em>not </em>turn deliberations regarding the settlement of a tort claim into \u201cconfidential\u201d attorney-client communications. As stated in the <em>Sacramento Newspaper Guild </em>case, \u201cNeither the attorney\u2019s presence nor the happenstance of some kind of lawsuit may serve as the pretext for secret consultations whose revelation will not injure the public interest.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>p. 58.) We conclude the minutes of the October 11, 1982, meeting are not exempt from disclosure under the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">County lastly contends the minutes of the committee\u2019s meeting should not be disclosed because \u201cconfidential\u201d records were discussed during the meeting, citing a California Attorney General opinion indicating holding of a closed session is justifiable where independently privileged records are discussed. (62 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 150, 159 (1979).) However, County has failed to establish <em>any </em>of the records contained in the Clemens\u2019 settlement file, which were presumably discussed at the secret meeting, is in fact independently privileged from disclosure. This last contention is therefore also devoid of merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">D. <em>Rough Notes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">County claims the rough undated notes made by risk management staff, contained in a document entitled \u201caction and memo sheet\u201d (doc. 16), are exempt from disclosure under subdivision (a) of section 6254. This subdivision protects \u201c[preliminary drafts, notes, or interagency or intraagency memoranda which are not retained by the public agency in the ordinary course of business, provided that the public interest in withholding such records clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">There is no indication in the record regarding the contents of these notes; moreover, there is no indication whether the notes are of the type \u201cnot retained by the public agency in the ordinary course of business.\u201d Thus, we cannot ascertain whether subdivision (a)\u2019s exemption provisions are applicable to these notes. Even assuming the exemption is applicable, the record is silent regarding the competing considerations in balancing disclosure versus nondisclosure interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">We therefore remand the determination of this issue to the trial court with directions to inspect the undated rough notes <em>in camera </em>to determine whether they constitute notes not retained by the County in the ordinary course of business under the meaning of subsection (a) and, if so, whether the public interest in disclosure is outweighed by the public interest in nondisclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">E. <em>Remaining Settlement Records</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-11\">The remaining documents in Clemens\u2019 settlement file (those dealing with the annuity policy (docs. 7, 9 &amp; 15), those pertaining to the warrants issued to Clemens (docs. 11 &amp; 13), and those regarding the settlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>agreement itself (docs. 12 &amp; 14)) County argues should be protected from disclosure under section 6255 (fn. 7, ante) since \u201cthe public interest served by not mating the record public clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the record.\u201d (\u00a7 6255.)</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The County claims it is in the public interest to keep secret its settlement policy and decisions, for if known to the public it would result in frivolous tort claims filed against the County. It further argues public scrutiny of the County\u2019s settlement procedures would have an adverse impact upon the County\u2019s economic ability to sustain itself as a tort defendant, especially in those cases where it is more economically feasible to pay \u201cnuisance value\u201d in the settlement of a claim than to continue to litigate.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Against this interest must be measured the public interest in finding out how decisions to spend public funds are formulated and in insuring governmental processes remain open and subject to public scrutiny. We find these considerations clearly outweigh any public interest served by conducting settlement of tort claims in secret, especially in light of the policies of disclosure and openness in governmental affairs fostered by both the CPRA and Brown Act. While County\u2019s concern with the potential for escalating tort claims against it is genuine, opening up the County\u2019s settlement process to public scrutiny will, nevertheless, put prospective claimants on notice that only meritorious claims will ultimately be settled with public funds. This in turn will strengthen public confidence in the ability of governmental entities to efficiently administer the public purse.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">County argues the settlement agreement should remain confidential because it was entered into with the expectation its provisions would remain confidential. We disagree. \u201c[A]ssurances of confidentiality are insufficient in themselves to justify withholding pertinent public information from the public.\u201d <em>(San Gabriel Tribune </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>143 Cal.App.3d 762, 776.) As we have already held, the documents relating to the settlement of Clemens\u2019 claim constitute \u201cpublic records\u201d within the meaning of section 6252, subdivision (d). We conclude that assurances of confidentiality by the County regarding the settlement agreement are inadequate to transform what was a public record into a private one. (Cf. <em>San Gabriel Tribune </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>143 Cal.App.3d at pp. 774, 775 where assurances of confidentiality similarly made by a public entity to a utility company regarding financial data utilized in granting the company a rate increase were held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>insufficient to convert the data, deemed a public record, into a private record.)</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Lastly, we hold the court properly exercised its discretion <em>not </em>to conduct an <em>in camera </em>inspection of the remaining, nonexempt documents as it was able to adequately balance the competing interests for and against disclosure without such a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">We hold the County must allow The Register access to all the settlement documents contained in the Clemens\u2019 settlement file with the exception of the crime report (doc. 6) and the rough undated notes made by Risk Management staff (doc. 16). The cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings regarding accessibility to these two documents not inconsistent with the views expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">The court is also directed to award The Register court costs and reasonable attorneys fees incurred as the prevailing plaintiff in litigation pursued under the CPRA, in accordance with section 6259. The order is affirmed and the cause is remanded with directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">Wallin, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b631-13\"> All statutory references are to the Government Code unless otherwise specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-14\">Section 945.4 provides in relevant part: . no suit for money or damages may be brought against a public entity on a cause of action for which a claim is required . . . until a written claim therefor has been presented to the public entity. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b632-7\"> Pursuant to section 935.2, the Orange County Board of Supervisors has delegated to the claims settlement committee authority to settle all nonhospital or medical malpractice claims filed against the county exceeding $20,000.

I would reach none of the issues raised by the parties and addressed by the majority. The settlement document prepared by the county and signed by Clemens and his attorney contains, we are told, a nondisclosure clause similar to the following: \u201cIt is understood and agreed that the terms of this settlement shall remain confidential, and disclosure by the respective parties shall act to make this settlement void.\u201d When questioned about this provision at oral argument, counsel for The Register made the remarkable admission that the newspaper not only desires to publish the details of the settlement, it hopes its action will void the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">In its First Amendment fervor to publish Clemens\u2019 medical and psychiatric records and zeal to destroy his recovery, The Register has forgotten another part of our Constitution, due process of law. Michael T. Clemens has never been named as a party to this proceeding. He has received no legal notice of the action nor any proper opportunity to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-11\">At the hearing below, Clemens\u2019 absence was raised by the court at the very outset: \u201cI think that some notice should be given of the hearing to the individuals [sic] involved there.\u201d The deputy county counsel agreed: \u201cI think the court does point out a very valid point that there are privacy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>interests of the individual who is part of the settlement with the county. The court is well aware that\u2019s a constitutional right of privacy, and I think it would be well taken to have those individuals to be present to be heard in this regard, [f] The attorney who is representing the individual who is part of the settlement [agreement] has expressed interest to do that. I thought he would be here this morning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Later the following colloquy occurred: \u201c[County Counsel]: I would also indicate, too, that the settlement agreement would be similar to those, but it\u2019s also confidential in the terms that it is confidential by contract, and there is an expectation of privacy there, but our major argument\u2014 [H] The Court: Who wanted privacy, the county or the individual? [t] [County Counsel]: It\u2019s generally asserted by the county, but there was an interest conveyed to me by the claimant\u2019s attorney that they also wanted it confidential, because not only as you put forward all his medical and psychiatric records to expedite and to make sure there is a settlement here, but this gentleman is also in a vulnerable position being the subject of institutionalization. And I believe his argument would be if he were here, what is conveyed to me was that he is locked up, there are other people who would like to get his money, possibly extort money from him, and he doesn\u2019t want them to know that he has this money, and the money that he got from this settlement is a result of damages that he sustained. Just because he was alleged to be a child molester, I don\u2019t think it makes him any different from anybody else who sustained damages at the hands of the county. That is why he doesn\u2019t want this settlement agreement to be public. He doesn\u2019t want anybody to know he has money because he might have a lot of problems when they know he has money, [^f] The Court: I can appreciate that. Certainly that\u2019s an interest to be considered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The Register\u2019s counsel responded, \u201cthe reason that it\u2019s unnecessary is that what we are dealing with here is a public file, in the sense that it\u2019s in the risk management office of the County of Orange. When a person files a claim, that is the first step in a procedure for taking action against a public entity. When that claim is filed\u2014as a matter of fact, counsel, I believe, has admitted or at least advised us the claim is a public document\u2014that exposes the claimant to the issue involving all of those things that are involved in his action against the county in this case. Therefore, he has put into issue his damages, the means by which he was in this case attacked, I guess, and the issues involving the tort, and frankly the medical issues, because somebody has to assess all of that and make a decision about it. That\u2019s the only way that it can be resolved, [f] Therefore, his reasons for personal privacy have been waived to the extent that these matters are being used in a civil action.\u201d The court apparently accepted this argument, for it did not refer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>to Clemens\u2019 absence again and announced an intent to issue a ruling later the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">An individual does not waive the constitutional right of privacy by filing a claim or a lawsuit, except to the extent necessary to the particular action. <em>(Britt </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 844, 859 [143 Cal.Rptr. 695, 574 P.2d 766]; <em>GT, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 748, 753 [198 Cal.Rptr. 892]; see art. I, \u00a7 1, Cal. Const.) Clemens should be afforded a proper opportunity to argue the parameters of his own waiver, if any, and the effect of the nondisclosure clause.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">It is an established principle that \u201c[w]here the plaintiff seeks some type of affirmative relief which, if granted, would injure or affect the interest of a third person not joined, that third person is an indispensable party. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Sierra Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>California Coastal Com. </em>(1979) 95 Cal.App.3d 495, 501 [157 Cal.Rptr. 190].) Although the court retains jurisdiction to act despite the absence of an indispensable party, \u201cfor reasons of equity and convenience ... the court should not proceed with a case where it determines that an \u2018indispensable\u2019 party is absent and cannot be joined. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 500.)</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Also, it has long been the law that \u201c[t]he objection being so fundamental, it need not be raised by the parties themselves; the court may, of its own motion, dismiss the proceedings, or refuse to proceed, until . . . indispensable parties are brought in. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Bank of California </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1940) 16 Cal.2d 516, 522 [106 Cal.Rptr. 879].) In fact the objection may be made at any time by a trial or appellate court. <em>(Hartman Ranch Co. </em>v. <em>Associated Oil Co. </em>(1937) 10 Cal.2d 232, 265 [73 P.2d 1163].)</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">We should raise the objection. Clemens remains a prisoner with impaired access to the legal process. His lawyer has advised the county counsel Clemens desires to maintain the confidentiality of his medical and psychiatric records and fears for his safety if the settlement is disclosed. It is not for us to cast aside these fears lightly. Clemens is a convicted child molester who has already had his throat slashed once by another inmate. Part of the settlement was a nondisclosure provision which both sides bargained for. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>Moreover, The Register is not just trying to sell newspapers, its counsel admits it wants to derail Clemens\u2019 recovery.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The record reveals no information as to why Clemens\u2019 counsel failed to appear at the hearing\u2014perhaps he reasonably believed he lacked standing until Clemens was actually joined. Perhaps he was not retained for that purpose. Whatever the reason, it is clear Clemens has been denied the fundamental right to proper notice and an opportunity to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">It is the strength of the Republic that the Constitution protects the pariah with the same blind devotion it does the popular and the powerful. The majority should not yield to The Register\u2019s hypocritical invocation of our fundamental law at the expense of this principle. I would dismiss or abate the proceedings pending Clemens\u2019 joinder as an indispensable party. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 389.)</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied August 28, 1984, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied October 19, 1984.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b646-9\"> In a similar vein, see <em>Seattle Times Co. </em>v. <em>Rhinehart </em>(1984) \u2014 U.S. \u2014 [81 L.Ed.2d 17, 104 S.Ct. 2199] where the Supreme Court noted, \u201cA litigant has no First Amendment right of access to information made available only for purposes of trying his suit. . . . [H] Moreover, pretrial depositions and interrogatories are not public components of a civil trial. [Fn. omitted.] . . . Therefore, restraints placed on discovered, but not yet admitted, information are not a restriction on a traditionally public source of information.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u2014 U.S. at p. \u2014 [81 L.Ed.2d at pp. 26-27].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b647-7\"> Although the county counsel has forgotten his superior court argument concerning the need to join Clemens here, this record presents no current evidence of collusion between the county and The Register to defeat the agreement. Nevertheless, the result may be the same as if there were. The Register apparently believes once the claims settlement committee\u2019s bargain with Clemens is exposed in the newspaper, a public outcry against the settlement may stampede the county board of supervisors to seek to disavow it, perhaps by means of the nondisclosure provision which the county itself suggested.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
