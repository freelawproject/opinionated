Providing a statutory defense to prohibitions against slot machines for those which are antique, with no guidelines as to what constitutes an antique slot machine, creates an ambiguous exception to Penal Code prohibitions which must be liberally construed in favor of persons seeking its protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">Douglas Bale, a partner in A Amusements and Vending (hereafter Amusements), appeals the denial of his motion to recover 31 slot machines seized by the police. San Jose Police Officer Alejandro Cruise observed the premises of Amusements due to law enforcement reports that illegal and stolen slot machines were being transported to San Jose. From the sidewalk, Cruise and another police officer could see slot machines through the front window of Amusements. Cruise entered the premises with several other law enforcement officers and Randy Nikirk, an expert on slot machines. Nikirk inspected the slot machines for three and one-half hours, taking them apart, examining their inside workings, and recording his observations on a tape recorder. Nikirk eventually separated those slot machines he considered antiques from those he considered illegal and the latter were seized by Officer Cruise.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">Bale moved for an order to return the seized slot machines, pursuant to Penal Code sections 330.8, 335, 1538.5, and 1539.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He claimed the ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>chines were antiques, whose possession is legal under section 330.7.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following a hearing, the court denied the motion and ordered the machines destroyed under section 335a. We reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">Bale contends that section 330.7 is unconstitutionally vague because it does not define the term \u201cantique.\u201d Bale argues that subdivision (a)\u2019s conclusive presumption, that slot machines manufactured prior to 1941 are antiques, leaves open the possibility that machines manufactured after 1941 are also antiques.  Section 330.7 provides no further guidelines defining antiques.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that a criminal statute be declared void if it is so vague that \u201cmen of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.\u201d <em>(Connally </em>v. <em>General Const. Co. </em>(1926) 269 U.S. 385, 391 [70 L.Ed. 322, 328, 46 S.Ct. 126].) Two rationales underly the void-for-vagueness doctrine. First, it requires that fair warning be given to persons potentially subject to the statute. <em>(Lanzetta </em>v. <em>New Jersey </em>(1939) 306 U.S. 451, 453 [83 L.Ed. 888, 890, 59 S.Ct. 618].) Second, it shows concern that vague statutes will be subject to arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. <em>(Kolender </em>v. <em>Lawson </em>(1983) 461 U.S. 352, 357 [75 L.Ed.2d 903, 909, 103 S.Ct. 1855, 1858]; <em>Pryor </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 238, 252 [158 Cal.Rptr. 330, 599 P.2d 636]; see generally LaFave and Scott, Criminal Law (1972) \u00a7 11, pp. 83-89.)</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The United States Supreme Court recently identified several factors which affect the degree of vagueness that is constitutionally permissible. The law is more tolerant of vagueness in statutes which provide civil penalties in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>stead of criminal penalties. <em>(Hoffinan Estates </em>v. <em>Flipside, Hoffman Estates </em>(1982) 455 U.S. 489, 498-499 [71 L.Ed.2d 362, 371-372, 102 S.Ct. 1186].) A law\u2019s vagueness may be mitigated by a scienter requirement. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 499 [71 L.Ed.2d at p. 372].) Finally, more clarity is required in laws which may interfere with the exercise of constitutionally protected rights. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">These factors favor neither strict nor lenient review of section 330.7, which provides a defense to criminal prosecution and civil seizure. Section 330.7 does not restrict the exercise of any constitutionally protected right. On the other hand, it contains no scienter requirement. One who honestly believes his or her slot machine is \u201cantique\u201d is handicapped in claiming the defense provided in subdivisions (a) and (b) by virtue of a lack of statutory guidelines as to what constitutes an antique slot machine. Since the definition of \u201cantique\u201d in section 330.7 affects defenses against both criminal penalties (fines or jail terms under \u00a7 330.1) and civil penalties (destruction of slot machines under \u00a7 335a), our ruling in this civil proceeding must also affect defenses to criminal prosecutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">To evaluate the vagueness claim, we \u201clook first to the language of the statute, then to its legislative history, and finally to California decisions construing the statutory language. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Pryor </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d at p. 246.)  Section 330.7 provides no definition of the term \u201cantique.\u201d The word \u201cantique\u201d has no established legal meaning. Definitions of \u201cantique\u201d include \u201cbelonging to earlier periods,\u201d \u201cexhibiting the style or fashion of ancient or former times,\u201d \u201cold-fashioned,\u201d and \u201cancient.\u201d (Webster\u2019s New Internal. Diet. (3d ed. 1966) p. 96.) These definitions do not provide clear guidelines forjudges, law enforcement officers, or citizens to determine if possession of a specific slot machine is prohibited or allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Respondent claims the legislative history of section 330.7 shows the Legislature\u2019s intent that \u201cantique\u201d be defined as \u201cmanufactured prior to 1941.\u201d During hearings, the Senate removed a provision which explicitly stated that slot machines manufactured after 1941 could be shown to be antiques (8 Sen. J. (1975-1976 Reg. Sess.) p. 15557.) While the Legislature may have intended to define \u201cantique\u201d explicitly, it only provided a conclusive presumption which states one way of satisfying the \u201cantique\u201d requirement, but provides neither a definition nor an exclusive definition of \u201cantique.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There are no California cases interpreting section 330.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>The testimony of the police department\u2019s expert witness demonstrates the vagueness of section 330.7. Randy Nikirk deemed one of the seized machines a \u201creproduction\u201d of an older machine. Regarding another machine, Nikirk testified that 50 percent of the parts were new and 50 percent were made between 1932 and 1963. While neither of these machines come within the conclusive presumption of subdivision (a), they might come within a reasonable definition of \u201cantique.\u201d Section 330.7 provides no standard by which a court can rule that a machine is or is not antique, thus we find it to be unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">It would be counterproductive for us to void section 330.7 because, although it is vague, it does not proscribe conduct as illegal, but provides a defense to otherwise illegal conduct. By voiding this <em>defense, </em>we would leave all antique slot machine owners vulnerable to prosecution under other sections of the Penal Code and defeat the legislative purpose set forth in section 330.7, subdivision (c). Another alternative we reject is nullifying <em>all </em>prohibitions against slot machine ownership until the Legislature acts to clarify the antique slot machine defense. This alternative is inappropriate because the antique slot machine defense is not an integral part of California\u2019s gambling laws. The general prohibitions against slot machines were passed over 30 years ago (Stats. 1911, ch. 483, \u00a7 1, p. 951; Stats. 1950, First Ex. Sess. 1950, chs. 17-18, pp. 452-456), while the antique slot machine defense was only added in 1976. (Stats. 1976, ch. 936, \u00a7 1, p. 2144.) A finding that section 330.7 is unconstitutionally vague does not necessarily implicate these older prohibitions. (Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(1962) 189 Kan. 403 [369 P.2d 365, 91 A.L.R.2d 750] [invalidating entire Sunday closing law because unconstitutionally vague exceptions were integral to the closing law].)</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">We therefore treat section 330.7 as an ambiguous exception to a penal statute; it must be construed liberally in favor of persons seeking its protections. (82 C.J.S. Statutes, \u00a7 382, p. 893.) Liberal construction requires courts to consider whether slot machines built after 1941 could reasonably fall within the scope of section 330.7. Until the Legislature eliminates section 330.7 or provides a definition of \u201cantique,\u201d courts must grant motions to dismiss civil seizures and criminal prosecutions, and for a return of such machines, by any party whose slot machine comes under either the section\u2019s conclusive presumption or any reasonable definition of \u201cantique\u201d as applied to slot machines and is not being utilized for gambling purposes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>lieve this approach is consistent with and carries out the legislative purpose expressed in section 330.7, subdivision (c), \u201cto protect the collection and restoration of antique slot machines . . . because of their aesthetic interest and importance in California history.\u201d Since even slot machines conclusively presumed to be antique under the statute are illegal if utilized for gambling purposes, there is no reason for concern that our disposition in this case will open a loophole sanctioning illegal gambling.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Due to our disposition of this issue, we do not address appellant\u2019s remaining arguments. The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Low, P.
