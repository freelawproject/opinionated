The hospital was subsequently served with a request to produce \u201call original personnel files [of anyone performing medical or hospital service on Brett during his stay] . . . from the time of each such person\u2019s contact with [the hospital] for employment, in any capacity to the present [except those involving compensation].\u201d The Harveys\u2019 motion to compel was denied by the court \u201cwithout prejudice to plaintiff\u2019s framing and serving a narrower request.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">A motion for reconsideration was accompanied by a detailed list of requested documents<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> relating to approximately 37 individuals. The court tentatively denied the motion, Hospital submitted and its counsel departed. Following subsequent ex parte argument by the Harveys\u2019 counsel, the court ordered production of the files as specified. Hospital\u2019s motions to reconsider (pursuant to Evid. Code, \u00a7 1157 and the constitutional right to privacy) and for a protective order were denied,  We conclude the trial court erred in allowing blanket inspection of the requested files.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">In <em>Matchett </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 623 [115 Cal.Rptr. 317], the court recognized \u201c[s]ection 1157 represents a legislative choice between competing public concerns. It embraces the goal of medical staff candor [in appraising their peers to improve the quality of in-hospital medical practice] at the cost of impairing plaintiffs\u2019 access to evidence [revealing the competency of a hospital\u2019s staff].\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 629.)</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">The immunity contained in section 1157, however, protects proceedings and records of described staff committees, not \u201cthe files of the hospital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>administration (as distinguished from staff).\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 628.) And these administrative records are discoverable only to the extent they do not contain references to the immune proceedings,  To protect both parties in this instance, there must be an <em>in camera </em>hearing by the trial court, reviewing each item of evidence requested and acting \u201cupon those portions of petitioner\u2019s pretrial discovery motion which are directed only at hospital administration files not resulting from [any] investigation conducted by [an] advisory board.\u201d <em>(Schulz </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 440, 447 [136 Cal.Rptr. 67]; <em>Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hosp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 81 Cal.App.3d 626 [146 Cal.Rptr. 542].)</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Saddleback is further entitled to raise the privacy interests of its nonphysician medical staff, unnamed in the complaint but revealed through answers to interrogatories. <em>(Board of Trustees </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1981) 119 Cal.App.3d 516 [174 Cal.Rptr. 160].)  Even where a compelling state interest in the \u201cascertainment of truth in connection with legal proceedings\u201d <em>(Jones </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1981) 119 Cal.App.3d 534, 550 [174 Cal.Rptr. 148]) outweighs an individual\u2019s right to privacy, the compelled disclosure must be narrowly drawn\u2014precision is required. <em>(Britt </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 844 [143 Cal.Rptr. 695, 574 P.2d 766].)  \u201c[W]here an exception to a privilege depends on the content of a communication, the court may require disclosure <em>in camera </em>in making its ruling.\u201d <em>(Mavroudis </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 102 Cal.App.3d 594, 606 [162 Cal.Rptr. 724] [psychiatric records]; <em>In re Lifschutz </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 415, 437, fn. 23 [85 Cal.Rptr. 829, 467 P.2d 557, 44 A.L.R.3d] [suggesting disclosure ex parte in chambers]; <em>Valley Bank of Nevada </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 652, 658 [125 Cal.Rptr. 553, 542 P.2d 977] [bank records].)</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">We do not (and cannot) decide the discoverability of any particular items requested. \u201cAs further issues of [immunity,] privilege and privacy arise through implementation of the court\u2019s order [to produce], the trial court will be in the best position to assess the competing interests and to exercise its broad discretion in discovery matters in accordance with applicable principles.\u201d <em>(Jones </em>v. <em>Superior court, supra, </em>119 Cal.App.3d 534, 552.)</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing the trial court to vacate its order denying Saddleback Community Hospital\u2019s motion for protective order and to enter an order granting the requested production of documents only if countenanced by the court after an ex parte <em>in camera </em>hearing conducted in accord with the dictates of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>The Harveys\u2019 request for attorney\u2019s fees is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"A2t\">Wallin, Acting P.
