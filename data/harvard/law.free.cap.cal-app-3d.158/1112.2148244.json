(Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 11200 et seq.\u2014aid to families with dependent children [AFDC].)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The question presented is whether a governmental agency is precluded from seeking reimbursement for AFDC monies from a parent of a disabled minor who also receives aid through the state supplementary program for the aged, blind and disabled (ABD). We hold that such reimbursement is not proscribed by Section 12350, but reverse the trial court\u2019s order for reasons discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Minor Dion P. (son of Victoria Stark) is a disabled person residing in a nonmedical out-of-home care facility paid for by the Social Security Administration and the County of Ventura (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, div. 9, pt. 3) in monthly amounts as follows: $213.20\u2014Social Security, $296.80\u2014 ABD (\u00a7\u00a7 12000-12401), $390.00\u2014AFDC (\u00a7\u00a7 11200-11507). Respondent brought the instant action for on-going child support and reimbursement. (\u00a7\u00a7 11350, 11350.1.) The only question presented to the trial court was whether section 12350 relieved the mother of any obligation to reimburse the county for AFDC, the parties having stipulated to a payment schedule if such liability was found. The trial court held that appellant is responsible for reimbursing the county for past and present aid provided under sections 11200 through 11489 (AFDC) or sections other than section 12200. The instant appeal ensued.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">Appellant contends she is not liable for the support of her minor son because of section 12350, which provides: \u201cNo relative shall be held legally liable to support or to contribute to the support of any applicant for or recipient of aid under this chapter. No relative shall be held liable to defray in whole or in part the cost of any medical care or hospital care or other service rendered to the recipient pursuant to any provision of this code if he is an applicant for or a recipient of aid under this chapter at the time such medical care or hospital care or other service is rendered, [f] Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 206 of the Civil Code, or Section 270c of the Penal Code,[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] or any other provision of this code, no demand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>shall be made upon any relative to support or contribute toward the support of any applicant for or recipient of aid under this chapter. No county or city and county or officer or employee thereof shall threaten any such relative with any legal action against him by or in behalf of the county or city and county or with any penalty whatsoever. (Added by Stats. 1975, ch. 1136, p. 2811, \u00a7 2.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">Prior to 1975, section 12350 provided that a state could proceed against an adult child living within this state who failed to contribute to the support of his parents. Respondent asserts that (1) appellant is not a relative within the meaning of present section 12350 since the former statute spoke of the obligation of adult children only; and (2) restrictions of section 12350 do not apply to recovery of aid under the AFDC program.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Respondent\u2019s first argument is without merit.  The fundamental objective in construing a statute is to ascertain and give effect to the legislative intent. <em>(County of San Mateo </em>v. <em>Booth </em>(1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 388, 396 [185 Cal.Rptr. 349].)  We begin with the language of the statute: \u201cIf the language is clear and unambiguous, there is no room for construction and courts should not engage in it.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>It is clear that the legislature intended to broaden the class of persons protected by section 12350 in its present form since nowhere in that section is reference made to \u201cadult children\u201d or \u201caged parents.\u201d \u201cRelative\u201d is defined as, \u201ca person connected with another by blood or affinity.\u201d (Webster\u2019s New Internat. Diet.\u2014Unabridged (3d ed. 1961) p. 1916.) Lest there be any doubt, a mother is a relative of her son!</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">Respondent\u2019s second point is well taken; prohibitions of section 12350 are limited to <em>aid </em>under the ABD program, and <em>services </em>under any provisions of the Welfare and Institutions Code. Both aid and services are defined in the code: \u201c \u2018Aid\u2019 means financial assistance provided to or in behalf of needy persons under the terms of this division, including direct money payments and vendor payments.\u201d (\u00a7 10052.) \u201c\u2018Services\u2019 means those activities and functions performed by social work staff and related personnel of the department and county departments with or in behalf of individuals or families, which are directed toward the improvement of the capabilities of such individuals or families maintaining or achieving a sound family life, rehabilitation, self-care, and economic independence.\u201d (\u00a7 10053.) Both AFDC and ABD programs are part of division 9 of the code and are subject to the definitions therein. Whereas the first sentence of Section 12350 refers to nonliability for support resulting from aid given under chapter 3 (ABD) the second sentence speaks to nonliability for cost of medical care, hospital care or other <em>service </em>rendered pursuant to <em>any </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>provision of the code if the recipient is receiving aid under ABD at the time the medical, hospital or other services are rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">\u201cWhere a statute is theoretically capable of more than one construction we choose that which comports with the intent of the Legislature. \u201d <em>(California Mfrs. Assn. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Com. </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 836, 844 [157 Cal.Rptr. 676, 598 P.2d 836].) Appellant\u2019s contention that the second paragraph of section 12350 broadened the categories of aid which need not be reimbursed would \u201clead to mischief or absurdity\u201d. <em>(Ibid.) </em>It makes no sense for the Legislature to enact a detailed procedure for enforcement of child support obligations in chapter 2 (AFDC) only to abolish its collection in chapter 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">The Legislature explicitly declared that, \u201cEach family has the right and responsibility to provide sufficient support and protection of its children, ...\u201d (\u00a7 11205 added by Stats. 1982, ch. 1329, \u00a7 11.) \u201cIn the context established by these provisions, section 11350 represents a legislative pronouncement of public policy that a separated or deserted parent of a needy child who has been placed in foster care shall be \u2018obligated\u2019 to reimburse a county for AFDC payments made to the \u2018institution\u2019 or \u2018boarding home\u2019 involved if the parent had the \u2018reasonable ability to pay during that period in which aid was granted.\u2019 ... It has been held in broader terms that the policy is \u2018to insure that the moneys disbursed by the county for the aid of a needy child be returned to the public source from which they were disbursed.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(County of San Mateo </em>v. <em>Booth, supra, </em>135 Cal.App.3d 388, 398.)</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">Furthermore, \u201c(T)he provisions [of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 601 et seq.] seek to secure parental support in lieu of AFDC support for dependent children.\u201d <em>(King </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1968) 392 U.S. 309, 332 [20 L.Ed.2d 1118, 1134, 88 S.Ct. 2128]; cf. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, ch. 2, art. 7, Enforcement, \u00a7 11475-11476.1, amended by Stats. 1981 to 1982, 1st Ex.Sess., ch. 3, \u00a7\u00a7 31-35.)  A child is eligible for AFDC assistance if the child is \u201cneedy\u201d (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 606) but \u201cneedy\u201d is not equivalent to \u201cdestitute\u201d or \u201cpenniless.\u201d <em>(Bryant </em>v. <em>Swoap </em>(1975) 48 Cal.App.3d 431-438 [121 Cal.Rptr. 867].) Ability to support a needy child may coexist with eligibility for AFDC benefits. <em>(Ibid.) </em>While AFDC eligibility is governed by federal law, need and benefit levels are governed by state law. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 436, fn. 5, citing <em>King </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>392 U.S. at pp. 318-319 [20 L.Ed.2d at pp. 1126-1127].)</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">It is clear that a principal purpose of chapter 2 (AFDC) is the enforcement of parental support obligations for needy children. Parents may be required to reimburse the state for counsel costs in juvenile proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>or for medical treatment of a minor\u2019s physical injuries or care of a mentally-retarded minor. <em>(In re Ricky H. </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 513, 518 [86 Cal.Rptr. 76, 468 P.2d 204]; <em>In re Dudley </em>(1966) 239 Cal.App.2d 401, 404 [48 Cal.Rptr. 790] et seq.; <em>County of Alameda </em>v. <em>Kaiser </em>(1965) 238 Cal.App.2d 815, 817-818 [48 Cal.Rptr. 343].) Nevertheless, governmental agencies may not obtain reimbursement from relatives for costs of maintaining public institutions for public benefit. <em>(In re Jerald C. </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 1, 6 [201 Cal.Rptr. 342, 678 P. 2d 917]; <em>Dept, of Mental Hygiene </em>v. <em>Kir chner </em>(1964) 60 Cal.2d 716, 722-723 [36 Cal.Rptr. 488, 388 P.2d 720, 20 A.L.R.3d 353].) \u201c. . . the long tradition of law and history of societal custom of a duty to support poor adult children and parents must be deemed the substantial equivalent of the common law duty to support minor children. The duties may not be distinguished in terms of the state\u2019s right to reimbursement. On the one hand the state, in accordance with <em>Swoap, </em>may obtain reimbursement for support allowances paid to or for minors. On the other hand the common law duty to support minor children does not authorize the state to recover the costs of confinement imposed for the protection of society and the minor and his rehabilitation.\u201d <em>{In re Jerald C., supra, </em>36 Cal.3d 1, 9.) In the instant case, the child was not institutionalized for protection of society but was voluntarily placed in an out-of-home care facility for his own benefit and that of his parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">The intent of chapter 3 (ABD) is to implement a state supplementary program pursuant to title XVI of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1381 et seq.) and a program for state services to the aged, blind or disabled to meet the requirement of title VI of the Social Security Act (now 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1397 et seq.) (\u00a7 12001 added by Stats. 1973, ch. 1216, p. 2904, \u00a7 37, eff. Dec. 5, 1973). The object and purpose of this chapter is, \u201cto provide persons whose need results from age, blindness or disability with assistance and services which will encourage them to make greater efforts to achieve self-care and self-maintenance, whenever feasible, and to enlarge their opportunities from independence.\u201d (\u00a7 12002 added by Stats. 1973, ch. 1216, p. 2904, eff. Dec. 5, 1973.)</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Although the focus of former section 12350 was the obligation of adult children to aged parents, that deviation from the more usual custom of parents aiding their children interfered with family relationships and introduced guilt and shame into elderly citizens, who having made their contribution to society, suddenly found themselves dependent on their children. (See <em>Review of Selected 1972 California Legislation </em>(1973) 4 Pacific L.J. 432, 435.) Additionally, the implications were ominous; there was fear that liability to reimburse the state might no longer be limited by obligations under Civil Code section 206. \u201c(Responsible relative provisions could be imposed upon siblings, aunts and uncles, and perhaps even grandparents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>and grandchildren.\u201d (Penning, <em>The Supreme Court of California </em>(1975) 63 Cal.L.Rev. 85, 101.)</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Furthermore, the possibility existed that the state government might attempt to find other services for which some responsible relatives could be charged. \u201cNot only can this be applied to adult children of parents receiving pensions but the state may also use this power to demand reimbursement from parents whose children are taking special classes in school, participating in recreation programs or utilizing lower public transportation rates. In such a case, the state would merely have to demonstrate a rational relationship between the purpose of the program and the group to be charged with its cost.\u201d (Harmon &amp; Karpman, <em>Swoap </em>v. <em>Superior Court. Old Age Security and \u201cRelative Responsibility\u201d Laws </em>(1974) 5 Golden Gate L.Rev. 179, 186.)</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">The genesis of \u201crelative responsibility\u201d was the Elizabethan Poor Law of 1601 designed to indemnify the public and to minimize costs in aiding the poor. (tenBroek, <em>California\u2019s Dual System of Family Law: Its Origin, Development, and Present Status, Part 1 </em>(1964) 16 Stan.L.Rev. 257, 283) Senate Bill No. 42 (1972 Regular Session) as originally introduced January 11, 1972, attempted to delete entirely the responsible relative provision of the old age security program but was amended merely to reduce offsprings\u2019 contribution to the level existing prior to the Welfare Reform Act of 1971. <em>Review of Selected 1972 California Legislation, supra, 4 </em>Pacific L. J. 432, at p. 434.)</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">With this background in mind the intent \u00f3f section 12350 becomes clear: No relative shall be legally liable to support or to contribute to support of any applicant for or recipient of financial aid given under chapter 3 (ABD) or for the cost of any medical care, hospital care or other service rendered to the recipient pursuant to <em>any </em>provision of the Welfare and Institutions Code so long as the applicant or recipient is receiving <em>aid </em>under the ABD program at the time such medical care or hospital care or other service is rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">Nothing in sections 12350 or 12351, however, precludes a governmental agency from seeking reimbursement from parents for aid received under chapter 2 (AFDC) <em>so long as said aid has not been used to pay for medical care or hospital care or other service rendered while the recipient was also receiving aid under chapter 3 (ABD).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">Whereas the record herein indicates that the minor receives approximately $390 per month from the AFDC program, there is no evidence of actual monthly costs of the total care facility, or breakdown of costs of services, medical and non-medical, versus room and board. We do not know whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>the money received from social security and the ADB program covers the total monthly cost of medical or hospital care and other services provided under the Welfare and Institutions Code, or whether part of the AFDC funds are used to defray those expenses. It is possible that the cost of the child\u2019s monthly care exceeds the total aid received from all three programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">In the record before us, the County of Ventura failed to provide any evidence in the trial court that the money it was seeking to collect was used solely for the minor\u2019s support and not for medical care, hospital care or other services under the code. It is impossible to ascertain whether appellant would be paying for the child\u2019s support or a service for which reimbursement is proscribed by section 12350. The order for support and reimbursement is reversed and remanded for further trial to give the district attorney the opportunity to present evidence if he wishes to show what portion, if any, of the AFDC funds were expended for purposes other than those which we have held nonreimbursable.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Abbe, J., and Gilbert, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b833-9\"> All statutory references hereinafter are to the Welfare and Institutions Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b833-10\"> Appellant appeals from the minute order of April 7, 1983.
