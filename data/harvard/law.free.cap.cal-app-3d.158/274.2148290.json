The trial court sentenced him to prison for an aggregate term of seven years, eight months, comprised of the six-year upper base term on the burglary and consecutive terms of one year on one robbery and eight months on the phone line charge. Pursuant to the multiple punishment bar of Penal Code section 654, the trial court imposed but stayed a six-year upper base term on the other robbery. The trial court ruled that Welfare and Institutions Code section 3052 rendered appellant statutorily ineligible for the California Rehabilitation Center (CRC), because his total prison term exceeded six years. Appellant contends the trial court misread section 3052.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">Welfare and Institutions Code sections 3050 and 3051 provide the basic statutory authorization for narcotics addict commitment proceedings for a defendant upon conviction for any crime or following revocation of probation. However, Welfare and Institutions Code section 3052 renders these sections inapplicable to certain persons. The latter section provides, in pertinent part: \u201c(a) Sections 3050 and 3051 shall not apply to any of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-10\">\u201c(2) Persons whose sentence is enhanced pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 12022 of the Penal Code, or Section 12022.3, 12022.5, 12022.6, 12022.7, or 12022.8 of such code; or persons whose sentence is subject to the provisions of Section 3046 of the Penal Code; or persons whose conviction results in a sentence which, in the aggregate, exclusive of any credit that may be earned pursuant to Article 2.5 (commencing with Section 2930) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>of Chapter 7 of Title 1 of Part 3 of the Penal Code, exceeds six years\u2019 imprisonment in state prison; or persons found to come under the provisions of Section 1203.06 of the Penal Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-4\">At issue here is the meaning of the reference to \u201cpersons whose conviction results in a sentence which, in the aggregate, exclusive of any credit that may be earned pursuant to Article 2.5 (commencing with Section 2930) of Chapter 7 of Title 1 of Part 3 of the Penal Code, exceeds six years\u2019 imprisonment in state prison; . . .\u2019\u2019 Reprising an argument made below, appellant asserts \u201cthat the plain meaning of this section permits referral to CRC of any person whose total sentence, after subtracting expected credits for good time and work time, amounts to six years or less.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Appellant\u2019s argument hinges on the word \u201caggregate\u201d, which is defined as \u201ctotal.\u201d Appellant urges a distinction \u201cbetween the <em>maximum </em>sentence, being the sentence pronounced, and the <em>total </em>sentence, being the sentence actually to be served.\u201d First, we note that the statutory language is \u201cin the aggregate\u201d, which means \u201ctaken all together.\u201d (Webster\u2019s New World Diet. (2d college ed. 1982) p. 26.)</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Second, the phrase \u201cin the aggregate\u201d finds a close parallel in Penal Code section 1170.1, subdivision (a), which provides, in pertinent part: \u201cExcept as provided in subdivision (c) and subject to Section 654, when any person is convicted of two or more felonies, whether in the same proceeding or court or in different proceedings or courts, and whether by judgment rendered by the same or by a different court, and a consecutive term of imprisonment is imposed under Sections 669 and 1170, the <em>aggregate term of imprisonment </em>for all such convictions shall be the sum of the principal term, the subordinate term and any additional term imposed pursuant to Section 667.5, 667.6, or 12022.1. ...\u201d (Italics added.) In-prison credits which may be earned under Penal Code section 2930 et seq. are not part of the \u201caggregate term of imprisonment\u201d as defined in Penal Code section 1170.1, subdivision (a). We find no meaningful distinction between the concepts of \u201caggregate term of imprisonment\u201d and a defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cin the aggregate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Third, in the great scheme of things, Penal Code section 2930 et seq., credits are no more a part of a defendant\u2019s prison sentence than income <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>tax credits are part of a taxpayer\u2019s income tax. Conduct credits are <em>reductions </em>from a defendant\u2019s prison term. For our purposes, credit is an accounting concept defined as \u201ca sum deducted (from an amount owed).\u201d (Webster\u2019s New World Diet. (2d college ed. 1982) p. 333.) To use a common metaphor, a sentence is the defendant\u2019s debt to society and conduct credits are a sum (when earned and if not forfeited) deducted from this debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Fourth, appellant\u2019s argument ignores the context of the words \u201cin the aggregate\u201d and the total phrase which we must interpret. That phrase is \u201ca sentence which, in the aggregate, <em>exclusive of </em>any credit that may be earned . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) \u201cExclusive of\u201d means \u201cnot including or allowing for; ignoring.\u201d (Webster\u2019s New Word Diet. (2d college ed. 1982) p. 489.) This definition dispels any possible lingering doubt about how to interpret Welfare and Institutions Code section 3052, subdivision (a)(2). In determining whether a defendant\u2019s sentence in the aggregate exceeds six years in prison, a court looks to the total sentence not including or allowing for conduct credits which may be earned.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Finally, appellant argues we should adopt his construction as a reasonable one to achieve the evident rehabilitative intent of the narcotics addict commitment provisions. Two problems exist. First, as stated above, appellant\u2019s construction is not reasonable because it defies the statute\u2019s plain, unambiguous meaning. <em>(Tieman </em>v. <em>Trustees of Cal. State University &amp; Colleges </em>(1982) 33 Cal.3d 211, 218-219 [188 Cal.Rptr. 115, 655 P.2d 317]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Irwin </em>(1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 891, 897 [202 Cal.Rptr. 475].) Second, while the narcotics addict commitment provisions generally evince a rehabilitative purpose (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Ortiz </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 249, 254-255 [37 Cal.Rptr. 891, 391 P.2d 163]), the phrase at issue here was part of a 1980 amendment to Welfare and Institutions Code section 3052 which expanded the categories of persons statutorily <em>ineligible </em>for CRC. At the same time (Stats. 1980, ch. 822, \u00a7 1), the Legislature deleted from Welfare and Institutions Code section 3051 a trial court\u2019s former authority \u201cIn unusual cases, wherein the interests of justice would best be served\u201d to \u201corder commitment notwithstanding Section 3052.\u201d The trial court\u2019s interpretation of the subject phrase promoted the purpose of certain portions of the 1980 legislation which cut back against the grain and substantially restricted access to CRC.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">In sum, the trial court did not err in refusing to initiate narcotics addict commitment proceedings here. Nor was appellant prejudiced when both counsel acquiesced in the procedure proposed by the trial court and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>secured from the Department of Corrections a correct interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b235-11\"> Before Franson, Acting P.
