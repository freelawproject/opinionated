J.</author>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">On May 24, 1978, appellant, while seated at the desk in his law office, observed a round circle in the field of vision of his right eye. When he pressed the small of his finger against his eyelid the spot disappeared. Believing his eyelashes were sticking, he trimmed them. Five days later he had difficulty wearing his contact lenses because of eye irritation. The following morning, May 30th, he awoke at approximately 4:45 a.m. and observed a pie-shaped portion taken out of the lower center section of the field of vision of his right eye. Since he was not in pain, he decided to take his routine, two-mile jog and call his eye doctor after he got to his law office.</p>\n<p id=\"Axa\">Appellant Ernest George Williams, the beneficiary of a policy of accidental death and dismemberment insurance issued by respondent Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company, filed his complaint for damages in connection therewith on May 20, 1981. In the fashion hereinafter described, respondent was granted summary judgment on June 16, 1983. The facts giving rise to the litigation are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Appellant\u2019s jog went as always. He experienced no pain, nor did he observe any change in the obstruction in the field of vision of his right eye. He did not fall, bump into anyone, or even stop suddenly. He traveled over the same jogging path he typically traveled.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">Later the same morning, appellant was diagnosed as having a detached retina and was hospitalized. On June 2, 1978, he had an eight-hour surgery to correct the condition. Several days later his eye hemorrhaged, and a second corrective surgery took place on August 21 or 22, 1978. On September 28, 1978, he was told for the first time that the surgery had not been successful and that he would never regain any sight in his right eye.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Respondent\u2019s answer to appellant\u2019s complaint alleged among other things that appellant\u2019s loss of vision in his right eye resulted from a sickness or disease and not from an accident. On December 23, 1982, respondent filed its first motion for summary judgment on the grounds, among others, that a routine jog, as a matter of law, does not constitute an \u201caccident.\u201d In support of this position respondent submitted appellant\u2019s unequivocal deposition testimony that there was nothing unusual about his jog other than the pre-existing obstruction in his field of vision. Rather, appellant contended the jog was an \u201caccident\u201d inasmuch as he had been told by his doctors that jogging increased the ocular pressure in his eye. According to appellant\u2019s testimony, Dr. Stephen J. Ryan advised him that where he may have had just one retinal tear prior to the jog, he ended up with four tears after it. Appellant acknowledged, however, that no doctor ever told him that his jog in any way caused or contributed to his original retinal tear.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Respondent\u2019s motion was argued and taken under submission. On February 7, 1983, the trial court ruled, conditionally granting respondent the relief requested. It nonetheless concluded, contrary to respondent\u2019s contention, that if appellant\u2019s retinal damage occurred suddenly as a result of the May 30th jog, there was a question of fact as to the existence of an \u201caccident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Pursuant to the trial court\u2019s conditional order, appellant filed the declaration of Dr. Ryan, stating appellant\u2019s May 30, 1978, jog caused additional retinal tears. Respondent\u2019s motion was accordingly denied by the trial court on February 22, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">The deposition of Dr. Ryan was thereafter taken by respondent and based upon it a second motion for summary judgment was filed on May 4, 1983, respondent reasserting its position that irrespective of whether the jog caused additional retinal tears there was as a matter of law no \u201caccident\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>and maintaining that even were the trial court\u2019s view of the law expressed in its conditional order correct, there was no longer any genuine issue of fact, since Dr. Ryan unequivocally recanted his February 14, 1983, declaration at his deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">In that deposition, Dr. Ryan testified it was his opinion the one large \u201ccausative retinal tear\u201d which was appellant\u2019s \u201cmain problem\u201d existed prior to his jogging on May 30th, and that, while appellant\u2019s May 24, 1978, observations were compatible with the tear having developed on that date, the large \u201ccausative retinal tear,\u201d as well as the other retinal tears or holes, could have been there for a substantial period prior to the accident. Moreover, when shown his statement of February 14, 1983, Dr. Ryan indicated that it did not reflect his opinion and that a retinal detachment left untreated was \u201ca blinding disease\u201d and that the only way to reattach a retina so as to prevent blindness was by surgery. He was of the further opinion, however, that the jog increased the amount of subretinal fluid in appellant\u2019s right eye and that the increase made the subsequent corrective measures more difficult.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">On May 20, 1983, \u201chaving read and considered in its entirety [the] deposition of Dr. Ryan taken on April 5, 1983,\u201d the trial court granted respondent\u2019s second motion for summary judgment. This appeal followed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Respondent\u2019s insurance policy provided for the payment of $75,000 when the loss of sight in one eye \u201cresult[s] from injury sustained by the insured . . . .\u201d \u201cInjury,\u201d in turn, was defined to mean \u201cbodily injury sustained by the insured . . . caused by an accident occurring while this policy is in force . . . and which results directly and independently of all other causes in loss covered by this policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">An exclusion provided the policy did not apply to loss resulting from \u201cSickness or disease, or medical or surgical treatment thereof, . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">From this it will be seen that the only injuries compensable under the policy were those caused by an \u201caccident,\u201d a term not specifically defined in the policy. In spite of the absence of such definition, the trial court herein, as noted, was of the opinion the facts associated with appellant\u2019s injury did not, as a matter of law, involve an accident, based, in its words, on \u201cthe teaching of cases such as <em>Geddes &amp; Smith, Inc. </em>v. <em>St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d 558 [564] . . . that injury or damage resulting from a series of imperceptible events that finally culminate in a single tangible harm is not accidental; [but that where] there is a specific event which manifests itself at an identifiable time which caused identifiable harm at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>time it occurred, it may be accidental . . . .\u201d Applying the stated rationale to the facts present here, the trial court concluded appellant\u2019s injury was not within the coverage provided by respondent\u2019s policy, because what was shown was that while appellant\u2019s condition was aggravated by the jog, in that an additional amount of subretinal fluid was induced thereby, that aggravation did not constitute the injury for which recovery was sought, even though it might ultimately have contributed to it, by making appellant\u2019s surgery a more difficult procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">While not unwilling to accept the reasoning which resulted in the summary judgment in its favor, respondent urged below and reiterates here that the conclusion arrived at was required as well by those authorities which appear to support the proposition an \u201caccident\u201d does not occur in the absence of some intervening element of force or violence, in a context of a happening \u201cnot according to the usual course of things.\u201d (See <em>Alessandro </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Cas. Ins. Co. </em>(1965) 232 Cal.App.2d 203, 207 [42 Cal.Rptr. 630]; see also <em>Slobojan </em>v. <em>Western Travelers Life Ins. Co. </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 432 [74 Cal.Rptr. 895, 450 P.2d 271]; <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>(1945) 27 Cal.2d 305 [163 P.2d 689]; <em>Arata </em>v. <em>California-Western States Life Ins. Co. </em>(1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 821 [123 Cal.Rptr. 631]; <em>Shafer </em>v. <em>American Casualty Co. </em>(1966) 245 Cal.App.2d 1 [53 Cal.Rptr. 446; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co. </em>(1963) 221 Cal.App.2d 247 [34 Cal.Rptr. 484]; <em>Wharton </em>v. <em>Prudential Life Ins. Co. </em>(1954) 122 Cal.App.2d 857 [265 P.2d 956].) No such intervention being present here, it is said, no \u201caccident\u201d occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Appellant, on the other hand, urges both of the foregoing theories are either incorrect or inapposite, and that the controlling principle, or correct rule, in the matter is that expressed in <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., supra, </em>27 Cal.2d 305, 309-310 and confirmed in <em>Slobojan </em>v. <em>Western Travelers Life Ins. Co., supra, </em>70 Cal.2d 432, 443, that: \u201c\u2018[T]he presence of preexisting disease or infirmity will not relieve the insurer from liability if the accident is the proximate cause of death [or injury]; and that recovery may be had even though a diseased or infirm condition appears to actually contribute to cause the death [or injury] if the accident sets in progress the chain of events leading directly to death [or injury], or if it is the prime or moving cause. [Citations.]\u2019 (See also <em>Shafer </em>v. <em>American Cas. Co. </em>(1966) 245 Cal.App.2d 1 [53 Cal.Rptr. 446]; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>United Ins. Co. </em>(1952) 113 Cal.App.2d 493, 499 [248 P.2d 113]; <em>Happoldt </em>v. <em>Guardian Life Ins. Co. </em>(1949) 90 Cal.App.2d 386, 398 [203 P.2d 55].)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Our own conclusion is that while it must be conceded that \u201cNo all-inclusive definition of the word \u2018accident\u2019 can be given\u201d <em>(Geddes &amp; Smith, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number><em>Inc. </em>v. <em>St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d 558, 563 [334 P.2d 881]) and that a tautological review of the various expressions in the opinions dealing with the subject will tend to incline the analyst first to one view of the case and then to the other, what emerges as the foundation upon which disposition of the cause must rest is simply a common sense appraisal of what is by any reasonable understanding the nature of an \u201caccident\u201d policy of insurance. As pointed out by respondent, if it is to be held that an activity normally engaged in by an insured becomes an \u201caccident\u201d because the effect thereof, without more, is on a given occasion extraordinary, the term accident has, for insurance coverage purposes at least, no meaning at all. Put another way, if it is to be the case one may recover under an accident policy of insurance (with its correlatively reduced premium costs) for an injury which in some final analysis may be traced to what would otherwise be a commonplace act, because the injury transforms that act into an \u201caccident,\u201d there is nothing to distinguish the accident policy from an \u201cordinary\u201d or \u201cstandard\u201d form of disability insurance policy (with its correspondingly higher premium costs).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">We do not, of course, place our reasoning entirely on the basis of the economics involved nor do we fail to appreciate the tragic loss suffered by appellant. If our function were no more than to arrive at a resolution based upon the consideration whether it would be desirable that appellant be compensated, our task would be a simple one. Unfortunately, that is not the case. What must be determined is the justice of the cause in the light of the circumstances, and upon that premise we are unable to say the trial court erred, no matter which of the various rationales described is resorted to.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">So, it is manifest that in <em>Alessandro </em>there was absent any \u201cevidence of falling, slipping, overexertion, or of any external force striking the body of the appellant. . . . There was nothing outside \u2018the usual course of events\u2019 which happened \u201c \u2018suddenly and unexpectedly without any design of the\u2019 \u201d appellant <em>(Rock </em>v. <em>Travelers\u2019 Ins. Co., </em>172 Cal.462, 465 . . .) except the result, . . . .\u201d <em>(Alessandro </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Cas. Ins. Co., supra, </em>232 Cal.App.2d 203, 209.)</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">Similarly what was concerned was \u201ca series of imperceptible events that finally culminated in a single tangible harm\u201d and not as in <em>Geddes </em>a specific event or \u201ca series of specific events each of which manifested itself at an identifiable time and each of which caused identifiable harm [as defined in the policy] at the time it occurred.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>51 Cal.2d at p. 564.)</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">Finally, it is not true, we think, that recovery may be had herein because the jog set in progress the events leading directly to the loss of appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>vision, since that activity, except for its result, was not of such a nature as properly to be characterized an \u201caccident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">The judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Beach, J., and Gates, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
