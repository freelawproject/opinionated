(Capitol) appeals from a portion of a judgment entered after the court found the Board properly collected sales and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>use taxes on Capitol\u2019s acquisition and licensing of master tapes used to produce phonograph records.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Capitol (which maintains its principal place of business in Hollywood, California) is a full line record company which produces, manufactures, promotes and distributes records, record albums, and prerecorded cassette, eight-track, and reel-to-reel tapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The master tapes at issue here are the prototypes from which record companies, such as Capitol, manufacture their products. They are made by editing and \u201cmixing down\u201d multiple-track tape recordings of sounds generated by instruments, singers and/or speakers at studio recording sessions. For record production, the master tape is used to cut a \u201clacquer master\u201d from which a \u201cstamper\u201d for use in compression molding machines is ultimately derived. Cassette and eight-track prerecorded tapes are made from a \u201cduplicating master,\u201d which in turn is made from the master tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">Original master tapes are acquired by Capitol in one of three ways; (1) Capitol hires the exclusive services of artists (via a contract denoted \u201ctype A\u201d in this litigation), conducts recording sessions at its facilities, and makes its own master tapes; (2) Capitol purchases (via a \u201ctype B\u201d contract) master tapes made by others before any copies or lacquer masters are made; and (3) Capitol finances costs of independent production companies (with whom artists have exclusive contracts) and pays royalties in exchange for ownership of master tapes produced by these independent companies (a \u201ctype C\u201d contract).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">Capitol also engages in transactions involving duplicate master tapes or \u201ccopy tapes.\u201d Capitol sometimes agrees to license another company to manufacture, promote, and distribute records and/or tapes owned by Capitol. Pursuant to the license agreement, Capitol makes a duplicate master tape for the licensee. Duplicate master tapes are sometimes transferred to Capitol from other companies pursuant to similar licensing agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">At issue in this suit are use taxes assessed on amounts paid by Capitol to acquire original master tapes made outside the state in connection with \u201ctype B\u201d and \u201ctype C\u201d contracts for accounting periods in 1968, 1969, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>1970, and 1971.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (There is no issue as to \u201ctype A\u201d contracts.) Also at issue are use taxes imposed on amounts paid by Capitol for its acquisition of duplicate master tapes from other record companies, located out of state, and sales taxes imposed on amounts received by Capitol for furnishing duplicate master tapes to other companies, all pursuant to licensing agreements. Capitol paid the amounts assessed and claimed a refund from the Board. It brought suit when the Board denied its claim. (See Rev. &amp; Tax Code, \u00a7 6933; all further statutory references are to the Revenue and Taxation Code unless otherwise indicated.)</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">We begin with a brief overview of the California use tax law and of principles applicable to suits by taxpayers seeking refunds.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">Section 6201 defines the use tax and section 6202 specifies who pays it. Section 6201 provides in pertinent part: \u201cAn excise tax is hereby imposed on the storage, use, or other consumption in this state of tangible personal property purchased from any retailer on or after July 1, 1935, for storage, use or other consumption in this state . . . .\u201d Section 6202 provides in relevant part:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cEvery person storing, using, or otherwise consuming in this State tangible personal property purchased from a retailer is liable for the tax. His liability is not extinguished until the tax has been paid to this State . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">Discussing the purpose of the use tax, this court has said that, \u201cThe Use Tax Law (\u00a7\u00a7 6201-7273 et seq.) was designed to reach transactions involving property purchased from outside the state, not subject to California sales tax so that an unfair burden would not be placed upon local re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>toilers engaged in intrastate commerce; . . . The Use Tax Law is complementa! to the California Retail Sales Act of 1933 so that all taxable property is taxed once for the support of the state government.\u201d <em>(.McConville </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1978) 85 Cal.App.3d 156, 159 [149 Cal.Rptr. 194], citations omitted; see <em>Burroughs Corp. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 1152, 1159 [200 Cal.Rptr. 816]; Traynor, <em>The California Use Tax </em>(1936) 24 Cal.L.Rev. 175, 176.)</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">We also note that \u201cIn a suit for refund of tax, the burden of proof is on the taxpayer. <em>(Flying Tiger Line </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equal. </em>(1958) 157 Cal.App.2d 85, 99 [320 P.2d 552].) ... In an action for refund, \u2018the taxpayer has the burden of proof to show that he is entitled to his claim. He cannot assert error and thus shift to the state the burden to justify the tax. . . .\u2019 <em>(Hall </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Board </em>(1966) 244 Cal.App.2d 843, 848 [53 Cal.Rptr. 597].)\u201d <em>(Honeywell, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1982) 128 Cal.App.3d 739, 744 [180 Cal.Rptr. 479]; <em>see. Paine </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 438, 442 [187 Cal.Rptr. 47].)</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">Capitol first contends the Legislature specifically provided a retroactive exemption from taxation for master tapes during the years in question when the Legislature amended section 6362.5 in 1982. (Stats. 1982, ch. 951, \u00a7 1, pp. 3442-3443.) In order to evaluate Capitol\u2019s argument, we review the history of section 6362.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">In 1975, the Legislature enacted section 6362.5,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which exempted from tax the gross receipts received for the sale, lease, storage or use of master tapes or master records. (Stats. 1975, ch. 1116, \u00a7 1, p. 2708.) However, subdivision (a) of the statute provided that tax would continue to be due on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>\u201camounts . . . paid by a customer in connection with the customer\u2019s production of master tapes or master records to a recording studio for the tangible elements of such master records or master tapes.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The 1975 enactment specifically provided, \u201cThe provisions of this act are not intended by the Legislature to support any inference about the meaning of the law prior to the operative date of this act.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">The parties agree that the enactment of section 6362.5 in 1975 gave Capitol what it seeks in this suit for years after 1975\u2014an exemption from taxation on transfer of master tapes. The parties further agree that the 1975 legislation operates prospectively only and cannot be a basis of upholding Capitol\u2019s position in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">In 1982, the Legislature enacted Assembly Bill No. 2871. Section 1 of that act amended subdivision (b)(2) of section 6362.5 to add the following italicized language: \u201c(2) \u2018Amounts paid for the furnishing of the tangible elements\u2019 shall not include any amounts paid for the copyrightable, artistic or intangible elements of such master tapes or master records, whether designated as royalties or otherwise <em>including, but not limited to, services rendered in producing, fabricating, processing, or imprinting tangible personal property or any other services or production expenses in connection therewith which may otherwise be construed as constituting \u2018sale\u2019 under Section 6006.\u201d </em>(Stats. 1982, ch. 951, \u00a7 1, p. 3443.)</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The 1982 amendment also included the following statement of legislative intent: \u201cThe Legislature finds and declares that Section 1 [quoted above] of this act is declaratory of, and not a change in, existing law. It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this act to clarify the existing law and to affect all applicable pending proceedings.\u201d (Stats. 1982, ch. 951, \u00a7 2, p. 3443.)</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Capitol contends the 1982 amendment reflects an expression of legislative intent to apply all of section 6362.5 (including the explicit exception afforded master tapes in subdivision (a)) retroactively to all \u201cpending proceedings,\u201d including this case. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">We have examined certain materials submitted to us by the parties containing indications of the collegial intent of the Legislature in enacting the 1982 amendment. (See <em>Commodore Home Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 211, 222-223 [185 Cal.Rptr. 270, 649 P.2d 912].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>materials are the staff commentaries of the Assembly and Senate Committees on Revenue and Taxation<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the Legislative Counsel\u2019s Digest.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">These materials make it clear that the purpose of the 1982 amendment to section 6362.5 was to attempt to clarify whether fabrication costs of independent recording engineers and producers were subject to tax <em>under the 1975 statute. There was no intent to apply the 1975 legislation retroactively. </em> The amendment purports to reach back to 1975 and to affect claims subject to adjudication under the 1975 statute, but the amendment does not attempt to affect claims such as Capitol\u2019s that originated before 1975.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>n</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">Having rejected any retroactive application of the statutory exemption, we now turn to Capitol\u2019s other arguments to the effect that no use tax can be imposed on its acquisition of original master tapes made outside the state during the 1968-1971 time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Capitol first contends the trial court erred in finding that agreements between Capitol and independent production companies for acquisition of master tapes (type C contracts) were sales agreements and not employment contracts. Both sides agree that performance of services or production of goods by an employee for an employer does not result in the imposition of use tax. (See <em>Automatic Canteen Co. </em>v. <em>State Board of Equalization </em>(1965) 238 Cal.App.2d 372, 386 [47 Cal.Rptr. 848],)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\n                   In determining whether one who performs services for another is an employee or an independent contractor, the most important factor is the right to control the manner and means of accomplishing the result desired. <em>(Empire Star Mines Co. </em>v. <em>Cal. Emp. Com. </em>(1946) 28 Cal.2d 33, 43 [168 P.2d 686]; <em>Automatic Canteen Co. </em>v. <em>State Board of Equalization, supra, </em>238 Cal.App.2d at p. 386.) Whether the right to control existed or was exercised is generally a question of fact to be resolved from the reasonable inferences to be drawn from the circumstances shown. <em>(Miller </em>v. <em>Long Beach Oil Dev. Co. </em>(1959) 167 Cal.App.2d 546, 550 [334 P.2d 695].)</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Capitol argues it exercised the same supervision and control over recording sessions of the artists employed by the production companies subject to type C contracts as it did with its direct employees under type A contracts.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In essence, Capitol asks us to reweigh conflicting evidence. This is a particularly inappropriate request since Capitol waived findings of fact by not requesting them.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>\n                   \u201cOur role in the absence of findings is laid out in <em>Price </em>v. <em>Price </em>(1952) 114 Cal.App.2d 176, 179 [249 P.2d 841]: \u2018the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>pellate court will not weigh the evidence to determine what is true and what is not, but will assume that the trial court found every fact essential to support the judgment, and will search the record for the purpose only of determining whether there is substantial evidence supporting the judgment and will resolve all doubts in favor of the judgment. [Citation.]\u2019 (See also <em>Beehan </em>v. <em>Lido Isle Community Assn. </em>(1977) 70 Cal.App.3d 858, 861 [137 Cal.Rptr. 528]; <em>Lane &amp; Pyron, Inc., </em>v. <em>Gibbs </em>(1968) 266 Cal.App.2d 61, 65 [71 Cal.Rptr. 817].)\u201d <em>(Golde </em>v. <em>Fox </em>(1979) 98 Cal.App.3d 167, 174 [159 Cal.Rptr. 864].)</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">We first note that the type C agreements themselves provide substantial evidence that no employee/employer relationship existed between Capitol and the makers of master tapes. Capitol\u2019s type C contracts consist of two separately signed agreements, one for production of master tapes and one for royalties. The royalty agreement describes the production contract as \u201can agreement (called the \u2018Contract\u2019) under which [the independent production] <em>Company will produce for its own account </em>phonograph record masters embodying performances by the individual(s) identified in Section 11 below (collectively called \u2018Artist\u2019) <em>and sell such masters to Capitol.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) In the production agreement, the production company warrants, inter alia, \u201cThe Artist Recording Contract permits Company to sell masters recorded thereunder to Capitol on all the terms of Addendum No. 1 hereto;\u201d and \u201cCompany has the right to make this entire agreement and . . . Company has not done or permitted to be done anything which may curtail or impair any of the rights given or grants made herein.\u201d Thus, on its face, the production agreement is a sales contract, not a contract of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Trial testimony also established that, during the time period at issue, Capitol did not exercise de facto control over those making master tapes pursuant to type C contracts. For example, there was no requirement that selections or song titles be submitted to or approved by Capitol before recording sessions began. The sessions were directed by session producers usually chosen and supplied by the independent production company; they were usually not Capitol employees. Independent session producers hired musicians and vocalists, assisted in arranging music, directed performances in the studios, and worked with sound engineers in the mix-down process that resulted in the master tape. Other producers employed by Capitol scouted artists, found tunes that were prospective \u201chits,\u201d and did \u201ca large amount of peripheral work\u201d in connection with recording sessions. The Capitol producers participated in but did not dictate decisions regarding recording session dates and locations. Capitol\u2019s employees approved the budget submitted by the production company (to avoid overcharges) and paid the bills. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>The inference to be drawn from this testimony is that it was the session producer, not Capitol, who controlled the manner and means of accomplishing the production of a master tape. Substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s determination that master tapes furnished to Capitol pursuant to type C contracts were purchased by Capitol from independent companies and were not fabricated for Capitol by its employees. (See <em>Mission Park Co. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1972) 23 Cal.App.3d 120, 127 [100 Cal.Rptr. 69].)</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Capitol next contends the Board acted unreasonably in imposing use tax on master tapes made outside the state and acquired by Capitol pursuant to type B and C contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The parties disagree as to the legal authority that the Board relied on when it imposed tax. Prior to the 1970\u2019s, the Board adopted formal interpretive \u201crulings\u201d which were published in the California Administrative Code.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> These \u201crulings\u201d or \u201crules\u201d (which were generally readopted as \u201cregulations\u201d by the Board in the 1970\u2019s) were consistently treated by the courts as formal administrative interpretations of statutes entitled to great weight and subject to being overturned only if shown to be plainly arbitrary. (See, e.g., <em>Mission Pak Co. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization, supra, </em>23 Cal.App.3d at p. 125; <em>Gen. Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1952) 111 Cal.App.2d 180, 188 [244 Cal.Rptr. 427].)</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">In the instant case, the Board contends imposition of tax was based on formal Board ruling No. 16, applicable during the years in question and renumbered and adopted as Board regulation No. 1527 on December 3, 1971.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>Capitol contends that the Board did not rely on ruling No. 16 but rather relied on the Board\u2019s <em>interpretation </em>of ruling No. 16. Capitol notes that ruling No. 16 (later regulation No. 1527) does not expressly refer to master tapes, and Capitol points to 1974 and 1976 amendments to regulation No. 1527 that do explicitly refer to master tapes.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, Capitol contends the Board merely interpreted its own rule or regulation in imposing tax and that the Board\u2019s interpretation is entitled to less weight on review than is a rule or regulation itself according to the doctrine of <em>Culligan Water Conditioning </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 86 [130 Cal.Rptr. 321, 550 P.2d 593]. There the court held that while the Board\u2019s <em>interpretation </em>of its own regulation is not entitled to a presumption that it is correct unless shown to be arbitrary, capricious, or without rational basis, the interpretation is still entitled to great weight. <em>(Culligan, supra, </em>at pp. 92-93.)</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Even assuming arguendo that tax was imposed on Capitol as a consequence of the Board\u2019s litigating interpretation of ruling No. 16, when we apply the rule of <em>Culligan </em>we conclude the interpretation was reasonable because tax was required by the applicable use tax statutes.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Section 6201 (see <em>ante, </em>p. 588) imposes a use tax if (a) tangible personal property is (b) purchased (c) from any retailer (d) for storage, use or other consumption in this state. In this case there is no dispute that the master tapes were, in fact, used by Capitol in this state. Moreover, we have already concluded that the master tapes were acquired by purchase and not as a consequence of fabrication by employees. Additionally, we note that, except for argument that master tapes were fabricated by employees, Capitol has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>not contended that the independent producers of the tapes were not retailers.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Consequently, Capitol has not met its burden of proving that it acquired master tapes from someone other than a retailer. (See <em>Hotel Del Coronado Corp. </em>v. <em>State Board of Equalization </em>(1971) 15 Cal.App.3d 612, 619-620 [92 Cal.Rptr. 456]; see also <em>Honeywell, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization, supra, </em>128 Cal.App.3d at pp. 744-745.)</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Finally, we conclude that original master tapes acquired by Capitol constitute \u201ctangible personal property\u201d subject to the use tax. Section 6016 defines \u201ctangible personal property\u201d for purposes of sales and use tax liability as \u201cpersonal property which may be seen, weighed, measured, felt, or touched, or which is in any other manner perceptible to the senses.\u201d In <em>Simplicity Pattern Co. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 900 [167 Cal.Rptr. 366, 615 P.2d 555], the Supreme Court construed section 6016 and related regulations of the Board so as to uphold the imposition of sales tax on a transfer of film negatives and master recordings used to make audiovisual training materials. Simplicity\u2019s argument was that transfer of the negatives and masters was not subject to sales tax because the purchaser\u2019s primary interest was not in the physical objects but rather in the right to exploit the intangible intellectual products they embodied. Concluding that \u201cthe film negatives and master recordings are analogous to printing plates,\u201d (p. 909) the court held the materials subject to tax as tangible property: \u201cThough valued in part for their intellectual content, they also were physically useful in the manufacturing process. Their value as physical objects permitted measuring the tax on their sale by the price received for their entire worth. Finally, the present transfer was not incidental to any service and so was a sale of property for tax purposes.\u201d (P. 912.) <em>Simplicity Pattern </em>controls here. Master tapes obtained by Capitol were manifestly useful in the manufacturing process, were not furnished as incidents to any service, and were therefore properly taxed as tangible personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Since master tapes acquired by Capitol from out-of-state producers met all criteria for imposition of use tax under section 6201, the Board acted properly and reasonably in construing the statute and Board ruling No. 16 so as to tax the transactions in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Capitol next asserts that imposition of use tax on its acquisition of original master tapes pursuant to type B and C contracts violated guarantees of equal protection of the laws<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> because allegedly identical transactions between independent film producers and motion picture studios are exempt from tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">It is undisputed that, during the years in question, major movie studios acquired rights in films made by independent producers outside the state, that the films were made with a soundtrack and picture negative as physically separate elements, that the studios sometimes used the soundtrack portion of the films ultimately to make records,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and that the Board did not impose tax on the movie studios when they acquired rights in these films (including soundtracks).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">Before addressing Capitol\u2019s equal protection claim, we examine the legal bases upon which the Board has exempted from tax the acquisition of movies by movie studios. In 1933, the Board adopted ruling No. 19, (now Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 18, \u00a7 1529) which, during the period in question here, read in relevant part as follows: \u201cProducers of motion pictures are consumers of all film and other tangible personal property used in production, and tax applies to sales to producers of such property. <em>Tax does not apply to amounts received by the producer for the right to exhibit or reproduce motion pictures. </em>\u201d (Italics added.) Ruling No. 19 was adopted to reflect the established historical fact that independent producers of movies did not <em>sell </em>their movies to studios; rather, the agreement between producer and studio was one that generally allowed the studio to <em>lease </em>the producer\u2019s movie for exhibition and distribution. Accordingly, ruling No. 19 exempted \u201camounts received by the producer for the right to exhibit or reproduce motion pictures\u2019\u2019 because the transfer of such rights involved neither a \u201csale\u201d for purposes of the sales tax (see \u00a7 6051) nor a \u201cpurchase\u201d for purposes of the use tax (see \u00a7 6201). In 1965, when the Legislature first included leases of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>tangible personal property as sales or purchases for tax purposes, it specifically exempted leases of motion picture and television films and tapes from taxation. (\u00a7\u00a7 6006, subd. (g)(1); 6010, subd. (e)(1).)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> These statutes afford films (including their soundtracks) an exemption from sales and use tax in the prescribed circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">We question whether Capitol has standing to pursue its equal protection claim in light of the statutory exemption provided for films. Capitol\u2019s equal protection attack is expressly aimed immediately at striking down ruling No. 16 (later regulation No. 1527). However, as we have just concluded in part II-B, use tax was properly imposed on Capitol under the applicable statute. (\u00a7 6201.) Since exemption from tax on the acquisition of films has also been granted by statute (\u00a7 6010, subd. (e)(1)), any equal protection infirmity in the Board\u2019s rules and regulations is immaterial if tax is properly assessed on Capitol under the statutory scheme. (See fn. 15, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">However, Capitol has not claimed that any statute is unconstitutional either on its face or as applied to Capitol. (Compare, e.g., <em>Estate of Morrison </em>(1982) 130 Cal.App.3d 543, 546-548 [181 Cal.Rptr. 834]; <em>City of San Jose </em>v. <em>Donohoe </em>(1975) 51 Cal.App.3d 40, 45-48 [123 Cal.Rptr. 804].) While Capitol could, in another form of action, attempt to invalidate the statutory exemption provided for films (see, e.g., <em>Kay </em>v. <em>Pacific Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>(1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 814, 817 [148 Cal.Rptr. 213]; <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1971) 16 Cal.App.3d 629, 633 [94 Cal.Rptr. 190]), Capitol has made no such challenge to the exemption statutes here, nor would it have standing to do so in this action.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> (See <em>Simplicity Pattern Co. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 912.)  While this court has the power to invalidate a statute on constitutional grounds (see <em>Barker Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>Los Angeles </em>(1938) 10 Cal.2d 603, 609 [76 P.2d 97]), we may not rewrite a statute to grant an exemption from tax. (See <em>Vogel </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1967) 68 Cal.2d 18, 25 [64 Cal.Rptr. 409, 434 P.2d 961]; <em>Cypress Lawn C. Assn. </em>v. <em>San Francisco </em>(1931) 211 Cal. 387, 390 [295 P. 813].)</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">While we question Capitol\u2019s standing to pursue their articulated equal protection attack, we also note the Board has not challenged Capitol\u2019s standing and has addressed the merits of why different tax classifications for master sound tapes and movies should be upheld. Consequently, we assume <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>arguendo that Capitol is attempting to invalidate the combination of statutes that impose use tax on master tapes but exempt movies, as the statutes are applied to Capitol; we further assume Capitol has standing. (See <em>Carmichael </em>v. <em>Southern Coal Co. </em>(1936) 301 U.S. 495, 510-512 [81 L.Ed. 1245, 1253-1255, [57 S.Ct. 868, 109 A.L.R. 1327].) Also, because we find the separate classification of master tapes and movies constitutional, we do not reach the question whether any unconstitutionality in the statutory scheme could be saved by severing the exemption statute. (See, e.g., <em>Carmichael, supra, </em>301 U.S. at p. 513 [81 L.Ed. at p. 1255]; see also <em>Morey </em>v. <em>Doud </em>(1957) 354 U.S. 457, 469 [1 L.Ed.2d 1485, 1494, 77 S.Ct. 1344], overruled on other grounds in <em>New Orleans </em>v. <em>Dukes </em>(1976) 427 U.S. 297, 306 [49 L.Ed.2d 511, 518-519, 96 S.Ct. 2513].)</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Capitol must prove the Legislature adopted an impermissibly discriminatory classification by taxing the purchase of master tapes under section 6201 and by exempting the leasing of movies in section 6010, subdivision (e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">As was said in <em>Henry\u2019s Restaurants of Pomona, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1973) 30 Cal.App.3d 1009 at pages 1016-1017 [106 Cal.Rptr. 867]: \u201cWe start with the proposition that the statute comes before us clothed with a presumption of constitutionality.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">\u201c \u2018[T]he power of the states to make classifications of persons or property for the purpose of taxation is very broad. ...

First, Capitol acquires original master tapes from independent producers by <em>purchase-, </em>the statutory exemption for movies is based on <em>lease </em>transactions. (See \u00a7 6010, subd. (e)(1).) Consequently, the legislative classification<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> is justified by fundamental differences in the economic transactions by which movies, on the one hand, and master tapes, on the other, get from producers to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">In evaluating whether the Legislature has acted arbitrarily in classifying a <em>lease </em>of a motion picture differently from a <em>purchase </em>of a master tape, we are mindful that these sorts of differences (between leases and sales) are at the very heart of the tax laws. Not every transfer of property from one to another is subject to sales or use tax; the Legislature has imposed these taxes only on certain economic transactions, to wit, retail sales, purchases, or leases. (See \u00a7\u00a7 6006, 6006.1, 6007; 6051, 6201; <em>Roth Drug, Inc. </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1936) 13 Cal.App.2d 720, 734-735 [57 Cal.Rptr. 1022].) Indeed, the Legislature did not even tax lease transactions before 1965, except that sales tax was imposed where goods were rented or leased in lieu of a sale. (See <em>Universal Eng. Co. </em>v. <em>Bd. of Equalization </em>(1953) 118 Cal.App.2d 36, 41 [256 P.2d 1059].) We conclude that Capitol, which <em>purchases </em>its original master tapes, has not proved it is within the same class as movie studios that <em>lease </em>movies.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>A second reason why the Legislature\u2019s classification must be upheld is that Capitol has not proved that movies and master sound tapes are functionally the same things. Evidence at trial indicated a master sound tape is made of one-quarter inch magnetic tape and is immediately useful as a kind of mold or \u201cprinting plate,\u201d as <em>Simplicity Pattern </em>noted. <em>(Simplicity Pattern Co. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 909.) Although movies generally have soundtracks, which are physically separate from the visual film component of the movie, the soundtrack is recorded on 35 millimeter sprocketed magnetic tape, synchronized with the film. There was no evidence at trial indicating that a film soundtrack was immediately useful (without editing, mixing, or transfer to another form of tape) for the production of commercial tapes or records for sale to the public.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> A film soundtrack is not useful as a mold or \u201cprinting plate,\u201d and the Legislature and the Board can reasonably distinguish between soundtracks and master tapes on that basis, i.e., that additional work must be done on the sound components of movies in order to make them useful for the purpose of producing products for sale to the general public. (See <em>Simplicity Pattern Co. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 912.)</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Boiled down to its essentials, Capitol, a member of the record industry, is trying to take advantage of a statutory exemption provided for the movie industry. In <em>Culligan Water Conditioning </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d 86, the taxpayer made an argument analogous to Capitol\u2019s and the Supreme Court disposed of it as follows: \u201cPlaintiff first points out that section 6006, subdivision (g)(2) provides that the Sales and Use Tax Law does not apply to a linen supplier and argues that the \u2018furnishing of soft water by [plaintiff] to a customer\u2019s home is almost identical in nature to the linen supply service.\u2019 We do not see how this reference assists plaintiff, since the point plaintiff attempts to make contains its own complete answer, namely that the Legislature has seen fit to provide a statutory ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>emption for the linen industry.\u201d <em>(Culligan, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at p. 97, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Here, there are sufficient differences between the acquisition and use of master sound tapes and movies to justify different treatment of the record industry and the movie industry by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">We have already held that master tapes are tangible personal property for purposes of sales and use tax law. However, Capitol contends license fees paid by and to it for the right to reproduce and market musical recordings are payments for intangible rights and are not subject to sales and use tax even though the recordings are made from duplicate master tapes supplied in conjunction with the licensing agreements. The argument is premised on the technological possibility of using previously manufactured prerecorded tapes or records to produce a new production master tape (\u201cpirating\u201d in the parlance of the industry) and the theoretical possibility that a licensee would purchase the right to manufacture and distribute the artist\u2019s performance and not the copy tape which embodies that performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">However, the record reveals no such separate purchase of intangible rights. Evidence at trial indicated that licensees obtain duplicate master tapes and the right to manufacture, market and distribute records and tapes made from the duplicate in exchange for payment. For licenses given by Capitol, the payment includes amounts attributable to the cost of the duplicated tape and art work that might go with it (about $35 to $40). At the expiration of the term of the license, the duplicate master tapes must be returned or destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">Substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s implied finding that the \u201clicenses\u201d are, in fact, leases of master tapes. Section 6006.3 defines \u201clease\u201d to include a \u201clicense.\u201d Leases are taxed as continuing sales. (\u00a7\u00a7 6006, subd. (a); 6006.1.) The tax measure is \u201cthe total amount for which tangible personal property is . . . leased . . . valued in money . . . without any deduction on account of . . . labor or service cost . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 6011, subd. (a); <em>Simplicity Pattern Co. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 906.) The Board correctly imposed tax on the total value of the license agreements.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">We have rounded up the usual authorities and have discovered they cannot supply an exemption from tax for Capitol. Although there are superficial similarities between master tapes and movies, they are like the similarities present in certain falcons of the Maltese variety: differences appear as one chips at the surface of each bird. Although a master sound tape may contain the stuff that dreams are made of, it is not a movie for purposes of the sales or use tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">Blease, Acting P.

Capitol requests that we take judicial notice of information allegedly taken from <em>Billboard </em>magazine indicating the ranking of sales of record albums for certain years. We decline the request. (See <em>San Luis Obispo Bay Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>(1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 556, 563-564 [104 Cal.Rptr. 733].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b436-7\"> See Statutes 1965, First Extraordinary Session 1965, chapter 2, sections 6-7, pages 5445-5446; <em>Culligan Water Conditioning </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at p. 97.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b436-8\"> Besides that, knocking out the exemption provided the film industry is the last thing Capitol wants from this litigation. That victory would entitle Capitol to report to their film neighbors in Hollywood: \u201cThe good news is we won. The bad news is you\u2019re taxed too.\u2019\u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b438-7\"> Board ruling No. 19, which predated enactment of sections 6006, subdivision (g)(1) and 6010, subdivision (e)(1), was premised on the same distinction: the absence of a \u201csale\u201d or \u201cpurchase\u201d when movie producers transferred rights to studios. (See discussion <em>ante, p. </em>597.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b438-8\"> At trial, one of Capitols\u2019 own experts, an attorney with long experience in the movie industry, testified it was the custom in the movie industry for independent film producers to retain the rights to the story of the film when distribution rights were acquired by a studio. The expert testified that in \u201cthe great bulk of cases\u201d the economic transaction between film producer and major studio is one in which the sthdio finances the making of the movie in exchange for distribution rights but that no sale of the film to the studio occurs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Evidence at trial indicated that music for a film is recorded in studios at recording sessions on sprocketed, multiple-track 35 millimeter tape which is then edited and mixed down onto a master music sound tape. That tape is then combined with separately recorded dialogue and sound effects tapes and edited into a master soundtrack tape, which is synchronized with the picture negative. When an independent movie producer delivers a \u201cmovie\u201d to a studio, he delivers a photographic picture negative and a soundtrack tape. The soundtrack master tape and the picture negative are physically separate elements which the film studio combines to create an answer print which it copies to release to exhibitors.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">A representative of Walt Disney Studios testified that Disney uses the master music sound tape to make phonograph records and tapes. However, Disney is a studio that makes and distributes its own movies. Thus, the availability of the master music sound tape to Disney does not permit the inference that the sound tape, rather than the soundtrack, is generally available to major studios that obtain films from independent producers. Moreover, no evidence suggested that even the master music sound tape was immediately useful, as a \u201cmold\u201d or \u201cprinting plate,\u201d for the manufacture of records and tapes for sale to the general public.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b440-9\"> It is not clear whether Capitol is contending its right to equal protection of the laws was violated when tax was imposed on its licensing agreements. At trial and on appeal, Capitol\u2019s equal protection argument focused on original tapes acquired by Capitol pursuant to type B and C contracts. In a footnote in its brief, Capitol does contend the trial court erroneously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>rejected Capitol\u2019s equal protection argument because the trial court allegedly \u201cignored\u201d evidence that Capitol leased copy tapes. (Since Capitol failed to request findings of fact or conclusions of law, it is in no position to assert what the trial court did or did not ignore.) We therefore assume Capitol contends that imposition of tax on its licensing agreements is discriminatory and that there is no reasonable basis for exemptions provided the movie industry. Since Capitol raised the issue in a footnote, we dispose of it in one.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-12\">Capitol has not shown that the Legislature has arbitrarily discriminated between motion picture leases and copy tape licenses. Evidence at trial indicated that major studios commonly acquired motion pictures from independent producers pursuant to an agreement calling for the financing and distribution of the film. Assuming arguendo that the financing/ distribution agreements are \u201cleases,\u201d Capitol has not shown any similarity (not to mention identity) between its licensing agreements and the \u201cleases\u201d applicable to the movie industry. Indeed, the trial court had no evidence on which to make such a comparison. Although witnesses testified generally that major studios acquired movies from independent producers pursuant to financing/distribution agreements, only one such agreement was admitted in evidence, and no evidence indicated that the agreement was standard in the industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-13\">In addition, as we have pointed out, evidence at trial did not establish that movies and master sound tapes are functionally the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
