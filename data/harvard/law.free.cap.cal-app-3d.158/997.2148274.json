J.</author>\n<p id=\"b718-10\">Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b718-11\">In this appeal, we are asked to analyze the sufficiency of the allegations of a complaint filed by appellant, a real estate developer, against the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>spondents, private citizens who supported a referendum that repealed a city ordinance which would have allowed appellant to build a condominium project. For the reasons stated below, we conclude that the conduct of the citizens during the course of this political campaign was not actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">We also determine that the appeal is partially frivolous as to the libel claims because the invalidity of these claims was conclusively adjudicated by our Supreme Court. Accordingly, we assess sanctions against appellant\u2019s counsel Levy &amp; Norminton.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">As a portion of the complaint has already been thoroughly reviewed by our Supreme Court in <em>Okun </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 442 [175 Cal.Rptr. 157, 629 P.2d 1369] (cert. den. 454 U.S. 1099 [70 L.Ed.2d 641, 102 S.Ct. 673]), we adopt the Supreme Court\u2019s recital of the facts of this case as our own.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">Appellant, Maple Properties, \u201cis a limited partnership that purchases, manages, develops, and sells real property. In 1977 it bought 10 acres of Beverly Hills property with a view to building condominiums. The property, then under a building moratorium pending determination of zoning, adjoined city-owned parcels. [Appellant] had discussed with city officials the possibility of a land exchange so that [appellant] and the city each would own contiguous land. The discussions concluded successfully on November 28, 1978, when the city council agreed to the land exchange and adopted a zoning ordinance allowing plaintiff to construct condominiums on all its newly acquired property, [f] To prevent construction, [respondents Erwin Okun, Betty H. Harris, Joann Ruden and various Does] circulated and then filed a petition to allow the electorate to reject or accept the ordinance. Consequently, the council placed it on the ballot for an election held March 9, 1979. It was rejected and thus repealed. ...\u201d <em>(Okun, supra, </em>29 Cal.3d at pp. 447-448.)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">Two months after the referendum election, appellant filed its initial complaint against respondents. The subsequently filed first amended complaint alleged ten causes of action, namely for libel (the first, second, third and fifth causes of action), slander (fourth and sixth causes of action), violation of various federal civil rights laws (seventh and eighth causes of action) and interference with prospective economic advantage (ninth and tenth causes of action).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">On April 24, 1980, respondents\u2019 demurrer to the first and seventh through tenth causes of action was sustained without leave to amend. Respondents\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>demurrer to the defamation causes of action (second, third, fifth and sixth), however, was overruled. The fourth cause of action was placed off calendar because it alleged only Doe defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">The Supreme Court granted a hearing on respondents\u2019 petition for writ of mandate on the defamation causes of action and eventually issued a peremptory writ of mandate directing the superior court to sustain the demurrer. <em>(Okun, supra, </em>29 Cal.3d at p. 460.) The peremptory writ issued by the Supreme Court ordered the demurrer to the libel causes of action sustained without leave to amend but permitted amendment of the sixth cause of action for slander. <em>(Id., </em>atp. 460.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">On remand, the trial court, pursuant to the order of the Supreme Court, sustained the demurrer to the libel causes of action without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Appellant filed a second amended complaint, alleging only a fourth cause of action for slander and a sixth cause of action for conspiracy to commit slander. The trial court sustained respondents\u2019 demurrer to the second amended complaint and denied further leave to amend. Subsequently, the trial court dismissed the entire action.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal which is the subject of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">Contention</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">Appellant contends that the complaint states ten viable causes of action and that the trial court erred in sustaining the various demurrers without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b720-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b720-12\"><em>Our Supreme Court\u2019s Decision in Okun </em>v. <em>Superior Court (1981) 29 Cal. 3d 442, Mandates Dismissal of the Causes of Action Based on Libel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b720-13\">Appellant first contends that the superior court erred in dismissing the libel causes of action. The allegedly libelous documents consisted of a letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>to the editor of the Los Angeles Times,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> an open letter to the mayor published in the Beverly Hills Courier<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the statement included in the \u201cSample Ballot and Voter Information Pamphlet.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>In <em>Okun, supra, </em>29 Cal.3d 442, the Supreme Court exhaustively analyzed these documents and concluded that they \u201ccould not reasonably have been interpreted by its probable readers as having a libelous meaning.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 457.) The court further concluded that leave to amend the complaint should be denied \u201cbecause <em>\u2018there are no circumstances under which an amendment would serve any useful </em>purpose\u2019 [citation] . . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 460.) (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Incredibly, appellant now asks this court to overturn the superior court order which complies with the clear and unambiguous directive of the Supreme Court to dismiss the libel causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Initially, appellant contended in its opening brief that our further review of the libel causes of action was warranted on grounds that subsequent to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Okun, </em>\u201cnew facts\u201d \u201cwhich were not part of the record in the first appeal\u201d were discovered. Appellant urged that these \u201cnew facts\u201d that respondent and others had agreed to make criminal complaints against Richard Stone and appellant with government agencies at the time the allegedly libelous letters were published, \u201cadd[ed] new contextual meaning\u201d to the publications which our Supreme Court had deemed to be nonlibelous.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">However, the record reveals that these additional facts were not \u201cnew\u201d at all. Appellant now concedes that these facts were part of the record when the Supreme Court considered respondents\u2019 petition for writ of mandate and again when it considered appellant\u2019s petition for rehearing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>It is axiomatic that the Court of Appeal is bound by the decision of the California Supreme Court. <em>(Auto Equity Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 455 [20 Cal.Rptr. 321, 369 P.2d 937].) The Supreme Court\u2019s determination of the question of the propriety of the libel causes of action is law of the case. <em>(Richer </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 63 Cal.App.3d 748 [134 Cal.Rptr. 52].) We can review it no further and the libel causes of action were properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">\n<em>This Appeal Is Partially Frivolous and Is an Appropriate Instance for the Imposition of Sanctions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">A. <em>The Procedural History and Our Order to Show Cause</em></p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">We now address the question as to whether sanctions should be imposed under Code of Civil Procedure section 907<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and rule 26(a) of the California Rules of Court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">In its brief on appeal, respondent Okun requested that this court award sanctions for attorney\u2019s fees and costs on the grounds that the contentions on appeal were frivolous. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 907; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 26(a).) Appellant argued against the imposition of sanctions in its reply brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">Appellant filed a written election to waive oral argument at the hearing on the appeal set for May 16, 1984. Respondents\u2019 counsel appeared at the oral argument, argued briefly and responded to our questions; both counsel then requested sanctions against appellant for pursuing a frivolous appeal. We indicated to respondents\u2019 counsel that we would consider remanding the matter for hearing in the superior court on the question of sanctions for an appeal that was frivolous with regard to the libel claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-11\">Upon reflection, it was our view that the issue of sanctions for an appeal which was partially frivolous was a question of law and therefore an issue we should decide. Because of our desire to follow scrupulously the dictates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>of our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>In re Marriage of Flaherty </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 637 [183 Cal.Rptr. 508, 646 P.2d 179] <em>(Flaherty), and </em>because of appellant\u2019s decision not to appear for oral argument, we issued an order to show cause why sanctions should not be assessed against appellant and its counsel.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">Appellant and its counsel filed a 32-page brief in response to our order to show cause.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This brief asserted three major contentions: (1) the proceeding instituted by our order to show cause violates their procedural due process rights because they were not afforded reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard; (2) the appeal is not frivolous; and (3) even if the appeal on the libel claims is frivolous, the remaining six causes of action are meritorious and the appeal cannot be considered frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">B. <em>The Flaherty Due Process Requirements Have Been Satisfied</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">(2) In <em>Flaherty, </em>our Supreme Court discussed the necessary due process requirements to be afforded a party prior to the imposition of sanctions. The court stated, \u201c[d]ue process requires that certain basic procedural protections be afforded before the state deprives an individual of property. [Citations.] . . . [|] . . . Fundamental constitutional mandates require that the basic protections of due process be followed before an attorney is fined for prosecuting a frivolous appeal.\u201d <em>(Flaherty, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at pp. 651-652.)</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">\u201cDue process, fundamental fairness and the integrity of our judicial system all require that counsel be permitted to pursue their clients\u2019 interests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>with the confidence that they will not be singled out at random for sanctions. In proper cases, the imposition of penalties for prosecuting a frivolous appeal may be fair and may serve the useful purpose of deterring similar conduct. However, such sanctions should be imposed rarely and only if the mandates of procedural due process are obeyed, [t] Due process is a flexible concept, and must be tailored to the requirements of each particular situation. . . . The appellate courts should exercise their statutory power to impose sanctions only after scrupulously observing the due process mandates set forth herein. Penalties for prosecuting frivolous appeals should not be imposed without giving fair warning, affording the attorney an opportunity to respond to the charge, and holding a hearing. Further, when imposing sanctions, the court should provide the attorney with a written statement of the reasons for the penalty.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 654.)</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Appellant\u2019s claims concerning the violation of its due process rights are specious. Appellant chose not to appear at oral argument to challenge the respondents\u2019 contentions and the request for sanctions. The request for sanctions had been made in respondent Okun\u2019s brief filed nearly six months prior to the scheduled date for oral argument. In order to comply with <em>Flaherty, </em>we issued an order to show cause re sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">While appellant claims our order to show cause lacked clarity and precision, its responses to our order and its arguments presented at the hearing belie this contention. An extensive brief and a supporting declaration as well as a reply to respondents\u2019 brief was filed. Appellant and its counsel appeared at the hearing with two additional counsel who were engaged to present appellant\u2019s views. Appellant\u2019s counsel engaged in a vigorous and extensive debate with respondents\u2019 counsel before this court. The briefs submitted by appellant exhaustively cited the relevant statutory and decisional authorities on the subject of frivolous appeal; the briefs squarely addressed the subject matter of our order to show cause. At the conclusion of the hearing, we offered appellant\u2019s counsel further opportunity to brief the subject of sanctions and they declined our invitation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">We have complied with the due process requirements set forth in <em>Flaherty. </em>Our order to show cause adequately warned of the possibility of sanctions; we permitted the filing of briefs; and, we conducted a lengthy hearing during which appellant was permitted a full opportunity to present argument on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>C. <em>The Appeal Concerning the Libel Claims Is Frivolous</em></p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">Next, we must determine whether the appeal of the libel claims is frivolous. The standards for determining when an appeal is frivolous was extensively set forth in <em>Flaherty, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d 637. Because the language contained in that opinion is crucial to our determination, we quote from it at length.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\"><em>\u201cThe California cases discussing frivolous appeals provide a starting point for the development of a definition of frivolous. Those cases apply standards that fall into two general categories: subjective and objective. </em>[Citation.] <em>The subjective standard looks to the motives of the appellant and his or her counsel. </em>Thus, in <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Bemis Bros. Bag Co. </em>(1955) 131 Cal.App.2d 378, 382 [280 P.2d 528], the court rejected a claim that an appeal was frivolous, noting that counsel presented his argument in a \u2018courteous and gracious manner\u2019 and seemed to believe \u2018fervently\u2019 that he might succeed on the merits. Similarly, the courts have frequently looked at the \u2018good faith\u2019 of the appellant and have penalized appellants where the only purpose of the appeal was delay. [Citations.]</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\"><em>\u201cThe objective standard looks at the merits of the appeal from a reasonable person\u2019s perspective. </em>\u2018The problem involved in determining whether the appeal is or is not frivolous is not whether [the attorney] acted in the honest belief he had grounds for appeal, but whether any reasonable person would agree that the point is totally and completely devoid of merit, and, therefore, frivolous.\u2019 [Citations.] [f] The two standards are often used together, with one providing evidence of the other. Thus, the total lack of merit of an appeal is viewed as evidence that appellant must have intended it only for delay. [Citations.] [f] Both strands of this definition are relevant to the determination that an appeal is frivolous. An appeal taken for an improper motive represents a time-consuming and disruptive use of the judicial process. Similarly, an appeal taken despite the fact that no reasonable attorney could have thought it meritorious ties up judicial resources and diverts attention from the already burdensome volume of work at the appellate courts. Thus, an appeal should be held to be frivolous only when it is prosecuted for an improper motive\u2014to harass the respondent or delay the effect of an adverse <em>judgment\u2014or when it indisputably has no merit\u2014when any reasonable attorney would agree that the appeal is totally and completely without merit. </em>[Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 649-650.) (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">Here, the appeal of the libel claims is frivolous under the \u201cobjective\u201d standard espoused in <em>Flaherty, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at page 649. No reasonable person would conclude that the libel claims had any merit after the decision in <em>Okun </em>was rendered. In <em>Okun, </em>the sufficiency of the libel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>claims was based on the two letters and the ballot argument. The court stated that \u201c[e]ach of those documents is nonlibelous when read in light of [the] circumstances.\u201d The court further stated that \u201cleave to amend those three [libel] causes should be denied because \u2018there are no circumstances under which an amendment would serve any useful purpose\u2019 [citation] and \u2018speedy resolution of cases involving free speech is desirable\u2019 to avoid \u2018a chilling effect upon the exercise of First Amendment rights\u2019 [citation].\u201d <em>(Okun, supra, </em>29 Cal.3d at p. 460.)</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Facts concerning the criminal investigation were placed in the superior court record sometime in 1980 by appellant itself prior to the hearing on the first demurrer and were part of the record before the Supreme Court in the writ proceedings in <em>Okun. </em>Just because the Supreme Court did not mention this \u201ccriminal investigation\u201d in <em>Okun </em>does not mean that the court failed to consider these facts and then reject them. It is a rare opinion indeed which covers all the points urged by the parties in their briefs or oral argument. Furthermore, after appellant\u2019s petition for rehearing in <em>Okun </em>on the basis of these \u201cnew facts\u201d was denied, no reasonable person would dispute the fact that the libel claims were totally and completely without merit.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">We need not address the question of whether the appeal was partially frivolous on a \u201csubjective\u201d basis, because under <em>Flaherty, </em>if the appeal was objectively frivolous, sanctions could be imposed even if the record fails to demonstrate that the appeal was \u201csubjectively\u201d frivolous. <em>(Flaherty, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at p. 650.)</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">D. <em>Sanctions May Be Awarded When an Appeal Is Partially Frivolous</em></p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">Appellant asserts that even if the libel claims were frivolous, the appeal was not frivolous, because of the existence of other viable causes of action.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>None of the decisions cited by the parties or uncovered by our research has squarely addressed the question of the propriety of sanctions when one or more severable and distinct issues in an appeal is frivolous, but the balance of the appeal has arguable merit. For example, in <em>Custom Craft Carpets, Inc. </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 120 [187 Cal.Rptr. 78], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Beverly Bail Bonds </em>(1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 906 [185 Cal.Rptr. 36], the entire action was determined to be frivolous and sanctions were imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Bank of America </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1942) 20 Cal.2d 697, 702-703 [128 Cal.Rptr. 357], is misplaced. That case is distinguishable because the Supreme Court\u2019s decision did not preclude further amendment of the pleading despite the sustaining of the demurrer to the complaint without leave to amend. The <em>Okun </em>decision, however, leaves <em>no </em>doubt that no further amendments would be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The reference to <em>Anders </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 738, 744 [18 L.Ed.2d 493, 498, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 1400], in <em>Flaherty, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at page 649, is of no assistance to appellant. While it is true that <em>Flaherty </em>cited <em>Anders </em>for the proposition that \u201can appeal is not frivolous if \u2018any of the legal points [are] arguable on their merits\u2019 \u201d <em>(ibid.), </em>the reference to <em>Anders </em>was used in the context of \u201c \u2018whether any reasonable person would agree that the <em>point </em>is totally and completely devoid of merit, and, therefore, frivolous.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d (Ibid.) The use of the word \u201cpoint\u201d rather than the word \u201cappeal\u201d to describe whether the appeal is frivolous would support the proposition that an appeal may be partially frivolous if a point on appeal has no merit and therefore the proper subject of sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">While the entire appeal is not totally frivolous because it challenges the merits of the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the slander and other causes, the appeal is partially frivolous insofar as it attempts to relitigate the libel claims which were conclusively decided in <em>Okun.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">Sanctions for an appeal which is partially frivolous are appropriate if the frivolous claims are a <em>significant </em>and <em>material </em>part of the appeal. Here the libel claims are not only significant and material but such claims are severable and distinct from the other causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">In imposing sanctions, we are well aware of the strong public policy in favor of the peaceful resolution of disputes in our courts and that attorneys must not be deterred from pursuing their client\u2019s remedies for fear of sanctions against them and/or their clients. Nevertheless, \u201cthe practice of penalizing frivolous appeals reflects a fear that irresponsible litigants may abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>their right of access to the judicial system.\u201d <em>(Flaherty, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at p. 648.)</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">E. <em>The Amount of Sanctions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Counsel for respondents Harris and Ruden estimated that 50 percent of his time on this appeal or $9,500 is allocable to the libel causes of action. Counsel for respondent Okun also estimates that 50 percent of the 145 hours he devoted in defending this appeal on behalf of his clients were allocable to the libel claims. These estimates were submitted prior to the hearing on our order to show cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">In determining the amount of sanctions, we have considered the following factors: the nature and extent of the libel claims on appeal and the conclusive holding in <em>Okun </em>(see <em>Beckstead </em>v. <em>International Industries, Inc. </em>(1982) 127 Cal.App.3d 927, 934 [179 Cal.Rptr. 767]); the protracted length of this litigation and the delay in the resolution of the appeal (see <em>Hersch </em>v. <em>Citizens Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>(1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 1002, 1012 [194 Cal.Rptr. 628] and <em>Miller </em>v. <em>R. K. A. Management Corp. </em>(1979) 99 Cal.App.3d 460, 469 [160 Cal.Rptr. 164]; the chilling effect that appellant\u2019s actions have had on the respondents\u2019 first amendment rights and the electoral process, the relative costs of legal counsel for respondents in addressing the frivolous claims on appeal (see <em>Wax </em>v. <em>Infante </em>(1983) 145 Cal.App.3d 1029, 1031 [194 Cal.Rptr. 14]); the undue burden on the legal system and consumption of this court\u2019s time (see <em>Custom Craft Carpets, Inc. </em>v. <em>Miller, supra, </em>137 Cal.App.3d 120, 125); and the need to deter this type of conduct in the future (see <em>Kapelus </em>v. <em>Newport Equity Funds, Inc. </em>(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 1, 9 [194 Cal.Rptr. 893]). After weighing all of these factors, we have determined that an appropriate sanction in the form of a penalty of $20,000 is suitable and appropriate in view of appellant\u2019s use of this court to relitigate a settled question.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">The opening brief of appellant and Levy &amp; Norminton filed in response to our order to show cause states that <em>\u201cIf, Against All The Evidence, Appellant\u2019s Contentions Are Found To Be Frivolous, The Responsibility Is Solely That Of Appellant\u2019s Counsel, </em>[f] The Order to Show Cause suggests that the Court is considering the imposition of sanctions against both Appellant and its counsel. Although we believe that sanctions cannot be justified in any case, the accompanying declarations make it clear that any sanctionable conduct was solely counsel\u2019s. <em>Norminton Decl., </em>1\u00a1 15; <em>Mahboubi Decl., </em>ff 3-7. Appellant relied on its counsel\u2019s advice, and it should not be punished for having done so.\u201d (Italics in original.) We interpret this statement in said brief to suggest that Levy &amp; Norminton should be sanctioned and not appellant. We shall therefore impose sanctions on counsel. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>opinion is a written statement of our reasons for imposing sanctions as required by <em>Flaherty.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">III<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">\n<em>The Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in Sustaining the Demurrers Without Leave To Amend</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">Appellant finally urges that the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrers to all of the causes of action without leave to amend. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">The superior court was, of course, precluded from allowing an amendment to the causes of action based on libel by the authority of <em>Okun, supra, </em>29 Cal.3d at p. 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">As to the remaining causes of action, denial of leave to amend was appropriate. Although great liberality should be exercised in permitting a plaintiff to amend <em>(LeMoge Electric </em>v. <em>County of San Mateo </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 659, 664 [297 P.2d 638]), an amendment should not be allowed where it would not serve any useful purpose. <em>(Routh </em>v. <em>Quinn </em>(1942) 20 Cal.2d 488, 493-494 [127 P.2d 1, 149 A.L.R. 215].)</p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">As to the causes of action based on civil rights statutes and interference with economic advantage, there are no circumstances under which an amendment to the complaint could state a cause of action under the theories proffered in the absence of state action.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-11\">The question of whether appellant should have been allowed to amend the slander cause of action raises a closer question. Over the vigorous objection of three justices, the majority in <em>Okun, supra, </em>gave appellant the opportunity to amend its cause of action in slander after determining that the allegation that Councilman Stone entered into a \u201ccorrupt\u201d relationship with appellant was not slanderous in context of a political debate. The court noted the \u201cpossibility\u201d of an appropriate amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-12\">The trial court determined, and we agree, that appellant\u2019s new attempt to amend the complaint did not result in a substantial change from the allega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>tion which was held to be nonactionable in <em>Okun, supra, 29 </em>Cal.3d at pages 459-460.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Appellant then asked the trial court for leave to file a third amendment stating that it is prepared to allege that respondents \u201cexpressly charged that Maple \u2018bribed\u2019 Stone.\u201d The trial court denied the request for a new leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">While we might be disposed to grant an additional leave to amend in a usual tort case, we are mindful that the present case seeks to inhibit fundamental First Amendment rights. Where such precious rights are involved, \u201cspeedy resolution of cases ... is desirable\u201d to avoid a chilling effect upon the exercise of free speech. <em>(Good Government Group of Seal Beach, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 672, 685 [150 Cal.Rptr. 258, 586 P.2d 572].)</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">This action is directed at citizens who were lawfully working through the political process. Respondents have been required to defend this case for nearly five years, presumably at private expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">The wisdom of Justice Mosk\u2019s dissent in <em>Okun, supra, 29 </em>Cal.3d 442, seems particularly compelling in view of the passage of time in this case. \u201c[T]here comes a time when the finality of litigation is almost as important as the decision therein. In the preservation of the free exercise of speech, writing and the political function, the early termination of this lawsuit is highly desirable. We should discourage attempts to recover through the judicial process what has been lost in the political process. \u201d <em>(Id., </em>atp. 461.)</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">At this late date, appellant has exploited the resources of the trial and appellate courts and the defendants sufficiently. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant the opportunity to begin again.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b731-11\">The judgment of dismissal is affirmed. Respondents are awarded their costs on appeal. In addition, sanctions are imposed against appellant\u2019s counsel, Levy &amp; Norminton, in the sum of $20,000, $10,000 each payable to respondent Okun and to respondents Harris and Ruden jointly.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-12\">Danielson, J., and Arabian, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-13\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied October 4, 1984. Kaus, J., did not participate therein. Bird, C. J., and Mosk, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b720-14\"> Appellant erroneously asserts that the Supreme Court expressly permitted amendment of both the fourth and sixth causes of action. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision only permitted amendment of the sixth cause of action. <em>(Okun, supra, </em>29 Cal.3d at p. 460.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The letter reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-6\">\u201cSetting the Record Straight</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-7\">\u201cThe article regarding a controversial land swap between the Beverly Hills City Council and a developer of luxury condominiums (\u2018Land Swap Stirs Up Beverly Hills\u2019 by Sam Kaplan, Dec. 26) missed the point entirely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-8\">\u201cTo set the record straight:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-9\">\u201cWhile the area in contention adjacent to Beverly Hills\u2019 civic center\u2014is known as the industrial area, it also houses the city\u2019s vital municipal services facilities. It is the site of the city\u2019s refuse transfer station, vehicle maintenance garages and all the other indispensable operations that make a city function. It is also the site of a water treatment plant that the city council abandoned in 1976.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-10\">\u201cThis action was followed by the council\u2019s abandoning the city\u2019s own water wells in the midst of the recent drought. It was this incredible move that caused a number of citizens to become suspicious of the council\u2019s motives. Beverly Hills residents were thus forced to become completely dependent upon one very expensive source of water, that supplied by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. Even the MWD\u2019s general manager advised the city against this decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-11\">\u201cNevertheless, this was done despite the fact that in 1974 the voters of Beverly Hills had passed, by a two-thirds majority, a $3.75 million bond issue to refurbish the city\u2019s water wells and treatment facilities. The only council member opposed to the bond issue and retention of the city\u2019s wells was Richard Stone, an attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-12\">\u201cMysteriously, one week after the voters approved the refurbishing of their water system, the city announced that its cost projections to revitalize the wells were $5 million short. Amazingly, a year later the claim went to $12 million more than the voter-approved bonds. But, without asking the voters again, in December, 1976, the council closed down the wells and sold off the land on which they were located.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-13\">\u201cNot until April 12, 1977, did Richard Stone, at that time the mayor of Beverly Hills, reveal that David Rowen, representing a developer, had become a client of Stone\u2019s. The abandoned treatment plant is now earmarked for the developers in a landswap deal.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b721-14\">The letter provided in pertinent part as follows: \u201cAre we going to become a contract city, beholden to outside vendors? [1] Where will our water come from when we are totally at the mercy of the MWD and rates treble and we are in a drought worse than the recent one? [1] Why are we trading land which we should be buying\u2014like other cities that are landbanking for the future? [f] But the even larger question is who will gain from this plan? The majority of residents, or the very few individuals with a vested interest in the condominium project? [1] And what about all the ambiguous promises to the senior citizens? The 100-unit housing promise is a blatant, political carrot in return for their dedicated support. [1] Can you honestly tell the folks there really will be such a building for them exclusively? What will the costs be? $300 a month? $650? Who will determine those with highest priority? How can you restrict entry to city residents only, if state and federal money is involved? And what about the hundreds and hundreds of needy, Beverly Hills seniors who will be left out?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b721-15\">The statement provided as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b721-16\">\u201cArgument Against Proposition B</p>\n<p id=\"b721-17\">\u201cBeverly Hills has only one Industrial Area to sustain us as an independent city. <em>We must keep it for our community needs and not allow it to be zoned away.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b721-18\">\n<em>\u201cVote No on Proposition B.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b721-19\">\u201cWe need a place for police cars, carpentry and paint shops, city truck maintenance, park equipment, trash disposal, water facilities and other lifeline services essential to our community.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-20\">\u201cThese indispensable city services enable Beverly Hills to operate efficiently and at low cost. They must be contained in the Industrial Area for they are unpleasant neighbors. <em>We </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number><em>cannot afford to allow developers to take over the only suitable location within our city for these vital needs.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">\u201cEvery citizen approved General Plan designated this land to be saved for municipal and service use. The developers hired one of our Councilmen, subsequently the Fair Political Practices Commission ruled the Councilman had a conflict of interest. The General Plan was changed drastically to accommodate the developer\u2019s desires, ignoring residents\u2019 needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">\u201cThe Council violated the recommendation of their own consultant and the Council-appointed citizens committees when it voted this rezoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">\u201cThis Scheme Will Cost the Taxpayers Millions. Rubbish disposal has to be moved, street intersections redesigned, businesses relocated, city services put underground, all at prohibitive costs to taxpayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-11\">\u201cOnly the Developers Benefit From This Rezoning. They will sell condominiums at up to $1,000,000.00 each, which the taxpayers will subsidize. They will get city maintained landscaping. By the Council\u2019s own admission, these luxury condominiums will cost the city more to service than revenues they will produce.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-12\">\u201cSenior Housing is being used as a deceptive cover for this \u201cEnrich the Developers\u201d scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-13\"><em>\u201cDon\u2019t jeopardize our city\u2019s futurel </em>Vote No on Proposition B.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-14\">\u201cJoann Ruden, President League of Women Voters of Beverly Hills</p>\n<p id=\"b722-15\">Betty H.
