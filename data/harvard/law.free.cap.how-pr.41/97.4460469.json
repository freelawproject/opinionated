Wolff has been sick for some time. Draft presented a number of times; promised to pay <em>1 </em>soon.\u2019 On last presentation, Mr. W. was found to have failed in business, and says it is impossible for him to pay. M. L. Doherty, <em>Agent.\"</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-8\">On\u2019the trial of this cause, a clerk of the plaintiffs testified that between the time when he left the draft with the defendants, and the time when the same was returned to the plaintiffs, he called \u00e1 number of times at the office of the defendants, and inquired about the draft or the money, but was always informed that they had not heard from it, and that they would write to their agents in Memphis in regard to the matter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-9\">This was contradicted by the evidence of a clerk in defendants\u2019 employ.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-10\">The court instructed the jury that if they believed-the testimony of plaintiffs\u2019 clerk, the plaintiffs would be entitled to recover the full amount of the draft.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-11\">To this charge defendant\u2019s counsel excepted, as also to the refusal of the court to charge that upon the evidence the plaintiffs were entitled to recover only nominal damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-12\">The jury, thereupon, found a verdict for the plaintiffs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>for the full amount of the draft, with interest from its date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-5\">The defendants appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b105-6\">Blatchford, Seward <em>and </em>Da Costa, <em>for defendants and appellants.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b105-7\">T.

J. Steam Nav. Co., </em>11 <em>N. Y., </em>485 ; <em>Bissell </em>agt. <em>N. Y. Central R. R. Co., </em>25 <em>N. Y., 445; Belger </em>agt. Dinsmore, 34 <em>How., </em>421.)</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">Assuming, but without deciding, that the defendants in \u2022this action could not thus limit their responsibility, or if they could, that the plaintiffs are correct in their views, and that the defendants, by their subsequent acts, must be deemed to have waived the conditions in the receipt, which they claim, exempts them from all liability for the negligence \u2022of the Southern Express Company, to which they transferred the draft, and that they are estopped from saying that they passed the same over to said company, still I do not see how this judgment can be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">It was admitted by the plaintiffs in their complaint, and also by a certain stipulation signed by their attorney, and read on the trial, that within a few days after the delivery \u2022of the draft to the defendants, and as soon as the same could be transmitted to Memphis, to wit, on or about the 31st \u2022day of Deoember, 1866, and repeatedly thereafter, the agent \u2022of the Southern Express Company presented said draft for payment to the drawee; that payment thereof was repeat- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>- edly demanded, and that the said drawee neglected and refused to pay, although he repeatedly promised to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">It thus appears to be conceded by the plaintiffs themselves, that the defendants did all that could possibly be asked or required of them in regard to transmitting the draft to Memphis, and presenting the same to and demanding payment thereof from the drawee.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Now, the evidence on the part of the plaintiffs shows, that they never requested the defendants to return the draft, nor did they surrender the receipt and pay the charges, all of which was necessary, according to the terms of one of the clauses in the receipt, before the defendants could be required to return the said draft, and it may, therefore, be\" questionable whether they were bound to do so. <em>(Newstadt </em>agt. <em>Adams, </em>5 <em>Duer, </em>13 ; <em>Manhattan Oil Company agt. Camden Railroad, </em>5 <em>Abb., N. S., </em>289 ; <em>Bostwick </em>agt. <em>The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, </em>55 <em>Barb., </em>137.)</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">'However that may be\u2014for, as already intimated, there are also authorities to the contrary\u2014it is quite clear that the defendants should, at least, h\u00e1ve given due notice to the plaintiffs of the non-payment of the draft, and not having done so, they must be held liable to the plaintiffs for all damages sustained by them by reason of their negligence. But it seems to me that before the plaintiffs can recover more than mere nominal damages, they must show that they could, in all probability, have collected the amount of the draft, or some part thereof, from the drawee, if they had. received the notice of non-payment, which the defendants\u2019 duty in the premises, required them to give. <em>(Allen </em>agt. <em>Suydam, </em>20 <em>Wend., </em>327 <em>to </em>331.)</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">The defendants having used due diligence in endeavoring to obtain payment of the draft and having failed, the plaintiffs must show that they could have done better, and that there was at least, a reasonable probability that they could' have collected the amount of the draft, if they had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>properly notified that the same was not paid, before they are entitled to recover the full amount thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">But having done that, I think they would be <em>prima facie </em>entitled to a verdict or judgment for that amount, and the onus would then be upon the defendants to prove, that the real loss or damages sustained by the plaintiffs, in consequence of the negligence imputed to them was not the whole amount of the draft. There is not a particle of evidence in the case to show that payment of this draft or any part thereof, could have been obtained, either by legal proceedings or otherwise, between the time when it was first presented to the drawee for payment and the time when the plaintiffs were notified of its non-payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">From the facts and circumstances of the case, the probabilities seem to me to be all the other way.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">In my opinion, the jury should have been charged as the \u25a0chancellor thought they should have been instructed in <em>Allen </em>agt. <em>Suydam (supra), </em>viz.: that upon the evidence the plaintiffs were only entitled to nominal damages; or at least they should have been told to find only such damages as they should from the evidence believe it probable that the plaintiffs might have sustained by reason of the delay of the defendants in notifying them of the non-payment of the draft.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">The judgment should be reversed and a new trial ordered, -costs to abide event.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">Larremore, J.\u2014Concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
