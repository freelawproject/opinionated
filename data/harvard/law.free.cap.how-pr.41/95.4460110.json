Waterman, 4 <em>How., </em>313; <em>St. John agt. West, </em>4 <em>How., </em>329; <em>Bedell </em>agt. <em>Stickles, </em>4 <em>How., </em>433; <em>Salters </em>agt. <em>Genin, </em>10 <em>Abb., </em>478, 19 <em>How., </em>233.)</p>\n<p id=\"b101-13\">Nor does the order, as made, affect a substantial right, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>for a party cannot be said to have a substantial right to what- a court has a discretion to grant or withhold. The legislature must have intended, by a substantial right, a fixed, determined right, independent of the discretion of the court, and of some value. Such a right must exist, and be injuriously affected by an order, to bring a case within the third subdivision of sec. 349 of the Code. <em>(Tollman </em>agt. <em>Hinman, </em>10 <em>How., </em>90.)</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The appeal should be dismissed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Monell, J.\u2014I concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Spencer, J.\u2014I concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
