Lindsley and Isaac B. Cottrell agt. The European Petroleum Company.</parties>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b62-8\"><em>Before </em>Ingraham, P. <em>J., </em>Barnard <em>and </em>Brady, <em>JJ.</em></p>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-9\">This was an action brought to recover the amount of thirteen promissory notes, made by the European Petroleum Company to the order of L. E. Lahens and indorsed by said Lahens to the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-12\">Upon the trial before a referee, the defendants\u2019 counsel proposed to open the case, and insisted on his right so to do, on the ground that the burden of the proof was on the defendants, and that the affirmative was with them. The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel objected and claimed that he was entitled to open and close the case. \u25a0 \u2022</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b63-5\">Frederic R. Coudert, <em>counsel for appellant,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-8\">I. The defendants specifically admitted all the facts in the \u2022complaint contained, that were necessary to the recovery of plaintiffs, viz.: \u201c Themaking, indorsement,, transfer, delivery \u2022andnon-payment\u201d of the notes in suit. The subsequent denial was manifestly intended to dispute the lawfulness of the \u2022claim and nothing more. If the affirmative defense in the \u2022answer was established on the trial, then the plaintiffs were not the lawful owners of the notes in suit, and the defendants were not justly indebted on the notes. If no affirmative defense was proven, then the plaintiffs were entitled to judgment without any proof whatever.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b63-11\">George C. Genet, <em>attorney, and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>James C. Carter, <em>counsel for </em>respondent,</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\"><p id=\"b62-6\">Where an answer admits the making and delivery of a promissory note and sets-up an affirmative defense, the affirmative is with the defendant who is entitled to open and close the case, and the refusal of the court to allow him so to do, is error, for which judgment will be reversed and a new trial ordered.</p><p id=\"b62-7\"><em>First District, General Term, January, </em>1871.</p><p id=\"b62-10\">The answer of the defendants was as follows: \u201cThe defendants came into court and answering the complaint of plaintiffs, admit the making, indorsement, transfer and delivery of the said notes, and deny the other allegations therein contained,\u201d and then proceeded to set forth an affirmative defense.</p><p id=\"b62-13\">The referee decided that the plaintiff was entitled to open and close the case, to which decision defendants\u2019 counsel excepted. The counsel for plaintiffs, thereupon opened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>the case, produced the promissory notes mentioned in the complaint and rested. The referee having decided in favor of plaintiffs, the defendants appealed to the general term upon the foregoing and other exceptions.</p><p id=\"b63-6\">Argued as follows on the point above suggested.</p><p id=\"b63-7\">The referee erred in his ruling to the effect, that the plaintiffs were entitled to open and close.</p><p id=\"b63-9\">II. It being clear that the affirmative was with the defendants, we submit that the error of the learned referee in denying them their right to open and close, is a subject of review by the appellate court, and that the defendants on this .ground alone, are entitled to a new trial. <em>(Huntington </em>agt. <em>Conkey, approved in </em>31 <em>N. Y., </em>614; 33 <em>Barb., </em>218; <em>citing Davis </em>agt. <em>Mason, </em>4 <em>Peck, </em>158; <em>Brooks </em>agt. <em>Barrett, </em>7 <em>Peck, </em>98 ; 8 <em>Metcalf, </em>64; 7 <em>Cush., </em>563; <em>Rolum </em>agt. <em>Hanson, </em>11 <em>Cush., </em>44; <em>Hoxie </em>agt. <em>Green, </em>37 <em>How., </em>97.)</p><p id=\"AeM\">ITT. Nor is it for the defendant to show that the error of the referee prejudiced him. It is for the plaintiff to prove \u2022.the negative of that proposition. <em>(Greene </em>agt. <em>White, </em>37 <em>N. Y., </em>384.)</p><p id=\"b64-5\">Argued that the denial of \u201c <em>all other allegations </em>\u201d was sufficient to entitle plaintiffs to the affirmative, and moreover, that it was a question within the discretion of the referee, and his ruling thereon would not be reviewed.</p><p id=\"b64-6\">After argument, the court declined to look into the other exceptions in the case, and held that the referee erred in not allowing defendants to open and close \u00abthe case, and reversed the judgment accordingly.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
