An insolvent, although having assets, and those assets having been duly surrendered to the assignee, bnt not amounting to the required fifty per cent, of the claims proven against his estate, is not entitled to a certificate of conformity, unless the bankrupt, before, on, or at the time of hearing of the application for discharge, tender or file the assent in writing of a majority in number and value of hia creditors to whom he shall have become liable as principal debtor, and who shall have proved their claims, as required by \u00a7 33 of the bankrupt act as-amended. In case an involuntary bankrupt does not tender or file the assent of his creditors, or show payment of his debts by the return of the assignee, ok that his property and effects equal or will pay fifty per cent., so as to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 33 of the bankrupt act as amended, the certificate of conformity cannot be granted.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-7\">\n<em>Southern District, New York.</em>\n</p>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b412-8\"><em>Before </em>John Fitch, <em>Register.</em></p>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-9\">This is a proceeding in involuntary bankruptcy. The-proceedings in the cause are regular, and according to law,., up to and including the return of the order to show cause why the above named bankrupt should not be discharged according to law. Several creditors, who have duly proved their respective claims, have filed notice of their appearance by their respective attorneys, and have a right to file specifications of their grounds of opposition to the discharge of said bankrupt within the time prescribed by the act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-10\">By the schedule, it appears that the debts from which-the bankrupt seeks to be discharged, were contracted since-January 1st, 1869, which brings this case within the provisions of the amendment to \u00a7 33 of the bankrupt act, approved July 2?th, 1868, which reads as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>\u201cThat the provisions of second clause of the\" 33d section of said act, shall not apply to the cases of proceedings in bankruptcy, commenced prior to the first day of January, 1869, and the time during which the operation of the provisions of said clause is postponed, shall be extended until said first day of January 1869. And said clause as amended July 14th, 1870, reads as follows: \u201cIn all proceedings in bankruptcy commenced after the first day of January, 1869, no discharge shall be granted to a debtor whose assets shall not be equal to fifty per centum of the claims proved against his estate upon which he shall be liable as the principal debtor, unless the assent in writing of a majority in number and value of his creditors to whom he shall have become liable as principal debtor, and who shall have-proved their claims, be filed in the case at or before the time of the hearing of the application for discharge.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-5\">Several creditors have duly proved their claims, amounting in the aggregate to the sum of $32,063 08 and the assets to $10,000, as appears by the certificate of the assignee. The bankrupt has not shown that his assets equal in value, since the adjudication of bankruptcy, fifty per cent, of the debts proved against his estate, as required by law, or that they will do so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-6\">Counsel for the bankrupt upon all the proceedings in the case, applies for the usual certificate of conformity. He does not offer or tender the assent in writing of a majority of his creditors who have proved their claims, nor any of them, as is required-by' said \u00a733 neither does he ask for an adjournment of the order to show cause, but applies for a .discharge and the usual certificate of conformity, and claims as &gt; a matter of law that said \u00a7 33 is not applicable to an involuntary case, and only applies to voluntary bankruptcy, and that he is entitled to the certificate of conformity without filing proof that his assets equal fifty per cent., or filing the assent of a majority of his creditors, both in number and value, as required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>by law. That the bankrupt, being an involuntary bankrupt, has the same right to apply, under \u00a7 33 as amended in 1868, for a discharge as if he was a voluntary bankrupt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-5\">That he having been declared a bankrupt by this court, and having delivered up all his property and effects, both real and personal, to the assignee, he is entitled (the assignee not opposing) to his discharge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-6\">That any other construction of \u00a733 might be the means of transforming the statute from a liberal one to a very harsh one, inasmuch as it might put it into the power of a few of the principal creditors to utterly preclude the bankrupt from obtaining a discharge, although he had in good faith surrendered all his effects to the assignee, and that in this case the bankrupt is entitled to his discharge without the consent of a majority of his creditors, or the payment of fifty per cent in value, as required by \u00a7 33. The bankrupt, by his counsel, not only declined to ask for but positively refused an adjournment of the order to show cause to some future day, which I was wjlling to grant in order that if the district court decides, that said assent was necessary, the same, if possible might be obtained. The bankrupt claims that he can apply at any future time for - permission t\u00f3 file the assent of his creditors to his discharge, and that his failure to do so on the return day of the order to show cause, does not prejudice any of the proceedings already had, and may show assets equal to fifty per cent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-7\">I certify that in the course of the proceedings in this cause now pending^ before me, the following questions arose pertinent to said proceedings, and were stated and agreed to by counsel for the bankrupt, and also by counsel for creditors, and requested the usual certificate to the distict court:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-8\">I.

Is the thirty-third section of the bankrupt act as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>amended July 27th, 1868, and July 14th, 1870, applicable to proceedings in involuntary bankruptcy ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-5\">III. Can an involuntary bankrupt whose assets have been surrendered to the assignee, but without proof that the assets equal or \u00e1mount to fifty per cent, of the amount proved against his estate, be discharged without the assent of a majority in number and value of\" his creditors, who have, proved their debts, &amp;c., as required by said \u00a7 33 of the bankrupt act as amended, having neen filed in the case at or before the time of the hearing of the application for discharge ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-6\">IV. Can the certificate of conformity be granted in an involuntary case, when the assets do not equal fifty per cent, of the claims proved, which accrued subsequent to January 1st, 1869, and the bankrupt does not file an assent of the majority of his creditors who have proved their claims, &amp;c., as required by the aforesaid section of the bankrupt act as amended ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-7\">V. Can a bankrupt who neither pays the fifty per cent., and who does not prove that his assets equal or amount to that sum, and who does not tender or file the required assent, apply again for a discharge under and by virtue of the order to show cause, unless the return day of the order to show cause has been adjourned ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-8\">The bankrupt act prescribes a particular and specific code of procedure or practice which the bankrupt must comply with before the question as to whether he is entitled to a discharge can be entertained by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-9\">In this case the bankrupt has complied with all the requirements of the bankrupt act, with the exception of paying fifty per cent, of the amount of debts proved against his estate, or showing that they equal or amount to fifty per cent, or filing an assent in writing of a majority in number and value of his creditors who have proved their debts to his discharge, without regard to the percentage which may be realized from his estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>That \u00a7 33 of'the bankrupt act expressly provides that a bankrupt may be discharged if he files such an assent on or before the return day of the order to show cause why he should not be discharged ; consequently, if he fails so to do, and his estate does not equal or amount to fifty per cent, of the debts proved, the court cannot entertain his motion or application for a discharge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-5\">From the scope and tenor of the bankrupt act it appears to have been founded upon the idea and principle, that unfortunate debtors should be released from their pecuniary contracts (except those fraudulently contracted) by a general law, in conformity to article one, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of the United States. Such a general law is the bankrupt act of Congress, approved March 2d, 1867. Involuntary bankruptcy did not originate with the act of Congress approved March 2d, 1867, as the State of New York has for years her statute enactments, whereby imprisoned and insolvent debtors were discharged both from imprisonment and from their debts ; the act entitled, \u201c an act to abolish imprisonment for debt, and \"to punish fraudulent debtors,\u201d passed April 26th, 1831, and the several acts amending the same; the Massachusett insolvent laws, the' English bankrupt act, together with \u00a7 1 of the bankrupt law of 1841, which act of 1841 took effect February 1st, 1842, resembled, in this particular, the English bankrupt act (6 <em>George IV, </em>16).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-6\">By the act of 1841, it was provided that any person so declared a bankrupt at the instance of any creditor, may petition the court, &amp;c., and upon complying with the provisions of the act of 1841, was discharged in the same manner as the insolvent who applied by petition, from all debts which <em>u </em>shall not have been created in consequence of a defalcation as a public officer, or as executor, administrator, guardian or trustee, or while acting in any fiduciary capacity.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-7\">The practice as to the commencement of proceedings under the act of 1841, and also under the act of 1867 were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>different in voluntary and involuntary cases up to the adju dication ; then they were united in both manner and form of procedure, and to the manner of application for discharge. In this district, under the act of 1867, both class of cases have uniformly been granted the same relief, no distinction having been made. The inference is fair, that had Congress intended to take, by virtue of \u00a7 39 of the bankrupt act, the property of an insolvent, dividing it among his creditors and not have afforded him any relief and denying him a discharge, similar to the one given to a voluntary bankrupt from his debts, that an express provision refusing such a discharge would have been contained in the eact. But we are not left to doubt or conjecture on that point, neither must we decide the question by implication, as \u00a7 32 of the' act of 1867, in providing for a discharge under and by virtue bf the act, uses the words, l&lt; the bankrupt,\u201d thus, by the ordinary acceptation of the words, includes both a voluntary and involuntary bankrupt. The discharge in form, as set forth in \u00a7 32 of the act of 1867, in describing the bankrupt, also in reciting the proceedings had, uses the words, <em>\u201c </em>on which day the petition for adjudication was filed by or against him,\u201d the words \u201c or against \u201d are in parenthesis, thereby clearly indicating that the-words <em>\u201c </em>or against\u201d were put in the act for the express purpose of showing that a person against whom a petition in bankruptcy had been filed was entitled to a discharge the same as one by whom a petition had been filed by himself. \u2022 The words, <em>u </em>on his own application,\u201d when taken in connection with ^ 36 and 37, all seem to tend to the conclusion, that after the adjudication, the practice and relief, as to both voluntary and involuntary proceedings, should be the same, subject, however, to the provisions of \u00a7 39 of the act. <em>In re Clark, </em>(3 <em>B. R., </em>3), <em>and in re Dibblee </em>(2 <em>B, R. </em>185), seems to be decisive on this point, and is in accordance with the uniform practice of the United States district courts throughout the United States. An involuntary as well as a voluntary bankrupt may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>apply for a discharge <em>(Grazzam on Bankruptcy, 2d ed., </em>134; <em>Bump on Bankruptcy, 3d ed., </em>214).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-5\">It was the avowed determination of congress, in passing the bankrupt act, to destroy and eradicate the unjust, oppressive and improper system which had become so prevalent, and an evil too grevious for honest men to bear, by which insolvent debtors could, under state laws, pay whom they choose, and cheat and defraud all others. By means \u25a0of confessions of judgment, conveying, transferring real \u00abestate or assignments, mortgages on real and personal pro\u00aberty, and other means, prefer their friends, and render the administration of the laws for the collection of debts, a mere farce. But now all is changed since the passage of the bankrupt act, which has suspended the state insolvent laws, <em>ipso </em>facfo, as soon as it took effect. ( <em>Commonwealth </em>agt. <em>O'Hara, B. R. sup. </em>9; <em>Van Nostrand </em>agt. <em>Carr, 2 B. R., </em>154; <em>Perry </em>agt. <em>Langley, 1 B. R., </em>155; <em>Martin </em>agt. <em>Berry, 2 B. R., </em>188 ; <em>Conner </em>agt. <em>Miller, et al., </em>1 <em>B. R., </em>98). No preference \u2022can be given to relatives or friends; each creditor who proves a claim shares with the other creditors, all receiving their <em>pro rata </em>share alike.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-6\">This is just and equitable, and in accordance with the true principles of justice and equity, of which all honest men approve.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-7\">The views of the bankrupt\u2019s counsel in this case are not \u25a0sound. Bankrupts are no worse off if their property is equally divided, than they would be if (as in this case) it had been taken on execution by a creditor, upon a judgment in a state court. It is better for the bankrupt that his property be equally distributed, and he be discharged by assent of his creditors, (as he probably would be) for creditors are usually lenient when an insolvent is honest, (and usually sign the assent to his discharge when requested to do so), than to be left hopelessly insolvent, and not relieved by the decree of this couit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-8\">I fail to see any just or valid ground upon which a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>bankrupt can be discharged without complying with the requirements of \u00a7 33 as amended ; and I also fail to see any legal grounds upon which the case, <em>(Repplier </em>agt. <em>Bloodgood, </em>1 Sweeny, 34), was decided. The court in that case held, that , an involuntary bankrupt could not apply for a discharge, and says: Section 35 of the act, declares void all securities or contracts made or given in order to induce any creditor to forbear opposing the application for discharge of the bankrupt. But in this involuntary proceeding, taken by a creditor against the bankrupt, there is not, nor can there be any application for discharge of the bankrupt. The statute provides no method or means whereby a bankrupt can apply for a discharge in a proceeding hostile to him, instituted by a creditor. In this respect, as well as others, the United States law differs from the English bankrupt statutes.\u201d In this respect Judge Fithian, who delivered the opinion of the court, mistook the tenor and effect of the English bankrupt law in proceedings to be taken for the discharge of the bankrupt, and in any proceedings which may be instituted against a bankrupt under the English bankruptcy act of 1869, must be had under 48 and 49 of the act, whether the proceedings have been instituted by or against a bankrupt, and are similar to the proceeding under $ 33 of the bankrupt act, part 1, adjudication in bankruptcy, of the English bankrupt act of 1869. (32 <em>and </em>33, <em>Vict, C. </em>71).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-6\">\u201cAn act to consolidate and amend the law of bankruptcy\u201d contains similar provisions in regard to proceedings in cases of involuntary bankruptcy, &amp;c., to sections 39 and 40 of our bankrupt act. The English bankrupt act applies for the most part to cases of involuntary bankruptcy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-7\">In \u00a7 33 of the bankrupt act as amended, the following words occur, to wit: \u201cIn all proceedings in bankruptcy.\u201d It is difficult to perceive how a court can construe that sentence so as to annul and ignore the word \u201c all,\u201d and confine the privilege of a discharge to voluntary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>bankrupts alone. The section, as a whole, and the sentence aforesaid, is unmistakable and precludes the idea of any distinction between voluntary and involuntary proceedings, or that it denies to the involuntary bankrupt the relief afforded to the voluntary bankrupt. That would be a hardship, and leave the bankrupt, where the state laws do, an insolvent, after the taking of his' property by execution, and deny him the relief afforded by the bankrupt act, which was intended as a palliation for the harsh remedy of involuntary bankruptcy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-5\">The bankrupt act is two fold in its operations, it being an insolvent as well as a bankrupt act. It has the same scope and effect as an insolvent law as the state acts had, and acts upon the same cases and persons, suspending the state insolvent laws as per article 6, section <em>2 </em>of the Constitution of the United States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-6\">An involuntary bankrupt has few, if any, of the equities in his favor which can be claimed by a voluntary bankrupt. One of the elements of fraud in bankrupt proceedings, as set forth by Judge Blatchford, <em>in re Lowenstein, (2 B. R., </em>99), is, that the involuntary bankrupt has not done what he should have done, <em>i. e., </em>filed his petition in bankruptcy. The law, by adjudicating him bankrupt, has determined his status, and by virtue of such adjudication he has been forced to do what he should have done of his own free will. That his property has been taken forcibly only shows that the law has been compelled to. use force to compel him to do his duty. The bankrupt cannot question the propriety or justice of the law in having compelled him to do his duty. Instead of its being a reason in favor of, it is rather a reason against his discharge. As the law magnanimously overlooks his delinquency in not filing his petition\u2014as the law requires\u2014and provides that he may, nevertheless, receive a discharge, if he will only comply with the same terms that are required of a voluntary bank rupt, he should gladly comply with and accept the same, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>not as a right, but as a favor granted him, thus giving him a legal, but not a moral, release from his pecuniary obligations. It has ever been a cardinal rule of moral honesty, that a debtor cannot be released from a moral obligation to pay a debt, except upon the payment of the same, or in some way or manner satisfying the creditor; nothing else can exonerate the conscience of the debtor, or discharge the moral obligation created by contracts between man and his fellow-man.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-5\">I am clearly of the opinion that if an adjournment is not had upon the return day of the order to show cause, &amp;c.,: no further proceedings can be had under or by virtue of that order; and if, upon that day, the bankrupt fails to show the payment of the fifty per cent., or that his property and effects were equal to fifty per. cent, of the claims proved against his estate, upon which he shall have become, liable as principal debtor upon the debts created since January 1st, 1869, or unless the assent in writing of a majority in number and value of his creditors to whom he shall have become liable as principal debtor, and who shall have proved their claims,. be filed in the case at or before the time of the hearing of the application for discharge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-6\">In construing and administering the act, courts should be . guided by the judicial decisions and precedents founded upon the enactments of a similar nature, by the courts of England and of the various states of the United States; also follow the rules as laid down in the elementary works upon the construction of statutes. In doing so they give form, force and solidity to judicial proceedings, as well as carry out the evident intention of the lawmakers. Any other rule would create the most interminable confusion, conflict of authority and of decisions,\u2014the same as have arisen under the ill-digested and unintelligible code of procedure of this state\u2014 and entail upon the whole country the curses inflicted by \"the code of procedure, and the conflicting decisions thereon by the courts of this state, a calamity which all who are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>required to construe and administer the bankrupt act should endeavor to avoid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-5\">I.
