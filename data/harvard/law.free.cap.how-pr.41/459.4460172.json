Brady, J.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<attorneys id=\"b471-12\">J. M. Scribner, Jr., attorney, <em>and </em>A. R. Lawrence, J.r, <em>counsel for relator.</em></attorneys>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Between January 1st, and April 29th, 1870, the liabilities and debts of the petitioner increased, and on the 29th day of April, the excess of such debts and liabilities over his assets and personal property was greater than on the 1st day\", of January, 1870.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">He had, between the dates aforesaid, no other assets or \u2022 personal property than those above mentioned, except the United States bonds hereinafter mentioned, nor were his. debts and liabilities, at any period between January 1st and May 1st, 1870, ever less than $356,084 49 ; <em>and Ms debts' and liabilities were at all times between those respective dates greater than his assets, </em>excepting therefrom the United States bonds.</p>\n\n<p id=\"b472-9\">On the 29th day of April, 1870, the relator addressed to tne respondents a written notice, verified by his oath, claiming that he was not liable to taxation in any amount for personal estate; requesting them to strike his name from the assessment rolls, and giving in detail his debts and liabilities, and the amount of his personal estate and assets.</p>\n\n<p id=\"b472-11\">By the statement above referred to, it appeared that the relator, at the time aforesaid, was the owner of bonds of the United States of the par value of $250,000, commonly known as five-twenties, which had been purchased by him in the years 1865, 1866, and 1867, for <em>permanent investment, and have ever since been held and owned by Mm, and that none of the said bonds were purchased since January 1st, </em>1868.</p>\n\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The petitioner insisted before the respondents, that as his 'debts and liabilities exceeded the amount of his personal property, save the bonds aforesaid, he was not liable to be assessed or taxed in any amount for personal estate, and that those bonds could not be taken into consideration <em>for the purpose of taxation, </em>either as a <em>part of his capital, </em>or for the <em>reduction of his debts and liabilities.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"b473-12\">I. The respondents erred in taking into consideration the bonds of the United State, of which the relator was the owner, for the purpose of determining the amount of personal estate for which the relator was liable to be assessed and taxed.</p>\n\n<p id=\"b474-5\">And it has also been held that a tax laid by a state on banks \u201c on a <em>valuation equal </em>to the <em>amount </em>of their <em>capital stock </em>paid in, or secured to be paid in,\u201d <em>is a tax on the property </em>of the <em>institution, </em>and when that property consists of <em>stocks </em>of the <em>Federal Government, </em>the <em>law </em>laying the tax is <em>void, (Bank Tax Case, 2 Wallace, </em>200).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\"><em>(b.) </em>It seems to the relator to be clear, that the rspondeiits, in determining the amount of. his personal property liable to taxation, have <em>included </em>the United States bonds of which he was owner in the aggregate of his property, <em>liand valued it, like the </em>rest, <em>at its worth.\u201d </em>(2 Black, 260);</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">The effect of their action is the same as if the respondents had added the $250,000 of bonds to the rest of the relator\u2019s assets, and then deducted the amount of his debts from the aggregate sum. In other words, the United States bonds of the relator have been included as an element in the amount to be taxed as the relator\u2019s personal estate.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"b475-6\">1st. He was entitled to have his United States bonds laid entirely out of view, in ascertaining the amount of his personal estate, <em>because </em>they were not taxable by law for any purpose; and,</p>\n\n<p id=\"b475-8\">The United States bonds which he owned were not more under the jurisdiction of the respondents or their duputies, than if they had been owned by a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">The effect of the action of the respondents was to deprive the relator of his right to escape taxation upon his United States bonds, because they were applied by the respondents to the reduction of another item, to wit, his debts, which item he was entitled by the laws of the state to have deducted <em>in full </em>from the amount of his taxable personal property.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"b476-5\">' In that case, the relator was a bank organized under the general banking law of 1858, with a capital of $104,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">\" The defendants caused the relator to be assessed in the sum of $102,400, being the whole amount of its capital stock, paid in and secured to be piaid in, and on all its surplus-profits, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">It appeared, that the bank had $203,500 of United States-stocks or bonds, a portion of which was deposited with the bank department, and that the total value of all the other personal property of the bank did not, at the time the assessment was made, exceed, and had not since exceeded, the amount of its debts.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Now, in this case, no such rule has been followed. There were two privileges to which the relator was entitled ; his bonds were absolutely exempt, and he was entitled to have his debts deducted from the aggregate valuation of his taxable property. Instead of according to him these privileges or rights, the respondents applied his exempted property to the reduction of his debts, which it was his right and privilege under the law of the state to have deducted in full from the valuation of his taxable property.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"b477-11\">VI. It is submitted, i.i conclusion, that the papers show that the debts and liabilities of the relator exceeded his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number><em>taxable </em>personal property at <em>the time </em>this assessment was made, and at all times, when the said assessment was before the respondents, and that he is entitled, therefore, to the' relief which he seeks by this proceeding.</p>\n\n<attorneys id=\"b478-6\">C. A. Arthur, attorney, <em>and </em>Charles E. Miller, <em>counsel for respondents.</em></attorneys>\n\n\n<p id=\"b478-10\">Amount invested in business, $345,895 92. Amount inv\u00e9sted in United States stocks, known as five-twenties, $250,000 00. Total, $595,895 92. Less debts, $356,-184 49. Balance, $239,711 43.</p>\n\n<p id=\"b478-12\">Relator claims, however, that in assessing him the commissioners are bound to deduct his debts solely from such of his personal property as is taxable, and that such property is insufficient to pay his debts. That he is taxably insolvent, although worth in personal property two hundred and forty thousand dollars over and above all his indebtedness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"b479-6\">III. Such was not the intention of the legislature.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"b479-14\">The doctrine is full of danger, and if carried to its full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>extent must seriously cripple the resources of the state government. The very debts that a person claims to be deducted from his taxable property, are incurred for the purchase of United States stocks, also exempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Any one could, as in the present instance, carry on a large' business, own an amount of taxable property protected by the laws of the state and at the expense of the other inhabitants of the state, and yet shirk all obligations to contribute \u2018 to such expense by refusing to apply this personal property not taxable, to the payment of such debts.</p>\n\n\n\n<opinion><p id=\"b465-6\">In determining the amount of personal property of an individual, by assessors or commissioners of taxes, for the purpose of taxation, <em>stocks and bonds of the United States </em>are to form no part of the estimate. They cannot be excluded or deducted from the amou\u00fat of his assets, liable to taxation, for it is error to in dude them in such assets.</p><p id=\"b465-7\">At a special term of the supreme court of the state of; New York, held at the city hall, in the city of New York,, on the 29th day of June, 1870.</p><p id=\"b465-9\"><em>(Title of cause). </em>Order.\u2014On reading and filing the petition of Benjamin T.

Loew, <em>cleric.</em></p><p id=\"b471-13\"><em>Facts. </em>The petitioner is a resident of the city of New York, engaged in business at No. 89 Washington street.</p><p id=\"b471-14\">On the 1st of January, 1870, his personal property and as- \" <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>sets, other than certain bondsof the United States, amounted to the aggregate sum of $345,895 97.</p><p id=\"b472-5\">His debts on said day amounted to $356,084 49.</p><p id=\"b472-8\">\u2022 The relator was notified by t'he respondents that his personal estate had been assessed at the sum of $250,000.</p><p id=\"b472-10\">He attended before the respondents on the same day, and offered to be examined under oath. This was declined, and the statement was left by'him with the respondents.</p><p id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>This fact also appears from the petition as an independent allegation.</p><p id=\"b473-6\">He demanded that his name should be struck from the assessment roll.</p><p id=\"b473-7\">The respondents declined to do this, but by ,a notice in writing informed the relator that they had reduced his assessment to $200,000.</p><p id=\"b473-8\">By this notice, which, although dated May 26th, was not served on the relator until June 14th, 1870, it appears that the respondents deducted from the relator\u2019s debts the par value of his United States bonds, and that they then deducted, the balance thus obtained from his assets, and fixed upon the sum of $200,000 as an <em>equitable </em>amount for the assessment of his personal property. :</p><p id=\"b473-9\">The relator thereupon brought a <em>certiorari, '</em></p><p id=\"b473-10\">The return of the comptrollers is at pp. 12 to 17 of the case.</p><p id=\"b473-11\">By the return it appears, that the respondents acted under the instructions given by the comptroller of the state, for which see.</p><p id=\"b473-13\"><em>(a.) </em>Stock of the United States is not subject to taxation under the laws of a state, and a state law for that purpose is unconstitutional, whether it imposes the tax on United States stock <em>eo nomine, </em>or includes it in the aggregate of the1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>tax-payer\u2019s property, to be valued like the. rest at its worth. <em>(Bank of </em>Commerce, N. <em>Y., 2 </em>Black, 620).</p><p id=\"b474-8\">- And they have been made just as much the subject of taxation as if they had been added to the taxable personal property of the relator.</p><p id=\"b474-9\">\u25a0 II. The Revised Statutes provide, that assessors \u201c shall prepare \u00e1n assessment roll, in which they shall set down, in four separate columns, and according to the best information in their power:</p><p id=\"b474-10\">\u201c 1st. In the first column the names of all the taxable inhabitants of the town or ward, as the case may be. * * #</p><p id=\"b474-11\">\u201c 4th. In the fourth column the full value of all the <em>taxable personal property </em>owned by such person, <em>after deducting-the just debts owing by him.\u201d </em>(1 <em>R. S., p, </em>363, <em>sec. </em>9, <em>Edmond\u2019s </em>ed:)</p><p id=\"b474-12\"><em>(a.) </em>It is obvious that the respondents in this case have not only assessed the relator\u2019s bonds as a part of his personal estate, which was an illegal act on their part, under the decisions above referred to, but that they have also violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>the provisions of the Revised Statutes prescribing the mode of arriving at the amount of personal estate, for which an individual is liable to be assessed.</p><p id=\"b475-5\">The relator, we submit, was entitled to two exemptions:</p><p id=\"b475-7\">2d. He was entitled, under the law of this state to have Ms just .debts deducted from his <em>taxable </em>personal property.</p><p id=\"b475-10\"><em>(b.) </em>The effect also was to deprive the relator of the right to have his just debts deducted as provided by the Revised Statutes.</p><p id=\"b475-11\">The respondents should, in the language of the Revised Statutes, have placed in the fourth column of the roll, the full value of all the <em>taxable </em>personal property owned by the relator, <em>after deducting the just debts owing by him. </em>(1 <em>R. S., </em>363, <em>sec. </em>9, <em>Edmond\u2019s ed).</em></p><p id=\"b475-12\">Instead of doing so, they have deducted from his debts $250,000 which was exempted by law from taxation, and have, therefore, decreased his debts in that amount. The relator has not, therefore, been allowed the deduction on account of his debts to which the Revised Statutes entitle him.</p><p id=\"b475-13\">III. The precise point presented in this case does not \u00a1seem to have been passed upon by the courts of this state, but there is a decision in the case of <em>The People, </em>ex rel., <em>The Lockport City Bank </em>agt. <em>The Board of Education of Lockport, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>(46 <em>Barb., </em>588), which may be cited as authority for the action of the respondents in this case, and which, therefore,, demands some consideration here.</p><p id=\"b476-8\">The relator brought a mandamus to have the assessment stricken from the roll, which was denied, but the court based its decision upon the ground that the provisions of. the Revised Statutes requiring the assessors to set down in theassessmrnt roll the full value of all <em>taxable </em>personal property of the person, <em>after deducting the just debts owing by' him, had no relation to the taxation of monied corporations.. </em>(46 <em>Barb., 588).</em></p><p id=\"b476-9\">Indeed, the case is an authority for the position taken by the relator in this case ,\u2022 because it is apparent from the-reasoning of judge Marvin, who delivered the opinion of the court, that if the case had been that of an individual, the court would have felt bound to allow a deduction to be made of his <em>just debts, </em>irrespective of any reduction on account of United States bonds owned by him. (46 <em>Barb.,. </em>596).</p><p id=\"b476-10\">IV. The true rule applicable to this case is, we conceive,,, to be found in the opinion delivered by Judge Denio, in the case of <em>The People </em>agt. <em>The Commissioners of Taxes, </em>(23 N. Y., 195).</p><p id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>_ In speaking of the mode in which a bank should be assessed and taxed, he says:</p><p id=\"b477-5\">\u201c The position of a bank in this respect is precisely the same as that of an individual tax-payer. It is, as a general rule, assessed and taxed for all its property of every kind ; but there is an exception as to such part of it as the constitution and laws of the Union and of the state have, upon special reasons of policy, declared shall be exempted. Whether such exempt property is found in the hands of an individual or in the possession of a corporation taxed upon the actual value of its capital, the rule is the same. <em>The exempt property is to he deducted from the aggregate valuation. </em>(23 <em>N. Y., </em>195).</p><p id=\"b477-7\">V. The case which is made by the relator commends itself to the court, as one presented in good faith.</p><p id=\"b477-8\">The position of the relator is not that of one who has hastily converted his assets into United States securities for the purpose of avoiding taxation.</p><p id=\"b477-9\">On the contrary, it is expressly averred, and it is not denied by the respondents, that all the securities of the relator were bought for <em>permanent </em>investment, in the years 1865, 1866, and 1867.</p><p id=\"b477-10\">The relator is, therefore, not subject to the charge of attempting to evade the tax laws, but is merely standing upon what he in good faith deems his legal rights.</p><p id=\"b478-5\">VII. The .assessment in question should be declared illegal and void, and should be set aside.</p><p id=\"b478-8\">Statement.\u2014This matter comes-before the court upon a <em>certiorari </em>isssued under the act of 1859, to review the decisions of the respondents as to the assessment of the personal property of the <em>relator for the year </em>1870.</p><p id=\"b478-9\">This personal property, as appears by his own statement is as follows:</p><p id=\"b478-11\">\u25a0 The' respondents fixed the sum of two hundred thousand dollars, as the value of the personal property of relator, subject to taxation.</p><p id=\"b478-13\">I. The tax commissioners in making their assessments are governed by the provisions of the Revised Statutes. (1 <em>R. S. p., </em>390, <em>et seq).</em></p><p id=\"b478-14\">, Section 9 of article 2, provides that the commissioners shall prepare an assessment roll, in the fourth column whereof they shall set down \u201c the full value of all the taxable personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>poperty owned by such person, after deducting the just debts owing by him.\u201d</p><p id=\"b479-5\">IT. The relator to maintain his claim for exemption must establish the proposition, that the legislature by the above cited provision of law intended that the debts should be deducted solely from the preperty liable to taxation.</p><p id=\"b479-7\">In ascertaining such intention by construction of the statutes, two great underlying principles must be constantly borne in mind:</p><p id=\"b479-8\">1st. That the power to levy and collect taxes being an incident of sovereignty, without which no government could exist, all the statutes in derogation of such authority and exempting particular persons or particular classes of property, are to be strictly construed, and confined to their narrowest meaning <em>(Blackwell on Tax Titles, pp 2, </em>406 to 411).</p><p id=\"b479-9\"><em>2d. </em>That equality in taxation is the principle by which the legislative power is controlled in the levy of taxes <em>(Blackwell on Tax Titles, pp </em>6-6).</p><p id=\"b479-10\">IV. Bearing in mind these principles, it is insisted that the intention of the legislature, as evidenced by the section cited, was simply to establish a rule by which the assessors should ascertain what a person is really worth.</p><p id=\"b479-11\">Had they intended that the debts should have been deducted solely from taxable personal property, they would have inserted the word \u2018\u2018therefrom,\u201d so that the section would read \u201c after deducting therefrom.\u201d</p><p id=\"b479-12\">They used the words \u2018\u2018 taxable personal property \u201d as descriptive of what the assessors should insert in their lists, not of what the debt should be deducted from.</p><p id=\"b479-13\">Y. The exemption that relator claims is not only an exemption of. his bonds from taxation, but also from their being considered as liable for the payment of his debts when taxation is concerned. Its practical effect is to create a double exemption.</p><p id=\"b480-6\">VI. The decision of the respondents should be affirmed.</p><p id=\"b480-7\">On the hearing at the general term January, 1871, the court ordered judgment on the writ of certiorari for relator, and directed that the assessment should be vacated and stricken from the rolls.</p><p id=\"b480-8\">There was no written opinion, the decision being rendered on the argument.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
