The contract was entered into, by the plaintifls with a view of fattening cattle for market, keeping the cattle in the barn during the winter. The plaintiffs after the making of the contract placed a large number of cattle , in the barn, and kept them there during the winter. The defendants furnished the amount of slops from their distillery specified in the contract, and they were -received by the plaintiffs daily, and fed to the cattle, and paid for monthly as-specified in the contract. The complaint in the action, after stating the contract and the placing of the cattle in the bam, proceeds to allege that very soon thereafter, the defendants, against the dissent of the .plaintiffs, purchased damaged grain which was totally unfit for the purpose of manufacturing the slops mentioned in the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>tract, and used the same in their distillery, and from the same, manufactured and delivered slops to the plaintiffs, which the plaintiffs refused to receive, <em>as in any way a fulfillment of the contract on the part of the defendants. </em>And that by reason thereof the plaintiffs have sustained damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b9-5\">It appears that during the winter, the defendants purchased and distilled in their distillery a quantity of .grain which had been contained in an elevator at Oswego, which had been burned. That a portion of the slops, arid perhaps two thirds, furnished to the defendants were the slops from this damaged grain.</p>\n<p id=\"b9-6\">And the plaintiffs adduced testimony showing that these slops were full of gravel, ashes and cinders, and were black, and tending to show that they were not fit for the purpose \u25a0of fattening cattle, and according to some witnesses, were worth nothing at all, whereas good slops were worth from fifteen to twenty cents per bushel.</p>\n<p id=\"b9-7\">They also gave evidence tending to show that some of their cattle had gained nothing at all in weight, while the majority of them had gained only an average of 57lbs per head, whereas they should have gained in weight an average of SOOlbs. per head. It appeared that the plaintiffs \u25a0on several occasions complained to the defendants, or their agents at the distillery that the slops were not good, and on one occasion threatened to sue the defendants on that account if the cattle did not do well.</p>\n<p id=\"b9-8\">Witnesses on the part of the defendants who had used the same slops, testified that the quality was good and that their cattle, fed on them, did well.</p>\n<p id=\"b9-9\">The referee finds that the slops furnished the plaintiffs for one hundred and twenty-five days of the time, <em>a </em>was' inferior \u2022and not merchantable.\u201d And that by reason thereof the plaintiffs sustained damages to $1,029 37, for which amount he ordered judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b9-10\">Van Bur\u00e9n, one of the plaintiffs, testified that he \u201c knew the quality of the slops all the time it was being fed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>cattle.\u201d And the referee finds that the payment for the slops was made after they had been received and used by the plaintiffs, arad that the plaintiffs did not offer to return any of the slops to the defendants, or give them notice to\u00bb take any part of them back.</p>\n<p id=\"b10-5\">On this state of facts the plaintiffs claim to sustain this recovery, upon the ground that the contract is for the sale and purchase of an article to be manufactured, and that in every such sale there is an implied warranty that the article when delivered^ shall be of a merchantable quality. We do not think the ; agreement in this case is to manufacture or furnish a manufactured article, in the sense of the rule referred to, or thqt an article designated no otherwise than as \u201c slops from their distillery,\u201d constitutes a manufactured article within, the meaning of the rule which implies a. warranty of merchantable quality. A manufacture is defined as <em>tl </em>the process of making anything by art, or of reducing materials into a form fit for use, by the hand or by machinery.\u201d And it seems to imply a proceeding wherein the. object or intention of the process is, to produce the article in question. The residuum or refuse of various kinds of manufactories is more or less valuable for certain purposes. And may be, and often is the subject of. sale, but it is not expected that the skill and attention of the manufacturer is to be devoted to the quality of the refuse material. This is not the object of the process, and its quality is wholly subordinate, and disregarded, when attention to it would interfere with the most profitable mode or material to be used in the process which is the main object of the manufacturer.</p>\n<p id=\"b10-6\">\u25a0 It is not reasonable to suppose that in contracts for the sale of this refuse material it is the expectation of either party that the manufacturer is to be controlled in his choice of material or machinery to be used, by any consideration as to .the effect which it may have upon the value of the refuse material resulting from the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b11-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>And it seems absurd to suppose there can be, in the absence of express contract and of fraud or imposition, any responsibility for the quality of what is sold as slops or \u25a0swill. The plaintiffs had what they bargained for \u201c slops from the said distillery,\u201d and it would seem reasonable to apply the doctrine of <em>caveat emptor </em>to such \u00e1 sale, if ever.</p>\n<p id=\"b11-5\">But if there were a warranty of merchantable quality implied in such a sale, the plaintiffs would not be entitled to recover in this case, since it appears that they- received and consumed the slops from day to day, with a full knowledge of their quality and without returning, or offering to return them, or giving the defendants notice to take them, away or not to deliver any more. This fact, upon well settled principles governing executory contracts of sale, was a complete waiver of the alleged defects. The defendants offered to sell the article at a certain price. The plaintiffs cannot make a different contract for the defendants, or receive and use the article at a less price without their consent, unless prevented from rejecting it by want of knowledge of, or \u25a0opportunity to ascertain the alleged defects.</p>\n<p id=\"b11-6\">It is notimprobable from the testimony, that if the plaintiffs had refused to receive and consume the slops in question, the defendants might have obtained the same or a better price from other parties. The case, on this point, seems to be entirely within the principle of <em>Reed </em>agt. <em>Randall, </em>(29 <em>N. Y., </em>358); see also <em>Hoe </em>agt. Sanborn, (21 <em>N. Y., </em>552, 556,) and <em>Howland </em>agt. <em>Hoey, </em>(23 <em>Wend., </em>357.)</p>\n<p id=\"b11-7\">Judgment must be reversed, and a new trial must be granted, costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
