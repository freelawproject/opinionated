Morrow, Texas inmate # 606781, moves this court for leave to proceed on appeal <em>informa pauperis </em>(IFP). On January 9, 1997, this court ordered Morrow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>to file an affidavit for leave to proceed IFP on appeal pursuant to the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA). <em>See Morrow v. Collins, </em>No. 96-10824 (5th Cir. Jan. 9, 1997) (one-judge order). The order held Morrow\u2019s appeal in abeyance for 30 days pending payment of the $105 filing fee or submittal of the required documents pursuant to the PLRA. Morrow received notice that failure to comply with the order would result in the dismissal of his appeal for want of prosecution. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Morrow\u2019s IFP motion, filed within the 30-day period, does not comply with the PLRA because Morrow has not attached a certified statement of his prison trust account. Morrow asserts that he attempted to acquire the certified statement on January 27, 1997, but due to the history of hostility Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) officials have toward inmate litigants, he is unable to provide the required document. We take judicial notice of the recently established TDCJ procedures <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> whereby an inmate may obtain the certified statement of the inmate trust account. The notarized Trust Fund Balance Inquiry Screen, the document created by following the procedures for records release information, is sufficient to comply with the PLRA\u2019s requirement of a certified statement of the prison trust account. In light of the relative speed by which Morrow could obtain the document, his assertion of inability is insufficient to comply with this court\u2019s January 9 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Accordingly, Morrow\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED, and his appeal is dismissed for want of prosecution. <em>See </em>5th Cir.R. 42.3. Should Morrow wish to reinstate his appeal, he is instructed to pay the $105 filing fee to the clerk of the district court within 30 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">IFP MOTION DENIED. APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"A22\">\n<em>APPENDIX</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">NOTICE TO OFFENDERS PRISONER\u2019S LITIGATION REFORM ACT \u2014 TITLE 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915</p>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">Effective December 1,1996, procedures for requesting and receiving trust fund account information for filing an In Forma Pauperis Affidavit in any Federal District Court within the State of Texas, or for other valid legal purposes, are as follow:</p>\n<p id=\"b475-12\">RECORDS RELEASE INFORMATION:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-13\">1.
