We review the constitutionality of a federal statute <em>de novo. United States v. Osburn, </em>955 F.2d 1500, 1503 (11th Cir.1992). We find section 860(a) to be constitutional and, consequently, affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-27\">Jackson argues that section 860(a) is unconstitutional in view of the Supreme Court ruling in <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995). In <em>Lopez, </em>the Court held that Congress exceeded its power under the Commerce Clause by enacting a statute prohibiting possession of a firearm within 1000 feet of a school. <em>Id. </em>at -, 115 S.Ct. at 1626. The Court determined that possession of a firearm in a school zone involved no commercial activity and showed no substantial nexus with interstate commerce. <em>Id. </em>Jackson argues that the same principles should apply to possession with intent to distribute illegal drugs in a school zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-30\">Although this circuit has not addressed directly the constitutionality of section 860(a), we have refused to apply <em>Lopez </em>broadly in other contexts. <em>See United States v. McAllister, </em>77 F.3d 387 (11th Cir.) (finding constitutional a statute which makes possession of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>a firearm by a felon a criminal offense), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 117 S.Ct. 262, 136 L.Ed.2d 187 (1996); <em>Cheffer v. Reno, </em>55 F.3d 1517 (11th Cir.1995) (holding that the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act of 1994 was within Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause power because the provision of reproductive services was a commercial activity). Furthermore, every circuit that has considered a <em>Lopez </em>challenge of section 860(a) has upheld the statute as a lawful exercise of Congressional power. <em>See United States v. Ehrlich, </em>106 F.3d 409 (9th Cir.1997) (table) (unpublished opinion available through computer assisted research); <em>United States v. Hawkins, </em>104 F.3d 437, 439-40 (D.C.Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Ekinci, </em>101 F.3d 838, 844 (2d Cir.1996); <em>United States v. McKinney, </em>98 F.3d 974, 977-80 (7th Cir.1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 117 S.Ct. 1119, 137 L.Ed.2d 319 (1997); <em>United States v. Orozco, </em>98 F.3d 105, 106-07 (3d Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Zorrilla, </em>93 F.3d 7, 8-9 (1st Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Tucker, </em>90 F.3d 1135, 1139-41 (6th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">The illegal possession and sale of drugs affects interstate commerce, and Congress accordingly has authority under the Commerce Clause to criminalize and punish drug-related activity. <em>United States v. Bernard, </em>47 F.3d 1101, 1103 (11th Cir.1995) (per curiam). Under this constitutional authority, Congress has the power to regulate drug activity in a school zone. We adopt the reasoning of our sister circuits in concluding that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 860(a) is a constitutional exercise of power under the Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">We AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
