(\u201cGSV\u201d) (formerly Cybershop.com, Inc.), Jeffrey Tauber, Jeffrey Leist, and Ian Phillips are before the Court on their motion to dismiss the Plaintiffs consolidated amended class action complaint (\u201camended complaint\u201d) under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Defendants allege that Plaintiff has failed to plead sufficient facts to prove its alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>violations of sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). The class period relevant to these alleged violations extends from October 26, 1999 through February 24, 2000 (the \u201cclass period\u201d). (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 14). The Court heard oral argument on Defendants\u2019 motion on January 4, 2002, and has jurisdiction to consider this matter under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381. For the reasons set forth below, Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the Plaintiffs amended complaint is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">For the limited purpose of this motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court, as it must, accepts as true the facts alleged in the amended complaint and all reasonable inferences drawn from those facts. <em>See Hayes v. Gross, </em>982 F.2d 104, 106 (3d Cir.1992); <em>see also </em>infra TV. Rule 12(b)(6) Standard. Accordingly, the facts recited below are taken from Plaintiffs amended complaint, and do not reflect this Court\u2019s factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">A. The Parties</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Lead Plaintiff FU Investment Company and all other class members purchased common stock in Cybershop sometime between October 26, 1999 and February 24, 2000. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 7, 14-20.) Cy-bershop, then a Delaware corporation operating a principal place of business in Jersey City, New Jersey, was an online and direct-to-consumer retailer throughout the relevant class period. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 8, 24.) Cybershop\u2019s \u201cstore,\u201d which was located online at www.cybershop.com sold discounted, designer and brand-name apparel, electronics, home accessories, toys, gifts and watches at closeout prices. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 8, 24.) Through a joint venture with Tops Appliance City (\u201cTops\u201d), Cybershop also sold online at www.elec-tronics.net various consumer electronics, appliances, and home office equipment. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 8, 24.)</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">Defendants Jeffrey S. Tauber, Ian S. Phillips, and Jeffrey Leist (collectively referred to as the \u201cIndividual Defendants\u201d), were officers and/or directors of Cyber-shop during the class period. Tauber, at all relevant times, was the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President, Principal Executive Officer, and a director of Cybershop. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 9.) In these capacities, he was responsible for signing quarterly reports on Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d), and for issuing statements on Cy-bershop\u2019s behalf. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 9.) Phillips was a director of Cybershop and the Chief Executive Officer of MG Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cybershop. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 10.) Leist was the Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer as of February 1999, and also was the Chief Financial Officer from April 1999 until April 2000, when he resigned. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">B. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b258-12\">Initially, approximately thirteen parties filed separate complaints alleging that Cy-bershop and the Individual Defendants violated securities regulation laws. (T3 at 12-15.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>) After a conference with the parties on April 15, 2000, the Court entered an order consolidating all cases. The Court also selected FU Investment Co. as lead Plaintiff (\u201cPlaintiff\u2019), appointed Bernstein Liebhard &amp; Liftshitz LLP as lead counsel, and directed Plaintiff to file a consolidated amended class action complaint. Plaintiff so filed, and that pleading is the one that this Court reviews in con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>sidering the motion now before it. Plaintiff opposes that motion, and contends alternatively that it should be granted leave to amend under Rule 15 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure so that it may cure any deficiencies within the amended complaint. (Pl.\u2019s Opposing Mem. at 39 n. 21.)</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">II. Class Allegations</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The allegations in the amended complaint are based primarily \u201con the investigation by Plaintiffs attorneys.\u201d (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 1.) That investigation included a review of: SEC filings<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, reports and advisories, Cybershop\u2019s press releases and other public statements, and media reports. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 1.) The amended complaint alleges that Cybershop and the Individual Defendants caused Plaintiff to purchase Cybershop\u2019s common stock at \u201cartificially inflated prices\u201d during the class period. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 7.) It further alleges that the Individual Defendants violated section 20(a) of the Exchange Act by breaching their duty to correct Cyber-shop\u2019s false and misleading public statements. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 13.) The amended complaint also asserts that Cy-bershop made material misrepresentations to the public or failed to disclose to the public facts that \u201cwould tend to induce a reasonable investor to misjudge the value of Cybershop\u2019s common stock.\u201d (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 22.) Additionally, Plaintiff claims that various analysts wrote and released public reports regarding Cybershop to the sales force, to brokerage firm customers, and to various automated data retrieval services. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 22).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">III. General Background</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">Effective June 1, 1999, Cybershop tendered one million shares of Cybershop\u2019s common stock and five thousand dollars to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of The Magellan Group, Inc. (\u201cMagellan\u201d), an online and direct response retailer of high quality personal care, home- and health-related products. (Am. Compl. at \u00b626.) Cybershop began operating its Tools for Living division, formerly the Magellan business, during the second quarter of 1999. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 26.) That division offered high quality merchandise in the personal care, health, and home accessories categories, and promoted its merchandise through direct response, print media campaigns in national consumer magazines and at its website, www.tools-forliving.com. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 26.)</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">Cybershop\u2019s quarterly report dated August 13, 1999, which was filed with the SEC on Form 10-Q, identifies the company as \u201can online and direct[-]to[-]consumer retailer\u201d with two online sites, www.cyber-shop.com and www.electronics.net. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 24.) In that 10-Q filing, Cy-bershop reported \u201ca shift\u201d in its commercial strategy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-11\">Beginning in the first quarter of the current year, the Company began implementing several operating initiatives at its flagship store, cybershop.com, designed to better serve its customers and streamline its operations. The Company has completed a shift in its merchandising strategy to focus on offering off-price branded merchandise such as that found in outlets and traditional discount retailers. The Company initiated a significant overhaul of its infrastructure, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>migrating its web-based order processing onto a new platform, redesigning the web site and integrating it with a new order fulfillment system. The transition to an inventory-based model was completed in the second quarter with the development of a new distribution and fulfillment center. In addition, the Company launched two new online auction sites. With this initiative, the Company introduced the excitement of the online auction experience to all its customers, complementing its existing product offerings. The initiative also offers the Company a new way to attract customers, learn more about their shopping preferences and provide an effective mechanism to manage excess inventory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AkV\">(Am. Compl. at \u00b6 25.)</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">During the third and fourth quarters of 1999, Cybershop made public announcements that allegedly \u201cwere intended to, and did, convey, the impression that Cy-bershop was successfully positioning itself as the premier online name-brand discount retailer.\u201d (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 27.) First, on September 16, 1999, Cybershop announced that it had signed exclusive, online distribution agreements with \u201ckey designer apparel brands\u201d: \u201cCybershop.com is leveraging its experience as traditional merchants and its position as a pioneer in e-commerce, to purchase close-outs and over stocks directly from America\u2019s most prestigious manufacturers.\u201d (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 28.) Commenting on those agreements, Tauber stated that \u201c[j]ust as T.J. Maxx and Marshalls ... have become the dominant brick and mortar retailer <em>[sic] </em>for off-price brands, we are positioning Cyber-shop.com as the key internet destination to purchase designer apparel and home furnishings.\u201d (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 28.)</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Next, on September 21,1999, Cybershop announced that it had secured for its auction site additional distribution from Ly-cos, Excite@Home, and MSN: \u201c[ajuctions have been an exciting feature, attracting thousands of new customers and registrants to CyberShop.com and electronics.Net who register to bid and win top quality, branded consumer electronics.\u201d (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 80.) To this, Tauber added that \u201c[ajuctions have been an exciting way for us to acquire new customers for both CyberShop.com and electronics.Net ... This new distribution from Ly-cos, MSN and Excite has given a real boost to our traffic and demand for auctions.\u201d (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 31.)</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">On September 23, 1999, Cybershop announced that it had entered into an agreement with LookSmart to be featured in RewardMall, LookSmart\u2019s online shopping mall. Commenting on that new agreement, Tauber stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">Securing this key area will help to position us as the premier place to shop for branded discount merchandise and our broad selection of consumer electronics.... We believe our positioning with LookSmart in their RewardMall combined with their significant growth in traffic will be an important contributor to our traffic growth into the fourth quarter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">(Am. Compl. at \u00b6 32.)</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">On September 30, 1999, Cybershop completed an equity securities private placement raising $5.1 million in gross proceeds. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 33.) Relevant to that placement, Cybershop issued a class of warrants that gave the investors the right to receive additional shares if the price of the stock trades fell below certain, specified levels. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 33.)</p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">On October 4, 1999, Cybershop announced that Tops, its partner in the elec-tronies.Net joint venture, had decided to discontinue consumer electronics sales so as to focus on higher-margin appliances sales. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 34.) Though elec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>tronics.Net would have access to Tops\u2019 inventory through the year, Cybershop had then started to seek alternative supply arrangements, indicating that \u201cit is not believed that this decision by Tops will have a detrimental impact on the operating results of CyberShop.com.\u201d (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 34.)</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">On October 21, 1999, Cybershop announced that it had signed an expanded agreement with Yahoo! to include its products in the Yahoo! shopping directory, (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 35.):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-5\">CyberShop.com is quickly establishing itself as one of the leading sites for designer apparel and other brand name merchandise at deep discount prices. With this deal, CyberShop.com will be well positioned to capitalize on the upcoming holiday season, which according to Jupiter Communications, an internet research firm, is estimated to generate $6 billion in online sales.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">(Am. Compl. at \u00b6 35.) Focusing on how this agreement would impact its continuous strategy, Tauber remarked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_j\">CyberShop.com has been growing rapidly with our last quarter revenues increasing over 270% over the June quarter ended 1998. This agreement with Yahoo! will further enable us to continue driving top line growth and bringing our deep merchandise mix to millions of additional online shoppers.... This deal highlights our ongoing strategy to become the premier destination on the Web for brand name merchandise while providing a fast and convenient shopping experience.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">(Am. Compl. at \u00b6 36.)</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">On the first day of the class period, October 26, 1999, Cybershop issued a press release entitled, \u201cCyberShop.com(R) Third Quarter Net Sales Increase Over 450% from the Prior Year with Strong Product Gross Margins of 34%.\u201d The opening lines of that press release report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-Z\">CyberShop.com(R), Inc. (NASDAQ: CYSP), a leading online retailer (http://www.cybershop.com) of brand name merchandise, announced today that its net sales of $2,788,000 for the third quarter of 1999, were up 458% from $500,000 in the third quarter of 1998 and up 35% from $2,067,000 in the second quarter of 1999. Gross margins for the quarter improved to 34% of net sales from 30% in the second quarter of 1999.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">(Am. Compl. at \u00b6 37.) Relevant to the Company\u2019s Tools for Living division, that press release informs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-12\">In June 1999, CyberShop.com acquired tools-for-living.com, a direct to consumer marketer of high quality merchandise in personal care, health and home accessories. These products are promoted on the http://tools.cybershop.com site and through print media campaigns in national consumer magazines.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-13\">(Aff. of Miranda Schiller (\u201cSchiller Aff.\u201d), Ex. 25.) It does not specify Tools for Living\u2019s financial statistics or its impact on the company\u2019s revenues.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-14\">That press release quotes Tauber on the company\u2019s holiday sales preparations: \u201cWe are now gearing up for the upcoming holiday season with a host of online and off line initiatives to promote a number of hot products.\u201d (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 37.) Cyber-shop also reported on its inventory and its service capabilities for that season: \u201cIn preparation for the holiday season, Cyber-Shop.com is carrying thousands of products and over 150 top brands, and has boosted its fulfillment and customer service capacity to process many more orders in preparation for the fourth quarter.\u201d (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 37.)</p>\n<p id=\"b261-15\">On November 5, 1999, Cybershop issued a press release summarizing an interview <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>that Tauber gave to The Wall Street Reporter. During that interview, Tauber described Cybershop as a retailer \u201cproviding consumers a better way to buy name brand apparel at deep discounts.\u201d \u201cThe new business model has been in place for a little more than two quarters with great success. In the second quarter we did roughly $2 million with a 30% gross margin, which is four times last year, and in our third quarter we did $3 million with a 34% gross margin.\u201d (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 45.) Also during that interview, Tauber commented that \u201c[w]e made a very important acquisition in June with Tools for living.com and we will continue to look for more acquisitions.\u201d (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 45.) Tauber specifically noted some of the products offered through that division:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXt\">the fourth quarter can represent over 50% of our business .... Right now we are expecting an enormous fourth quarter and its very exciting. We are not only leveraging our expertise picking <em>toys, </em>we will run Pokemon and Sega Dreamcast, we also have some great apparel items and a china pattern from Spode. We are ready.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">(Am. Compl. at \u00b6 45.)</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Within approximately two weeks after the October 26, 1999 press release and within five days after the press release recounting Tauber\u2019s Wall Street Reporter interview, on November 11, 1999, Tauber and his wife sold 200,000 shares of Cyber-shop common stock at $10 per share, earning proceeds of $2 million. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 75.) Fifteen days later, on November 26, 1999, Tauber and his wife sold an additional 475,000 shares of Cybershop common stock, or 26% of their aggregate holdings. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 75.) Likewise, between November 22, 1999 and November 29, 1999, Phillips sold 40,000 shares of Cyber-shop common stock at prices ranging from $10.50 to $14 per share, earning $480,000. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 75.) Additionally, Linda Wiatrowski, Cybershop\u2019s General Merchandise Manager and Vice President, sold 20,000 shares of the Company\u2019s stock on November 29, 1999, at $13.47 per share, earning proceeds of more than $269,000. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 75.) Neither Phillips nor Wiatrowski had previously sold any of their shares. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 75.) Plaintiff does not allege that Leist sold any stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Meanwhile, Cybershop issued a number of press releases announcing developments in its core operations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\">\u2022 an extension in its relationship with AOL (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 42.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-9\">\u2022 implementation of the Business Evolution\u2019s @Once Service Center to enhance its customer service capabilities (Am.

Compl. at \u00b6 53.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Next, Cybershop announced that 0N24, Inc. selected it as one of the elite Network Economy stocks to own. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 56.) Chosen as a \u201ccore holding\u201d for investors based on anticipated growth during the holiday season, the Company stated that it was picked by ON24\u2019s Editor-in-Chief as the \u201cracing horse stock pick\u201d that was \u201cclearly going to benefit from the onset of the Christmas selling season.\u201d (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 56.)</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">On December 23, 1999, the Company issued a press release reporting that \u201c[e]arly financial data is encouraging, indicating solid year over year revenue growth and healthy gross margins.\u201d (Schiller Aff., Ex. 25.)</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">On February 1, 2000, the Company announced its unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter of 1999, reporting revenues double those earned in 1998: approximately $4.2 million for the quarter and $10 million net for the year. That announcement does not analyze the revenues earned respectively from each Cybershop division.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">On February 10, 2000, the Company issued a press release over the Business Wire announcing that it was closing its e-tailing sites, CyberShop.com and electronics.net, and selling those operations\u2019 retail assets. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 65.) Announcing a change in its core strategy, the Company indicated that it would begin operating as an Internet incubator, GSV. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 65.) After this announcement, Cyber-shop\u2019s common stock price <em>increased.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">As a means to comply with generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) for reporting operations discontinued after the fiscal year\u2019s end, the Company issued on February 24, 2000, an Amended 10-Q for the quarter ending September 30,1999. The Amended 10-Q reveals that sales of core operations, CyberShop.com, declined during the third quarter of 1999 twenty-eight percent in one year: \u201c[rjevenues attributable to CyberShop for the third quarter of 1999 totaled $358,000, as compared to $500,000 for the same period of 1998.\u201d (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 66.) Cybershop did not make any other changes in its Amended 10-Q. Indeed, it reported the same consolidated gross revenues ($2,788,-000) as disclosed in its original Form 10-Q. (Schiller Aff., Ex. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">That same day, the stock\u2019s market price increased. The stock closed at $3.9375 per share on February 24, 2000. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 67.) In fact, its closing price was higher than its opening price, and was also higher than its market price the previous day. And, indeed, the stock price continued to rise through February 28, 2000. By February 28, 2000, the stock price had increased 25% since Cybershop\u2019s February 24 announcement. Significantly, the parties do not dispute that the share price had continually increased through February 28. The stock closed at $4.875 per share on February 28. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 69.)</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">On February 29, 2000, the New York Times published an article entitled, \u201cCan Cybershop Explain This To Investors?\u201d (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 68.) Its author reported that Cybershop\u2019s stock, which was trading at about $6 a share before the company\u2019s third quarter revenue announcement, \u201cclimbed to a high of $14.25 on Nov. 29 amid great optimism over the holiday shopping season.\u201d (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 68.) Reporting that third quarter 1999 revenue results were essentially distorted, the author wrote that core business revenues had decreased twenty-eight percent on a year-to-year basis (Am.

He says, \u2018the fourth quarter can represent over 50% of our business and we are very focused on making sure that our systems are robust enough to handle traffic, our marketing plans are in place, and we picked the right products. Right now we are expecting an enormous fourth quarter and its very exciting. We are not only leveraging our expertise picking toys, we will run Pokemon and Sega Dreamcast, we also have some great apparel items and a china pattern from Spode. We are ready.\u2019 What should investors look for when investing in CyberShop.com? Jeff explains[,] \u2018One1 of the most critical elements when looking at an online retailer is gross margin; you can\u2019t acquire customers at any cost. We are very focused on gross margin because we believe ultimately that gross margin is the way we will reach profitability. Investors also have to look at marketing dol.lars spent. Last quarter we generated $3.40 of revenue for every marketing dollar spent. \u25a0 We believe we have one of the best executed sites, its simple, its easy to find products and checkout. And of course we have a management team with over 100 years of merchandising experience. We are going after a big market segment. Off-price retail business is a $27 billion industry and we believe we are poised to capture a big portion of that business online.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">(Am.

Compl. at \u00b6 46.) Further, Plaintiff contends that Tauber\u2019s expectations for an \u201cenormous fourth quarter\u201d and his statement that Cybershop was \u201cpoised to capture a big portion of [the off-price retail business] online\u201d were false and misleading because he knew or recklessly disregarded that sales of Cyber-Shop.com\u2019s core business actually declined 28 percent from a year earlier.

This increase was primarily attributable to greater marketing efforts, an expanded customer base, repeat purchases from existing customers, acquisitions, and strong sales of four products, which represented approximately 45% of total revenues in the three months ended September 30,1999. Advertising and set-up fees decreased by 73%, or $22,000, to $8,000 in the third quarter of 1999 from $30,000 in the third quarter of 1998, as a result of a decrease in emphasis on this revenue stream and an increased focus on the Company\u2019s merchandising strategies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">(Am. Compl. at \u00b6 50.) Plaintiff claims that these statements conveyed falsely that \u201cgreater marketing efforts, an expanded customer base, and repeat purchases from existing customers\u201d had a greater impact on the increased revenues than Cyber-shop\u2019s acquisition activities, relying on the fact that, as Cybershop ultimately disclosed, more than half of revenues generated in the third quarter 1999 came from the Magellan Group, Inc., which Cyber-shop had acquired in June 1999.

Plaintiff asserts that Tau-ber\u2019s statement was \u201cmaterially false and misleading\u201d because Tauber knew or recklessly disregarded the fact that the \u201cCy-bershop.com division had experienced a substantial decline in revenues during the third quarter of 1999, and the division\u2019s poor financial performance was continuing throughout the fourth quarter.\u201d (Am.

(Am. Compl. at \u00b6 56.) Its stock joined ranks with AT <em>&amp; </em>T, Qwest Communications, Yahoo!, Intel, AOL, Cisco, Amazon, Ebay, and Adaptec. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 56.) It reported that ON24 selected the company as a \u201ccore holding\u201d for investors based on anticipated growth during the holiday season. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 56.) Cybershop stated that ON24\u2019s Editor-in-Chief identified it as the \u201cracing horse stock pick,\u201d explaining that the stock was well off its 52 week high and \u201cclearly going to benefit from the onset of the Christmas selling season.\u201d (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 56.)</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">Commenting on ON24\u2019s decision selecting Cybershop, Tauber stated, \u201c[w]e are excited our stock has been chosen by ON24.com and believe it further illustrates the strength of our company ... We are well prepared for \u2018the holiday season and believe it will clearly differentiate us as the leader in our segment of online retail.\u2019 \u201d (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 57.) Plaintiff claims that Tauber\u2019s statement was materially false and misleading because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANH\">[Defendant Tauber knew, or recklessly disregarded, that at the time he made the statement the Company\u2019s core business revenues were actually declining. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>Based on the Company\u2019s actual third quarter financial results, Tauber had no reasonable basis for his belief that the holiday season would differentiate Cy-bershop as the leader in its segment of online retail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">(Am. Compl. at \u00b6 58.) Further, Plaintiff alleges that \u201cON24\u2019s selection of Cyber-shop was based, in substantial part, on defendants\u2019 materially false and misleading statements concerning the purported success of the Company\u2019s online retail business, CyberShop.com.\u201d (Am.

December 28, 1999 press release</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">A press release dated December 23, 1999, reports that \u201c[e]arly financial data is encouraging, indicating year over year revenue growth and healthy gross margins. According to a recent <em>Business Week </em>article, \u2018E-Tailers with high gross margins are likely to survive the cyberwars.\u2019 \u201d (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 60.) That press release quotes Tauber as stating, \u201c \u2018[w]e are very pleased with our performance to date and our ability to increase our margins throughout the year ... Our infrastructure was well prepared for the added volume, our web servers, fulfillment operations, and customer service all rose to the occasion.\u2019 \u201d (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 60.)</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Plaintiff contends that these representations were materially false and misleading because Cybershop knew or recklessly disregarded that it \u201cwas not, in fact, experiencing revenue growth on a year-to-year basis.\u201d (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 61.) Plaintiff claims that, instead, the majority of Cyber-shop\u2019s 1999 revenues resulted from its Tools for Living division (formerly Magellan), which Cybershop did not acquire until June 1999. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 61.) \u201cIrrespective of its gross margins, the Company\u2019s Cybershop.com division was generating only half the sales as compared to the same period the prior year.\u201d (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 61.)</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">\n<em>g. February 1, 2000 announcement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">On February 1, 2000, Cybershop announced its unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter of 1999: approximately $4.2 million in quarterly revenues and $10 million in net revenues for the year 1999. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 62.) These figures were double those from 1998. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 62.) The Company reported that it expected operating losses to decline approximately 30% for the quarter as compared to the previous year. (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 62.) Commenting on the 1999 financial results, Tauber said: \u201cWe are pleased with our financial performance and believe our balanced approach in growing our business towards profitability versus growth at any cost will allow us to build a more sustainable business model long term.... \u201d Tauber further commented, \u201cWe believe that growth at any cost is unsustainable for any dot com, and are very pleased with the way our marketing drove traffic and sales for the holiday selling season ... Ultimately, we were able to show significant top line growth while not sacrificing the bottom line.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">Plaintiff claims that the February 1, 2000 announcement and Tauber\u2019s responses to that announcement were \u201cmaterially false and misleading\u201d because \u201cthe increase in revenues for 1999 was primarily attributable to its Tools for Living division, which contributed $5,298,000 or 75% of total revenues in 1999, and also to the growth of electronics.net which contributed $1,721,000 or 25% of total revenues in 1999.\u201d (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 64.)</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">VIII. The Allegations in the Amended Complaint Fail to Give Rise to any Section 10(b) Claim under the Exchange Act</p>\n<p id=\"b272-12\">a. False and Misleading Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b272-13\">The Court, as it must on this motion, has considered each allegedly false <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>and misleading statement pled in the amended complaint. Scrutinizing each separately and independently from another, the Court finds that Plaintiff cannot prove any set of facts that would entitle it to relief based on a 10b-5 claim. From a review of the statements made within the press releases and other public announcements, <em>see, e.g., Burlington Coat, </em>114 F.3d at 1426; <em>Westinghouse, </em>90 F.3d at 707; <em>In re Donald Trump Sec. Litig., </em>7 F.3d at 368 n. 9 (recognizing that a court may rely on factual allegations pled in other documents in reviewing a 12(b)(6) motion where a party\u2019s claims arise from those documents, and thus they are \u201cintegral to\u201d the complaint), the Court finds that Plaintiff cannot make a threshold showing that Cyber-shop made a material representation or omission, the first element of any 10b-5 action. <em>Campbell Soup, </em>145 F.Supp.2d at 583 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">Conceivably, Cybershop could have offered investors additional, clarifying information to explain that Tools for Living transactions contributed substantially to revenues earned. <em>See Nice Sys., </em>135 F.Supp.2d at 573. But even if Cybershop had provided that information, it is, nevertheless, immaterial to reasonable investors for two reasons. First, the information concerning Tools for Living would not have meaningfully changed the total mix of information available to a reasonable investor. <em>See Campbell Soup, </em>145 F.Supp.2d at 584 (citations and quotations omitted). With or without that information, reasonable investors would have interpreted identically Cybershop\u2019s overall earnings and share price. Importantly, Plaintiff concedes that it does not, and can not, challenge the accuracy of the reported revenues. It is undisputed that the financial results reported in the Amended 10-Q for the quarter ending September 30,1999, mirrored those reported in the earlier Form 10-Q. Cybershop did not file the Amended 10-Q to retract its earlier revenue totals. Rather, the Amended 10-Q was filed, consistent with GAAP, to reflect the effect of operations discontinued after the fiscal year end. Cybershop also broke out the results for each of the company\u2019s four web sites in the Amended 10-Q; it had no duty to earlier do so. <em>See Gilford Partners, L.P. v. Sensormatic Elecs. Corp., </em>1997 WL 570771, at * 17 n. 16 (N.D.Ill. Sept. 10, 1997) (noting that where a company complies with GAAP and applicable accounting guidelines, plaintiff must plead facts establishing why such reporting was still materially false and misleading). Further, the Court finds that Cyber-shop did not fail to disclose that \u201cmore than half of revenues generated in the third quarter [of] 1999 came from the Magellan Group, Inc. which the Company acquired in June 1999.\u201d (Am. Compl. at \u00b6 51.) Not only had market investors learned of that acquisition in Cybershop\u2019s June 1999 press release, but they had been informed of the Magellan revenue source through the third quarter Form 10-Q, which disclosed that Magellan\u2019s results were \u201cincluded in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial results beginning on the date of acquisition.\u201d (Schiller Aff., Ex. 3 at 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Moreover, since the parties agree that efficient market principles apply, the Third Circuit requires the Court to recognize that materiality in the context of an \u201cefficient\u201d market \u201ctranslates into information that alters the price of the firm\u2019s stock.\u201d <em>Burlington Coat, </em>114 F.3d at 1425; <em>see Campbell Soup, </em>145 F.Supp.2d at 584 (quoting <em>Burlington Coat </em>for the same proposition). Indeed, this is not a case in which a company withheld information and, as a result, its actions caused investors to lose money when the share price decreased. Put another way, investors\u2019 concerns regarding the market value of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>their Cybershop common stock would not have been different had they learned more information regarding the Tools for Living division. The information relevant to Cy-bershop\u2019s Tools for Living division was immaterial to the price of Cybershop\u2019s stock. The price of Cybershop shares, in fact, increased steadily from February 24, 2000 through February 28, 2000, the four day period following all of the company\u2019s relevant disclosures. It is undisputed that the stock only decreased after the New York Times article appeared on February 29, 2000. Interestingly, that article questions revenues that even the parties here do not challenge. Additionally, the Court notes that Cybershop did not make any representations, let alone misrepresentations, regarding the cybershop.com website in its first Form 10-Q or in any of the allegedly false press releases, statements, or announcements.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Second, Plaintiff can not prove a material misrepresentation or omission because the allegedly false statements are, indeed, opinions or general statements of optimism, and cannot be construed fairly as anything more than mere puffery. <em>See Campbell Soup, </em>145 F.Supp.2d at 584 (quotations and citations omitted). Critically, Tauber\u2019s statements concern Cybershop\u2019s future prospects, yet do not portend future earnings or other projections. At most, Tauber and other Cybershop representatives made optimistic, possibly even ambitious, statements that are necessarily immaterial as a matter of law, <em>see Achanta, </em>180 F.3d at 538 (holding that general statements of optimism, \u201ceven if arguably misleading, do not give rise to a federal securities claim because they are not material.\u201d), even if they reflect \u201cmisguided optimism,\u201d <em>Nice Sys., </em>135 F.Supp.2d at 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">For example, though alleged to be false and misleading, these statements reflect \u201cpuffery\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-6\">\u2022 \u201cRight now we are expecting an enormous fourth quarter and it is very exciting. ... Off-price retail business is $27 billion industry and we believe we are poised to capture a big part of that business online.\u201d Amended Complaint at \u00b6 45.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">\u2022 In announcing an agreement with Merrill Lynch\u2019s e-Shopping channel, Mr. Tauber said, \u201c[w]e are very excited about this deal and believe Merrill e-Shopping customers will have a higher propensity to transact and to shop online, driving our top line growth and increasing margins by lowering our customer acquisition costs.\u201d Amended Complaint at \u00b6 49.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-8\">\u2022 \u201cThe print ads will allow us to reach millions of consumers to uniquely feature our hot holiday products.... We believe we have the right combination of online and offline marketing to promote our merchandise and our brand for this holiday season.\u201d Amended Complaint at \u00b6 53.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">These statements, as Defendants correctly observe, were made when the company\u2019s sales and revenues had been increasing steadily from quarter to quarter; thus, the company was then reasonably optimistic about its future performance. <em>See Craftmatic Sec. Litig. v. Kraftsow, </em>890 F.2d 628, 642 n. 19 (3d Cir.1989) (noting that a history of operations may provide a reasonable basis for management projections). Significantly, too, the parties do not dispute that all past financial data statements are accurate, and thus do not give rise to liability under 10b-5. <em>See Advanta, </em>180 F.3d at 538; <em>Milestone Scientific, </em>103 F.Supp.2d at 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">Additionally, the Court determines that Plaintiff has not pled a cognizable 10b-5 claim against either Phillips or Leist. Neither Phillips nor Leist made any allegedly false statements or signed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>any allegedly false documents. These two parties can not be linked to the alleged misconduct merely because they held corporate positions at relevant times in this litigation. <em>See Marra v. Tel-Save Holdings, Inc., </em>1999 WL 317103, at *3-5 (E.D.Pa. May 18, 1999) (determining that the Reform Act requires that a securities fraud complaint identify the material misrepresentations made by each of the defendants, and not merely lump them all together). The claims against them thus fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">b. Loss Causation</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Plaintiffs 10b-5 claims also fail to survive this 12(b)(6) motion because it has not, and cannot, plead facts proving the requisite loss causation. A plaintiff must prove the \u201cact or omission of the defendant ... caused the loss for which the plaintiff seeks to recover damages\u201d under the Reform Act. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78u-4(b)(4); <em>see Hartman v. Blinder, </em>687 F.Supp. 938, 940, 942-43 (D.N.J.1987) (dismissing 10(b) claims for failure to allege loss causation). Proof of loss causation is required so as not to \u201ctransform the defendant into an insurer of the stock, a result which is contrary to the purpose of the federal securities laws.\u201d <em>Wiley v. Hughes Capital Corp., </em>746 F.Supp. 1264, 1294 (D.N.J.1990). Though Plaintiff alleges that the market for Cybershop stock was efficient and that \u201cif the market had known the truth concerning the source of the Company\u2019s 1999 third quarter revenues, the price of its common stock would have been adversely impacted,\u201d (Am. Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 21-23, 39-40), those allegations lack factual basis. The stock price did not drop after investors first received notice of the principal source of those third quarter revenues through the Amended 10-Q. Indeed, the stock price continuously increased through the market\u2019s closing hour on February 28, 2000. It did not decline until February 29, 2000, immediately after the suspect New York Times Article appeared. Absent the requisite causal nexus between Cyber-shop\u2019s allegedly misleading conduct and a measurable decrease in share price, Plaintiffs 10b-5 claim must be dismissed on Defendants\u2019 motion. <em>See Semerenko v. Cendant Corp., </em>223 F.3d 165, 185 (3d Cir.2000)(\u201cWhere the value of the security does not actually decline as a result of an alleged misrepresentation, it cannot be said that there is in fact an economic loss attributable to that misrepresentation.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">c. Absent a cognizable claim under 10b-5, Plaintiff cannot succeed under section 20(a) of the Exchange Act</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">Plaintiff claims that Defendants Tauber, Philips, and Leist are secondarily liable for Cybershop\u2019s alleged misrepresentations under Section 20(a), which creates liability for \u201ccontrolling persons\u201d in a corporation, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(a). (Am. Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 91-92.) Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that their roles as directors and/or officers gave them \u201csupervisory involvement in the day-to-day operations,\u201d and create a presumption that they \u201ccontrolled] ... the transactions giving rise to the securities violations.\u201d (Am. Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 91-92.)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">These allegations are entirely ineffective. Since the amended complaint fails to establish any primary violation of the Exchange Act, secondary liability under section 20(a) does not attach. <em>See Milestone Scientific, </em>103 F.Supp.2d at 474. While a section 20(a) claim requires a party to plead more than just a primary violation, <em>see Nice Sys., </em>135 F.Supp.2d at 588 (articulating elements that plaintiff must satisfy under section 20(a)), the Court finds it futile to probe further that analysis. Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the \u00a7 20(a) claims is thus granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>IX. Plaintiff Does Not Satisfy Rule 9(b) and Reform Act Pleading Standards for Drafting the Amended Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Plaintiff not only fails to plead a material misrepresentation or omission attributable to any Defendant, but also omits the requisite particularity under Rule 9(b) and the Reform Act for pleading fraud. Section 10(b) allegations must meet the strict pleading requirements of Rule 9(b). <em>Advanta, </em>180 F.3d at 532. The requisite \u201cstrong inference\u201d of fraud \u201cmay be established either (a) by alleging facts to show that the defendant had both motive and opportunity to commit fraud, or (b) by alleging facts that constitute strong circumstantial evidence of conscious misbehavior or recklessness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 534. Supplementing Rule 9(b), the Reform Act requires a plaintiff, \u201cwith respect to <em>each </em>act or omission alleged to violate this chapter, state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that ... [each] defendant acted with the required state of mind.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2) (emphasis added). This requirement is not, to put it mildly, lightly regarded in securities fraud cases. <em>Oran, </em>226 F.3d at 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">a. Lacking Proof of the Individual Defendants\u2019 Motive to Commit Fraud, Plaintiff Has Not Pled the Requisite Scienter</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Essentially, Plaintiffs seek damages based on the theory that the Individual Defendants artificially inflated Cybershop\u2019s stock price so that they could sell stock before the company disclosed unfavorable information in the Amended 10-Q. Lacking facts establishing each of the Individual Defendant\u2019s motive to commit fraud, however, the amended complaint disregards well-settled pleading standards. Additionally, the amended complaint does not even allege that Leist sold any shares. While Plaintiff pleads that Tauber and Phillips sold shares at critical times, that fact, even when assumed true, does not alone establish fraud. <em>See Advanta, </em>180 F.3d at 540 (recognizing that insider sales that occur before a stock price declines do not alone give rise to an inference of fraud.); <em>see also Burlington Coat, </em>114 F.3d at 1424 (observing that such inference would be wholly improper because \u201c[a] large number of today\u2019s corporate executives are compensated in terms of stock and stock options. It follows, then, that these individuals will trade in those securities in the normal turn of events.\u201d); <em>Milestone Scientific, </em>103 F.Supp.2d at 471 (rejecting a claim that a fraudulent motive may be inferred where company\u2019s CEO sold his stock before the company disclosed adverse information because \u201cthe proceeds [of the transactions] were the result of accumulated stock options and were an intended part of [the executive\u2019s] overall compensation,\u201d) Moreover, both Phillips and Tauber sold shares of their stock, but those sales affected minimally their overall holdings. (Schiller Aff. at Ex. 6, 7, 9); <em>see Advanta, </em>180 F.3d at 540-41 (declining to infer fraud from the fact that insiders sold stock, particularly where those sales represented only minimal percentages of their holdings.). Indeed, even after his November 1999 stock sales, Tau-ber remained the company\u2019s single largest shareholder with over 2 million shares. (Schiller Aff. at Ex. 6, 9); <em>see Advanta, </em>180 F.3d at 540-41 (finding that, \u201c[f|ar from supporting a strong inference that defendants had a motive to capitalize on artificially inflated stock prices,\u201d the fact that \u201cdefendants continued to hold a sizeable percentage of [the Company\u2019s] stock even after their [sales] suggest they had every incentive to keep [the Company] profitable.\u201d); <em>Burlington Coat, </em>114 F.3d at 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Contrary to Plaintiffs allegations, the timing of Tauber\u2019s sales raises no particular suspicion. \u201c[0]nly if such sales were unusual in scope or timing\u201d might they be so suspect as to imply scienter. <em>Nice Sys., </em>135 F.Supp.2d at 583 (quoting <em>Oran, </em>226 F.3d at 280) (citations omitted). In fact, Tauber sold his stock one month after the company reported its third quarter results and before fourth quarter results were known. Additionally, he sold stock during the same week in both 1998 and 1999, and, in fact, sold 200,000 shares at a far higher price in 1998. (Schiller Aff., Ex. 30.) In short, neither the timing of Tauber\u2019s sales nor the amount of shares sold establishes an inference of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Furthermore, Plaintiff has not met its pleading burden in alleging that Cyber-shop\u2019s Officers and Directors signed public statements and were well informed of the company\u2019s regular business. (Am. Comply 73.) This is because \u201c[allegations that a director or officer signed public disclosures and/or was involved in the company\u2019s daily operations, standing alone, will not satisfy the pleading requirements of the PSLRA or Rule 9(b).\u201d <em>In re Cendant Corp. Sec. Litig., 76 </em>F.Supp.2d 539, 547 (D.N.J.1999); <em>see Advanta </em>180 F.3d at 539 (holding that mere assertion that a defendant was an officer or director with access to unidentified, confidential information is insufficient to plead fraud); <em>Milestone Scientific, </em>103 F.Supp.2d at 470 (\u201c[Generalized imputations of knowledge do not suffice, regardless of the position of the defendant within the company.\u201d). The risk, of course, is that if such bald allegations sufficiently establish fraud, then virtually all corporate directors or executives will presumptively possess fraudulent intent. <em>In re Health Mgmt. Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>970 F.Supp. 192, 205 (E.D.N.Y.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Overall, Plaintiff pleads no facts demonstrating that the Individual Defendants acted with scienter. Absent a showing of scienter then, Plaintiffs amended complaint cannot survive this 12(b)(6) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">b. Plaintiffs Alternative Allegations of Recklessness are Insufficient to Establish Scienter</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">Alternatively, Plaintiff claims that Defendants acted with such extreme recklessness that conscious misbehavior should be inferred. Amended Complaint at \u00b6\u00b6 38, 39, 46, 51, 54, 58, 61, 64, 82, 84. Recklessness is defined as \u201can extreme departure from the standard of ordinary care ..., which presents a danger of misleading that is either known to the defendant or is so obvious that the actor must be aware of it.\u201d <em>Advanta, </em>180 F.3d at 535. \u201cConscious behavior in this sense refers to \u2018intentional fraud or other deliberate illegal behavior.\u2019 \u201d <em>Milestone Scientific, </em>103 F.Supp.2d at 454. Absent \u201cstrong circumstantial evidence\u201d of scienter, a party cannot establish recklessness. <em>Acito v. IMC-ERA Group Inc., </em>47 F.3d 47, 52 (2d Cir.1995). The Amended Complaint contains no allegations of fact, much less particularized facts, that might show that each, or any, of the Individual Defendants acted recklessly. Aside from the fact that Cybershop is not responsible for any material misstatements of omissions, it voluntarily filed an Amended 10-Q in February 2000. The Court agrees with Defendants that Cybershop\u2019s amended filing does not reflect recklessness, let alone intentional fraud. The Company acted so as to timely comply with GAAP standards, not to mislead or deceive.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">In examining the amended complaint, the Court further finds that Plaintiffs theory that Defendants acted recklessly in making optimistic statements about the future when they knew otherwise fails. \u201cWhere plaintiffs contend defendants had access to contrary facts, they must specifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>cally identify the reports or statements containing this information.\u201d <em>Novak v. Kasaks, </em>216 F.3d 300, 308 (2d Cir.2000); <em>Milestone Scientific, </em>103 F.Supp.2d at 465. But Plaintiff does not plead those facts in the amended Complaint. That pleading does not identify a single fact or internal report indicating that the 1999 holiday season would not be strong or that Defendants had the foresight to know in November 1999 that the company\u2019s e-tailer business would fall. To be sure, Defendants cannot be found reckless based sheerly on hindsight. As a final observation, the Court agrees with Defendants that basic logic dictates against a finding that the company misled investors concerning third quarter results only to reveal its plan a few short months later. <em>See Shields v. Citytrust Bancorp. Inc., </em>25 F.3d 1124, 1130 (2d Cir.1994). If this were true, as Defendants point out, the Individual Defendants likely would have been selling stock through March 2000 and unlikely would have issued the Amended 10-Q.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Having found that Plaintiffs Amended Complaint fails to plead any cause of action for a securities violation under 10b-5 and also fails to satisfy the Rule 9(b) and Reform Act pleading standards, the Court need not address Defendants\u2019 alternative arguments that Plaintiffs failure to satisfy other Reform Act pleading requirements also warrants a dismissal. (Def.\u2019s Br., Pt. IV.)</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">X. Plaintiff is not Entitled to Leave to Amend its Pleading</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Though it fails to specify how it would amend its pleading so as to withstand a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), Plaintiff contends that the Court, alternatively, should dismiss without prejudice the amended complaint and grant leave to amend its pleading! (Pl.\u2019s Oppos. Mem. at 39 n. 21.) Defendants oppose leave to amend as a futile exercise that would thwart the interests of justice. (Defs.\u2019 Reply Br. at 11.) They additionally point out that Plaintiff had an opportunity to revise its pleading when the Court consolidated this matter. (Defs.\u2019 Reply Br. at 11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">The Court agrees. Plaintiff has already had its proverbial \u201csecond bite at the apple.\u201d Originally, the parties filed thirteen complaints. At a case conference on the matter, the Court directed Plaintiff to proceed no further until they reviewed Cyber-shop\u2019s annual report for its discussion of the New York Times article at issue in the case. Presumably, Plaintiff read that report. After the Court appointed their lead counsel, Plaintiff filed the consolidated amended class action complaint that is the subject of this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">Ever mindful that leave to amend is ordinarily granted, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a), the Court finds that any likely amendment will not cure the deficiencies plaguing the amended complaint. <em>See Foman v. Davis, </em>371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962) (explaining that it is within the court\u2019s discretion to deny leave to amend for undue delay, bad faith, dilatory motive, repeated failure to cure deficiencies, undue prejudice to non-moving party or futility of amendment); <em>In re Champion Enter., Inc., Sec. Litig., </em>145 F.Supp.2d 871, 872 (E.D.Mich.2001) (citing <em>Foman </em>for same proposition). Plaintiff has failed to proffer any proposed, substantive amendment that would satisfy applicable pleading requirements; indeed, it does not suggest any amendment at all. Plaintiff had ample opportunity to craft a sufficiently pled complaint when the Court directed it to review the annual report, consolidated the thirteen pending cases into this single class action, and ordered the lead Plaintiff to file an amended class action complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Moreover, the Court finds that leave to amend is improper because the Reform Act restricts Rule 15 in securities cases. <em>In re Champion Enter., </em>145 F.Supp.2d at 872. Essentially, the Reform Act would be \u201cmeaningless\u201d if judges liberally granted leave to amend on a limitless basis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-4\">If the Reform Act is read to mean that when a complaint is filed under the Reform Act, a judge must scrutinize the complaint and advise the pleader where the complaint is deficient, and then give the pleader an opportunity to amend the complaint, and when that is done, the judge must again, perhaps like a law school professor, advise the pleader that he or she has not passed the test, and if not, give the pleader another opportunity to meet the heightened pleading requirements, and even after that, still another opportunity, if the pleader requests it, then the Reform Act is meaningless. If this is the interpretation of the Act, then Rule 15 always trumps the plain requirements of the Act, and what Congress did when it passed this act over a presidential veto, means nothing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-5\"><em>Id.; see In re: NAHC, Inc., </em>2001 WL 1241007 at *26 (E.D.Pa. Oct. 17, 2001) (agreeing with <em>In re Champion Enter, </em>that Congress deliberately set higher burdens on plaintiffs in pleading securities fraud actions \u2018to provide a filter at the earliest stage (the pleading stage) to screen out lawsuits that have no factual basis.\u2019 (quotations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Thus, to prevent futile amendments and to preserve the integrity of the Reform Act, the Court denies Plaintiff leave to amend its amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">XI. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">For all of the foregoing reasons, the Court dismisses with prejudice Plaintiffs consolidated class action complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. An appropriate order follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">Before the Court is Defendants\u2019 motion for dismissal of the consolidated amended complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Plaintiff has opposed this motion. For the reasons set forth in the accompanying written opinion,</p>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">\u2022IT IS on this _ day of March 2002</p>\n<p id=\"b279-13\">ORDERED that Defendants\u2019 motion for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is GRANTED, and it is further</p>\n<p id=\"b279-14\">ORDERED that this dismissal shall be with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-16\">This case is closed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b258-8\">. \"T\u201d refers to the Transcript of Proceedings taken on January 4, 2002.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b259-7\">.

Defendants\u2019 brief in support of this motion criticizes Plaintiff's blind reliance on the February 29, 2000 New York Times article as the catalyst for this class action suit. Although the article appears to be rife with inaccuracies, the Court simply does not consider its content in deciding Defendants' motion to dismiss. For purposes of ruling on this 12(b)(6) motion, the Court relies only on those documents that are, indeed, \u201cintegral to\u201d the complaint's allegations, <em>Burlington Coat, </em>114 F.3d at 1426 (citation and quotations omitted), namely, documents reporting and commenting on Cybershop's raw data and calculations during the relevant time period.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
