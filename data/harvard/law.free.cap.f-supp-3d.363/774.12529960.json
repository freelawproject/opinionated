[ECF # 92], and Defendant Cross Trailer's Summary Judgment Reply, Def.'s Summ. J. Reply [ECF # 95]. For the reasons below, the Court orders Defendant CTMS's Motion for Summary Judgment be\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Underlying Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The instant dispute arises from U.S. Trademark Number 4,520,252 (\"Mark *252\" or the \"Mark\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pl.'s Second Am. Complaint \u00b6 10 [ECF # 101]. Plaintiff Cross Trailers alleges it owns Mark *252 as applied to cargo trailers in Trademark Manual Class 12 (Vehicles; apparatus for locomotion by land, air or water).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This mark, Plaintiff claims, consists of the term CROSS as used on Class 12 trailers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It is also often associated with a cross symbol, though the mark does not appear to include the symbol on its own.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; CROSS, Reg. No. 4,520,252.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff sells cargo trailers bearing Mark *252 primarily in the Midwest with operations in the northern-most South as well. Pl.'s Summ. J. Resp., Ex. A (Lovely Decl. \u00b6 10). Cross Trailers does not maintain any dealer relationships in Texas and did not at any relevant time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It does maintain a website accessible across the United States and receives inquiries from individuals located in Texas about its services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. Cross Trailers markets itself on social media in multiple languages and provides its English Facebook page as an example.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. Plaintiff regularly participates in the North American Trailer Dealer Association (NATDA) and advertises in the Association's magazine.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6-7. While Plaintiff provides little information on the number of its direct sales, a part-owner of the company, Terry Lovely, testified: \"Cross Trailers, Inc. has seriously considered opening additional manufacturing facilities in PA, IA, GA, UT and / or Texas.\" Lovely Decl. \u00b6 12. It is undisputed at least seven of Plaintiff's trailers were sold in Texas during CTMS's operation. Def.'s Summ. J. Reply at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant also sells cargo trailers under the 'Cross' name and often bearing cross imagery. Pl.'s Complaint \u00b6 12. It represents that it is focused on Texas and makes little to no effort to expand its market beyond states \"surrounding\" Texas. Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. at 5. A customer list from Defendant identifies dealerships in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Massachusetts as customers. Def.'s Mot. Summ. J., Ex. A-6 (Cust. List Summ. at 1-6). A properly-authenticated list of Defendant's trailer sales, however, does not identify the locations of the customers. Def.'s Mot. Summ. J., Ex. D-1 (Sales Report at 1). Regardless, CTMS's primary market is located in Texas, though a not-insignificant-portion of its trailers were sold across the country and often in states where Plaintiff's trailers were already being registered by customers. Cathey Decl., Ex. 3 (Surveys Rep. at 1-7) (explained more thoroughly in section\n   C, subsection i. of the Court's discussion, infra).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Defendant-Movant CTMS filed its Motion for Summary Judgment on May 10, 2018, arguing no genuine dispute exists on the \"likelihood of confusion\" prong of Plaintiff's Section 32 Trademark Infringement claim. Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. at 1-2;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201114\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1). The specific issue Defendant CTMS raised in its Motion was the apparent lack of geographic overlap in markets between it and Plaintiff Cross Trailers, which Defendant argued defeats de facto Plaintiff's trademark infringement claim. Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. at 2 (\"because there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding the alleged infringement, trial is unnecessary and final summary judgment in favor of Defendant is warranted\"). Defendant relied in part on the testimony of its owner Larry Cathey, who opined Plaintiff's prospects of establishing a dealership base in Texas in the near future were remote.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201114\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201114\">\n    at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff responded to Defendant's Motion on May 31, 2018. Pl.'s Summ. J. Resp. First, Plaintiff objected to the testimony of Larry Cathy regarding Plaintiff's potential expansion to Texas.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201114\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201114\">\n    at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, it argued CTMS did not show the conflicting marks were used in separate and distinct geographic markets as alleged and produced evidence it claim showed both a likelihood of confusion and actual confusion by customers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201114\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201114\">\n    at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Dawn Donut Co. v.

Its evidence included testimony by its owner, Terry Lovely, of instances of actual confusion. Pl.'s Summ. J. Resp. at 3. Third, it asked the Court to defer ruling until additional discovery was complete.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. Plaintiff generally discussed a delay to encompass the discovery period (ending October 26, 2018) or a spoliation ruling for which no timetable is known.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-18. In the five months since Plaintiff requested time for discovery, Plaintiff made no effort to supplement the summary judgment record with additional evidence obtained during this period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant replied on June 7, 2018 and filed objections to Plaintiff's Response. Def.'s Summ. J. Reply. Defendant objected to the entirety of Plaintiff's customer confusion evidence as inadmissible.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. It further objected to the Lovely Declaration as impermissibly-conclusory.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Otherwise, Defendant reasserted the overlap of its customers and Plaintiff's was a rarity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. It also argued deferral of its Motion was unnecessary given the level of discovery already completed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10. CTMS did not respond to Plaintiff's objection to the testimony of witness Cathy. Plaintiff, for its part, never responded to CTMS's objections to its evidence, either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On June 22, 2018 Plaintiff moved unopposed for leave to file a new complaint. Pl.'s Mot. Leave [ECF # 99]. The Court granted leave and accepted Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint on July 9, 2018. Pl.'s Second Am. Compl. The new complaint added causes of action under Section 43 of the Lanham Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Trade Dress Infringement) as well as Texas Common Law (Trademark Infringement, Unfair Competition, and Unjust Enrichment).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 26-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
