GAYLES, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS CAUSE\n   </strong>\n   comes before the Court upon Defendant The Insurance Company of the State of Pennsylvania's (\"Defendant\") Motion for Final Summary Judgment (the \"Motion\"). [ECF No. 45]. The Court has considered the Motion, the record, argument of counsel at the hearing on the Motion, and is otherwise fully advised. For the reasons set forth below, the Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Underlying Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 26, 2013, Plaintiff Jane Doe (\"Plaintiff\") filed an action (the \"Underlying Action\") against Cayman Style Ocean Adventures, Inc. (\"CSOA\") and its employee Shawn Mourao (\"Mourao\"). On March 3, 2014, Plaintiff filed her Second Amended Complaint in the Underlying Action bringing claims for negligence, sexual assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress (the \"Underlying Complaint\"). [ECF No. 29]. Aside from the direct negligence claim against CSOA, Plaintiff's claims were brought against Mourao individually and against CSOA based on vicarious liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As set forth in the Underlying Complaint, on July 22, 2012, Plaintiff embarked on a seven-day Caribbean cruise on the Carnival Legend. For the cruise's stop in Grand Cayman, Plaintiff purchased a three-hour beach and party boat snorkeling excursion operated by CSOA. On July\n   27, 2012, Plaintiff went ashore to participate in the excursion. Upon arriving at the CSOA excursion vessel, Plaintiff was introduced to Mourao who identified himself as the captain. When the CSOA excursion vessel returned to the harbor, Plaintiff disembarked and remarked that she needed to use the bathroom before returning to the Carnival Legend. Mourao offered to direct Plaintiff to the nearest bathroom. Rather than assist Plaintiff, Mourao led her to a nearby shopping center where he detained her against her will in a small room and sexually assaulted her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   CSOA and Mourao failed to appear in or defend the Underlying Action. After clerk's defaults were entered against both, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Entry of Final Default Judgment [ECF No. 42-4]. The court entered a Final Default Judgment as to Liability [ECF No. 42-6], but reserved judgment as to damages pending an evidentiary hearing. After the evidentiary hearing, the court entered a Final Default Judgment in the amount of $ 1,988,460.54 against CSOA and Mourao jointly and severally. [ECF No. 42-7].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Policies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the time of the allegations in the Underlying Complaint, CSOA and Mourao were insured by Defendant under a Foreign Commercial General Liability Policy [ECF No. 1-1]. A second policy, the Foreign Commercial Package Policy, which is materially identical, was also issued to \"Cayman Style Ocean Adventures, Ltd.\" [ECF No. 1-2] (collectively the \"Policies\"). The relevant provisions of the Policies provide:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     SECTION I - COVERAGES\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    COVERAGE A BODILY INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Subject to any deductibles, limitations, terms, conditions, sublimits and exclusions contained in the Declarations, together with any Schedules applicable to this Foreign Commercial General Liability Coverage Part, we agree to provide coverage to you to the extent herein provided.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   1.

Based on its interpretation of the Policies, Defendant denied coverage in the Underlying Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Current Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Plaintiff brought this lawsuit for breach of contract and declaratory relief seeking to recover the full amount of the Final Default judgment in the Underlying Lawsuit. In her First Amended Complaint [ECF No. 29] and in the pleadings presently before this Court, Plaintiff argues that Defendant must indemnify its insureds because the Final Default Judgment falls within the terms of the Policies and no exclusions apply. Defendant has moved for summary judgment arguing that there is no coverage for the Final Default Judgment under the Policies because Plaintiff's losses are excluded by the Abuse and Molestation Exclusion endorsement and under the plain language of the insuring agreements. Defendant has also filed a counterclaim, seeking a declaratory judgment that neither policy applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a), \"[t]he court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). \"[T]he plain language of Rule 56 [a] mandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a party who\n   fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

Interpretation of the Policy Language\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Defendant raises two primary arguments for why Plaintiff's injuries are not covered: (1) that the assault was not an \"accident\" or \"occurrence\" covered under the Policy's terms, and (2) that the plain language of the insurance policy excludes Plaintiff's injuries, namely that Mourao's conduct is excluded from coverage under the abuse or molestation endorsement. Each is discussed in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    1. Whether The Judgment Falls Under The Policies' Insuring Agreement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   At issue is whether the assault is covered under the policy because it constituted a \"bodily injury ... caused by an occurrence.\" The insurance policy defines \"occurrence\" as an \"accident.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The term \"accident\" is not defined. Defendant argues that the assault was not an occurrence because CSOA had actual knowledge\n   of prior abuse by Mourao, and thus, it was an expected injury. Defendant points out that Plaintiff's Underlying Complaint repeatedly states that Defendant knew that Mourao was a liability. Plaintiff counters that her assault was an occurrence because the allegations in her Underlying Complaint\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   stated that CSOA \"should have known\" about Mourao's incidents. She contends that because CSOA \"should have known\" (but did not know) certain facts about Mourao, CSOA could not have expected or intended that Plaintiff would suffer bodily injury at his hands. Thus the only question is whether the assault was expected from CSOA's viewpoint. If it was, the assault is not covered under the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Florida precedent defines \"accident\" as an \"accidental event [causing] injuries or damage\" that is \"neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.\"\n   <em>\n    Singer v.

The Abuse or Molestation Exclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The insurance policy contains an \"abuse or molestation exclusion,\" which effectively releases Defendant from coverage if its insured sexually assaults anyone in the insured's \"care custody or control.\" Both parties agree that Doe's rape constitutes \"abuse or molestation.\" At issue is whether the abuse occurred when she was under the \"care, custody, or control\" of CSOA and Mourao.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Defendant argues that CSOA and Mourao had \"care, custody, or control\" of Plaintiff because: (1) Plaintiff alleged that both CSOA and Mourao owed her a duty to protect and care for her safety, and (2) Mourao was acting in the course and scope of his employment at the time of the assault. In support of this, Defendant cites a series of cases discussing materially similar abuse or molestation exclusions, where children were placed in the custody of a caregiver other than their parents, were abused, and subsequently were found to be outside the scope of relevant insurance provisions.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am.

Defendant also cites several cases concerning imputing an employee's negligence to its employer, presumably in support of an argument that the insurance policies exclude coverage for \"the negligent ... employment ... investigation ... or retention\" of an employee whose conduct would be excluded. [ECF No. 48 at 13].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Plaintiff argues that this exclusion does not apply because she was not in the \"care, custody, or control\" of CSOA or Mourao at the time of the incident for two reasons: (1) the excursion ended when she reached her destination and disembarked the party boat, ending Mourao and CSOA's \"care, custody, or control,\" and (2) that although Mourao's actions originated in the course and scope of his employment during the assault, whether he was acting in the \"course and scope of his employment\" is legally different from whether she was in his \"care, custody, or control.\" [ECF No. 48 at 12-13].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \"Care, custody, or control\" is a phrase frequently used in insurance contracts.\n   <em>\n    Shankle v.

The parties here do not dispute these definitions, only how they apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The parties agree that Plaintiff is an adult woman who went on a cruise excursion. Mourao, a staff member of the cruise excursion and her assailant, guided her to the bathroom at her request, where he then assaulted her. And the Underlying Complaint, whose facts are accepted as true, alleges that \"at all relevant times, Mourao was acting within the course and scope of his employment and/or exercising his duties as a member of the CSA crew[,]\" and that the sexual assault happened \"during\" the excursion. [ECF No. 42-1 \u00b6\u00b6 26, 47, 48]. This fact was key to obtaining a judgment against CSOA in the underlying action, as opposed to judgment only against Mourao. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38-40, 45-54, 57-63, 66-75, 78-85]. Plaintiff cannot change her position on this key fact now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The Court finds that the admitted allegations in the Underlying Complaint establish that the Abuse or Molestation exclusion eliminates coverage. All of the underlying claims either involved abuse or molestation or are deemed to have arose out of the abuse or molestation of Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chabad House\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3819438\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/771/1336/#p1340\">\n    771 F.Supp.2d at 1340-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The allegations also establish that Plaintiff was still in the custody or control of Mourao and CSOA at the time of the assault. Plaintiff alleges the assault occurred during the excursion where Mourao was both acting in the scope of his employment and had a duty to protect and care for Plaintiff's safety. Although he breached this duty, that does not change the nature of their relationship: Plaintiff was still in his \"care, custody, or control\" when he guided her to the bathroom at her request, then locked the door, and detained her so she could not leave. Given the scope and context of the \"case, custody, or control\" provision, and the context of the insurance policy, the facts are sufficient to show that Plaintiff was in the care of Mourao and CSOA at the time of her assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Defendant's Counterclaim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Defendant's counterclaim seeks a declaratory order that Defendant \"has no duty to indemnify Jane Doe for the default judgment\" against CSOA and Mourao under either of the two policies. Plaintiff asserted four affirmative defenses, but conceded her fourth affirmative defense in her pleadings, and has also agreed that her third affirmative defense only applies if the Court rules that coverage exists. The policies are materially and functionally similar, and the Court has found for the Defendant on the pertinent issues. Thus, Plaintiff's remaining defenses are rendered moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
