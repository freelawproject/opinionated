DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff brings his claim under a provision of the TCPA which prohibits the use of an automatic telephone dialing system (\"ATDS\") to call a cellular telephone without the recipient's consent. The TCPA provides in pertinent part: It shall be unlawful for any person within the United States ... to make any call ... using any [ATDS] ... to any telephone number assigned to a ... cellular telephone service....\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A)(iii). A text message to a cellular telephone qualifies as a \"call\" within the meaning of the TCPA.\n   <em>\n    Gager v. Dell Fin. Servs., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076722\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/727/265/\">\n    727 F.3d 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 269 n. 2 (3d Cir. 2013). Thus, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant violated the TCPA when it sent him text messages without his consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant argues that Plaintiff's Complaint fails to state a claim under the TCPA because Plaintiff has not provided a sufficient factual basis for the assertion that Defendant used either an ATDS or prerecorded voice and sent solicitation text messages to Plaintiff's cellular phone without Plaintiff's consent. Specifically, Defendant contends that at a minimum Plaintiff should be required to provide the phone number at which he received the alleged messages. Additionally, Defendant maintains that Plaintiff's class allegations should be stricken because Plaintiff's allegations concerning the number of members in the proposed class are too speculative to satisfy the plausibility requirement under\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As Defendant appears to acknowledge in its Reply,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [12] at 2, at the pleading stage, the TCPA does not require Plaintiff to \"allege his specific cellular telephone number.\"\n   <em>\n    Manfred v. Bennett Law, PLLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 12-CV-61548,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%206102071\">\n    2012 WL 6102071\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 n. 2 (S.D. Fla. Dec. 7, 2012). Indeed, in a TCPA case in the Southern District of Florida involving similar allegations, the court found that despite not identifying the specific telephone number called or texted, allegations of the \"date and content of the text message, and that numerous other persons received the same text to their cell phones ... are sufficient to meet plaintiff's obligation to\n   provide the grounds of his entitlement to relief, and provide sufficient notice to Defendant to answer the complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    Buslepp v. Improv Miami, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 12-60171-CIV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201560408\">\n    2012 WL 1560408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (S.D. Fla. May 4, 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Here, Plaintiff's Complaint includes a screenshot of the allegedly violative text messages, setting forth the content of the text messages. The screenshot shows the date (but not the year) that the five text messages were sent, which, together with Plaintiff's allegation that the messages were sent between November 2, 2017 and April 1, 2018, establishes the particular date that each message was allegedly sent to Plaintiff. Plaintiff also sufficiently alleges that the text messages were sent\n   <em>\n    en masse\n   </em>\n   using an ATDS. Plaintiff's allegations concerning the circumstances surrounding the text messages - the messages' ability to trigger an automated response by replying \"Y,\" the messages' commercial and generic content, and that the messages were sent from a short code - create a plausible inference of autodialing.\n   <em>\n    Keim v. ADF Midatlantic, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 12-80577-CIV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%2011713593\">\n    2015 WL 11713593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20159070\">\n    2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 159070\n   </extracted-citation>\n   *13 (S.D. Fla. Nov. 9, 2015) (collecting cases). Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to state a claim under the TCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Turning to Plaintiff's class allegations, given the factual allegations identified in the preceding paragraph, it is entirely plausible that thousands of individuals may be entitled to relief from Defendant's alleged misconduct. Requiring Plaintiff to plead with greater particularity those facts concerning the size of the putative class is unnecessary at this early stage of the litigation. The issue of numerosity is more properly determined on a motion for class certification.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
