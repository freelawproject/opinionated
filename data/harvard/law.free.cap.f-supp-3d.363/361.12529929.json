(Doc. 1.) On May 14, 2018, Applicants submitted a letter with revisions to the Application (\"May 14 Letter\"). (Doc. 8.)

(Appl. Mem. 3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Livingstone Decl. \u00b6 4.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The IREO Funds are managed by multiple entities affiliated with IREO, an Indian consortium comprised of over 100 companies. (Roxborough Decl. \u00b6 5.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Applicants, Lalit Goyal founded and acts as the de facto manager of the IREO Funds, exercising total control over all aspects of IREO's business in India. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Beginning in 2015, investors in the IREO Funds, including Applicant Children's Fund, began to voice concerns over mismanagement of the IREO Funds and lack of transparency. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) Applicants filed several actions in Mauritius seeking to enforce their rights as investors, which the IREO Funds opposed. (3/21/18 Portnoy Decl. Exs. K-L.) Applicants claim that they have also become aware of at least three specific frauds perpetrated by Goyal, which allegedly resulted in the misappropriation of over $ 150 million in investor assets. (Appl. Mem. 5; Applicants 8/13/18 Opp.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, Applicants claim that IREO Grace Realtech Private Ltd. (\"IREO Grace\"), an IREO Indian operating subsidiary, used investor assets to purchase land rights from a group of four land-owning companies that were owned or controlled by Goyal or his associates. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 8, at 1-2; Roxborough Decl. \u00b6 15.) Goyal allegedly directed IREO Grace to acquire land and development licenses in Gurgaon for approximately $ 85 million more than what was commercially justified. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 8, at 1-2; Roxborough Decl. \u00b6 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Second, Applicants claim that IREO Private Ltd. (\"IREO Private\"), at the direction of Goyal, advanced approximately $ 62 million to certain third-party \"broker companies\" in Bhiwadi, India, using investor assets. (Doc. 8, at 2.; Roxborough Decl. \u00b6 16.) IREO Private allegedly received nothing in return for this advance except development rights to certain land in Bhiwadi. (Doc. 8, at 2.; Roxborough Decl. \u00b6 16.) However, according to Applicants, several years after its acquisition, the land remained undeveloped and, within four years, the value of the land was almost entirely written off by IREO Private. (Doc. 8, at 2; Roxborough Decl. \u00b6 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Third, Applicants claim that Goyal, through the use of his personal majority ownership interests in several land-owning companies, continues to misappropriate valuable IREO assets for his personal benefit, to the detriment of the IREO Funds and their investors. (Chandhoke Decl. \u00b6 10.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Applicants seek documentary and testimonial evidence for use in foreign proceedings related to the alleged mismanagement and suspected frauds involving the IREO Funds in Mauritius, India, and the United Kingdom (the \"Foreign Proceedings\"). First, as referenced above, beginning in or about 2015, Applicants and other investors initiated several actions in Mauritius (the \"Mauritius Proceedings\") to enforce their rights as investors against the IREO Funds. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   3/21/18 Portnoy Decl. Ex. K; Rajah Decl. \u00b6 3.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   These proceedings include an action to obtain books and records, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), an action to wind up one of the IREO Funds after its limited life had expired (\"Winding Up Proceeding\"), (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   3/21/18 Portnoy Decl. Ex. L; Rajah Decl. \u00b6 4), an action to convene a shareholder meeting for one of the IREO Funds to replace board members, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   3/21/18 Portnoy Decl. Ex. K; Rajah Decl. \u00b6 3), and liquidation proceedings relating to one of the IREO Funds (\"Liquidation Proceeding\"), (Rajah Decl. \u00b6 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Second, Applicants Children's Fund and Axon filed a criminal complaint on February 28, 2018 with the New Delhi Police Station in India against the IREO Funds, associated companies, and their directors/officers, including Goyal. (Livingstone Decl. \u00b6 8.) The criminal complaint relates specifically to the first two of the suspected frauds described above. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) Applicants Children's Fund and Axon filed a second criminal complaint in India on May 19, 2018, which relates to the third suspected fraud discussed above (the two criminal complaints are collectively referred to as the \"Indian Criminal Proceedings\"). (Gupta Mem. \u00b6 6.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Third, Applicant Children's Fund commenced an arbitration on April 6, 2018 in the London Court of International Arbitration (\"LCIA\") against one of the IREO Funds, its manager, and its controlling shareholder pursuant to the dispute resolution clause in the Fund's shareholder agreement (\"London Proceeding\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rajah Decl. \u00b6 3; Roxborough Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 10-16.) In the London Proceeding, Applicant Children's Fund alleges claims for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty and requests damages and termination of the fund management agreement. (Roxborough Decl. \u00b6 13.) The deadline to submit documentary evidence in that proceeding is March 15, 2019. (Applicants' Ltr. 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Applicants submitted the Application ex parte on March 21, 2018. (Doc. 1.) After reviewing the Application, I entered an order instructing Applicants to appear for a hearing on May 17, 2018 and to submit a letter to justify the breadth of the discovery sought. (Doc. 7.) Prior to the hearing, Applicants submitted the May 14 Letter, which significantly narrowed the scope of the discovery they sought from Respondents. (Doc. 8.) At the hearing on May 17, 2018, Applicants answered additional questions about the scope of discovery. After considering Applicants' memorandum of law in support of the initial Application, (Doc. 5), the declaration of Lawrence Portnoy, Esq. in support of the Application and\n   its exhibits, (Doc. 6), the May 14 Letter, (Doc. 8), and arguments made by Applicants at the May 17, 2018 hearing, I granted the Application as revised by the May 14 Letter, authorizing Applicants to take the requested discovery from Respondents, (Doc. 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After Applicants served the subpoenas on Respondents, on July 13, 2018, Respondent IREO Subsidiary filed a motion to vacate the Approving Order, quash the subpoenas, and for a protective order against the deposition subpoena. (Docs. 14-17.) On August 13, 2018, Applicants filed their opposition to Respondent IREO Subsidiary's motion, (Docs. 19-20), and on August 22, 2018, they filed a motion to compel compliance with the subpoenas, (Doc. 23). On September 3, 2018, Respondent IREO Subsidiary filed: (1) its reply memorandum in support of its motion to vacate the Approving Order; (2) its opposition to Applicants' motion to compel; and (3) a cross-motion to stay discovery. (Docs. 27-32.) Applicants opposed the cross-motion to stay on September 10, 2018, (Doc. 34), and Respondent IREO Subsidiary filed its reply in support of the motion to stay on September 12, 2018, (Doc. 36-38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On November 29, 2018, Applicants and Respondent Wisch submitted a joint letter, informing me that Respondent Wisch also intended to file a motion to quash the subpoenas and for a protective order. (Doc. 42.) Respondent Wisch submitted the motion on December 28, 2018, (Doc. 45), which Applicants opposed on January 4, 2019, (Doc. 51). On the same day, Applicants filed a letter motion for leave to file a motion to compel Respondent Wisch to comply with the subpoenas and for attorneys' fees. (Doc. 51.) Respondent Wisch filed his reply on January 14, 2019. (Doc. 54.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On December 11, 2018, Applicants filed a request for expedited consideration of all motions pending before me, in light of an approaching March 15, 2019 deadline to submit documentary evidence in one of the proceedings underlying the Application.

(Resp't IREO Sub. Mem. 17-25.) First, IREO Subsidiary argues that the discovery sought is \"not in any manner tailored to the purposes for which [Applicants] claim to need that information,\" and the subpoenas are therefore \"a massive dragnet.\" (Resp't IREO Sub. Mem. 17-18.) Respondent IREO Subsidiary discusses why certain discovery requests may not apply to certain proceedings, but notably they fail to specifically state why any of the requests is not relevant to the London Proceeding. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-25.) As discussed below, all of the discovery sought is for use in the London Proceeding, and Respondent IREO Subsidiary's failure to specifically state why the requests are not narrowly tailored to the purposes of that proceeding weighs in Applicants' favor for purposes of the fourth discretionary factor.\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   Part IV.D. Moreover, IREO Subsidiary does not demonstrate how each request is irrelevant or overbroad.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pegoraro v.

Specifically, IREO Subsidiary argues that authorities in India and Mauritius have the power to compel the production of documents, even documents that are located in New York. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-23.) However, the Second Circuit has clearly explained that parties who seek discovery pursuant to \u00a7 1782 are not required to \"seek information through the foreign or international tribunal before requesting discovery from the district court.\"\n   <em>\n    Euromepa\n   </em>\n   , 51 F.3d at 1098 (internal quotation marks omitted).

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   For the reasons described above and in Part IV.D, I find that all of the discovery requested by Applicants is for use in the London Proceeding, that the LCIA meets the statutory \"for use\" requirement of \u00a7 1782, and that, at a minimum, Applicant Children's Fund is an interested person with regard to that proceeding. Accordingly, Respondent IREO Subsidiary's motion to vacate the Approving Order, quash the document and deposition subpoenas served on Respondent IREO Subsidiary, and for a protective order against the deposition subpoena is DENIED. Respondent IREO Subsidiary is instructed to comply with the subpoena issued and produce the discovery requested, including deposition testimony, to Applicant Children's Fund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Respondent Wisch's Motion to Quash\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Respondent Wisch \"adopt[ed,] ... incorporate[d] by reference\" and elaborated on Respondent IREO Subsidiary's arguments that the Applicants had failed to meet the statutory requirements of \u00a7 1782 and that the\n   <em>\n    Intel\n   </em>\n   discretionary factors weighed against granting the Application. (Resp't Wisch Mem. 12-14.) As discussed above, I have already found IREO Subsidiary's arguments unpersuasive.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part IV.A. Wisch's supplemental arguments fair no better, and I find them to be unpersuasive for the same reasons. Respondent Wisch also does not address Applicants' persuasive showing that the first three\n   <em>\n    Intel\n   </em>\n   discretionary factors weigh in favor of granting the Application, (Appl. Mem. 15-19), and therefore he concedes that they do.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    W.

(Resp't Wisch Mem. 14-18.) He identifies several considerations that I should weigh when conducting the \"undue burden\" analysis. As a preliminary matter, he argues that the analysis should be conducted in light of his minimal involvement with the IREO Funds. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp't Wisch Mem. 6 (asserting that he served only in \"limited advisory roles\"); Wisch Decl. \u00b6 4.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Applicants contest the accuracy of this characterization of Respondent Wisch's involvement in the IREO Funds, which is one of the topics Applicants seek to explore through deposition testimony. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Applicants 1/4/19 Opp. 5-8;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   1/4/19 Portnoy Decl. Ex.

His status as a non-party warrants consideration under Rule 26,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cohen v.

He asserts that the requests are duplicative because he is \"unlikely to have any documents or information that cannot more conveniently be garnered from ... the IREO entities which are parties\" in the Foreign Proceedings. (Resp't Wisch Mem. 16) (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Application of OOO Promnefstroy\n   </em>\n   , No. M. 19-99(RJS),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%203335608\">\n    2009 WL 3335608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 15, 2009).) However, Wisch provides no evidence to support this assertion, he does not describe with any particularity the documents that are allegedly in both his possession and the possession of a party to one of the Foreign Proceedings, and he does not identify which particular party might have those documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pegoraro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4282079\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/281/122/#p128\">\n    281 F.R.D. at 128-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These types of conclusory statements and self-serving speculation cannot form the basis of a Rule 26 objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Wisch also argues that the requests are unduly burdensome because he \"has already expended substantial time and resources preparing a witness statement.\" (Resp't Wisch Mem. 15.) However, the correspondence between counsel for Respondent Wisch and for Applicants during the negotiations surrounding the draft witness statement indicates that both parties clearly contemplated that if the parties did \"not reach agreement on a statement,\" Applicants may \"elect to proceed\" with formal discovery. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pecora Decl. Ex. 1.) Nonetheless, Wisch asserts that the requests are unduly burdensome because, having already produced the witness statement, he \"has no additional information to provide ... and requiring [him] to now prepare for and sit for a deposition would ... impose significant additional expense and unwarranted burden.\" (Resp't Wisch Mem. 15-16.) As an initial matter, his argument that he has no additional information strains credulity and is inconsistent with his assertion that requiring him to produce documents would be unduly burdensome. First, his argument suggests that his draft witness statement contains all of the information that is contained in the documents being sought; I find this assertion to at best be a gross exaggeration. Second, the argument is inconsistent because at the core of his argument of burden is the tacit acknowledgement that he is in possession of the requested documents,\n   and that those documents contain information. In addition, the law is clear that parties are \"ordinarily entitled to test a potential witness's claim that he has no relevant knowledge.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Application of Operacion y Supervision de Hoteles, S.A. de C.V. for an Order to Conduct Discovery for Use in a Foreign Proceeding\n   </em>\n   , No.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=14%20Misc.%2082\">\n    14 Misc. 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (PGG),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%2082007\">\n    2015 WL 82007\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 6, 2015). Respondent Wisch does not identify any authority in this district for the proposition that drafting a witness statement somehow immunizes a third party from deposition. In his reply, he identifies a single opinion in which a party's submission of sworn declarations demonstrating \"limited knowledge of the matters that [were] the subject of the underlying litigation.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp't Wisch's Reply 7-8) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Pizzuti v.

He asserts that his IREO-related physical documents are stored in multiple locations and are comingled with other, unrelated files. (Wisch Decl. \u00b6 17.) He further asserts that reviewing his electronic files would require him to upload 238 gigabytes of data-potentially millions of pages of documents-to a document reviewing platform. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Reviewing all of Respondent Wisch's physical and electronic files may indeed impose a significant burden, but such a burden does not ordinarily mandate that a subpoena be quashed. Rather, Applicants and Respondent Wisch should meet and confer to develop a discovery protocol to govern the search for and protection of documents, including a protocol for the search and production of electronic documents. I hold in abeyance any decision regarding which party will bear the costs of this production, pending further clarity-with the benefit of discovery-regarding the nature of Respondent Wisch's role in the IREO Funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   On balance, and in light of the \"twin aims\" of \u00a7 1782, I find that the discretionary factors weigh in favor of granting the Application. Accordingly, Respondent Wisch's motion to quash the subpoenas and for a protective order is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Motion to Compel and for Attorneys' Fees\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Local Rules of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York require a party to request an informal conference with the Court prior to filing a motion under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 26 through 37.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   L.R. 37.2. Rule 3 of my own Individual Rules &amp; Practices in Civil Cases requires parties to bring discovery disputes to my attention \"in a single letter, jointly composed, not to exceed five pages.\" Applicants characterize the parties' dispute about whether the Application satisfies the requirements of \u00a7 1782 as a discovery dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   (Doc. 23, at 1.). They argue that Respondent IREO Subsidiary's \"efforts to shirk its discovery obligations\" and its failure to follow the procedures set forth in Local Rule 37.2 and my Individual Rule 3 are proper grounds for an order compelling them to comply with the subpoenas. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). They also argue that Respondent Wisch has \"delayed and sought multiple extensions of time to respond\" to the subpoenas served on him. (Doc. 51, at 2.) These arguments miss the mark and fail to address the interplay between the Federal Rules and \u00a7 1782. First, but for Applicants' request to submit the Application ex parte, Respondents IREO and Wisch would have had an opportunity to challenge the legality of the Application itself before I entered the Approving Order. Respondent IREO Subsidiary's motion to vacate and to quash and Respondent Wisch's motion to quash challenge the validity of the Approving Order not just the contours of the requested discovery under the Federal Rules, and therefore the motions are properly characterized as having been brought pursuant to \u00a7 1782, not only \"under [Federal] Rules [of Civil Procedure] 26 through 37.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   L.R. 37.2. For the same reasons, my Individual Rule 3 does not apply to this dispute. Accordingly, Applicants' request that I enter an order compelling Respondent IREO Subsidiary to comply with the subpoenas, and Applicants' motion for leave to file a motion for an order compelling Respondent Wisch to comply with the subpoenas are DENIED without prejudice to refile the appropriate motions if Respondents IREO and Wisch fail to comply with the subpoenas.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp't IREO Sub.'s Reply 1-2.)

However, as discussed in Part IV.A.1.c, with the exception of the findings I made above, I do not have sufficient information to evaluate whether each Applicant is an \"interested person\" with regard to each of the Foreign Proceedings. I also do not have sufficient information before me to determine which discovery requests pertain to each of the Foreign Proceedings (except the London Proceeding). However, I do find that each Applicant is only entitled to documents produced pursuant to requests that are for use in a proceeding to which the Applicant is an interested person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Accordingly, Respondent IREO Subsidiary's motion to stay is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.

Discovery is only stayed as to Applicants Hohn and Axon, pending the outcome of the parties' conference.
