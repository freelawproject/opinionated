Defendants Stanley J. Pokorney (\"Pokorney\") and Scott Pokorney (\"Scott Pokorney\") (collectively with HUB, \"the Insurance Defendants\") joined in the motion. For the reasons set forth below, the court denies the motion to compel arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case arises out of the alleged embezzlement of millions of dollars from plaintiff Berkeley County School District (\"the District\"). The District alleges that its former Chief Financial Officer Brantley Thomas (\"Thomas\") conspired with HUB and HUB's employees Pokorney and Scott Pokorney to defraud the District through a concerted kickback scheme related to the purchasing of unnecessary insurance policies. Specifically, the District alleges that \"Thomas engaged in a pervasive scheme of corruption, in which he embezzled and misappropriated District funds, demanded and accepted multiple illegal kickbacks, and exposed the District to exorbitant fees and losses that have cost the taxpayers of Berkeley County tens of millions of dollars.\" ECF No. 36 at 2. Thomas allegedly conspired with Pokorney, who was the District's insurance consultant and broker, and HUB to concoct a scheme in which Thomas helped Pokorney and HUB obtain the District's insurance business in exchange for kickbacks. As part of this scheme, the District alleges, Thomas and the Insurance Defendants advised the District to purchase insurance policies that they knew were excessive and duplicative and for which the Insurance Defendants received commissions. The District also alleges that the Insurance Defendants charged sham broker's and consulting fees for the management of this insurance and the associated insurance reviews that were improperly conducted. The District alleges that from 2005 to 2017, it paid $ 6,799,956.50 in premiums and $ 2,994,311.65 in\n   broker's fees to the Insurance Defendants. Throughout the scheme, Thomas was provided with kickbacks totaling $ 32,000, in addition to expensive trips, hotel rooms, meals, and spa services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As part of their alleged concerted effort to defraud the District, Thomas and the Insurance Defendants entered into a number of brokerage service agreements (\"the Brokerage Service Agreements\"), each containing the following arbitration clause:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   All disputes, claims or controversies relating to this Agreement, or the services provided, which are not otherwise settled, shall be submitted to a panel of three arbritrators and resolved by final and binding arbitration, to the exclusion of any courts of laws, under the commercial rules of the American Arbitration Association.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   In those instances where any party is involved in an underlying claim or coverage dispute but the other is not, it is agreed that the arbitrators shall not be bound by any factual or legal determinations in such underlying claim or coverage dispute and that the arbitrators shall, in those cases where liability and/or damages cannot fairly be evaluated until resolution of the underlying claim or coverage dispute, defer their consideration pending resolution of any such underlying claim or coverage dispute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 23, Ex. B at 3 (\"the Arbitration Clauses\"). The District claims that it had never seen these Brokerage Service Agreements until the Insurance Defendants filed the motion at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On November 15, 2017, a South Carolina grand jury indicted Thomas on four counts of embezzlement. In one of the counts, the grand jury charged that Thomas deliberately caused the District to overpay a vendor and then ordered the vendor to send the refund of the overpayment to Thomas's home so that Thomas could use the refund for personal use. The complaint alleges that the vendor was Knauff Insurance Agency (\"Knauff\"), the predecessor to HUB, and Pokorney was the Knauff employee who refunded to the overpayment to Thomas. Thomas entered a plea of guilty to all of the state charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In addition, on December 7, 2017, the United States Attorney for the District of South Carolina charged Thomas with ten counts of wire fraud arising out of the illegal kickbacks in the amount of $ 32,000 that he received from \"a broker employee\" in exchange for \"steer[ing] [the District's] insurance policy purchases through\" the broker employee. ECF No. 36 at 9. Thomas entered a guilty plea to these charges. The broker employee, the District alleges, is Pokorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On January 18, 2018, the District filed suit in this court alleging violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"), the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act, fraud, aiding and abetting fraud, civil conspiracy, breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, constructive trust, and unjust enrichment against all defendants, and negligence per se and breach of contract against the Insurance Defendants. On March 5, 2018, HUB filed a motion to compel arbitration, arguing that all of the District's claims stem from the Brokerage Service Agreements that contain the Arbitration Clauses. ECF No. 23. Scott Pokorney joined the motion on March 12, 2018, ECF No. 29, and Pokorney joined the motion on March 19, 2018, ECF No. 35. On March 19, 2018, the District filed a response to the motion to compel arbitration. ECF No. 33. On that same day, the District also filed an amended\n   complaint. ECF No. 36. In this amended complaint, now the operative complaint in this case, the District removes certain claims, such as the breach of contract claim, and levies the following causes of action: RICO, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, civil conspiracy, breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, conversion, constructive trust, and unjust enrichment against all defendants, and negligence per se against the Insurance Defendants. HUB filed a reply on March 26, 2018. ECF No. 38. The court held a hearing on May 17, 2018. Pursuant to the court's request, the parties submitted supplemental briefing on July 6, 2018 addressing the potential impact of the United States Supreme Court's grant of certiorari in\n   <em>\n    Archer and White Sales, Inc. v.

ECF Nos. 57-59.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The motion has been fully briefed and is now ripe for the court's review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II. DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Insurance Defendants contend that this case must be resolved by arbitration because the Arbitration Clauses in the Brokerage Service Agreements clearly evince the parties' intent to submit the threshold question of arbitrability to the arbitrator. As such, they argue, any questions about the validity, scope, or enforceability of the Arbitration Clauses have been reserved for the arbitrators to decide. The District opposes arbitration and submits a number of challenges to both the Arbitration Clauses and the entirety of the Brokerage Service Agreements, including: (1) the Brokerage Service Agreements and Arbitration Clauses are invalid under South Carolina law because the District never agreed to them and was unaware they existed until the filing of this motion to compel; (2) Thomas could not have agreed to the Brokerage Service Agreements because the South Carolina state procurement code requires that the District undertake a competitive bid process to enter into such contracts, which was not followed here, and the procurement code does not allow for the District to enter into contracts that require arbitration; (3) the Arbitration Clauses should be found null and void because they were induced by fraud; (4) the Arbitration Clauses are unenforceable because the Insurance Defendants' and Thomas's actions related to the Brokerage Service Agreements were illegal, outrageous, and fraudulent; (5) Thomas was acting outside of the scope of his agency when he entered into the Brokerage Service Agreements; (6) not all of the claims in the amended complaint relate to the Brokerage Service Agreements; (7) the District is not seeking to enforce the Brokerage Service Agreements, which would in turn require enforcing the Arbitration Clauses; and (8) the Arbitration Clauses do not require arbitrators to determine arbitrability. The Insurance Defendants counter that all of the District's challenges to the existence of both the Arbitration Clause and the Brokerage Service Agreements must be resolved by the arbritrator, because the commercial rules of the American\n   Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") were incorporated by reference into the Arbitration Clauses. The rules state that \"[t]he arbitrator shall have the power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope, or validity of the arbitration agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim.\" ECF No. 38 at 3 (citing AAA Rules, R-7(a) ). Thus, according to the Insurance Defendants, there is \"clear and unmistakable evidence of the parties' intent to arbitrate arbitrability,\" meaning the court has no jurisdiction to determine even the threshold question of arbitrability and must send the case to arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Simply Wireless, Inc. v. T-Mobile US, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265159\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/877/522/#p527\">\n    877 F.3d 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 527-28 (4th Cir. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The law on arbitration has become rather complex. There are nuances that can be easy to overlook, and courts use various terms interchangeably, which has led to areas of the law becoming convoluted. Therefore, before addressing the specific arguments of the case at hand, the court will provide an overview of the law related to the relevant arbitration principles at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As an initial matter, courts use the word \"agreement\" in a variety of contexts when discussing arbitration, sometimes making it difficult to determine to which agreement the court is actually referring. The general meeting of the minds to use arbitration as a method of dispute resolution will be referred to as \"an agreement to arbitrate.\" Within an agreement to arbitrate, parties may also agree to send questions of arbitrability to arbitration. Arbitrability refers to \"gateway questions,\" such as whether the parties agreed to arbitrate or whether the agreement to arbitrate covers a certain dispute.\n   <em>\n    Rent-A-Center, W., Inc. v. Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455276,3644316\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/63/\">\n    561 U.S. 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 68-69,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455276,3644316\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/63/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2772\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644316,12455276\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/177/403/\">\n    177 L.Ed.2d 403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). An agreement to arbitrate these gateway questions \"is simply an additional, antecedent agreement\" to an agreement to arbitrate.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 70,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455276,3644316\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/63/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2772\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   An agreement to arbitrate may be included in a contractual relationship in two ways. First, the parties may form a new relationship, for example, an employer/employee relationship. Pursuant to that relationship, they may sign a contract, the entirety of which requires parties to arbitrate any disputes related to their relationship. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Rent-A-Center\n   </em>\n   , the employer hired an employee, and they entered into a contract titled \"Mutual Agreement to Arbitrate Claims\" as a condition to the employee's employment.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455276,3644316\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/63/\">\n    561 U.S. at 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455276,3644316\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/63/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2772\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court will refer to this type of agreement to arbitrate as an \"arbitration contract.\" Within an arbitration contract, there may be a delegation provision that delegates any dispute regarding the parties' relationship to arbitration (\"delegation provision\").\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455276,3644316\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/63/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455276,3644316\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/63/\">\n    at 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455276,3644316\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/63/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2772\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Alternatively, parties may enter into a contract related to any number of topics. The court will refer to this contract as a \"container contract.\" Within that contract, there may be an arbitration clause (\"arbitration clause\") that requires any claim related to the container contract to be resolved by arbitration. An example of a container contract is found in\n   <em>\n    Simply Wireless, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , where the parties entered into a contract titled \" Amended &amp; Restated Limited Purpose Co-Marketing and Distribution Agreement for Equipment Sold th[r]ough HSN &amp; QVC\" pursuant to the parties' joint project.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265159\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/877/522/#p527\">\n    877 F.3d at 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This contract contained an arbitration clause that sent claims related to the contract to arbitration.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265159\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/877/522/#p527\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265159\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/877/522/#p527\">\n    at 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, within the arbitration clause, there may be a delegation provision that requires an arbitrator to resolve any arbitrability questions. Here, the challenged agreement to arbitrate is an arbitration clause found within\n   the Brokerage Service Agreements, which are container contracts. While there is no separate delegation provision in the Arbitration Clauses within the Brokerage Service Agreements, the Insurance Defendants argue that the incorporation of the AAA rules create a de facto delegation provision. Therefore, for ease of reference and where appropriate, in subsequent discussion the court will refer to agreements to arbitrate as arbitration clauses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Principles of Arbitration Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   First, the court will discuss how a challenge to the validity of an arbitration clause under the \u00a7 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\") is handled. Then the court will distinguish between a challenge to the validity of the clause and a challenge to whether an agreement to arbitrate was formed in the first place. This distinction between validity and formation will become important later in the discussion. After identifying the distinction, the court will explain that when a party argues that it never agreed to arbitrate, it is generally the court's role to determine whether the parties did in fact form an agreement to arbitrate. In addition, the court will analyze the question of whether it must constrain its formation determination to the arbitration clause, or if it may consider formation of the container contract as well. Then, the court will discuss how challenges to a delegation provision are handled. Within this discussion, the court draws another distinction between the arbitrability issues of scope and formation. The court concludes by explaining that even if it appears that the parties agreed to arbitrate issues of arbitrability, the court still must first determine whether those parties entered into an agreement to arbitrate in the first place, meaning that here, the court must determine whether the District formed an agreement to arbitrate with the Insurance Defendants. The court also concludes that it may consider both the Arbitration Clauses and the Brokerage Service Clauses to determine if such an agreement exists. For the reasons discussed further below, the court finds here that an agreement to arbitrate was not properly formed, and thus denies the Insurance Defendants' motion to compel arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Challenges to Validity of an Arbitration Clause under \u00a7 2 of the FAA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Under the FAA, arbitration clauses \"shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \" Section 2 is a congressional declaration of a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements, notwithstanding any state substantive or procedural policies to the contrary.\"\n   <em>\n    Moses H.

As the Supreme Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna\n   </em>\n   , there are two types of challenges under \u00a7 2 that a party may make related to the validity of an arbitration clause.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5962007\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/440/#p444\">\n    546 U.S. 440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 444,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5962007\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/440/#p444\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5962007\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/440/#p444\">\n    163 L.Ed.2d 1038\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006).

When a party challenges validity, the court may only look at the validity of the arbitration clause, not the validity of the container contract, as required by the severability rule. However, validity and formation are different, suggesting that a court may not be bound by the severability rule when considering formation. This would allow the court to consider both the arbitration clause and the container contract to determine whether the parties ever formed an agreement to arbitrate. From a practical standpoint, it would be quite difficult to view the arbitration clause in isolation from the container contract when determining formation issues, because indicators of mutual assent, such as a party's signature, normally apply to the entire contract, not just an individual clause.

This relates back to the distinction between formation and validity. Therefore, when deciding whether a party agreed to delegate questions of arbitrability to arbitration, a court does not do so under \u00a7 2 of the FAA but instead by determining the parties' intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Courts use the term \"arbitrability\" generally and liberally, but it is important to distinguish between two different arbitrability issues: (1) the scope of an arbitration clause, i.e., whether a particular dispute should be subject to arbitration; and (2) whether the parties agreed to arbitrate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Despite the importance of this\n   distinction, it has gotten lost through the catchall use of the phrase \"arbitrability.\" But in cases such as this, where the District argues that it did not agree to arbitrate anything, including questions of arbitrability, the distinction is crucial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In most cases discussing arbitrability, the arbitrability question is one related to the scope of the clause, because the parties do not dispute the fact that they entered into an agreement to arbitrate. Instead, they dispute whether their specific claim falls within the type of claims that they agreed to arbitrate, and who should decide if the claim falls within the scope. In these scenarios, it makes sense for the court to look at the language of an arbitration clause to determine whether the parties \"clearly and unmistakably\" intended that an arbitrator would determine an issue because the parties agreed to the language.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Simply Wireless, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265159\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/877/522/#p527\">\n    877 F.3d at 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (language of arbitration clause evinces parties' clear and unmistakable intent to delegate question of whether claim fell within scope of clause to an arbitrator);\n   <em>\n    Carson v.

Despite the development of the jurisprudence on arbitrability, the basic concept that parties must agree to arbitrate remains true.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United Steelworkers of Am.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166480\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/363/574/#p582\">\n    363 U.S. at 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166480\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/363/574/#p582\">\n    80 S.Ct. 1347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A] party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.\"). However, when courts generally refer to \"arbitrability,\" which can include \"whether the parties agreed to arbitrate,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rent-A-Center\n   </em>\n   , 561 U.S. at 69,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455276,3644316\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/63/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2772\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the basic requirement that the parties agreed to arbitrate gets wrapped up in the \"scope of\" arbitrability analysis, creating confusion\n   over whether it is the court's or arbitrator's role to determine whether the parties agreed to arbitrate. Because arbitrability includes whether the parties agreed to arbitrate, the question seems as though it should fall into the arbitrability framework discussed above. Yet some courts have said that \"[a]rguments that an agreement to arbitrate was never formed, though, are to be heard by the court even where a delegation clause exists.\"\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516730\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/738/#p744\">\n    888 F.3d at 744\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The court's ability to determine whether an agreement to arbitrate was formed in the first place, even when a delegation provision exists, can be gleaned from the Supreme Court's review of arbitration framework in\n   <em>\n    Granite Rock Co.\n   </em>\n   The Court explained first that \"a court may order arbitration of a particular dispute only where the court is satisfied that the parties agreed to arbitrate that dispute.\" 561 U.S. at 297,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455281,3644277\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/287/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But the Court continued, stating that \"\n   <em>\n    [i]n addition\n   </em>\n   , these issues\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   include whether the clause was agreed to, and may include when that agreement was formed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455281,3644277\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/287/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). This language clearly indicates that regardless of whether a delegation provision exists, it is always within the court's province to determine whether an agreement was\n   <em>\n    formed\n   </em>\n   in the first place. The Court provided further support for this concept, stating that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   our precedents hold that courts should order arbitration of a dispute only where the court is satisfied that neither the formation of the parties' arbitration agreement\n   <em>\n    nor\n   </em>\n   (absent a valid provision specifically committing such disputes to an arbitrator) its enforceability or applicability to the dispute is in issue.

Again, the Court identified that whether the parties formed an agreement to arbitrate is separate from issues related to a delegation provision. Therefore, whether a party formed an agreement to arbitrate, including whether it agreed to arbitrate arbitrability, is a question for the court to resolve. As discussed above, when considering a challenge to the formation of an agreement to arbitrate, a court may consider both the formation of the arbitration clause and the container contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Moreover, there can be no \"clear and unmistakable\" evidence in an arbitration clause that parties intended to delegate questions of arbitrability to arbitration when the parties disagree over whether the arbitration clause was formed in the first place. The distinction between the arbitrability concepts of scope and agreement to arbitrate illustrates this point well and is best exemplified by arbitrability cases involving arbitration clauses that incorporate the JAMS rules or AAA rules. Courts are frequently and consistently finding that when an arbitration clause incorporates arbitration rules, whether they be JAMS or AAA rules, there is clear and unmistakable evidence that the parties intended to arbitrate arbitrability.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Simply Wireless, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265159\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/877/522/#p527\">\n    877 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   528 ;\n   <em>\n    Brennan v.

Indeed, the Insurance Defendants, relying on\n   <em>\n    Simply Wireless\n   </em>\n   and various other circuit\n   court cases, argue here that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability because the AAA rules are incorporated in the Arbitration Clauses. However, in\n   <em>\n    Simply Wireless\n   </em>\n   , the arbitrability issue was the\n   <em>\n    scope\n   </em>\n   of the arbitration clause, so it made sense to look at the language of the clause. The parties did not dispute the fact that they had formed an agreement to arbitrate when they executed the contract containing the arbitration clause.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265159\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/877/522/#p527\">\n    877 F.3d at 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It is impossible to infer that the District intended to delegate issues of arbitrability to an arbitrator from the language of the Arbitration Clauses, including the incorporation of the AAA Rules, if the District did not agree to the Arbitration Clauses or the Brokerage Service Agreements in the first place. As the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania explained, \"[w]hen one party contends that an agreement to arbitrate was never formed, looking to the text of that very agreement is problematic because the agreement is only a valid indicator of the parties' intent if they agreed to be bound by its terms.\"\n   <em>\n    Allstate Ins.

With these descriptions of the Brokerage Service Agreements in mind, the court now turns the District's formation challenges and finds that the District did not agree to any of the Brokerage Service Agreements or the Arbitration Clauses within them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   When a court decides if parties agreed to arbitrate, it applies state law on contract formation.\n   <em>\n    First Options of Chicago, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339246\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/938/#p944\">\n    514 U.S. at 944\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339246\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/938/#p944\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Lorenzo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4356609\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/806/777/#p781\">\n    806 F.3d at 781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"And the question of whether the parties agreed to arbitrate is resolved by application of state contract law.\").

Here, the Brokerage Service Agreements found in Exhibits D through G are not signed by either party. Moreover, the District represented to the court that it did not know these Brokerage Service Agreements containing the Arbitration Clauses even existed until HUB filed its motion to compel arbitration, which is supported by the fact that the agreements are unsigned. The District obviously could not have agreed to the Brokerage Service Agreements if it did not know they existed. Therefore, it is clear that there was no meeting of the minds where the District agreed to be bound by the Brokerage Service Agreements or the Arbitration Clauses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Insurance Defendants argue that while the District may have not accepted the terms of the Brokerage Service Agreements through signing the agreements, it did accept them through performance, i.e., paying the broker's and consultant's fees. It is true that a party may accept an offer and form a contract through performance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sauner v. Pub. Serv. Auth. of S.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"347771\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/354/397/\">\n    354 S.C. 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"347771\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/354/397/\">\n    581 S.E.2d 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 165-66 (2003) (\"A unilateral contract occurs when there is only one promisor and the other party accepts, not by mutual promise, but by actual performance.\"). But where the Insurance Defendants falter is by applying the usual rule to this most unusual set of facts. The Insurance Defendants overlook the fact that it was Thomas who caused the District to make the payments and perform the contract. And as the District alleges, Thomas did so as part of a scheme to defraud the District. Thomas was the Comptroller, Executive Director of Finance, and Chief Financial Officer of the District during the relevant time period. The amended complaint alleges that \"the District,\n   <em>\n    through Thomas\n   </em>\n   , purchased a myriad [of] commercial policies\" recommended by the Insurance Defendants. ECF No. 36 at 14 (emphasis added). In addition, the amended complaint alleges, Thomas would \"ensure\" that the Insurance Defendants were paid their brokerage fees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18. Moreover, the amended complaint, through the incorporation of the Information in Thomas's federal criminal case, alleges that Thomas \"was responsible for procuring and paying for [the District's] insurance policies,\" which were maintained by an insurance broker. ECF No. 36-1 at 2. That insurance broker, the amended complaint alleges, was HUB. In doing so, Thomas was allegedly able \"to enrich himself by steering insurance contracts and business and accepting cash payments, or kickbacks, paid by an insurance broker employee.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. The amended complaint alleges that the insurance broker employee was Pokorney. Yet another allegation of Thomas's control\n   over the District's payments to the Insurance Defendants is contained in the amended complaint's discussion of the state indictment. The District alleges that Thomas \"deliberately caus[ed] the [District] to overpay a vendor,\" and that the vendor is Knauff. ECF No. 36 at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Considering these allegations together, the amended complaint alleges that it was Thomas who caused the District to pay the brokerage service fees, and he did so with the purpose of defrauding the District. As such, the court is unwilling to consider the District's payment of the broker's and consultant's fees as the District's acceptance of the Brokerage Service Agreements. To do so would validate Thomas's fraud and self-enrichment to the detriment of the District, the victim of his scheme. Instead, if the performance of payment is to be considered acceptance of the Brokerage Service Agreements, the court imputes that performance to Thomas. In a similar vein, the Brokerage Service Agreements in Exhibits B and C were signed by an \"underling\" of Thomas and Thomas, respectively. Therefore, when considering both the agreements that were signed by Thomas (or his \"underling\") and the agreements that were unsigned but for which Thomas orchestrated payment, the question becomes whether the District may be bound by the Brokerage Service Agreements that were entered into by Thomas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Normally, Thomas, as the Chief Financial Officer of the District, would have the authority to act on behalf of the District, binding the District to the Brokerage Service Agreements. This argument would be convincing if it were not for the glaring fact that Thomas used his position to defraud the District. Under South Carolina law, an employer is bound by its employee's actions only when the employee is acting within the scope of his employment.\n   <em>\n    Murphy v. Jefferson Pilot Comms.

Thomas did so for the independent purpose of receiving kickbacks, and he was not acting in furtherance of the District's business because the payments to the Insurance Defendants actually harmed the District. Similarly, Thomas was not acting within the scope of his employment when he signed the first and second Brokerage Service Agreements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   He acted for his own benefit, namely to receive kickbacks from HUB.

Here, not only was Thomas clearly acting to benefit the independent purpose of lining his pocket with taxpayer money, but he was also acting to the detriment of his employer, the District.

Any appearance of agreement to the Brokerage Service Agreements is based on Thomas's actions, and Thomas was clearly acting outside of the scope of his employment. Therefore, he did not bind the District to the Brokerage Service Agreements or the Arbitration Clauses.
