For the reasons explained in this Order, the Court concludes that the DoD's challenged policies discriminate on the basis of national origin, and that defendant has not carried the burden of proving that the biennial NIACs required in connection with \"continuous monitoring\" and security clearance eligibility, which are imposed on citizens who accessed through the MAVNI program but not on other citizens affiliated with the DoD, survive strict scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   When this lawsuit began, plaintiffs sought relief with respect to additional aspects of the \"continuous monitoring\" program and the security clearance protocols applied to MAVNI personnel,\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   but as a result of the evidence presented at trial, plaintiffs narrowed their claim to encompass\n   only the periodic NIAC requirements of continuous monitoring and security clearance procedures.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   With respect to the biennial NIAC mandated for individuals who accessed through the MAVNI program and remain affiliated with the DoD, the questions before the Court are as follows: (i) whether the disparate treatment constitutes national-origin-based discrimination, and is therefore subject to strict scrutiny, or is merely related to the manner in which the soldiers entered the military (\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   , via the MAVNI program), and thus, must withstand only rational basis review; and (ii) whether the MAVNI-focused policies at issue bear the requisite relationship to the government's interest (\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   , national security).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Level of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court concludes that strict scrutiny must be applied to the challenged DoD policies.

Contrary to defendant's suggestion, even if the Court found that the challenged DoD policy is facially neutral, the equal protection analysis would not end.

In a declaration filed in connection with motion practice, the DoD's Chief of Personnel Security, Roger Smith, indicated that \"a number of individuals accessed into the military [through the MAVNI program] based on receiving fraudulent visas to attend universities that did not exist.\" Smith Decl. at \u00b6 25 (docket nos. 131-1 &amp; 132-1). The only example Mr. Smith could provide at trial concerned the University of Northern New Jersey,\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Tr. (Nov. 29, 2018) at 60:14-23 (docket no. 190), which was a fake school created by the Department of Homeland Security as part of a \"sting\" operation aimed at trapping brokers who were unlawfully referring foreign students to academic institutions for a fee,\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Tr. (Nov. 27, 2018) at 173:10-17 (docket no. 188). The Court is unimpressed with any assertion that MAVNI recruits who were deceived\n   by an agency of the United States into believing that they were enrolled in, or engaged in either curricular or optional practical training through, a legitimate school constituted a threat to national security.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Mr. Smith's declaration also referenced a MAVNI enlistee who said he would \"voluntarily help China in a crisis situation.\" Smith Decl. at \u00b6 25 (docket nos. 131-1 &amp; 132-1). During trial, Mr. Smith agreed that this individual was the subject of a DoD PowerPoint slide, which indicated that this person declined to become a naturalized United States citizen (and thus, is not similarly situated to plaintiffs), admitted to being a communist and loving socialism, identified himself as Josef Stalin, wore old foreign military (Nazi) apparel, and was removed from campus housing and suspended from a university after a search revealed several non-functioning firearms and a bayonet.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 98 at 11; Tr. (Nov. 29, 2018) at 66:20-67:14 (docket no. 190). While this person (and others like him) might pose a risk to community safety, defendant has not shown how he or similar individuals would escape detection through the MAVNI, or even the more lax non-MAVNI, enlistment protocols, and thus, defendant's reliance on this example as evidence that MAVNI soldiers constitute a national security threat is unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   At trial, defendant's witnesses were asked about Chaoqun Ji, a Chinese national who attempted to access through the MAVNI program, but did not advance out of the Delayed Entry Program or ship to basic training.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Tr.

Although the charges against Mr. Ji seem to support some alarm about the efforts of other governments to infiltrate the United States military, the record also reflects that Mr. Ji was unsuccessful in avoiding detection, even before extraordinary screening protocols were set in motion by the Levine memorandum. In addition, defendant's witnesses acknowledged that\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     no\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   MAVNI soldier who has become a naturalized citizen has ever been charged or convicted of espionage or any other criminal offense or been denaturalized.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Tr.

During the course of this litigation, defendant has mentioned, but has not produced to plaintiffs or offered as evidence, a 2017 DoD Inspector General \"classified review,\" a 2017 Defense Intelligence Agency \"classified assessment,\" and a 2016 DoD classified \"security review\" concerning the MAVNI program.

At trial, defendant's witnesses summarized these classified documents as bringing to the DoD's attention \"direct\n   threats for espionage within the [MAVNI] program,\" including attempts by \"hostile governments\" to either \"place known assets into the program to access into the military\" or \"develop assets who had accessed into the program.\" Tr.

According to Stephanie Miller, the DoD also learned from these classified reports that the investigatory tools it had been using might not be sufficient or might not have been consistently applied with respect to individuals who accessed through the MAVNI program. Tr. (Nov. 28, 2018) at 144:23-145:1, 148:2-17 (docket no. 189). Ms. Miller further indicated that the classified information raised concerns about aggressive attempts to obtain security clearances, unusual questions about equipment and information technology, deliberate omissions about foreign travel, unexplained wealth, and unreported contacts with persons identified as intelligence operatives or members of foreign governments.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201440\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201440\">\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201440\">\n    at 147:5-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   After hearing the testimony of defendant's witnesses and the closing arguments of counsel, the Court decided not to request that the classified documents at issue be provided for\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     in camera\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   review, expressing concerns about such\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     ex parte\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   presentation of evidence, as well as the probability that the materials would offer an incomplete understanding of the national security situation.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Tr.

The Court remains persuaded that it need not examine the DoD's undisclosed materials regarding the MAVNI program or determine whether they demonstrate the types of vulnerabilities to which defendant's witnesses generally alluded at trial because, even if defendant has carried his burden of establishing a compelling governmental interest, the NIAC policies challenged in this litigation do not satisfy the \"necessary\" and \"precisely tailored\" prongs of the strict scrutiny standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Neither Necessary Nor Precisely Tailored\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that the \"continuous monitoring\" program and the enhanced security clearance protocols for MAVNI personnel are both overbroad and under-inclusive, and thus, do not bear a sufficiently narrow relationship to national security. The Court agrees. The Court notes that plaintiffs, who all accessed after February 2012, already underwent investigations that were beyond what anyone else seeking the highest levels of security clearance must endure,\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   and they did so just to enlist and obtain a favorable Military Service Suitability Determination.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   note 16. Defendant has offered no statistical basis or other evidence to support a theory that a subsequent biennial NIAC (as part of a continuous monitoring system\n   or a security clearance application) would reveal national security concerns somehow left unexposed by the SSBI/Tier 5, NIAC, and CIFSR performed upon recruitment. Moreover, defendant has provided no explanation for engaging in flagrant profiling,\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   , equating MAVNI status with national security risk, rather than justifying on a case-by-case basis the heightened monitoring or screening that the DoD wishes to conduct. Indeed, as conceded by defendant's witnesses, no citizen who accessed into the Army through the MAVNI program has ever been charged or convicted of any criminal offense or been denaturalized, and defendant has offered no evidence that espionage or similar activity is so rampant among MAVNI personnel who have attained citizenship that a departure from the usual standard of particularized suspicion is necessary.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Tr. (Nov. 29, 2018) at 144:6-14 (docket no. 190) (indicating that the Army can \"investigate anyone\" it has \"reason to believe\" might be \"involved in a national security crime\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In this litigation, plaintiffs do not question the DoD's authority to conduct additional security investigations on an individualized basis,\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Tr. (Nov. 28, 2018) at 188:3-12 (docket no. 189), and the issues before the Court concern only whether the DoD may, without any indication of wrongdoing or cause for concern, routinely subject a group of citizens born outside the United States to a higher level of scrutiny than other citizens. More vetting and more monitoring will certainly reveal more information,\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Tr. (Nov. 29, 2018) at 159:13-16 (docket no. 190), but the DoD's approach, which is, according to defendant's witness Stephanie Miller, to obtain the information first and then decide whether individualized review is warranted,\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Tr. (Nov. 28, 2018) at 199:16-200:22, 201:15-18 (docket no. 189), puts the proverbial cart before the horse. Defendant simply has not shown why the DoD needs to conduct a NIAC every two years, as a matter of course, on the entire MAVNI population, and therefore, has not refuted plaintiffs' challenge of overbreadth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Defendant has instead provided a meaningless comparison, indicating that 13% of MAVNI soldiers had been deemed unsuitable for military service\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     or\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ineligible to have access to classified information, while only 1% of the non-MAVNI population were denied a security clearance.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Smith Decl. at \u00b6 27 (docket nos. 131-1 &amp; 132-1);\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     also\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   Tr.

When asked by the Court at trial, Roger Smith conceded that he was unable to recite\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     separate\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   figures for (i) the number or percentage of MAVNI recruits who (unlike all but one\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the plaintiffs in this matter) received unfavorable MSSDs and were required to leave the armed forces, and (ii) the number or percentage of MAVNI soldiers who had not received a requested security clearance.

Nevertheless, defendant requires all MAVNI soldiers, even those who have no access to classified information, to undergo biennial NIACs, while imposing no similar condition on the maintenance of \"secret,\" \"top secret,\" or even \"top secret/SCI\" clearance by non-MAVNI personnel. Defendant does not subject any other members of the military to the MAVNI level of monitoring,\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   even those with equivalent or perhaps greater ties to other nations than the typical MAVNI soldier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   For example, in the absence of individualized suspicion, no periodic NIAC is performed on individuals who were United States citizens or nationals at birth, but never resided in the United States before joining the military, on aliens who were lawful permanent residents at the time of their enlistment, or on persons who remain citizens of the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, or Palau during their entire career in the armed forces.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Faruki\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5702942\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/349/723/#p726\">\n    349 F.Supp. at 731\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (observing that, under the unconstitutional statute at issue, \"foreign-born American citizens at birth who have never set foot in America face no similar barrier when they decide to come here, perhaps for the first time, to take the Foreign Service entrance examinations\").

They did, however, assert claims regarding two other policies, namely (i) the requirement that they undergo a Passive Analytical CI and Security Assessment (\"PACSA\") as part of the \"continuous monitoring\" program, which was imposed in a memorandum dated October 13, 2017, on all \"incumbent\" MAVNI soldiers (like plaintiffs), meaning service members who completed security and suitability screening before the Levine memorandum was issued on September 30, 2016,\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      see\n     </em>\n    </em>\n    Ex. 49; and (ii) the requirement that anyone affiliated with the DoD who accessed through the MAVNI program be subjected to a CIFSR in connection with the adjudication of security clearance eligibility. Neither the PACSA nor the CIFSR is routinely performed on other personnel, even those seeking or holding the highest level of security clearance. On the fourth day of trial, Roger Smith, Chief of Personnel Security for the DoD, and Joseph Simon, Senior Counterintelligence Advisor to the Army G2 and to the Chief of Staff of the Army, each testified that PACSAs and/or CIFSRs have been completed for all MAVNI personnel. Tr. (Nov. 29, 2018) at 57:2-11, 134:8-135:21 (docket no. 190). During closing argument, based on his understanding that the DoD has \"no plans to repeat these investigations,\" plaintiffs' counsel conceded that the constitutionality of compelling a PACSA in connection with continuous monitoring, or a CIFSR when a MAVNI enlistee is being considered for \"top secret\" or \"secret\" clearance, is now moot.

The Court is satisfied that defendant's arguments regarding standing do not require differentiation between continuous monitoring and security clearance requirements. Defendant asserts that, with respect to the up-to-date NIAC needed for security clearance, all but seven plaintiffs' claims are moot because they have already received \"top secret/SCI\" or \"secret\" clearance, and that two other plaintiffs' claims are unripe because no request for security clearance has been made on their behalf. These contentions do not, however, establish a lack of standing because security clearances expire and must be renewed,\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      see\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      supra\n     </em>\n    </em>\n    note 10, plaintiffs with only \"secret\" clearance might soon need a higher level of clearance, and plaintiffs who have not yet sought clearance might in the near future need to do so. Plaintiffs have a \"reasonable expectation\" that they will (again or for the first time) be subject to the challenged NIAC policy, and they might receive the requested security clearance before the merits of their claim can be addressed.

Margaret Stock, the mass shooting that occurred in November 2009 at Fort Hood, Texas, which was perpetrated by Nidal Malik Hasan, an Army psychiatrist, forced the MAVNI program into a two-year hiatus. Tr. (Nov. 27, 2018) at 159:3-23 &amp; 161:3-5 (docket no. 188). Although Hasan was an American at birth, many people thought he was a MAVNI soldier because he had a foreign-sounding name.\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133470\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/541/\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n    </em>\n    at 159:6 &amp; 15-18. In advance of trial, defendant sought to exclude Lt. Col. Stock as a witness on several grounds, including self-interest, impermissible coaching by plaintiffs' counsel, and failure to qualify as an expert or offer appropriate expert testimony under Federal Rule of Evidence 702,\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      see\n     </em>\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Mot. in Limine (docket no. 158), and the Court denied defendant's motion without prejudice,\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      see\n     </em>\n    </em>\n    Minutes (docket no. 175). Having observed Lt. Col. Stock's demeanor on the witness stand and during the course of the trial, the Court finds her testimony, which was primarily factual in nature, credible and consistent with the documents admitted as evidence and the historical events about which the Court may take judicial notice,\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      see\n     </em>\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Evid. 201. Although the DoD and the Army certainly needed to conduct a thorough investigation following the incident at Fort Hood, in an effort to prevent repetition of the episode, the Court is persuaded that, if Hasan had had a surname common in the United States (Smith, Johnson, Williams, Jones, etc.), the horrific acts that he committed might not have affected the MAVNI program so singularly and significantly. As a result of the temporary suspension, no individuals enlisted through the MAVNI program in FY 2011 or FY 2012.\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n    </em>\n    Ex. 33 at 18. In FY 2013, when the MAVNI program was reinstated, individuals attempting to join the Army through the MAVNI program had to submit to the more rigorous vetting process articulated in the February 2012 memorandum issued by the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, which required an SSBI/Tier 5, a NIAC, and a CIFSR at the time of enlistment.\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      supra\n     </em>\n    </em>\n    note 16.

The Army commissioned both the Human Resources Research Organization (\"HumRRO\") and the RAND Corporation to evaluate the MAVNI program.\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n    </em>\n    Exs. 29 &amp; 33. HumRRO produced an interim evaluation in November 2011 and a final assessment in February 2013. Ex. 29 at 1 &amp; 15. The RAND report was issued in July 2017. Ex. 33 at 1. The HumRRO study focused on whether the Army was meeting its goals for the MAVNI program, how MAVNI recruits compared with other soldiers, and whether the attitudes of MAVNI personnel changed over time. Ex. 29 at 15-22. The RAND investigation was aimed at analyzing the relative performance and relative cost of MAVNI and non-MAVNI service members, estimating the size of the future pool of potential MAVNI recruits, and assessing the security risk associated with the MAVNI program. Ex. 33 at 21. Defendant has attempted to undermine the conclusions stated in the RAND report by indicating that the RAND researchers were not given access to classified information,\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      see\n     </em>\n    </em>\n    Miller Decl. at \u00b6\u00b6 4-5 (docket nos. 141-3 &amp; 159-2), but this criticism applies to the examination of security risk, and does not diminish the credibility of either the HumRRO or the RAND report regarding the cost-effectiveness of the MAVNI program in producing high-quality Army enlistments.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"25\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Nothing prevented the DoD or the Army from investigating on an individual basis the MAVNI service members who were duped by the Government's \"sting\" operation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"26\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    For example, to be deemed eligible for \"top secret\" clearance, non-MAVNI personnel (\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      e.g.\n     </em>\n    </em>\n    , individuals who were United States citizens at birth) must successfully complete an SSBI/Tier 5, but not a NIAC or a CIFSR, and to be eligible for \"secret\" clearance, a non-MAVNI soldier must pass only a Tier 3 review (formerly called a National Agency Check with Law and Credit), which requires responses to a questionnaire known as Standard Form 86 (or SF 86), an exemplar of which was admitted into evidence as Exhibit 22.\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n    </em>\n    Tr.
