(D.I. 63). The Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (federal question jurisdiction), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78aa (jurisdiction for violations of the Exchange Act), and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77v (jurisdiction for violations of the Securities Act).

(D.I. 65-1, Ex. 1 at 6). Navient's stock price went from a high of $ 21.40 on February 27, 2015 to a low of $ 11.46 on December 28, 2015, the last day of the Class Period. (D.I. 59 at \u00b6\u00b6 15-16). Several plaintiffs sued alleging that the loss in stock price can be attributed to false and misleading disclosures made by Defendants during the Class Period. On July 1, 2016, those actions were consolidated, and, on September 28, 2016, Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint in the consolidated class action. (D.I. 36). Defendants moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim (D.I. 38), and the Court granted the motion to dismiss because the Amended Complaint improperly relied on puzzle pleading that failed to set forth a \"short and plain\" statement of their claims. (D.I. 55 at 6-7; D.I. 56). On November 17, 2017, Plaintiffs filed the Second Amended Complaint (D.I. 59) (referred to hereinafter as \"the Complaint\"), which is the subject to the current motion to dismiss. (D.I. 63). To minimize repetition, the Court will discuss relevant background facts with each group of statements at issue in Defendants' motion when it discusses whether the Complaint states a claim with respect to each group of statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Rule 9(b) requires a plaintiff to \"state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b).

It does not, however, appear that the Securities Act claims of the Complaint are grounded in a theory of fraud. In addressing Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint, which was dismissed, the Court applied a heightened pleading standard to Plaintiffs' Securities Act claims, because the Securities Act claims incorporated allegations from the Exchange Act claims that Defendants \"knew or recklessly disregarded\" Navient's \"improper practices.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 55 at 6 (citing D.I. 36 at \u00b6 24) ). The Complaint does not repeat this problem. Finally, even if Rule 9(b) did apply, Defendants have done no more than make a one-sentence conclusory argument that the Securities Act claims are not pleaded with particularity. (D.I. 64 at 24). This is not enough for the Court to reach the same conclusion it did previously. Thus, the Court's decision not to apply Rule 9(b) to the Securities Act claims does not affect the outcome of this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Counts 1 and 2 of the Complaint assert claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, respectively. (D.I. 59 at \u00b6\u00b6 155-61). Counts 3, 4, and 5 assert violations of Sections 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act, respectively. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 213-24). Liability under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Section 15 of the Securities Act is predicated on first finding liability under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Sections 11 or 12 of the Securities Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consistent with that framework, Defendants have confined their arguments on the motion to dismiss to whether the Complaint pleads a claim under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Court will first set out of the elements of a claim under the relevant statutory sections. It will then elaborate on the standards for pleading the elements on which Defendants have focused their motion, to wit, materiality, falsity, and scienter. Finally, the Court will address whether the Complaint meets those standards. The Complaint has arranged the purportedly false and misleading statements into three groups: compliance, credit facilities, and loans. The \"loan\" topic is further divided into four subgroups: the quality of the loan portfolio, forbearance practices, loan loss provisions, and SOX certifications. Defendants have set forth several arguments as to why allegations regarding each group and subgroup of statements fails to adequately plead materiality, falsity, and/or scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Relevant Statutory Sections\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Exchange Act Claims: \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act makes it unlawful for any person to \"use\n   or employ, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security ... any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b). SEC Rule 10b-5 implements this provision by making it unlawful to, among other things, \"make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    17 CFR \u00a7 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .10b-5(b). Thus, to state a claim for violation of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, Plaintiffs must prove \"(1) a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant; (2) scienter; (3) a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation.\"\n   <em>\n    Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v.

Section 12(a)(2) imposes liability where a prospectus or oral communication \"includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4201894\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/639/623/#p630\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 77l(a)(2). Thus, under both Section 11 and Section 12(a)(2), a plaintiff must show a material misstatement or omission, but Section 11 focuses on registration statements and Section 12(a)(2) focuses on prospectuses and oral communications.\n   <em>\n    In re Adams Golf, Inc.

Accordingly, Plaintiffs' cases are not illuminating on the issue of whether Defendants' compliance statements are material. Defendants' motion to dismiss the portion of Plaintiffs' claims based on the compliance statements is granted. The portion of Plaintiffs' Securities Act claims, and Exchange Act claims based on compliance statements is dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Credit Facilities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Complaint alleges that Navient made false or misleading statements when it reported the borrowing capacity under its credit facilities, because Navient failed to disclose the likelihood that the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (\"FHLB-DM\") would terminate Navient's access to those credit facilities in light of a proposed rule by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (\"the FHFA\"). (D.I. 59 at \u00b6\u00b6 138-39). In September 2014, the FHFA proposed a rule that would prevent entities from using a \"captive insurer\" to gain membership to a Federal Home Loan Bank like FHLB-DM. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13). Navient's predecessor Sallie Mae formed a captive insurer which Navient then used to access the FHLB-DM's credit facility. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Thus, the proposed rule, which was adopted as a final rule in January 2016, impacted Navient's ability to obtain low-cost credit to fund its operations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On December 28, 2015, Navient disclosed that the FHLB-DM would reduce the company's ability to borrow under its credit facility by more than 50%, a change the Complaint alleges is material because the low-cost credit available under the FHLB-DM was not available from other sources. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13). Defendants argue that the Complaint fails to adequately plead materiality and scienter with respect to the credit facility statements. (D.I. 64 at 16-17; D.I. 69 at 15). Each element is addressed in turn below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Materiality\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Complaint alleges that, under SEC Regulations, Navient had a duty to disclose the \"serious risk\" that the FHLB-DM would terminate Navient's access to the credit facility due to the FHFA's proposed rule. (D.I. 59 at \u00b6 139-142). Specifically, it alleges that Navient violated its duty under SEC Regulation S-X, Rule 05-02-22, to disclose the \"conditions under which commitments may be withdrawn.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 141). It also alleges that Navient violated its duty under SEC Regulation S-K,\n   Rule 303, to \"[i]dentify any known trends or any known demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in the [company]'s liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 142).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendants' motion to dismiss does not discuss Rule 05-02-22 or Rule 303 or whether these rules do in fact impose a duty to disclose the FHFA's proposed rule regarding captive insurers. While Defendants mentioned that the proposed rule was public information, they do not explain the significance of that fact or provide citations to case law showing that it is proper grounds for dismissal. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 69 at 9). Defendants also suggest that the risk was in fact disclosed when the 2014 Form 10-K stated that \"regulatory actions\" are one of many \"factors that could make financing more expensive or unavailable to Navient.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 64 at 17). But Defendants did not explain, with citation to case law, how this statement was more than mere boilerplate and provided adequate warning with respect to the proposed FHFA rule. Finally, Defendants rely on\n   <em>\n    Gaer v. Education Management Corp.\n   </em>\n   to suggest that, as a matter of law, a company is \"not obligated to predict months in advance about the final regulations that eventually issued.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 64 at 17 (citing\n   <em>\n    Gaer v.

Pa. Aug. 30, 2011) ). But this reliance is misplaced, because the quote is taken out of context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The court in\n   <em>\n    Gaer\n   </em>\n   essentially held that a company did not have to predict, at the time of its initial public offering (\"IPO\"), that the Department of Education would adopt a final rule over a year later, when the only activity before the IPO was an announcement that the Department of Education planned to form a negotiated rulemaking committee, that committee eventually failed to produce any rules, and the rules finally adopted came about after a stop and start process.\n   <em>\n    Gaer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%207277447\">\n    2011 WL 7277447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2-*5, *23. Defendants have not shown that a similar start and stop process hindered its ability to disclose any risk from the FHFA's proposed rule. More importantly, the court in\n   <em>\n    Gaer\n   </em>\n   ultimately rejected the plaintiff's argument because the company \"did warn investors about the potential impact that the rulemaking might have.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *23. Therefore, Defendants have failed to show that the credit facility statements are not material. Defendants' motion to dismiss the portion of the Securities Act claims based on the credit facility statements is denied. Dismissal of the Exchange Act claims based on the credit facility statements will depend on whether Defendants have shown that the Complaint fails to adequately plead scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Scienter\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   To plead scienter with respect to the credit facility statements, the Complaint relies on: (i) the \"core operations doctrine\" and (ii) motive and opportunity. (D.I. 59 at \u00b6\u00b6 147-148). Under the core operations doctrine, when the misrepresentations and omissions involve \" 'core matters' of central importance\" to the company and its principle executives, an inference of scienter may arise.\n   <em>\n    Avaya\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4238849\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/564/242/#p253\">\n    564 F.3d at 268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Complaint does no more than make the conclusory allegation that the FHLB-DM credit facility was \"central[ ]\" to Navient's ability to fund its operations. (D.I. 59 at \u00b6 147). The Complaint does not allege, as required, that specific information regarding the impact of the proposed FHA rule was conveyed to management. Thus, there is no inference of scienter as to the credit facility statements based on the core operations doctrine. Similarly, the Complaint makes a single conclusory allegation that \"Defendants were highly motivated to conceal negative information threatening the Company's liquidity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 148). It does not, however, allege, as required, any \"concrete and personal benefit to the individual defendants resulting from this fraud.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    GSC Partners\n   </em>\n   , 368 F.3d at 237. Thus, the Complaint does not give rise to any inference of scienter, let alone a strong one, based on motive and opportunity. Given the foregoing, the Court grants Defendants' motion to dismiss the portion of the Exchange Act claims based on the credit facility statements for failure to adequately plead the element of scienter. Those claims are dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Loans\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Complaint alleges that Defendants made material statements regarding Navient's loans that were false and misleading. It divides the allegations regarding the materiality of Navient's loans into four subsections. The first section addresses the \"high quality\" of Navient's loan portfolio, including the \"low level\" of delinquencies and charge-offs. (D.I. 59 at \u00b6\u00b6 50-53). The second section addresses statements regarding Navient's forbearance practices. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 33-49). The third section addresses Navient's loan loss provisions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 54-63). The last section addresses SOX certifications signed by Navient's chief executive officer (\"CEO\") and chief financial officer (\"CFO\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 64-66). Finally, the Complaint sets forth the scienter allegations as to the loan statements collectively in a separate section. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 67-93). The Court will discuss the materiality and/or falsity of each group of loan statements separately before addressing the scienter allegations collectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Loan Portfolio Quality: Charge-Offs and Delinquencies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Defendants made misrepresentations regarding the \"quality\" of Navient's loan portfolio, including the number of delinquencies and\n   charge-offs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (D.I. 59 at \u00b6\u00b6 50-51). This subsection of the Complaint attacks two types of statements: statements characterizing Navient's loan portfolio and statements reporting on the portfolio's performance. The first type includes statements that the company has \"strong underwriting and customer support,\" a \"[l]arge, high quality asset base,\" and a \"[s]easoned portfolio.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The second type includes statements that the company \"set a six year-record low in delinquencies\" and \"show[ed] continued improvements in delinquencies and defaults since a year ago.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   For reasons not clear to the Court, Defendants does not address the materiality (or falsity) of the loan quality statements. Defendants' opening brief combined the arguments on materiality of the loan quality statements and loan loss provisions under the broader heading of \"financial results,\" but ultimately the arguments and cases cited focused on loan loss provisions. (D.I. 64 at 7, 10-14). As a result, there is no argument, with citations to supporting case law, addressing the materiality of Navient's loan quality statements. Because materiality is the only element at issue with respect to the Securities Act claims, Defendants have not shown that the Complaint fails to plead a Securities Act claim based on the loan quality statements. Defendants' motion to dismiss the portion of the Securities Act claims based on the loan quality statements is denied.

The Complaint alleges that the following forbearance statements were false or misleading when made: (1) Navient engaged in a \"careful use of forbearance,\" (2) Navient applied forbearances \"based on a customer's unique situation,\" (3) the company's forbearance policies \"include limits on the number of forbearance months granted consecutively and the total number of forbearance months granted over the life of the loan,\" and (4) Navient \"continue[d] to see ... continuing positive delinquency, forbearance and charge-off trends in connection with th[e] [PEL] portfolio.\" (D.I. 59 at \u00b6 49). The Complaint alleges that those forbearance statements were false or misleading when made, because \"Navient engaged in a systemic practice of indiscriminately placing borrowers into forbearance,\" which allowed Navient to avoid recording those accounts as delinquent or in default. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   To show how or why those forbearance statements were false, the Complaint relies on: (i) statements from three confidential witnesses; (ii) the allegations in complaints filed against Navient by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\"CFPB\"), the Attorney General of Illinois, and the Attorney General of Pennsylvania; and (iii) a September 2015 report by the CFPB resulting from a public inquiry by the CFPB, Department of Education, and the U.S. Treasury Department. (D.I. 59 at \u00b6\u00b6 37-48). Defendants attack the Complaint's reliance on confidential\n   witnesses and government complaints as sources to show the alleged falsity of the forbearance statements. (D.I. 64 at 8-10). Defendants further argue that even if the Complaint may appropriately rely on these types of sources, the allegations from those sources are insufficient to show falsity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Accordingly, the Court will first address the appropriateness of relying on confidential witness and government complaints, and then address whether those allegations do in fact adequately plead falsity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    a.

(D.I. 59 at \u00b6\u00b6 37-41). CW1 worked at Navient as a collections supervisor from early 2014 until April 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37). CW1 alleged, among other things, that \"the Collections Department's 'objective all of the time was to keep an account current' through using forbearances.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). According to the Complaint, this policy directive was conveyed to CW1 by her supervisor but came from Navient District Manager/Senior Vice President of Default Prevention Troy Standish, who reported to defendant John Kane, the Chief Operating Officer of Navient. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 32, 37). CW1 further explained that Navient encouraged employees to place borrowers into forbearance, which took less time than other options, by giving agents who wanted \"to achieve a good performance rating, just five and a half minutes per phone call with borrowers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 40).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   CW2 is a former Navient collections department supervisor who worked at the company from mid-2010 until October 2014 and supervised 25 collections agents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38). According to CW2, \"Navient Director of Operations Christi Hewes instructed CW2 and others to encourage customers to obtain longer forbearances than they initially requested, as that would result in a longer period during which the account would show up as 'current' on Navient's books.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38). CW2 also corroborated CW1's allegations regarding employee incentives to put borrowers into forbearance by stating that in order to be rated \"number one,\" agents had to put borrowers \"in something that makes them look like they're up to date for a longer period of time.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39). So even if a borrower requested a short forbearance, the supervisors were coached by management to coach the agents to convince the borrower to obtain a longer forbearance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Finally, CW3 is a former Navient Department of Education Specialist II who\n   worked at Navient's Delaware headquarters from June 2014 until after the Class Period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41). CW3 further corroborated allegations that \"Navient provided incentives to personnel for getting customers off the phone in the fastest amount of time\" and that borrowers relied on Navient customer service representatives to understand their options with respect to forbearance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Court finds that the Complaint describes each CW with sufficient particularity to support the probability that the CW has personal knowledge of Navient's forbearance practices. Defendants assert that the CWs' allegations should be steeply discounted, because they are \"all low-level former employees\" and \"were not employed for the full class period.\" (D.I. 64 at 8). But other courts have not discounted a CW's allegations just because those characteristics were present.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Avaya\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4238849\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/564/242/#p253\">\n    564 F.3d at 265-66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that allegations from CWs who were \"relatively low level former employees\" showed that certain forecast-related statements were false);\n   <em>\n    In re SLM Corp.

It alleges the direct involvement of the CWs supervisors, alleges that at least one of the CWs is only a few levels removed from one of the individual defendants in this case, and alleges that the actions taken by the CWs were guided by incentive programs, employee rating programs, and scripts. (D.I. 59 at \u00b6\u00b6 37-41). It is reasonable to infer that those programs and scripts would have been prepared and approved by employees who are not low-level. Finally, at least one CW was employed at any point during the Class Period. For the foregoing reasons, the Court does not agree with Defendants that the allegations of the CWs should be discounted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Government Complaints\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   To corroborate the confidential witness statements, the Complaint incorporates allegations from government complaints filed in other cases. Defendants assert that this is not permitted. Specifically, Defendants contend that \"courts deeply discount, or decline to consider altogether, untested allegations imported from third-party complaints.\" (D.I. 64 at 9). The Court cannot determine whether this is correct, because the few cases Defendants cite do not appear relevant to the issue before the Court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   First, Defendants rely on the court's statement in\n   <em>\n    Gaer\n   </em>\n   , \"the fact that the government may join in a\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   suit does not demonstrate that the suit has merit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9 n.9 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Gaer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%207277447\">\n    2011 WL 7277447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10 ) ). This, however, is not\n   <em>\n    a qui tam\n   </em>\n   action, the government complaints incorporated into Plaintiffs' Complaint are not\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   actions, and Plaintiffs are not relying on the fact that the government has brought an action to bolster the merits of their own suit. Instead, Plaintiffs rely on specific factual allegations in the government complaint, which must under Fed. R. Civ. P. 11 be based on a reasonable inquiry, to corroborate similar factual allegations in its own complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Second, Defendants rely on\n   <em>\n    RSM Productions\n   </em>\n   where a district court in the Second Circuit granted a motion to strike, because \"Second Circuit case law is clear that paragraphs in a complaint that are either based on, or rely on, complaints in other actions that have been dismissed,\n   settled, or otherwise not resolved, are, as a matter of law, immaterial within the meaning of Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f).\"\n   <em>\n    RSM Production Corp. v. Fridman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4185923\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/643/382/#p403\">\n    643 F.Supp.2d 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 403 (S.D.N.Y. 2009). As an initial matter, Second Circuit case law is not binding on this Court. In addition, Defendants are not asking the Court to strike the government allegations incorporated into the Complaint. Finally, there is some doubt that\n   <em>\n    RSM Production\n   </em>\n   correctly summarizes Second Circuit case law.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Sec. &amp; Exchange Comm'n. v. Lee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085814\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/720/305/#p340\">\n    720 F.Supp.2d 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 340 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (a later case from the same circuit denying a defendant's motion to strike because \"[t]here is no absolute rule barring a private plaintiff from relying on government pleadings ... to meet the Rule 9(b) and PSLRA thresholds\"). Given the foregoing, Defendants have not presented any binding or persuasive authority on the issue of whether Plaintiffs may rely on allegations in government complaints to adequately plead falsity. Therefore, the Court will not at this time \"deeply discount or decline to consider altogether\" those allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Sufficiency of the Falsity Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Defendants argue that the Complaint fails to adequately plead the falsity of the forbearance statements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9). The Court, however, is not convinced. The CWs' allegations, taken as true and read in the light most favorable to plaintiff, contribute to an overall picture that the forbearance statements were false when made. The CWs allege that - per the incentive programs, employee rating programs, scripts, and guidance from supervisors - the CWs and other collections agents in similar positions were not \"careful\" about the use of forbearance, did not apply forbearance \"based on a customer's unique situation,\" and did not limit either the number of forbearance months granted consecutively or the total number of forbearance months granted over the life of the loan,\" but instead placed borrowers into forbearance indiscriminately and for the longest possible periods of time. In addition, Defendants addressed the sufficiency of the falsity allegations taken from the government complaints in a single unhelpful sentence. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 64 at 9 (stating that \"[t]hese mundane allegations neither support the bombastic conclusions with which Plaintiffs pair them, nor show any systemic policy of forbearance misuse\") ). Accordingly, Defendants have not shown that the Complaint fails to adequately plead the falsity of the forbearance statements. For these reasons, Defendants motion to dismiss the parts of the Securities Act claims based on the forbearance statements is denied. Unless Defendants can show that the Complaint fails to adequately plead scienter, the Court will also deny Defendants' motion to dismiss the portion of the Exchange Act claims based on the forbearance statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Loan Loss Provisions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   For each quarter from Q1 2014 to Q1 2015, Navient reported the amount of its loan loss provisions for its Private Education Loans (\"PELs\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (D.I. 59 at \u00b6 54). Navient also reported an amount for the full year of 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Complaint alleges that the loan loss provisions were materially misstated, because \"Navient's systemic use of forbearances to hide what otherwise would have added to the Company's reported delinquencies, defaults, and charge-offs artificially depressed its loan\n   loss provisions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 55). The Complaint also alleges that Navient \"failed to properly account for losses on more than $ 2.5 billion in delinquent and defaulted PELs of higher risk borrowers who exited deferment in 2014.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 62). According to Defendants, the Complaint fails to adequately plead the falsity of the loan loss provisions for three reasons: (i) the lack of allegations that the loan loss model was manipulated; (ii) the improper reliance on hindsight; and (iii) the failure to meet the pleading requirements for statements of opinion. (D.I. 64 at 10-14). Each argument is addressed in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   First, Defendants assert that successful challenges to loan loss provisions require a plaintiff to allege \"facts showing that the defendant misapplied or manipulated its [loan loss] model\" to achieve a particular accounting outcome. (D.I. 64 at 12 (citing\n   <em>\n    Southeastern Pennsylvania Transp. Authority v. Orrstown Fin. Serv., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%203833849\">\n    2015 WL 3833849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *23-24, *27 (M.D. Pa. June 22, 2015) ;\n   <em>\n    In re NAHC, Inc. Sec.

Assuming Defendants are correct as to the law, and the Court cannot be certain of that because the cases Defendants cite do not say that manipulation is a requirement, the Complaint alleges that Navient's systemic use of forbearance artificially depressed Navient's loan loss provisions. (D.I. 59 at \u00b6 55). Read in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, that appears to be an allegation of manipulation. Defendants do not explain why this allegation of manipulation is insufficient without getting into an evidentiary challenge that is improper on a motion to dismiss. Specifically, Defendants argue that systemic use of forbearance cannot be a form of manipulation, because Navient's loan loss model \"is designed to prevent precisely [that] kind of manipulation.\" (D.I. 64 at 12). Because this issue cannot be resolved on a motion to dismiss, the Court is not convinced that the Complaint fails to adequately plead falsity based on the manipulation of the loan loss model.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Second, Defendants assert that the Complaint improperly relies on hindsight to show the falsity of the loan loss provisions. (D.I. 64 at 10-11). Specifically, the increase to the loan loss provision in July 2015 does not show that the earlier loan loss provisions were false or misleading. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendants are correct that a complaint may not rely on hindsight to show falsity.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Orrstown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%203833849\">\n    2015 WL 3833849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *23 (\"[T]he fact that a company's loan loss reserves are subsequently increased does not mean that the reserves were knowingly understated at some earlier time.\"). But it does not appear that the Complaint here is relying on the increase in July 2015 to show that the earlier amounts were false or misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Instead, the Complaint alleges that Defendants knew or recklessly disregarded information which should have caused an increase to the loan loss provisions at some point earlier than July 2015. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that Remondi, the CEO of Navient, indicated during Navient's Q2 2015 earnings call that a cohort of borrowers exiting deferment in 2014 exhibited characteristics long before 2014 that normally lead to a higher incidence of delinquencies and charge-offs. (D.I. 59 at \u00b6 62). Remondi stated that \"[t]he incidence of delinquency and default on borrowers who take more time to get an undergraduate degree is certainly higher,\" and this cohort had reflected that trend when they \" 'moved in and out of school multiple times' (some without earning a degree),\" and historically had been \"struggling to begin with.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting D.I. 65-1, Ex. 4 at 11-12) ). The Complaint suggests that the Defendants ignored those red flags.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Thus, Defendants have not shown that the Complaint improperly relies on hindsight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Finally, Defendants argue that loan losses provisions are statements of opinion and, therefore, the claims based on the loan losses provisions should be dismissed for failing to comply with the pleading requirements of\n   <em>\n    Omnicare, Inc. v.

Here, Plaintiffs' Complaint does not rest on statements about loan loss provisions using general labels. Rather, the Complaint alleges that the dollar amounts disclosed for the loan loss provisions were false or misleading,\n   because Defendants' systemic use of forbearance meant the loan loss provisions were \"artificially understated.\" (D.I. 59 at \u00b6 73).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendants have not shown that the Complaint fails to adequately plead the falsity of the statements regarding the loan loss provisions. Defendants' motion to dismiss the parts of the Securities Act claims based on statements about the loan loss provisions is denied. Unless Defendants can show that the Complaint fails to adequately plead scienter, the Court will also deny Defendants' motion to dismiss the portion of the Exchange Act claims based on statements about the loan loss provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    4. SOX Certifications\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The Complaint alleges that the false and misleading statements regarding Navient's forbearance practices and \"resulting manipulation of Navient's financial results\" rendered the SOX certifications by Navient's CEO John F. Remondi and CFO Somsak Chivavibul in the Form 10-Qs and 10-K issued during the Class Period false and misleading when made. (D.I. 59 at \u00b6\u00b6 64-66).

Cir. 2006) (stating that arguments raised only in footnotes are not preserved).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Given the foregoing, Defendants have not shown that the Complaint fails to plead a Securities Act claim based on the SOX Certifications. Defendants' motion to dismiss the portion of the Securities Act claims based on the SOX Certifications is denied. Unless Defendants can show that the Complaint fails to plead scienter, the Court will also deny Defendants' motion to dismiss the portion of the Exchange Act claims based on the SOX Certifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Scienter\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Complaint collectively addresses the element of scienter as to the statements regarding Navient's loan quality, forbearance practices, loan loss provisions, and SOX Certifications (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the \"loan statements\"). (D.I. 59 at \u00b6\u00b6 67-83). The scienter allegations for the loan statements are comprised of: confidential witness allegations (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 69, 76-78); allegations taken from government complaints (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 70); Remondi's statements during Navient's Q2 2015 earnings call (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 75); the centrality of certain operations to Navient (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 72-73); company-wide incentive policies and scripts (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 71); and motive and opportunity allegations (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 74, 80-83, 124, 148).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In addressing the Complaint's purported failure to adequately plead scienter as to the loan statements, Defendants raise a variety of arguments, including arguments already made elsewhere. Specifically, Defendants argue that: (i) the centrality of forbearance and credit to Navient's operations are insufficient to plead scienter under\n   the core operations doctrine; (ii) Remondi's statements in July 2015 do not suggest that he knew before July 2015 that the rate of default would be higher for the cohort exiting deferment in 2014; (iii) there is insufficient detail about the confidential witnesses to credit their allegations; and (iv) the motive and opportunity allegations improperly rely on a \"general corporate motive.\" (D.I. 64 at 18-22). As an initial matter, the Court will not again address Defendants' arguments about Remondi's statements or the reliability of the confidential witnesses, which were rejected for the reasons explained above.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   III(E)(3) and III(E)(2)(a). The scienter allegations as to the loan statements does introduce a new confidential witness, CW4, but this confidential witness has the same characteristics as the other three confidential witnesses and, therefore, there is no reason to treat the credibility of his or her allegations differently.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (D.I. 59 at \u00b6\u00b6 76-78). That leaves Defendants' arguments based on the core operations doctrine and motive and opportunity allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The Complaint relies on the core operations doctrine to allege scienter with respect to the loan statements, because delinquencies, defaults, and charge-offs were \"key financial metric[s]\" for Navient. (D.I. 59 at \u00b6 73). As discussed previously, it is not enough under the core operations doctrine for a matter to be of central importance to company; a complaint must also allege that specific information related to the fraud was conveyed to management.\n   <em>\n    Rahman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3726324\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/736/237/#p242\">\n    736 F.3d at 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the Complaint's scienter allegations with respect to the credit facility statements failed for that reason.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   III(D)(2). But the Complaint does not suffer the same infirmity with respect to the loan statements. It relies on allegations from confidential witnesses, which the Court has previously determined are credible, to allege that specific information regarding the fraud around forbearance, charge-offs, and delinquencies, was conveyed to the individual defendants Kane, Remondi, and Chivavibul. (D.I. 59 at \u00b6\u00b6 76-78).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The Complaint alleges that Defendants were motivated to manipulate Navient's financial results to meet market expectations and prevent bad news from causing further drops in Navient's stock price. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 74, 80-82).
