Notwithstanding such incorporation, the following summarizes certain of the Court's determinations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   (A) Pursuant to PROMESA, on May 3, 2017 and May 5, 2017, respectively, the Commonwealth and COFINA each commenced a federal case before the Court in accordance with the requirements of Title III of PROMESA. The commencement of these cases vested the Court with exclusive jurisdiction over the cases and all respective property of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and COFINA, wherever located. As a result of the consensual agreement among the Commonwealth, COFINA, and their respective creditor representatives, the parties formulated, duly solicited, and now seek confirmation of a plan of adjustment in accordance with federal law. The Plan and this Order quiet title to the COFINA Pledged Taxes and resolve all disputes of all parties relating thereto. Moreover, pursuant to PROMESA, and at the request of the Commonwealth and COFINA, the Court shall retain jurisdiction until the COFINA Bonds have been paid in full or otherwise satisfied in accordance with their terms to ensure compliance with the Plan and to adjudicate claims arising therefrom, including claims for specific performance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   (B) As set forth more fully in the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the Court has made the following determinations pursuant to applicable law:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   (ii) This Order is full, final, complete, conclusive, and binding and shall not be subject to collateral attack or other challenge in any court or other forum, except as permitted under applicable law. Confirmation of the Plan constitutes a judicial determination, pursuant to section 4 of PROMESA, that the terms of this Order shall prevail over any general or specific provisions of territory law, State law, or regulation that is inconsistent therewith.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   (iii) The Court shall retain jurisdiction to enforce the terms hereof and of the Plan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   (iv) Subject to the occurrence of and upon the Effective Date, Reorganized COFINA shall be an independent public corporation and instrumentality of the Commonwealth, separate from the Commonwealth and any other instrumentality of the Commonwealth.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   (v) Subject to the occurrence of and upon the Effective Date, ownership of the COFINA Revenues shall have been legally and validly transferred to Reorganized COFINA, and such transfer of ownership shall have been an absolute transfer of all legal and equitable right, title, and interest in the COFINA Revenues, free and clear of all liens, claims, encumbrances, and other interests of any party (except for the statutory lien that arises automatically, pursuant to the terms of\n   the New Bond Legislation, to secure the COFINA Bonds).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   (vi) Subject to the occurrence of and upon the Effective Date, the COFINA Revenues shall not constitute, and shall not be deemed to be, \"available resources\" or \"available revenues\" of the Commonwealth, as that term is used in the Puerto Rico Constitution (whether construed pursuant to the Spanish or English version of the Puerto Rico Constitution).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   (vii) Subject to a \"Quarterly Installment\" funding construct to the extent certain conditions are satisfied, each fiscal year, until the COFINA Bonds are paid in full or otherwise satisfied in accordance with their terms, the first funds comprising the COFINA Pledged Taxes shall be transferred to and deposited with Reorganized COFINA until such time that Reorganized COFINA has received an amount equal to the COFINA Revenues for such fiscal year.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   (viii) Reorganized COFINA's sole and exclusive ownership of the COFINA Revenues shall not be affected in any way by the manner of or control over collection, any person who collects or holds the COFINA Revenues shall do so on behalf of Reorganized COFINA, and no person or entity that collects or holds the COFINA Revenues shall have any legal or equitable right, title, or interest to the COFINA Revenues other than Reorganized COFINA, for the benefit of holders of the COFINA Bonds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   (ix) The statutory first lien against the COFINA Pledged Taxes (including any New Collateral substituted for the COFINA Pledged Taxes in accordance with the terms of the Plan and the New Bond Legislation) arising by operation of the New Bond Legislation in favor of holders of COFINA Bonds is legal, valid, binding and enforceable and shall remain in full force and effect and shall be \"closed\" until, in each case, the COFINA Bonds have been paid or satisfied in full in accordance with their terms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   (x) At the time of issuance and delivery of the COFINA Bonds, Reorganized COFINA is hereby directed to be stamped or written on each of the COFINA Bonds a legend substantially as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   DETERMINED BY THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO TO BE VALID, LEGALLY BINDING, AND ENFORCEABLE PURSUANT TO THE JUDGMENT AND CONFIRMATION ORDER, ENTERED ON THE 4TH DAY OF FEBRUARY, 2019\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   (xi) The Commonwealth's agreement, on behalf of itself and its governmental entities, not to take any action that would, among other things, (a) impair COFINA's right to receive the COFINA Revenues, (b) limit or alter the rights vested in COFINA in accordance with the Plan to fulfill the terms of the COFINA Bonds, (c) materially adversely impair the collection of the COFINA Pledged Taxes in any fiscal year, or (d) impair the rights and remedies of the holders\n   of the COFINA Bonds or the statutory lien established under Article 3.2 of the New Bond Legislation, each as provided in the New Bond Legislation and the New Bond Indenture, serve as adequate protection for the property interests of Reorganized COFINA and the holders of the COFINA Bonds in the COFINA Pledged Taxes under all applicable law, and constitute valid, binding, legal and enforceable obligations of COFINA, Reorganized COFINA, and the Commonwealth, as applicable, and an integral part of the settlements set forth in the Plan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   (xii) The covenants described
