The government asks the Court to enforce a False Claims Act settlement that it appears to have ignored for years. Douglas F. Greer, M.D., the counterparty, argues that the six-year statute of limitations has long since passed. Both parties move for summary judgment. Although the government is not entitled to recover on all of its claims, the Court finds that this lawsuit is timely, filed as it was within six years of Dr. Greer's completion of his related criminal sentence, and will grant in part and deny in part both motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

This claim overstates the obligation. In the Agreement, the government \"asserted a demand against Dr. Greer\" for payment of $ 1,000,000,\" based upon his admitted crimes and false claims,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Agreement at 1; Dr. Greer represented that he could not pay such a judgment,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202415\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202415\">\n    at 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; the parties, \"to avoid the delay, inconvenience and expense of protracted litigation,\" agreed that Dr. Greer would liquidate certain assets in satisfaction of the FCA liabilities,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202415\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202415\">\n    \u00b6 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and the parties recognized that any amount raised by liquidating the specific assets-except the $ 189,000 from the insurance policy-would first go towards the criminal penalties,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202415\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Agreement does not contain terms for future payment, such as by wage garnishment or the like. Further, while the Agreement made clear that, no matter the total value of his assets, Dr. Greer was obligated \"to make full restitution under the terms of the [criminal] Plea Agreement,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , no such statement was included regarding the $ 1 million demand asserted. Thus, performance of the civil Agreement was to be satisfied by liquidation of specified assets (and documentation of the same) but not the payment of a specified amount, and in this context the government's FCA demand of $ 1 million serves as a cap to the funds the government can receive from Dr. Greer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Second, it appears that Dr. Greer has already partially performed under the Agreement by liquidating some of the specified assets: $ 189,000 was paid to the government, which it clearly believes came from the insurance policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Greer Dep. 50:19-20, 65:22-66:6. Dr. Greer also liquidated his retirement accounts in 2007 and paid the proceeds to the government,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202415\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202415\">\n    at 24:5-18, 51:14-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the government does not allege that he failed to liquidate the \"other assets\" worth $ 500,000. Compl. \u00b6 9. The government argues that, notwithstanding the liquidation of assets, no other payments were made under the Agreement, and seeks to force Dr. Greer to liquidate current retirement accounts that were not otherwise discussed in the Agreement; the Court notes that the Agreement required Dr. Greer to use the settlement funds to pay the criminal penalties first, about which the government makes no complaint. Because the Agreement does not require Dr. Greer to use\n   assets outside of those described in the Agreement to satisfy the civil settlement, and because Dr. Greer already liquidated his retirement accounts, such as they were, in 2007, the Court will not require Dr. Greer to again liquidate his retirement accounts now.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Enforceability of the Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Dr. Greer argues that given the confusion over the amount owed, the terms of the Agreement are too vague to enforce. Not so. The Agreement is neither unintelligible nor unenforceable simply because the government has sued for more than it is entitled to. At the very least, Dr. Greer is estopped from making this argument because he relied on the Agreement to obtain a lesser sentence during his criminal sentencing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sentencing Mem. at 19-20, 36-37,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Greer\n   </em>\n   , No. CR-07-095-01 (RJL) (D.D.C. Oct. 19, 2007) (using the Agreement to show that the government was the predominant victim of his fraud and arguing that the Agreement was already financially ruinous). Additionally, the Court finds no ambiguity as to the actual performance required. As discussed above, it is clear to the Court that, under the Agreement, Dr. Greer is not obligated to pay $ 1 million; he is obligated to pay\n   <em>\n    up to\n   </em>\n   $ 1 million, liquidated assets permitting. That the house at 47th Place may be worth more in 2019 than it was in 2007 is unavailing. Just as the government would have had no recourse had Dr. Greer sold his house during the depths of the 2007-2008 recession, so too Dr. Greer has no recourse now. Indeed, the purpose of the Agreement was to avoid litigation over specific amounts; discrete actions satisfy its terms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Sale of the House\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   This leaves for decision only the house at 47th Place, which should have been sold but was not. There is no question that Dr. Greer breached the Agreement; the question is when. Because Dr. Greer's breach was occasioned by his non-performance, and because no period for performance was specified in the Agreement, the Court must determine what reasonable period for performance was contemplated by the parties, based on facts provided and the context within which it was negotiated. The government filed its complaint on April 27, 2016, which means that to prevail here it must show that the performance period extended through at least April 28, 2010, so as to avoid the bar of the 6-year statute of limitations. For reference, April 28, 2010, is approximately 2 years and 9 months after the Agreement was executed; 2 years and 7 months after Dr. Greer paid $ 189,000 under the Agreement; 1 year and 2 months after Dr. Greer was released from prison; 348 days after Dr. Greer was scheduled to complete his prison sentence, if he got no good-time credit; and 10 months before the end of his supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Dr. Greer argues that his performance period ended in August 2007, after he entered his plea and failed to make payments or provide financial documentation to the government. This argument is totally unpersuasive. Dr. Greer\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   make payments in 2007-he liquidated both his retirement accounts in 2007,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Greer Dep. 24:5-18, and other assets,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 9, showing compliance with the Agreement. In addition, the accrual period would have reset in September 2007, when he paid $ 189,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   28 U.S.C. 2415(a) (\"That in the event of later partial payment ... the right of action shall be deemed to accrue again at the time of each such payment.\"). More to the point, retirement accounts and insurance policies are far more liquid than real property, and Dr. Greer was obligated to report to prison in November 2007. The Agreement is not unenforceable because the government forbore from enforcement before Dr. Greer reported to prison or served his sentence. Although Dr. Greer now argues it is theoretically possible that he could have sold the house at that time, there is nothing in the Agreement that supports his argument that such was his deadline. Similarly, Dr. Greer's second proposed date for the end of a reasonable period for compliance, January 2008 (six months after his sentencing and 2-3 months into his prison term) is no more reasonable because it would have required him to sell the house, document the transaction, and remit the funds while he was still serving his prison sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Beyond these arguments, Dr. Greer remembers very little about the formation of the Agreement and so cannot hazard a guess as to the unspoken \"intentions of the parties\" at the time of its execution. Dr. Greer testified that, after his prison sentence, he thought that \"everything had just gone away,\" and believes that he did not breach the Agreement by virtue of the fact that he \"didn't remember the [A]greement.\" Greer Dep. 61:11-15, 63:21;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202415\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202415\">\n    at 64:1-2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[The Agreement] didn't cross my mind.\"). Having paid $ 189,000 under the Agreement, Dr. Greer also testified that he \" 'made no payments under the settlement agreement,\" and doesn't \"understand all these figures now or ... how they connect.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202415\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202415\">\n    at 64:18-22, 65:17-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, when asked what the purpose of the Agreement was, Dr. Greer testified \"I just don't remember. This is ten years ago, and I do not remember.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202415\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202415\">\n    at 71:16-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Without more, there is insufficient evidence to rule in Dr. Greer's favor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The government argues by turn that the intent of the parties is discernable from the structure of the Agreement, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Greer shall provide to the United States specific documentation exactly detailing the monies obtained from the liquidation of the Retirement Accounts, the availability and amount of liquid assets, the actual payment of taxes related to the liquidation of assets, and the proceeds from the sale of the [House on 47th Place] including the actual payment of any related capital gains taxes.\n   <em>\n    Failure to provide adequate documentation shall be grounds for the United States to file a false claims act lawsuit regarding the allegations settled herein. The statute of limitations for those claims is agreed waived by the signing of this Settlement Agreement\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Agreement \u00b6 3 (emphasis added). This provision is key because the FCA normally has a statute of limitations of six years,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203731\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), which would have run in December 2012. It therefore follows, the government argues, that the parties \"anticipated payment well beyond 2012.\" Pl.'s Mot. at 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Rooted as it is in the text of the Agreement, the Court finds the government's position compelling. If Dr. Greer was expected to sell the house within the FCA's six-year statute of limitations, no waiver of that statute of limitations would have been required to enforce the documentation requirements. And while the government needed the stick of the FCA to enforce the documentation requirements because those requirements otherwise had no monetary value, it had another option for the enforcement of the sale of the house: suit in this Court. While Dr. Greer responds that it would be unreasonable to imply from waiver of the FCA statute of limitations an extended period for performance, the inference of his argument would require the Court to find that the parties intended the house to be sold immediately but only documented years later. Otherwise, there would be no purpose behind the waiver for the FCA claims. Such an inference is unsound on its face. Notably, Dr. Greer supplies no facts or contract interpretation to support his claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Context also matters. Dr. Greer surrendered his medical licenses in the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia before pleading guilty. Greer Plea 21:1-8. During his prison term, he lost his medical practice and the two rented locations in downtown D.C. and suburban Maryland at which he had previously practiced. Greer Dep. 59:12-60:18. Dr. Greer's wife had been employed by his medical practice.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203731\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203731\">\n    at 42:20-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, his family income depended heavily upon his medical work. Dr. Greer's grown son is also \"unemployable\" and so depends entirely on Dr. Greer and his wife for financial support.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203731\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203731\">\n    at 31:2-6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When Dr. Greer was released from prison, he was \"facing trying to get the practice going back again\" since \"all the money [he] had, basically, was transferred to the federal government and then to those insurance entities.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203731\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203731\">\n    at 60:19-21, 51:14-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Against this chaotic backdrop, and without evidence to the contrary, the Court concludes that the parties could not and did not expect Dr. Greer to sell the house at 47th Place immediately; he had to rebuild his life. The Court also notes that while the\n   Agreement settled the civil FCA lawsuit, it also pertained to the criminal monetary penalties imposed as part of Dr. Greer's criminal sentence. As such, the Court finds that there is sufficient evidence in the record to show that Dr. Greer had at least until the end his prison sentence-including supervised release-to perform under the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Having thus determined that Dr. Greer had until at least 2011 to perform, the Court need not determine exactly when the Agreement was breached. In any event, the government's arguments about the repudiation doctrine provide an outer bound for that breach. Specifically, the government argues that, absent a time certain for payment, breach could only occur after \"(1) the performing party demands performance within a reasonable amount of time, and the other party still fails to perform within the time specified; or (2) the non-performing party repudiates the contract, and the performing party chooses to treat the repudiation as a breach.\"\n   <em>\n    Kasarsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9407493\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/296/1331/#p1336\">\n    296 F.3d at 1336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Put another way, Dr. Greer was in breach either after he failed to perform upon a timely government demand or after he repudiated the agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9407493\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/296/1331/#p1336\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (stating that the repudiation doctrine \"gives the promisee the right of electing either to wait until the time for the promisor's performance has arrived or to act upon the renunciation\" (citing\n   <em>\n    Roehm v. Horst\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3612456\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/178/1/#p13\">\n    178 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3612456\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/178/1/#p13\">\n    20 S.Ct. 780\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3612456\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/178/1/#p13\">\n    44 L.Ed. 953\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1900) ) ). Both Dr. Greer and the government agree that Dr. Greer did not repudiate the Agreement, at least not until 2015 when the government made its demand for payment and Dr. Greer refused to pay, as evidenced by this lawsuit. Whether Dr. Greer's period for performance expired sometime between 2011 and 2015, or whether it would have extended indefinitely absent repudiation, is irrelevant-either way, he was not in breach in 2011, and he was in breach when he forced the government to bring this suit to enforce the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The government brought its complaint for breach of contract within six years of 2011. Therefore, its complaint was timely.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Greer having asserted no other defenses to the breach of contract claim, the Court will require specific performance of his obligation under the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
