BROWNING, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS MATTER\n   </strong>\n   comes before the Court on: (i) the Defendant's Motion to Suppress Evidence, filed December 1, 2017 (Doc. 78)(\"Motion\"); (ii) the Defendant's Supplemental Motion to Suppress All Evidence Seized and Any Fruits of the Poisonous Tree Obtained as a Result of the Unlawful Search, filed July 24, 2018 (Doc. 141)(\"Supp. Motion\"); (iii) the Defendant Bentley Streett's Motion to Suppress Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, filed November 3, 2018 (Doc. 174)(\"Streett's Proposed Findings\"); and (iv) the United States' Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law (September 11, 2018 Evidentiary Hearing), filed November 2, 2018 (Doc. 168)(\"United States' Proposed Findings\"). The Court held an evidentiary hearing on September 11, 2018. The primary issues are: (i) whether the Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum at 1 (issued November 4, 3013), filed July 24, 2018 (Doc. 141-1)(\"Subpoena\"), constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States; (ii) whether the Subpoena violates New Mexico law and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States; (iii) whether the Affidavit for Search Warrant (undated), filed July 24, 2018 (Doc. 141-2)(\"First Affidavit\"), provides probable cause to believe that evidence of Streett's alleged criminal activity would be found in his cellular telephone records; (iv) whether, even if the Search Warrant at 4 (issued February 12, 2014), filed July 24, 2018 (Doc. 141-2)(\"First Warrant\"), issued based on the First Affidavit, lacks probable cause, Bernalillo\n   County Sheriff's Office Detective Kyle Hartsock relied on the First Warrant in good faith when he obtained Streett's cellular telephone records; (v) whether the First Affidavit violates the Due Process Clause, because, as Streett argues, it lacks substantial evidence to support probable cause as required by New Mexico law; (vi) whether the Affidavit for Search Warrant (executed February 24, 2014), filed December 1, 2017 (Doc. 78-1)(\"Second Affidavit\"), provides probable cause to believe that evidence of Streett's alleged criminal activity would be found at the residence at 4620 Plume Road NW, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87120 (\"4620 Plume residence\"); (vii) whether, even if the Search Warrant at 14 (issued February 24, 2014), filed August 15, 2018 (Doc. 144-5)(\"Second Warrant\"), issued based on the Second Affidavit, lacks probable cause, Hartsock relied on the Second Warrant in good faith when he searched the 4620 Plume residence; (viii) whether, even if the Second Warrant lacks probable cause and Hartsock did not execute the Second Warrant in good faith, law enforcement inevitably would have obtained a warrant to search the 4620 Plume residence; and (ix) whether, even if the Second Warrant contains an incurable defect, even if Hartsock did not execute the Second Warrant in good faith, and even if law enforcement would not have inevitably obtained a search warrant for the 4620 Plume residence, Hartsock would have discovered the identities of the charged victims. The Court will deny the Motion and the Supp. Motion. The Court holds that the Subpoena is not a search under the Fourth Amendment, because of the third-party doctrine. The Court concludes that the Subpoena does not violate New Mexico law, because a grand jury issued it after presentment of evidence, and that the Subpoena does not violate the Due Process Clause, for the same reasons it does not violate the Fourth Amendment or New Mexico law. The Court holds that the First Affidavit provides probable cause to search Streett's cellular telephone records and, even if it does not provide probable cause, that Hartsock relied on the First Warrant in good faith. Finally, the Court holds that the Second Affidavit does not provide probable cause to search the 4620 Plume Residence, but the Court will not suppress the resulting evidence because it concludes that: (i) Hartsock acted in good faith when he executed the Second Warrant; (ii) Hartsock would have inevitably discovered the evidence, because he would have obtained a valid warrant had the Second Warrant not issued; and (iii) Hartsock would have inevitably discovered the victims' identities through Streett's telephone records. Accordingly, the Court will deny the Motion and Supp. Motion, and will not exclude the telephone records or evidence seized from the 4620 Plume residence from the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Rule 12(d) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires the Court to state its essential findings on the record when deciding a motion that involves factual issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(d) (\"When factual issues are involved in deciding a motion, the court must state its essential findings on the record.\"). The findings of fact in this Memorandum Opinion and Order shall serve as the Court's essential findings for rule 12(d) purposes. The Court makes these findings under the authority of rule 104(a) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which requires a judge to decide preliminary questions relating to the admissibility of evidence, including the legality of a search or seizure and the voluntariness of an individual's confession or consent to a search.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Evid. 104(a) (\"The court must decide any preliminary question about whether a witness is qualified, a privilege exists, or evidence is admissible.

The NCMEC Tip states that it has a priority level of 3, the second-lowest priority level which NCMEC assigns its cyber tips and the lowest level assigned to submissions from an individual person, and that \"[a]dditional information [is] required to determine possible risk.\" NCMEC Tip at 1.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 13:17-24 (Zimmerman, Whitsitt);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17:9-18 (Zimmerman, Whitsitt).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   5.

My concern is that he is on-line solicitating [sic] nude photos from other minor children and could possibly have received some.\" NCMEC Tip at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   7. The submitter also provides Streett's address as \"Albuquerque, NM United States,\" his telephone number as \"(505) 242-2677,\" and his age as approximately thirty-eight, but does not provide how she knows this information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   NCMEC Tip at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   8. The Tip's submitter later emailed \"NCMEC's general email,\" saying \"I just sent a report of child exploitation in on-line. I realized after the fact that I entered the wrong phone number for the subject\" and, after stating the original number provided is a contact number for the Albuquerque Police Department, provided Streett's correct telephone number as \"505-974-9704\". NCMEC Tip at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   9. According to a NCMEC note on the Tip, the first \"provided number for the reported user appears to result back to the police department\" and, per the submitter's email, the correct \"number is: 505-974-9704.\" NCMEC Tip at 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   10.

NCMEC Tip at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   12. The TLO also notes that Streett is a deceased individual's social security number, and provides the social security number as (redacted)-6364.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NCMEC Tip at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   13. There are two \"Possible Criminal Records\" for Streett in the note as well, NCMEC Tip at 8, but they do not indicate \"a previous significant criminal history,\" Tr. at 23:8-10 (Zimmerman, Whitsitt).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 46:8-13 (Zimmerman, Whitsitt)(stating \"there was no indication of any criminal history of\" Streett being a sex offender).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   14. The note concludes with an address summary, providing a list of eight addresses, with the only non-redacted address being the 4620 Plume residence with associated dates of \"4/12/2004 to 10/30/2013.\" NCMEC Tip at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   15.

The NCMEC Tip concludes by saying it \"was made available to the Law Enforcement Agencies listed below\" and then lists the New Mexico Attorney General's Office -- naming special agent Anthony M. Maez as the assigned investigator -- and the Bernalillo County Sheriff's Office -- listing detective Kyle Hartsock as the assigned investigator. NCMEC Tip at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   17. Special Agent Jon Whitsitt began his career in law enforcement in June 2006,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 9:14-15 (Whitsitt), and worked in the Attorney General's Office as a criminal analyst, \"primarily focus[ing] on cyber tip management,\" from approximately September 2011, until approximately September 2014, Tr. at 10:9-21 (Zimmerman, Whitsitt).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 53:22 (Whitsitt)(clarifying that he did not leave the Attorney General's Office in 2013 as previously stated).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   18. The position of criminal analyst is not one of \"sworn law enforcement capacity\"; it is a civilian position. Tr. at 34:5-7 (Whitsitt, Zimmerman).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   19. At some date which Whitsitt could not recall, he transitioned to the position of special agent -- which is a law enforcement officer position.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 54:3-11 (Whitsitt, Zimmerman).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   20. Whitsitt currently works at the Gallup Police Department.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 9:10 (Whitsitt).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   21. Whitsitt was a special agent when investigating the NCMEC Tip.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NCMEC Tip at 11 (releasing the tip on November 1, 2013, to the Attorney General's Office); Letter to Custodian of Records at T-Mobile from Special Agent Jon R.

Whitsitt had special training as a criminal analyst to review NCMEC's cyber tips: he was \"trained in [Internet Crimes Against Children] procedures and NCMEC, and reading those tip reports,\" and also \"attended training at the [NCMEC office] in cyber tip management.\" Tr. at 16:8-16 (Zimmerman, Whitsitt).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   23. \"[C]yber tip management\" refers to triaging the tips that the New Mexico Attorney General's Internet Crimes Against Children task force receives from NCMEC -- after NCMEC has screened them -- as New Mexico's \"ICAC coordinator.\" Second Affidavit at 4.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 10:20-11:5 (Zimmerman, Whitsitt); First Affidavit at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   24. NCMEC asks the ICAC coordinators to \"validate the information\" in the cyber tips, because it forwards every tip received without \"vouch[ing] for the accuracy of any of the information.\" Tr. at 33:6-14 (Zimmerman, Whitsitt).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   25. Whitsitt's triage process is first \"figuring out the most information [he]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   could without launching a full-fledged investigation, and then presenting the information to [his] supervisor who would then assign the case to the appropriate law enforcement agency.\" Tr. at 11:4-9 (Whitsitt).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   26. Whitsitt \"looked at the facts or the elements of the cyber tip,\" and, if he believed that a child \"is in immediate threat or danger,\" that tip would take \"an ultimate priority.\" Tr. at 13:6-12 (Whitsitt).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   27. Whitsitt would receive variable numbers of cyber tips on any given day -- some days no tips, other days up to fourteen tips -- but he could not recall how many cyber tips he received on the day that he got the NCMEC Tip.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 12:23-13:3 (Whitsitt, Zimmerman).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   28.

The Second Affidavit does not identify the CI as the alleged victim's mother nor provide whether she has provided accurate information in the past.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Affidavit at 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   136.

The Second Affidavit provides some additional background information on the partnership between NCMEC and the New Mexico Attorney General's Office, stating that NCMEC screens the online tip first -- because anybody can submit one through its website -- then assign it to the appropriate state's \"ICAC coordinator,\" who \"conducts a basic investigation to find out what county or city has jurisdiction over the case.\" Second Affidavit at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   138. The Second Affidavit then discusses what Hartsock learned from Minnesota law enforcement's interviews with M.Y. and with her mother.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Affidavit at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   139. On February 21, 2014, Hartsock reached out through the ICAC network to law enforcement in Minnesota, where M.Y. resided, to attempt to make \"in-person contact with mom and daughter, to get more information about what had occurred\" -- especially because Hartsock believed the mixed media message \"could have been child pornography.\" Tr. at 98:1-16 (Hartsock).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hartsock Report at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   140. At the time that Hartsock reached out to local law enforcement, he lacked \"specific knowledge of\" how to contact law enforcement in another state, Tr. at 182:9-10 (Hartsock), because he wanted \"to make sure someone with ICAC background\" would contact M.Y. and her mother, Tr. at 180:4-6 (Hartsock).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   141. Hartsock waited to contact local law enforcement until after he executed the First Warrant, because he wanted to establish if M.Y. was still talking to Streett, as it would \"affect [his] ability to interview someone over the phone or law enforcement's ability to interview [M.Y.] in person if [she is] still in contact with [Streett].\" Tr. at 151:23-182:2 (Hartsock).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   142. On February 23, 2014, Matthew Vig, with the Kittson County Sheriff's Office, made contact with M.Y. and her mother at the Kittson County Sheriff's Office in Minnesota.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hartsock Report at 4; Vig Report at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   143. Vig took a statement from M.Y., who said she was fourteen-years-old at the time\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that Streett knew of her age, because her Twitter page showed her age of fourteen and because she told Streett that she was fourteen.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Vig Report at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   144. Vig reported that M.Y. said that Streett asked her \"to send him nude photos to him, two or three times,\" but that she did not send him any photographs. Vig Report at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   145. The Vig Report states that M.Y. said Streett sent her a \"face photo, no nudity,\" and that he \"was older,\" but that she \"did not know his true age.\" Vig Report at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   146. The Second Affidavit states that M.Y. \"consensually gave her cellphone to Deputy Vig so he could download it and confirm the details of her relationship with Bentley.\" Second Affidavit at 5.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Vig Report at 1 (stating that, \"with consent, I received M (remainder redacted)'s cell\n   phone as evidence\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   147. Hartsock believed that the Vig Report \"more strongly corroborated\" the NCMEC Tip and that this corroboration, combined with \"the phone records showing the high amount of communication, and that mixed media message being sent,\" led Hartsock to draft a search warrant for Streett's home. Tr. at 100:13-18 (Hartsock).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   148. The Second Affidavit concedes there is no evidence that M.Y. sent Streett any nude photographs, but notes that Streett's asking constitutes a crime under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2030-37-3.2\">\n    N.M.

Hartsock states that, in his \"training and experience[,] a person does not try to gain child pornography only once and one way,\" and thus he \"seeks to ensure no photographs were received from our victim that would violate further law of child exploitation and to ensure there were no other victims that our suspect has contacted asking for explicit images of minors.\" Second Affidavit at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   152. The remainder of the Second Affidavit provides how Hartsock's \"training and experience\" leads him to believe that evidence of child pornography may be found in the various pieces of personal property which he wants to search and seize. Second Affidavit at 5-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   153. The Second Affidavit does not discuss the information gleaned from the telephone records that Hartsock obtained\n   under the First Warrant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Affidavit at 2-13.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   154.

On May 21, 2014, Hartsock swore to an affidavit supporting an application for a warrant to search Streett's primary cellular telephone taken during the search of the 4620 Plume residence: \"A Nokia Lumia cell phone running a Microsoft Operating System.\" Affidavit for Search Warrant at 1 (executed May 21, 2014), filed December 1, 2017 (Doc. 78-2)(\"Third Warrant\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   164.

The Third Warrant also \"requests that Microsoft preserve these message[s] and not allow the user to initiate any request that could delete or alter the messages once uploaded.\" Third Warrant at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   166. The Third Warrant provides the same description of the NCMEC Tip and Vig's follow-up with M.Y. that the Second Affidavit provides.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Warrant at 1-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   167. Hartsock again states that his \"training and experience\" counsels that \"a person does not try to gain child pornography only once and one way,\" so he wants to ensure Streett received no photographs from M.Y. or any other underage victims. Third Warrant at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   168. The Third Warrant describes Hartsock's execution of the Second Warrant\n   and his conversation with Streett, in which Streett \"admitted to meeting many women and girls on Twitter and other social media websites and ask[ing] them for nude photographs of themselves.\" Third Warrant at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   169. According to the Third Warrant, Streett said in this conversation that \"he remembered meeting MY and talking to her via text messages on his phone but couldn't remember if he asked her to send a naked photograph. He did know she was under 18 years old during their conversations.\" Third Warrant at 3.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hartsock Report at 5 (stating that when asked about M.Y., Streett said he knows her).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   170. According to the Third Warrant, the Nokia telephone \"contains thousands of messages between Bentley and other women, some who identify themselves as young as 14 years old and contain photographs of genitals being sent and received from Bentley.\" Third Warrant at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   171. Microsoft told Hartsock that it could not prevent a remote user from erasing data from the phone, so he physically went through the conversations contained on the telephone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hartsock Report at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   172. Hartsock extracted \"[a]pproximately 13,000 different text messages\" from the Nokia telephone, Tr. at 104:19-20 (Hartsock), and found that it appeared that Streett was texting minors, because Streett \"would store the contacts as the name of the person, their location, their age and sometimes their usernames,\" Hartsock Report at 6.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 104:19-105:3 (Hartsock, Mease).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   173. Hartsock found the conversation with M.Y., which showed that Streett \"indirectly ask[ed] her for a nude photograph around the time the complaint was made.\" Hartsock Report at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   174. In a conversion with a person identified as \"B,\" Streett discussed a sexual relationship he had \"with a young follower\" and sent B \"a selfie of him and a white female who appears to be a teenager. It appears they are in a hotel or motel room....\" Hartsock Report at 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   175. After writing another warrant for \"a longer expansion of records for Bentley from T-Mobile\" to determine with whom Streett had the sexual relationship, he found \"a large amount of texting between two phone numbers,\" one beginning with \"414\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the other with \"815.\" Hartsock Report at 11-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   176. On June 24, 2014, Hartsock swore to an affidavit to obtain a search warrant for the \"call, SMS, MMS and any other recorded transaction records or meta data from 4/1/2013-2/28/2014,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the \"cell tower locations for each call or SMS, MMS or other recorded transaction or meta data\n   from 4/1/2013-2/28/2014\" for Verizon Wireless Account 414-(remainder redacted). Affidavit for Search Warrant at 1 (executed June 24, 2014), filed December 1, 2017 (Doc. 78-3)(\"Fourth Warrant\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   177. The Fourth Warrant provides the same information regarding the NCMEC Tip and Vig's contact with M.Y. as previous affidavits provide.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fourth Warrant at 1-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   178. According to the Fourth Warrant, Hartsock \"interviewed Bentley Streett who admitted to meeting wom[e]n on Twitter and asking them for nude photographs, 1-2 of them he knew were under 18 when he asked for the nude photographs. He stated that Twitter and text messaging were his primary ways of communicating with the underage girls.\" Fourth Warrant at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   179. The Fourth Warrant states that, after reviewing text messages on Streett's cellular telephone, Hartsock found \"multiple conversations\" in which Streett \"sends a photo of himself with a young teenage looking female and tells a story that he went to Illinois and Indiana in July of 2013 and met a virgin 15 year old girl that he had sexual contact with for a few days.\" Fourth Warrant at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   180. According to the Fourth Warrant, Hartsock obtained Streett's telephone records, and identified the 414-(remainder redacted) number as one which Streett was \"sending and receiving hundreds of text messages from in a short time span during early July, 2013.\" Fourth Warrant at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   181. Hartsock says that he wants to determine if this user is a \"possible victim[ ] of sexual exploitation or sexual coercion to perform intimate acts. By Bentley's statements he had physical sexual intercourse with her at his motel room, and with the phone location information affiant seeks to identify that hotel room.\" Fourth Warrant at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   182. On August 26, 2014, Hartsock swore to an affidavit for a search warrant to obtain \"[a]ccount subscriber and a list of all other phone numbers associated with [Verizon Wireless] account [815-(remainder redacted),] including their names, address and other contact information between 6/1/2013-12/31/2013.\" Affidavit for Search Warrant at 1 (executed August 26, 2014), filed December 1, 2017 (Doc. 78-4)(\"Fifth Warrant\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   183. After providing the same information regarding the NCMEC Tip and Hartsock's meeting with Streett as in the Fourth Warrant, the Fifth Warrant describes a photograph that Streett \"appears to have taken ... with the young female he had intercourse with,\" purportedly the fifteen-year-old virgin the Fourth and Fifth Affidavits describe Streett meeting in Illinois and Indiana. Fifth Warrant at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   184. The Fifth Warrant describes this photograph as showing \"what appears to be the inside of a motel room door.\" Fifth Warrant at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   185. According to the Fifth Warrant, the photograph \"was found on the cell phone and by looking at the meta data on the photo, Bentley's phone that was seized was the phone that took the photograph. The date is 7/13/13 for the photo and his call records indicate very high usage that day to this phone number.\" Fifth Warrant at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   186. Hartsock says he \"believes the girl in the photo was using\" the 815-(remainder redacted) number to communicate with Streett and that he \"seeks to identify the owner of the cell phone account to find the girl and find her involvement with Bentley.\" Fifth Warrant at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   187. This 815 telephone number is the same 815 number discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 118-120, belonging to Jane Doe 1.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 124:1-9 (Mease, Hartsock).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   In December 2015, a grand jury returned a Second Superseding Indictment,\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   charging Streett with two counts of traveling in interstate commerce from New Mexico to Illinois \"for the purpose of engaging in any illicit sexual conduct\" with a person under eighteen years of age -- Jane Doe 1 -- that \"would be in violation of Chapter 109A of Title 18, United States Code, had the sexual act occurred,\" in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202423\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

The crux of Streett's argument in the Motion is that the Second Affidavit \"is devoid of any indication that Mr. Streett resided at 4620 Plume, much less any indication that contraband related to Mr. Streett's alleged criminal activity would be found at this residence,\" and, thus that \"evidence obtained as a result of th[is] unreasonable search ... was wrongfully obtained in violation\n   of Mr. Streett's Fourth Amendment rights, and should be excluded.\" Motion at 1. The Motion likens the Second Affidavit to the affidavit at issue in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Gonzales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1546968\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/399/1225/\">\n    399 F.3d 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 2005), which identified the address \"321 E. Church\" but \"never specified that 321 E. Church was the defendant's residence, and otherwise never explained the connection between 321 E. Church ... or the suspected criminal activity.\" Motion at 6 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

According to Streett, the Tenth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Gonzales\n   </em>\n   upheld the district court's holding to suppress the evidence, concluding the warrant lacked probable cause and the good-faith doctrine did not apply, because the \"underlying documents are devoid of factual support.\" Motion at 7 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1546968\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/399/1225/\">\n    399 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1230 ). Streett contrasts this holding with that in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Beck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"602930\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/139/950/\">\n    139 F. App'x 950\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 2005) (unpublished)(Browning, J. sitting by designation), where the Tenth Circuit upheld the application of the good-faith doctrine, because, \"although the affidavit was weak, it established 'a minimally sufficient nexus between the illegal activity and the place to be searched.' \" Motion at 8 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"602930\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/139/950/\">\n    139 F.

Streett concludes from this caselaw that, because the Second Affidavit lacks the \"minimal nexus between 4620 Plume or any of the items listed on the Affidavit to Mr. Streett or his alleged criminal activity[,] ... the evidence seized from the 4620 Plume Search must be suppressed.\" Motion at 9. Streett argues that, because the Second Affidavit states that it seeks to seize \" 'documents which indicate proof of residence,' [this] impl[ies] that the affiant had no actual knowledge of whether Mr. Streett was, in fact, a resident of 4620 Plume,\" underscoring the Second Affidavit's lack of a minimal nexus. Motion at 1. Streett thus argues that the Court must exclude \"Streett's statements to police officers; computer; laptop; smartphone; and regular phone.\" Motion at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   The Motion concludes by arguing that \"all evidence later discovered as a result of this illegal search of [4620 Plume] must also be excluded. This includes evidence discovered pursuant to the three search warrants which were later obtained in the months after the initial search of 4620 Plume.\" Motion at 10. This exclusion is necessary, Streett asserts, under \"the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine.\" Motion at 9 (citing\n   <em>\n    Wong Sun v.

Streett specifically argues that, once the Court suppresses the evidence obtained from the illegal search of the 4620 Plume residence, the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Affidavits fail to provide probable cause, and \"the evidence obtained pursuant to the execution of these later warrants must also be suppressed.\" Motion at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     The Supp. Motion\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   Streett filed the Supp. Motion on July 24, 2018, to set forth three additional arguments for suppression of evidence: (i) that\n   <em>\n    Carpenter v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612910\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2206/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 2206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612910\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2206/\">\n    201 L.Ed.2d 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018), requires suppression of the evidence seized resulting from the Subpoena; (ii) that the First Warrant lacks probable cause, requiring suppression of evidence and fruits resulting from its execution; and (iii) that Hartsock failed to provide substantial evidence supporting a finding of probable cause in his First Affidavit in contravention of New Mexico Rules of Criminal Procedure,\n   denying Streett due process of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supp. Motion at 1, 19. Streett argues that\n   <em>\n    Carpenter v. United States\n   </em>\n   \"makes the Government's initial privacy intrusion here, the subpoena, an unlawful search and seizure that violated Mr. Streett's Fourth Amendment rights.\" Supp. Motion at 2. Streett states that the Supreme Court of the United States held in\n   <em>\n    Carpenter v. United States\n   </em>\n   \"that the prosecutor's request for cell site locator information ('CSLI') was a search and therefore required the Government to make a probable cause showing necessary to obtain a search warrant before obtaining cell phone information like the CSLI at issue in that case.\" Supp. Motion at 4 (citing\n   <em>\n    Carpenter v.

The CSLI data, Streett argues, \"gave the government, 'an intimate window into a person's life, revealing not only his particular movements, but through them his familial, political, professional, religious, and sexual associations.' \" Supp. Motion at 4 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Carpenter v.

Streett notes that \"cell phones follow the user everywhere ... and for the most part never leave the individual's side.\" Supp. Motion at 5. These technological changes, Streett states, led the Supreme Court to \"modify[ ] the third party doctrine it had previously employed\" in, for example,\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Supp. Motion at 5. The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Carpenter v. United States\n   </em>\n   , Streett argues, concluded that the CSLI data is collected involuntarily on everyone, \"creat[ing] a reasonable expectation of privacy in the data,\" although \"[m]ere telephone numbers dialed are still subject to the third party doctrine and do not require a probable cause determination.\" Supp. Motion at 6 (citing\n   <em>\n    Carpenter v.

Streett states that the Supreme Court held \"that the Fourth Amendment requires search warrants supported by probable cause, and not subpoenas, when the Government seeks cellular telephone records.\" Supp. Motion at 7 (citing\n   <em>\n    Carpenter v.

He notes that the Supreme Court had previously held that the Fourth Amendment requires search warrants \"to search the contents of a cell phone seized incident to arrest.\" Supp. Motion at 7 n.2 (citing\n   <em>\n    Riley v.

Streett cites the dissent of the Honorable Anthony Kennedy, former Associate Justice for the Supreme Court of the United States, because Justice Kennedy stated that the majority decision in\n   <em>\n    Carpenter v.

He then argues that \"there is no way to\n   know whether there was a pending grand jury investigation necessary for the subpoena to issue or that it was issued at the behest of the District Attorney,\" and that \"[s]ubpoenas issued without a pending grand jury matter are unlawful.\" Supp. Motion at 7 (citing\n   <em>\n    State v.

The Fourth Amendment, Streett avers, \"requires the suppression of any evidence seized as a result of the initial subpoena for telephone records,\" because it sought \"cell phone data beyond numbers dialed.\" Supp. Motion at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   Streett next argues that the First Warrant lacks probable cause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supp. Motion at 9. He says that he is challenging the First Warrant on its face, so the Court must look to \"the four corners of the [First Affidavit] to determine whether the warrant is supported by probable cause.\" Supp. Motion at 9 (citing\n   <em>\n    Whiteley v.

According to Streett, the First Affidavit \"lacked sufficient information for a probable cause finding,\" so despite approval a magistrate judge's approval of the First Warrant, \"all evidence seized pursuant to that search or subsequent searches must be suppressed.\" Supp. Motion at 10 (citing\n   <em>\n    Wong Sun v.

First, Streett argues that the First Affidavit \"is immediately conspicuous and questionable because it is blank on the portion of the form calling for the date Hartsock signed as the affiant.\" Supp. Motion at 10 (citing First Affidavit at 3). Second, Streett argues that the First Affidavit proffers \"no case specific facts justifying probable cause to issue a search warrant,\" and then quotes the portion of the First Affidavit discussing the NCMEC Tip, the Subpoena, T-Mobile's Email, and Hartsock's inability to contact the NCMEC tipster. Supp. Motion at 11 (quoting First Affidavit at 2). Streett then discusses electronic communication service providers' affirmative duty to report any apparent child pornography to NCMEC and the high fines associated with a failure to report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supp. Motion at 12 &amp; n.3 (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2258A(a) ). Streett characterizes the First Affidavit's language describing the NCMEC Tip as \"an adult male soliciting a nude photograph of a fifteen year old girl,\" acknowledging that the Court must only examine the First Affidavit, but averring that \"the language the affiant used made the actual NCMEC tip seem more nefarious, turning the word 'requested' into 'soliciting,' \" and suggesting that \"a struggling affiant [is] using all powers of creativity to create something out of nothing.\" Supp. Motion at 12 &amp; n.4 (quoting First Affidavit at 2). Streett argues that, because nothing in the NCMEC Tip suggests the tipster's desire to remain a CI, Hartsock used the term in \"an effort to beef up his lack of probable cause and draw attention from what easily could have been an intra-family dispute over a boyfriend the parent disapproved of.\" Supp. Motion at 13 &amp; n.5 (citing NCMEC Tip at 3). Streett also argues that the First Affidavit's use of the term \"conversation\" suggests the tipster \"had seen multiple communications,\" even though the NCMEC Tip refers to only one text message. Supp. Motion at 13 &amp; n.6 (citing NCMEC Tip at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   Streett argues that, because the NCMEC Tip does not state how the tipster knew the requestor was an adult or how he would have known that M.Y. was a minor, and because the requestor asked\n   only for a nude photograph, the First Affidavit fails to establish probable cause \"to search for private subscriber information based on the notion that the search warrant 'could contain child pornography or the attempt to entice sex from a minor.' \" Supp. Motion at 14 (quoting First Affidavit at 3). Streett further argues the First Affidavit is deficient in providing \"no information that would indicate the reliability of the CI's information,\" and in not disclosing how the CI knew the identity or location of the requestor. Supp. Motion at 14 (citing First Affidavit at 2). The First Affidavit, in Streett's view, \"relies solely on a confidential informant's hearsay tip to NCMEC,\" and does not provide \"the necessary reliability or ... corroboration to justify the speculative nature of the affidavit.\" Supp. Motion at 15. Streett acknowledges that an affidavit may rely on hearsay, but he notes the Tenth Circuit, in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3722034\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/735/1187/\">\n    735 F.3d 1187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 2013), said that \"the basis of a confidential informant's knowledge, as well as his reliability, are important factors in deciding whether information in an affidavit supports a finding of probable cause for a search.\" Supp. Motion at 15 (internal quotation marks omitted)(quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Streett avers that an affidavit relying on hearsay to establish probable cause is insufficient if it \"neither provides a basis for the informant's veracity, nor includes sufficient independent corroboration of the informant's information.\" Supp. Motion at 15 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v. Danhauer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11191108\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/229/1002/#p1006\">\n    229 F.3d 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1006 (10th Cir. 2000) ). With its lack of independent corroboration and no showing of the informant's veracity, the First Affidavit, Streett argues, lacks probable cause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supp. Motion at 15. Streett also argues that the First Affidavit does not \"explain the origin of the telephone number 505-974-9704, allegedly associated with Mr. Streett\" and that Hartsock was merely speculating, \"unconvinced there was any criminal activity.\" Supp. Motion at 17. Streett points to the First Affidavit's language -- that Hartsock is requesting the telephone records to \"see a wide picture of the frequency of communication between MY and the requestor, and the frequency or infrequency of mixed media messages that based on the Cl's [sic] complaint,\n   <em>\n    could contain child pornography\n   </em>\n   or the attempt to entice sex from a minor\" -- as showing the speculative nature of the search. Supp. Motion at 19 (emphasis in the Supp. Motion)(internal quotation marks omitted)(quoting the First Affidavit at 2-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   Streett also argues that Hartsock omitted the information the Subpoena provides -- \"like the numbers dialed, the nature of the communication, and the size of any messages conveyed\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   -- and Streett's lack of criminal history. Supp. Motion at 18. Streett argues that \"Hartsock had failed to come up with any further facts to support probable cause\" and that \"[t]he most basic of investigations went undone.\" Supp. Motion at 18. Streett argues that Hartsock's failure \"to do even the minimal amount of investigation to verify the confidential informant's allegations\" precludes the application of the good-faith doctrine. Supp. Motion at 16 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Streett states that Hartsock can blame only \"himself for his lack of diligence in securing sufficient probable cause to justify a warrant.\" Supp. Motion at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   Streett then argues that the First Affidavit's lack of substantial evidence violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, because the New Mexico Rules of Criminal Procedure require substantial evidence to support probable cause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supp. Motion at 19. Streett notes that the Supreme Court of the United States has held that \"[a] petitioner may also be entitled to habeas relief if he shows that the alleged violations of state law resulted in a denial of due process,\" and has emphasized that federal courts should not reexamine a state court's determination of state law.

Streett notes that the \"Court has the first opportunity to review the inadequacy of the\" First Affidavit, because \"no state court judge got to hear a motion to suppress.\" Supp. Motion at 20. Streett argues that \"Hartsock failed to comply with Rule 5-211(E), a rule patterned on Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 41,\" but which explicitly requires that probable cause be \"based on substantial evidence.\" Supp. Motion at 20 (quoting N.M. Ct. R. 5-211). As, in Streett's view, the First Affidavit provides \"few facts, much less probable cause,\" Streett argues the First Affidavit cannot contain substantial evidence. Supp. Motion at 20. Streett argues that this \"violation of state procedural law\" denied him due process. Supp. Motion at 21. Further, Streett notes that \"the Supreme Court requires an affiant to draft 'a reasonably specific affidavit describing the content' of the image that is alleged to be illegal\" when the probable cause analysis concerns child pornography. Supp. Motion at 21 (quoting\n   <em>\n    New York v. P.J.

Streett argues that \"the best practice in suspected child pornography cases is for search warrant affidavits to either attach the images at issue or at least describe the suspected unlawful images with sufficient detail.\" Supp. Motion at 22. That the First Affidavit says Streett solicited only a nude photograph, Streett argues, is not enough then to provide probable cause to search for child pornography. Nor does this solicitation provide substantial evidence, Streett argues, because \"[m]ere nudity does not fit the federal statutory definition of child pornography.\" Supp. Motion at 22 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Streett points to the lengthy sentence he faces if convicted as another reason why such law enforcement should not be tolerated. Streett argues that \"[n]o crime had been committed under New Mexico law,\" but that was not going to stop Hartsock's search. Supp. Motion at 23. Finally, Streett asks the Court to find the Subpoena, the search of Streett's telephone records, and the search of the 4620 Plume residence unlawful under the Fourth Amendment, and to exclude \"all evidence seized including any evidence discovered as fruits of those searches.\" Supp. Motion at 24 (citing\n   <em>\n    Wong Sun v.

The United States argues that the Court should deny Streett's Motion and Supp. Motion, because\n   <em>\n    Carpenter v. United States\n   </em>\n   does not apply to the Subpoena here, and because probable cause supports the First and Second Warrants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 1. Even if probable cause is found lacking, the United States argues, \"the executing officer acted with an objective good-faith belief that the warrants were properly issued.\" Response at 2. The United States begins by arguing that the Subpoena is valid under the Fourth Amendment and that Streett \"misstates the scope of the data produced as a result of this subpoena,\" by contending \"that 2,305 pages of phone records were provided by T-Mobile in response to the\n   <em>\n    grand jury subpoena\n   </em>\n   , when, in reality, those records were produced as a result of the later search warrant submitted to T-Mobile.\" Response at 6 (emphasis in original)(citing First Affidavit at 1). The United States then notes that the Supreme Court's protection of cell-site locator information in\n   <em>\n    Carpenter v. United States\n   </em>\n   is limited to cell-site location information and cannot be extended to protect \"basic cellular subscriber information.\" Response at 6. The United States District Court for the District of New Mexico has already rejected such an expansive reading of\n   <em>\n    Carpenter v.

The United States avers that the Subpoena \"contained a more limited request\" than the subpoenas at issue in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Further, the United States argues that law enforcement \"acted in good faith in obtaining the subpoena years prior to the [\n   <em>\n    Carpenter v.

First, it notes that no information was obtained via the Third Warrant, and that Streett does not have standing to challenge the Fourth and Fifth Warrants, because these are third-party accounts, so the United States will not address Streett's challenge in the Motion to these\n   three warrants under the fruit-of-the-poisonous-tree doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 8 n.3. Then the United States notes that probable cause is determined by a \"totality of the circumstances\" and that the Court should review the magistrate judge's determination deferentially.

The United States also underscores that \"no one element has to be sufficient to show probable cause on its own,\" that the supporting affidavit need not contain \"personal knowledge that the items sought are located at the place to be searched,\" and that the issuing magistrate judge may make reasonable inferences from the affidavit.

The United States also tries to justify Hartsock's use of the term \"confidential informant,\" saying it was used \"to reflect the parent's concerns with alerting Defendant, and presumably her daughter, to the fact of the tip,\" and is not \"indicative of some nefarious intent.\" Response at 11-12. The United States notes that the First Affidavit states \"that the reporting party observed the minor's cellular phone, but noted that the minor had complied with the requests for nude photographs.\" Response at 11 (citing First Affidavit at 2). According to the United States, the First Affidavit verifies the reporting party's identification of the requestor, and his location and telephone number, because of the information obtained via the Subpoena.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 11. Streett, the United States argues, ignores this verification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 12. The United States also notes the First Affidavit's language \"that the requested records could 'contain child pornography or the attempt to entice sex from a minor.' \" Response at 11 (quoting First Affidavit at 3). As to Streett's contention that a nude photograph does not establish probable cause, the United States notes that \"the state magistrate determined that the information regarding Defendant's attempted solicitation of nude photographs was sufficient to establish probable cause that the requested records would contain evidence of a criminal offense.\" Response at 12. The magistrate judge, the United States argues, \"could reasonably infer that Detective Hartsock's description of Defendant 'soliciting' a 'nude photograph' from a minor was in violation of N.M.S.A. \u00a7 30-6A-3.\" Response at 12 (footnote omitted). The United States contends that Streett \"would seem to require evidence of a completed offense in order to justify a request for a search warrant.\" Response at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   The United States then argues that, because Hartsock obtained additional information from the interview that Vig conducted with M.Y. and with her mother, Hartsock was better able \"to verify and corroborate the initial information to NCMEC\" in the Second Affidavit. Response at 13. According to the United States, this interview confirmed M.Y.'s mother was the CI and that the NCMEC Tip \"did not stem from a 'family dispute over a boyfriend,' as suggested by Defendant.\" Response at 13 (quoting Supp. Motion at 13). The United States argues that M.Y.'s mother \"is the 'unquestionably honest citizen' contemplated by the Supreme\n   Court in\n   <em>\n    Gates\n   </em>\n   ,\" because she made the Tip out of concern for her daughter, so \" 'rigorous scrutiny' [of her basis of knowledge] is unnecessary.\" Response at 14 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Illinois v.

The United States construes the Second Affidavit as making it \"clear that the focus of this investigation was Defendant's cellular phone,\" and that \"the ubiquitous use of mobile devices\" renders a link between the cellular telephone and the residence unnecessary. Response at 14. The United States notes that the Second Affidavit identifies the residence to be searched, that it requests permission to search electronic devices capable of sending texts and photographs, and that the information received via the Subpoena confirmed Streett owns the telephone number and lives in Bernalillo County.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 14. The United States argues that, under the totality-of-the-circumstances test, the Second Affidavit sufficiently corroborates the NCMEC Tip, and that the issuing magistrate judge could draw reasonable inferences providing \"abundant reason to 'believe that a search would uncover contraband or evidence of criminal activity.' \" Response at 15 (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

As to the Second Affidavit, the United States writes that \"a natural reading of the affidavit provides sufficient indicators of probable cause that a crime occurred through the use of Defendant's cellular phone, which was registered to his home address in Bernalillo County.\" Motion at 19 (citing\n   <em>\n    Illinois v.

These indicators, the United States argues, mean that the Second Affidavit \"establishes 'a minimally sufficient nexus between the illegal activity and the place to be searched.' \" Motion at 19 (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The United States notes that \"Hartsock was truthful in laying out all of the reasons he had for seeking a warrant\" and that, because he \"had no reason to believe that the warrant should not have been issued,\" suppression \"would not further the purposes of the exclusionary rule.\" Motion at 19. The United States argues that the Second Affidavit \"was not so lacking in probable cause as to render the officer's belief in its validity objectively unreasonable,\" because \"Hartsock's explanation of the ICAC's procedure for processing CyberTipline reports, coupled with the later explanation that a subpoena issued to T-Mobile confirmed Defendant's address, would lead any reasonable law enforcement officer to conclude that the target residence was, in fact, Defendant's residence.\" Motion at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   The United States also argues that the evidence \"would have been inevitably discovered by lawful means,\" making an important distinction with\n   <em>\n    United States v. Gonzales\n   </em>\n   , because no inevitable discovery argument was addressed in that case. Motion at 20 &amp; n.6. Hartsock, the United States notes, \"was aware of facts that sufficiently established probable case.\" Motion at 21 (heading capitalization omitted). The United States argues that the evidence \"clearly demonstrates that Detective Hartsock knew that 4620 Plume Rd. NW, was, in fact, Defendant's residence.\" Motion at 22 (citing NCMEC Tip at 9; T-Mobile Email at 1). Hartsock's knowledge, the United States argues, shows \"the inevitability of him rectifying any deficiency identified by the judge.\" Motion at 22 n.7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   Thus, the United States asserts, Hartsock would have been able to obtain a valid warrant and \"the evidence obtained during the search of Defendant's residence need not be suppressed because it would have been inevitably discovered.\" Motion at 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   Finally, the United States argues that \"the Court need not suppress the evidence found at Defendant's residence, because Detective Hartsock would have inevitably discovered the victims' identities due to law enforcement efforts already underway\" -- namely, the First Warrant, issued to obtain Streett's telephone records from T-Mobile. Motion at 23. These telephone records contain the telephone numbers for Streett's other victims, so \"Hartsock would have inevitably identified, located, and interviewed each of these victims.\" Motion at 23. The United States also notes how \"Hartsock sought a separate search warrant for [M.Y.]'s phone records, which showed numerous contacts with Defendant's phone.\" Motion at 23. Further, the United States contends that, \"even if the Court concludes that the very nature of the victims' identities is tainted, the independent source doctrine would remove any taint from the search,\" because \"the same evidence would have been discovered through an independent source -- Defendant's phone records from T-Mobile, and the separate search warrant for [M.Y.]'s phone records.\" Motion at 23-24. The United States argues: \"[T]he victims provided their electronic devices for forensic examination, which resulted in the location of evidence to independently support the charged offenses.\" Motion at 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     The Reply\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   Streett replies to reiterate his request for the \"suppression of all evidence seized subsequent to and as a result of the\" Subpoena, First Warrant, and Second Warrant.

As to the factors the Court should consider, Streett notes that the Tenth Circuit decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Streett states that Hartsock had no probable cause for any crime regarding M.Y., \"[d]espite access to the alleged victim and her phone,\" and \"jumped the gun\" while \"[s]till awaiting the results of the unlawful phone subpoena.\" Reply at 23. According to Streett, the Second Affidavit thus does not have facts allowing the Court to \"have a high level of confidence that a lawful warrant would have issued and the evidence seized from the house warrant inevitably discovered.\" Reply at 23.

Finally, Streett points to the value in deterring \"Hartsock's unlawful conduct,\" because he \"is now the State of New Mexico Second Judicial District Attorney's Chief Investigator\" and, thus, \"now can influence every law enforcement agency that interacts with the that [sic] office, as well as young prosecutors with limited experience,\" so suppression would have a \"system-wide impact.\" Reply at 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     RELEVANT FOURTH AMENDMENT LAW\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   The Fourth Amendment protects \"[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\" U.S. Const. amend.

Under petitioners' target theory, a court could determine that a defendant had standing to invoke the exclusionary rule without having to inquire into the substantive question of whether the challenged search or seizure violated the Fourth Amendment rights of that particular defendant. However, having rejected petitioners' target theory and reaffirmed the principle that the \"rights assured by the Fourth Amendment are personal rights, [which] ... may be enforced by exclusion of evidence only at the instance of one whose own protection was infringed by the search and seizure,\"\n   <em>\n    Simmons v.

We can think of no decided cases of this Court that would have come out differently had we concluded, as we do now, that the type of standing requirement discussed in\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   and reaffirmed today is more properly subsumed under substantive Fourth Amendment doctrine. Rigorous application of the principle that the rights secured by this Amendment are personal, in place of a notion of \"standing,\" will produce no additional situations in which evidence must be excluded. The inquiry under either approach is the same. But we think the better analysis forthrightly focuses on the extent of a particular defendant's rights under the Fourth Amendment, rather than on any theoretically separate, but invariably intertwined concept of standing. The Court in\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   also may have been aware that there was a certain artificiality in analyzing this question in terms of standing because in at least three separate places in its opinion the Court placed that term within quotation marks.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   <em>\n    Rakas v.

For example, if the Government were suddenly to announce on nationwide television that all homes henceforth would be subject to warrantless entry, individuals thereafter might not in fact entertain any actual expectation or [sic] privacy regarding their homes, papers, and effects. Similarly, if a refugee from a totalitarian country, unaware of this Nation's traditions, erroneously assumed that police were continuously monitoring his telephone conversations, a subjective expectation of privacy regarding the contents of his calls might be lacking as well. In such circumstances, where an individual's subjective expectations had been \"conditioned\" by influences alien to well-recognized Fourth Amendment freedoms, those subjective expectations obviously could play no meaningful role in ascertaining what the scope of Fourth Amendment protection was. In determining whether a \"legitimate expectation of privacy\" existed in such cases, a normative inquiry would be proper.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-298\">\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

This approach is ill suited to the digital age, in which people reveal a great deal of information about themselves to third parties in the course of carrying out mundane tasks. People disclose the phone numbers that they dial or text to their cellular providers; the URLs that they visit and the e-mail addresses with which they correspond to their Internet service providers; and the books, groceries, and medications they purchase to online retailers. Perhaps, as Justice Alito notes, some people may find the \"tradeoff\" of privacy for convenience \"worthwhile,\" or come to accept this \"diminution of privacy\" as \"inevitable,\" and perhaps not. I for one doubt that people would accept without complaint the warrantless disclosure to the Government of a list of every Web site they had visited in the last week, or month, or year. But whatever the societal expectations, they can attain constitutionally protected status only if our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence ceases to treat secrecy as a prerequisite for privacy. I would not assume that all information voluntarily disclosed to some member of the public for a limited purpose is, for that reason alone, disentitled to Fourth Amendment protection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-300\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446025,12186415\" index=\"304\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/400/\">\n    565 U.S. at 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446025,12186415\" index=\"305\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/400/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 945\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Sotomayor, J., concurring)(citations omitted).

Thus, the manner in which information is obtained through this investigative technique is much less intrusive than a typical search. Moreover, the sniff discloses only the presence or absence of narcotics, a contraband item.

Because Carvo had strong probable cause for a California crime and a federal crime, based on information that he learned in his investigation, and not based on information he learned from the BCSO or from the Albuquerque FBI, Carvo would have obtained search warrants that were not based on illegally obtained information.

Officer Carvo also knew that K.Y. was potentially suicidal, had left her depression medication behind, and ran away from home with Mr. Christy. Based on that knowledge, Officer Carvo's belief that K.Y. was at risk for sexual victimization and assault was reasonable. Thus, Officer Carvo had reasonable grounds to believe that Mr. Christy engaged in sexual activity in violation of California law and coerced or enticed K.Y. to travel across state lines to engage in criminal sexual activity in violation of federal law.

Second, in the context of administrative subpoenas, the Tenth Circuit found a subpoena duces tecum enforceable, even though it sought \"personal, private, and confidential\" matters, and no probable cause was shown, because \"administrative 'fishing expeditions' are often permitted; and ... administrative subpoenas may be enforced for investigative purposes unless they are plainly incompetent or irrelevant to any lawful purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Equal Emp't Opportunity Comm'n v.

Unless the Supreme Court is prepared to abandon the third-party doctrine -- which it has not and which the Court does not recommend it do -- it is not sound for Streett to argue that certain information is \"private\" where he willingly shared this same information with T-Mobile to obtain telephone service from it -- which, unlike obtaining services from a doctor or lawyer, implies no confidentiality protections.

Hartsock states that he has failed to make contact with M.Y.'s mother.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Affidavit at 2.

Although the First Affidavit does not explicitly state that the 505-974-9704 telephone number is the number that requested the nude photograph, this is logically inferred from the natural reading of the First Affidavit, because the NCMEC Tip provides that Streett requested the photograph and because the New Mexico Attorney General's Office subpoenaed the account information for this telephone number, discovering it belongs to Streett.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Streett further argues that Hartsock is merely speculating as to criminality in the First Affidavit, because he writes that he \"needs the records to see a wide picture of the frequency of communication between MY and the requestor, and the frequency or infrequency of mixed media messages that based on the Cl's [sic] complaint,\n   <em>\n    could contain child pornography\n   </em>\n   or the attempt to entice sex from a minor.\" Supp. Motion at 19 (emphasis in the Supp. Motion)(quoting First Affidavit at 2-3).

The Fourth Circuit concluded that these allegations of sexual assault did not support probable cause to support a search for child pornography and that the only allegation of child pornography -- a statement that an alleged sexual assault victim was shown photographs of nude children -- was double hearsay, provided by the uncle of the alleged victim, whose reliability and veracity was not addressed in the affidavit.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

While the First Warrant issued a little over three months after the incident date in the NCMEC Tip, there is no indication that the information in it is stale, because evidence of whether Streett was texting M.Y. would remain in the telephone records for as long as those records are kept.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   NCMEC Tip at 3 (incident date of October 21, 2013);\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   First Warrant at 4 (issued February 12, 2014).

From the totality of the circumstances, therefore, a judge\n   could reasonably find probable cause based on the informant's firsthand knowledge, combined with the small showing of veracity -- because Hartsock knew her name, she could have thought that she faced criminal charges if the information provided was false, and through independent corroboration of innocuous information -- and the nexus between the telephone records and the alleged criminal activity. Streett's lack of criminal history does not change the probable cause determination, because even if that information were provided, probable cause would still be found.

As to the first factor of the test, Hartsock prepared the Second Affidavit to obtain a search warrant for the 4620 Plume residence and ultimately received a warrant, albeit an invalid one under the Fourth Amendment. Hartsock could not have done anything else to complete the warrant process here, because he obtained a search warrant. As to the second factor, Hartsock possessed a strong showing of probable cause when he searched the 4620 Plume residence. He\n   confirmed that Streett's telephone number texted a minor asking for a nude photograph.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   T-Mobile's Email at 1; Vig Report at 1. Further, the TLO report in the NCMEC Tip, the T-Mobile Email, the cellular telephone records obtained via the First Warrant, and Streett's driver's license all state that 4620 Plume is Streett's residence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 100:24-101:2 (Hartsock); Hartsock Report at 4. Hartsock also had a firsthand account from M.Y. that she told Streett that she was fourteen, that her age was apparent from her Twitter profile -- where they met -- and that he had asked her to send him nude photographs \"two or three times.\" Vig Report at 1. The telephone records which Hartsock obtained under the First Warrant show a high amount of communication between Streett and M.Y.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 97:12-18 (Hartsock);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 100:13-18 (Hartsock); Hartsock Report at 3. The telephone records also show that Streett sent an MMS message,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 100:15-16 (Harstock), but M.Y. said this was a \"face photo, no nudity,\" Vig Report at 1. The telephone records as a whole -- with 135 different area codes, a number of MMS messages likely evincing photographs, and with texts making up \"the large majority of the 56,000 records\" -- also corroborate that Streett was meeting people on the internet and could be soliciting nude photographs.

Despite the lack of knowledge of any sexually explicit photographs being sent to Streett, the evidence Hartsock had collected was sufficient to support probable cause to believe that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1081\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2030-37-3.2\">\n    N.M.

No new warrant is needed to obtain the victims' identities, because Hartsock already received Streett's extensive telephone records which contained the telephone numbers of all the charged victims via the valid First\n   Warrant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 23. He sorted the numbers contacted in an Excel table to determine the most frequently contacted numbers, finding only two with New Mexico area codes and a total of 135 different area codes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 107:4-13 (Hartsock); Map at 1. Without the Second Warrant to search the 4620 Plume residence, Hartsock would have more thoroughly investigated these telephone records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 107:18-21 (Mease, Hartsock). As a law enforcement officer with about ten years of experience at the time, Hartsock knew that people who want nude photographs from minors \"obsessively try to gain nude images from one particular minor or multiple minors,\" and he believed Streett's texting pattern fit this \"mold[,] potentially dead-on.\" Tr. at 107:18-108:15 (Mease, Hartsock). He testified that he thus would have tried to identify the owners of the telephone numbers which Streett was texting, either with public information or legal service -- such as a subpoena or search warrant -- or even by calling the numbers to see who answered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 108:8-15 (Hartsock). He also testified that he obtained a victim's identity by cold-calling M.S.,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 116:14-3 (Mease, Hartsock), and that all of the MMS messages caught his attention,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 122:3-5 (Hartsock). Finally, all of the alleged victims named in the Second Superseding Indictment are present in the telephone records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 117:3-118:20 (Mease, Hartsock);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 119:20-123:13 (Mease, Hartsock). Hartsock also obtained a warrant for one such telephone number based in part on the hundreds of text messages exchanged with Streett in July 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fourth Warrant at 3. This evidence establishes by a preponderance that Hartsock would have obtained the victims' identities through his search of Streett's telephone records and, thus, that suppression of this evidence is unwarranted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nix v.

Accordingly, the Court will deny Streett's requests in the Motion and the Supp. Motion. The Subpoena does not constitute a search under the Fourth Amendment, and was not issued in contravention of state law or of the Due Process Clause, so the Court will not suppress the subscriber information received under the Subpoena. Probable cause supports the First Warrant, and that warrant is thus valid under the Fourth Amendment. Moreover, even if the First Warrant were not valid, the good-faith exception applies, so the Court will not suppress the telephone records received under the First Warrant. Further, the First Warrant does not violate Streett's due process rights. Finally, although the Second Warrant is invalid, both the good-faith and inevitable-discovery exceptions apply, so the Court will not suppress the evidence obtained via the\n   Second Warrant -- Streett's statements to Hartsock, his computer, his smartphone, and his regular telephone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-520\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that: (i) the requests in the Defendant's Motion to Suppress Evidence, filed December 1, 2017 (Doc. 78), are denied; and (ii) the requests in the Defendant's Supplemental Motion to Suppress All Evidence Seized and Any Fruits of the Poisonous Tree Obtained as a Result of the Unlawful Search, filed July 24, 2018 (Doc. 141), are denied.

This is the relevant exchange, during direct examination of Whitsitt by Mr. Zimmerman:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-535\">\n    Q.

The Court concludes this is not a fair representation of the hearing and thus does not incorporate these Proposed Findings. Mr. Zimmerman first points Whitsitt to the \"additional information\" on page four of the NCMEC Tip:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-539\">\n    Q.

This testimony, combined with Ms. Mease's cross-examination cited\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 31, shows that Whitsitt believed it possible that \"sexual exploitation had occurred,\" but did not have probable cause showing that sexual exploitation had occurred.

The Grand Jury Log shows the grand jury proceedings for a period of forty minutes.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Grand Jury Log at 1-3. The Grand Jury Log provides that the grand jury is considering subpoenas for \"ROBLOX Corporation // Cyber Tip 21353331; T-Mobile,\" among a number of IP addresses. Grand Jury Log at 1. There does not seem to be any information in the Grand Jury Log connecting it to the Subpoena here, however, for the cyber tip number it provides does not match the NCMEC Tip's number, and there is no telephone number associated with T-Mobile.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Grand Jury Log at 1; NCMEC Tip at 11 (providing the unredacted number as beginning with the numbers \"216\").

This information does not convince the Court that Pena testified regarding the Subpoena in question despite Streett's statement that \"Special Agent Owen Pena testified in support of the grand jury subpoenas issued on November 4, 2013, not Whitsitt,\" Streett's Proposed Findings at 18 n.2, and the United States' statement that it \"understands that Officer Jon Whitsitt did not provide testimony in front of the state grand jury on November 4, 2013,\" United States' Sealed Notice of Correction to Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law (September 11, 2018 Evidentiary Hearing) at 1, filed November 6, 2018 (Doc. 175).

At the hearing, Streett's counsel asked Hartsock if he had \"been questioned by [his] own Internal Affairs Division about the inadequacy of [his] investigation or reporting,\" Tr. at 205:9-11 (Zimmerman), and Hartsock responded: \"No, I can't recall an Internal Affairs investigation about the accuracy of my reporting,\" Tr. at 205:15-16 (Hartsock). Harry Zimmerman -- Streett's attorney -- also asked if, in the seven years that Hartsock served as a law enforcement officer in the field, he had \"an internal affairs jacket indicating complaints against\" him, Tr. at 205:21-25 (Zimmerman), and Hartsock responded \"I presume,\" but that he had \"not looked in [his] Internal Affairs file,\" Tr. at 206:1, 3-4 (Hartsock). Mr. Zimmerman then introduced a complaint of misconduct against Hartsock, because Hartsock \"did not acknowledge that he had [complaints against him].\" Tr. at 206:5-207:2 (Zimmerman).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     generally\n    </em>\n    Bernalillo County Sheriff's Department Internal Affairs Unit Investigators Supplemental Report (signed March 3, 2005)(filed with the Court at the September 11, 2018, evidentiary hearing as Defendant's Exhibit K)(\"IA Report\"). Mr. Zimmerman said the IA Report relates to Hartsock's \"failure to investigate and interview witnesses\" in a previous investigation, which is \"essential to [the Court's] understanding of the inadequacies of the search warrant here.\" Tr. at 207:5-8 (Zimmerman). Mr. Zimmerman also noted that, \"about seven, eight years ago,\" the Court decided another motion to suppress involving failures in Hartsock's policing, and there, according to Streett, the Court \"suppressed and did not find good faith.\" Tr. at 207:9-11 (Zimmerman)(citing\n    <em>\n     United States v. Martinez\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4026998\" index=\"1118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/696/1216/#p1244\">\n     696 F.Supp.2d 1216\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (D.N.M. 2010) (Browning, J.) ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-566\">\n    The Court concludes that these two specific instances of alleged misconduct do not bear on Hartsock's credibility as a witness at the hearing. First, Hartsock does not deny the existence of the IA Report such that introducing it shows he was lying; when asked if Internal Affairs had questioned him about the inadequacy of his investigation or reporting he said \"I can't recall,\" Tr. at 205:15 (Hartsock), and when asked more generally about the existence of complaints about him, he said he \"presume[s]\" that there are, Tr. at 206:1 (Hartsock).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tr. at 205:9-206:1 (Zimmerman, Mease, Court, Hartsock). The Court notes that the IA Report is thirteen years old, from early in Hartsock's career in law enforcement, so that he could not remember the specific subject of the Report is plausible. Second, the two prior instances of alleged misconduct do not point to Hartsock's character for truthfulness but, rather, his prior failings in properly investigating and therefore, the Court does not consider them. While the Federal Rules of Evidence's rules on character evidence do not bind the Court in a suppression hearing, the Court must decide this case's facts, and Hartsock's prior instances of alleged misconduct have little, if anything, to do with this case besides showing a propensity to not fully investigate things. This propensity has little, to no, bearing on Hartsock's credibility, and the Court finds Hartsock a credible witness here. As he testified before the Court, the Court looked at him carefully and listened to him clearly, and saw and heard nothing for the Court not to believe him. The Court therefore will not adopt Streett's Proposed Findings on pages 17-18.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-567\">\n    Streett's Proposed Findings aver that \"[n]othing in the New Mexico Attorney General's T-Mobile Subpoena or return indicated the reliability of the CI or the information.\" Streett's Proposed Findings \u00b6 31, at 10 (citing Tr. at 151 ).

No unlawful images were found.\" Streett's Proposed Findings \u00b6 8, at 14 (citing Tr. at 189 ). This is a misstatement of the evidence. At the hearing, Mr. Zimmerman questioned Hartsock:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-575\">\n    Q.

This indicates that Hartsock did not remember if images were found on M.Y.'s telephone. Further, the Vig Report does not say what was found in the search of the cellular telephone, or if it even was searched.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Vig Report at 1-2 (just saying the telephone was taken as \"evidence\"). The Hartsock Report also does not indicate if the telephone was searched.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Hartsock Report at 4. The Court thus cannot conclude that \"[n]o unlawful images were found\" on M.Y.'s cellular telephone,\" and does not incorporate this Proposed Finding. Streett's Proposed Findings \u00b6 8, at 14 (citing Tr. at 189 ). The Court also does not incorporate Streett's Proposed Finding that \"Hartsock omitted from his search warrant affidavit ... the results of the search of MY's telephone showing no sexually explicit images,\" for the same reason. Streett's Proposed Finding \u00b6 10, at 15 (citing Vig Report; Tr. at 189-91 ).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"25\">\n   <p id=\"p-578\">\n    Streett's Proposed Findings state: \"Hartsock could have used the information gleaned from the telephone warrant as a basis for the house warrant, even without the information Minnesota police provided after their interview of MY.\" Streett's Proposed Findings \u00b6 61, at 13 (citing Tr. at 109-10 ). To the extent that this is stating that the telephone records alone could have established probable cause, this is a legal conclusion and the Court does not adopt this Proposed Finding.

If the Court adheres too rigidly to Tenth Circuit caselaw, ignoring changes undergone by a state's law in the ensuing years, then parties litigating state-law claims will be subject to a different body of substantive law, depending on whether they litigate in state court or federal court. This result frustrates the purpose of\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    , which held that federal courts must apply state court interpretations of state law, rather than their own, in part so that parties achieve a consistent result regardless of the forum. This consideration pulls the Court toward according Tenth Circuit precedent less weight and according state court decisions issued in the ensuing years more weight. On the other hand, when the state law is unclear, it is desirable for there to at least be uniformity among federal judges as to its proper interpretation. Otherwise, different federal judges within the same circuit -- or even the same district, as district courts' decisions are not binding, even upon themselves -- would be free to adopt differing interpretations of a state's law. This consideration pulls the Court towards a stronger respect for vertical stare decisis, because a Tenth Circuit decision on point -- regardless whether it accurately reflects state law --at least provides consistency at the federal level, so long federal district judges are required to follow it.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-606\">\n    The Court must decide how to weigh Tenth Circuit caselaw against more-recent state court decisions, choosing a point on the spectrum between the two extremes: rigidly adhering to Tenth Circuit precedent unless there is intervening caselaw directly on point from the state's highest court, on one end; and independently interpreting the state law, regarding the Tenth Circuit precedent as no more than persuasive authority, on the other. In striking this balance, the Court notes that it is generally more concerned about systemic inconsistency between the federal courts and the state courts than it is about inconsistency among federal judges. Judges, even those within a jurisdiction with ostensibly identical governing law, sometimes interpret and apply the law differently from one another; this inconsistency is part and parcel of a common-law judicial system. More importantly, litigants seeking to use forum selection to gain a substantive legal advantage cannot easily manipulate such inconsistency: cases are assigned randomly to district judges in this and many federal districts; and, regardless, litigants cannot know for certain how a given judge will interpret the state law, even if they could determine the identity of the judge pre-filing or pre-removal. All litigants know in advance is that whomever federal district judge they are assigned will look to the entirety of the state's common law in making his or her determination -- the same as a state judge would. Systemic inconsistency between the federal courts and state courts, on the other hand, not only threatens the principles of federalism, but litigants may more easily manipulate the inconsistency. When the Tenth Circuit issues an opinion interpreting state law, and the state courts subsequently shift away from that interpretation, litigants -- if the district courts strictly adhere to the Tenth Circuit opinion -- have a definite substantive advantage in choosing the federal forum over the state forum, or vice versa.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-607\">\n    The Court further notes that district courts may be in a better position than the Tenth Circuit to be responsive to changes in state law. Tenth Circuit decisions interpreting a particular state's law on a specific issue are further apart in time than the collective district courts' are. More importantly, the Tenth Circuit does not typically address such issues with the frequency that the state's courts themselves do. As such, Tenth Circuit precedent can lag behind developments in state law -- developments that the district courts may be nimble enough to perceive and adopt. Additionally, much of the benefit of having a consistent Tenth Circuit-wide interpretation of a particular state's law is wasted. Other than Oklahoma, every state encompassed by the Tenth Circuit contains only one federal judicial district, and there is relatively little need for federal judges in Wyoming and Kansas to have a uniform body of New Mexico law to which to look. Last, the Court notes, respectfully, that district courts may be in a better position than the Tenth Circuit to develop expertise on the state law of the state in which they sit. Every federal judicial district in the nation, except the District of Wyoming, covers at most one state. It is perhaps a more workable design for each district court to keep track of legal developments in the state law of its own state(s) than it is for the Tenth Circuit to monitor separate legal developments in eight states.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-608\">\n    Having outlined the relevant considerations, the Court thinks the proper stance on vertical stare decisis in the context of federal court interpretations of state law is as follows: the Tenth Circuit's cases are binding as to their precise holding -- what the state law was on the day the opinion was published -- but lack the positive precedential force that its cases interpreting a federal statute or the federal Constitution possess. A district court considering a state law issue after the publication of a Tenth Circuit opinion on point may not come to a contrary conclusion based\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    on state court cases that were available to the Tenth Circuit and that the Tenth Circuit considered, but it may come to such a conclusion based on intervening state court cases.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-609\">\n    When interpreting state law, the Tenth Circuit does not and cannot issue a case holding that\n    <em>\n     x\n    </em>\n    is the law in New Mexico; it holds that the\n    <em>\n     proper interpretation\n    </em>\n    of New Mexico law, at the time the opinion is released, is\n    <em>\n     x.\n    </em>\n    Its holdings are descriptive, not prescriptive -- interpretive, not normative. Because federal judicial opinions lack independent substantive force on state law issues, but possess such force regarding federal law issues, the Court thinks the following is not an unfair summary of the judicial interpretive process: (i) when interpreting federal law, the federal appellate courts consider the existing body of law, and then issue a holding that both reflects and influences the body of law; that holding subsequently becomes a part of the body of law; but (ii) when interpreting state law, the federal appellate courts consider the existing body of law, and then issue a holding that only reflects the body of law; that holding does not subsequently become a part of the body of law. The federal district courts are bound to conclude that the Tenth Circuit's reflection of the then-existing body of law was accurate. The question is whether they should build a doctrine atop the case and use the existence of the Tenth Circuit's case to avoid any responsibility to independently consider the whole body of state law that exists when the time comes that diversity litigants raise the issue in their courtrooms. Giving such effect to the Tenth Circuit's interpretations of state law is at tension with\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    , giving independent substantive effect to federal judicial decisions --\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , applying federal law -- in a case brought in diversity.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-610\">\n    The purpose of\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    is well-known and simple, and the Court should not complicate it beyond recognition: it is that the same substantive law governs litigants' cases regardless whether they are brought in a federal or state forum. For simplicity's sake, most courts have settled on the formulation that \"the federal court must attempt to predict how the states' highest court would rule if confronted with the issue.\"\n    <em>\n     Moore's Federal Practice\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 124.22[3] (citing\n    <em>\n     Comm'r v.

This formulation may not be the most precise one if the goal is to ensure identical outcomes in state and federal court -- the Honorable Milton I. Shadur, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Illinois, looks to state procedural rules to determine in which state appellate circuit the suit would have been filed were it not in federal court, and then applies the state law as that circuit court interprets it,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Abbott Labs. v.

This formulation, built out of ease-of-use, does not relieve courts of their Supreme Court-mandated obligation to consider state appellate and trial court decisions. To the contrary, even non-judicial writings by influential authors, statements by state supreme court justices, the closeness of the vote on a prior case addressing the issue, and personnel changes on the court -- considerations that would never inform a federal court's analysis of federal law -- may validly come into play. The question is whether the district courts must abdicate, across-the-board, the \"would decide\" aspect of the\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    analysis to their parent appellate courts when the Court of Appeals has declared an interpretation of state law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-611\">\n    The\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    doctrine results in federal cases that interpret state law withering with time. While cases interpreting federal law become more powerful over time -- forming the groundwork for doctrines, growing upward from one application (Congress may create a national bank) to many (Congress may set quotas on wheat-growing for personal consumption), expanding outward from the general (states must grant criminal jury trials) to the specific (the jury need not be twelve people, nor must it be unanimous) -- federal cases interpreting state law often become stale. New state court cases -- even when not directly rebuking the federal court's statement of law -- alter the common-law legal landscape with their dicta, their insinuations, and their tone. The Supreme Court, which picks its cases sparingly and for maximum effect, almost never grants certiorari to resolve issues of state law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-612\">\n    The Court's views on\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    , of course, mean little if the Tenth Circuit does not agree.

Supp. Motion at 12 n.4. First, there is no evidence in the record indicating that Hartsock used this language to mislead the magistrate judge.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Tr. at 163:20-24 (Zimmerman, Hartsock)(Hartsock denying the accusation that he \"tr[ies] to kind of pump up the language a little bit so the judge sees something that might encourage the judge to issue that warrant\");\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 165:17-19 (Hartsock)(saying he does not \"ha[ve] that level of clarity when I write my warrants to [beef up my language] on purpose\");\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 242:6-9 (Hartsock)(denying that he was consciously \"trying to affect the judge's understanding of what the case was\");\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    note 16 (finding Hartsock credible). Second, law enforcement officers are often not English majors. They may use big words instead of plain language as a matter of course.

Requesting a nude photograph from somebody could indicate that the requestor is not asking, necessarily, for a photograph of that specific person. That the requester is, however, asking for a photograph of that specific person is a natural and logical reading of such language. It would be odd for a person to specifically ask someone for a nude photograph, expecting to get a nude photograph of somebody else without specifically asking for a photograph of that third party.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    Tr. at 243:1-3 (Hartsock)(discussing how he has had cases where \"a perpetrator is asking one kid to try to get photos of someone else, and they specify\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"52\">\n   <p id=\"p-633\">\n    Streett avers that two circumstances rendering the good-faith exception are applicable here: \"[T]he affidavit in support of the warrant is so lacking in indicia of probable cause to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable[,] ...
