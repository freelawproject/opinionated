BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On June 5, 2018, Monsivais-Lopez was indicted on one count of illegal reentry into the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Monsivais-Lopez, a citizen of Mexico, while in immigration custody in Pearsall, Texas, was served in person with a United States Department of Homeland Security form titled \"Notice to Appear\" on April 6, 2010. The form notice states that Monsivais-Lopez is subject to removal because he is \"an alien present in the United States who has not been admitted or paroled.\" The notice informed Monsivais-Lopez,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   YOU ARE ORDERED to appear before an immigration judge of the United States Department of Justice at: 800 Dolorosa Street, Suite 300 San Antonio Texas 78207, on (Date) a date to be set, at (Time) a time to be set, to show why you should not be removed from the United States based on the charge set above.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The certificate-of-service portion of the notice indicates that Monsivais-Lopez was provided with \"oral notice in the Spanish language of the time and place of his [ ] hearing and of the consequences of failure to appear.\" Immediately above the certificate of service, dated April 6, 2010, Monsivais-Lopez signed a request for an expedited removal hearing and waived his right to a 10-day waiting period before appearing before an immigration judge. The record does not include evidence that Monsivais-Lopez was ever personally served with a written notice of hearing containing the time and place of the hearing, though the Government asserts that \"detained inmates are generally provided with written or oral notice of the hearing.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Removal proceedings occurred on May 3, 2010. According to the Order of the Immigration Judge signed May 3, 2010, \"the hearing was conducted by teleconferencing\" with the immigration judge located in San Antonio and the hearing occurring in Pearsall. The order provides, \"[u]pon the basis of respondent's [Monsivais-Lopez's] admissions\" the immigration judge determined that [Monsivais-Lopez] is subject to removal on the charge in the Notice to Appear. Additionally, the order includes, \"[Monsivais-Lopez] has made no application for relief from removal.\" The immigration judge ordered Monsivais-Lopez removed from the United States to Mexico. Although the record does not contain a signed waiver of appeal, the order includes the notation, \"Appeal: WAIVED\" at the end of the order. Monsivais-Lopez was removed from the United States on May 10, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The May 3, 2010 removal order was reinstated and Monsivais-Lopez was removed again on June 29, 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Monsivais-Lopez came to the attention of federal law-enforcement\n   authorities in Austin, Texas on May 29, 2016. Monsivais-Lopez however, did not enter federal custody until May 4, 2018, after he completed a two-year term of imprisonment for the state felony offense of driving while intoxicated. The charge at issue followed when a grand jury returned an indictment on June 5, 2018, for illegal reentry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The May 3, 2014 removal order is the basis for the instant indictment. Although Monsivais-Lopez originally pleaded guilty to the charge alleged by the Government in the June 5, 2018 indictment, the court granted Monsivais-Lopez's request to withdraw his guilty plea on October 23, 2018 (Dkt. No. 35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In order to prove illegal reentry, the Government must prove that Monsivais-Lopez \"has been denied admission, excluded, deported, or removed or has departed the United States while an order of exclusion, deportation, or removal is outstanding.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The lawfulness or validity of a prior removal order is not an element of an illegal-reentry offense, and the Government need only prove the fact of a prior removal.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Did the immigration court lack jurisdiction to render removal order?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Monsivais-Lopez first argues that the immigration court was without jurisdiction to enter the 2010 removal order, thus, as a matter of law, the current indictment lacks a sound basis, and this prosecution cannot continue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Although the Constitution and governing statutes lack any reference to the jurisdiction of an immigration court, Monsivais-Lopez contends that, primarily based upon language in\n   <em>\n    Pereira v. Sessions\n   </em>\n   , the immigration court lacked jurisdiction to enter the May 3, 2010 removal order, because the notice to appear given to Monsivais-Lopez on April 6, 2010, was statutorily deficient-the notice failed to include a time at which the removal proceedings would be held.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 2105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    201 L.Ed.2d 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018) (considering Section 1229(a) requirements for notice to appear in context of Section 1229b, request to cancel removal proceedings, and stop-time rule\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   );\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(G)(i) (notice to appear given to alien shall include \"time and place at which the proceedings will be held\"). Monsivais-Lopez contends that the removal order resulting from the May 3, 2010 immigration removal proceeding was void and cannot now be used as a basis for of his illegal-reentry offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Monsivais-Lopez's contention is not novel. Illegal-reentry defendants around the country, relying on language in\n   <em>\n    Pereira v. Sessions\n   </em>\n   , have filed similar motions to dismiss the Government's charges against them. The motions usually raise the same two contentions and similarly argue that based on a statutorily-deficient notice to appear, which fails to inform the defendant in writing of the scheduled time for the removal proceedings, the immigration court entering the initial removal order lacked jurisdiction to issue such an order. Thus, the initial removal order is void, and the subsequent indictment for illegal reentry must be dismissed. Courts presented with this issue have not spoken with one voice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   This court has made an effort to review all decisions issued as of the date of this order in considering the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   Court considered a similar statutorily-deficient notice to appear, but not in the context of an attack on an initial removal order in an illegal-reentry prosecution. The\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   Court was presented with a direct appeal from a Board of Immigration ruling and the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit regarding a noncitizen's\n   request for cancellation of removal proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Noncitizens subject to removal proceedings may be eligible for cancellation of removal proceedings if they have been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of 10 years immediately preceding the date of the Government's request for removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(A). Under this \"stop-time rule,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   the period of continuous presence ends when the Government serves the noncitizen with a notice to appear under section 1229(a). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(1) (special rules relating to continuous residence or physical presence: \"[f]or purposes of this section, any period of continuous residence or continuous physical presence in the United States shall be deemed to end ... when the alien is served a notice to appear under section 1229(a) of this title\"). The date the Government serves the noncitizen with a Section 1229(a) notice to appear at a removal proceeding stops the noncitizen's continuous presence in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Pereira, a citizen of Brazil who had been present in the United States for several years, was served with a notice to appear stating that his removal proceeding would occur on a date and time \"to be set.\"\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 2112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ahead of the removal hearing, the immigration court sent Pereira a notice of hearing with the date and time for the hearing, but the notice was mailed to the wrong address.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Without information about when the hearing would occur, Pereira failed to appear at the removal proceedings. The immigration court proceeded with the hearing and ordered\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   removed\n   <em>\n    in abstentia.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Several years later, Pereira was arrested and his removal proceedings reopened.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   At that time, Pereira applied for a cancellation of the removal proceeding under Section 1229b, which the immigration court denied.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Pereira timely appealed the decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals and then filed an appeal to the First Circuit; both appeals were denied.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    at 2113-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On direct appeal from the First Circuit, the Supreme Court considered whether Pereira's notice to appear, which lacked the time and place of removal proceedings, was an adequate notice to appear under Section 1229(a) that would trigger the statutory stop-time rule provided in Section 1229b(d).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    at 2110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Court held that \"[a] putative notice to appear that fails to designate the specific time or place of the noncitizen's removal proceedings is not a 'notice to appear under [ Section] 1229(a),' and so does not trigger the stop-time rule.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    at 2113-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court reasoned that the time-and-place requirement is \"definitional\" for a document that purports to be a notice to appear and that \"the omission of time-and-place information is not, as the dissent asserts, some trivial, ministerial defect, akin to an unsigned notice of appeal.... Failing to specify integral information like the time and place of removal proceedings unquestionably would 'deprive [the notice to appear] of its essential character.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    at 2116-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"The plain text, the statutory context, and common sense all lead inescapably and unambiguously to that conclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    at 2110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The parties now dispute how language in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   regarding a notice to appear applies in a context other than a direct appeal from an immigration-court ruling in cancellation-of-removal proceedings and the application of the stop-time rule. Issue is joined as to what effect, if any,\n   <em>\n    Pereira's\n   </em>\n   language regarding notices to appear applies in illegal-reentry prosecutions where, as here, the underlying notice to appear\n   provided to the noncitizen and filed with the immigration court fails to specify the time and date of the removal proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The primary argument that Monsivais-Lopez advances is that the immigration judge lacked jurisdiction to enter the underlying May 3, 2010 removal order, because the statutorily deficient notice to appear prevented\n   <em>\n    jurisdiction\n   </em>\n   from ever vesting in the immigration court. Monsivais-Lopez contends that \"removal proceedings commence,\" and\n   <em>\n    jurisdiction\n   </em>\n   vests, in the immigration court only upon the filing of a notice to appear that complies with Section 1229(a) and\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   -that is, a notice to appear that includes time-and-place information for removal proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   This court recognizes the Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   -in the context of the stop-time rule-that a \"notice to appear that fails to designate the specific time or place of the noncitizen's removal proceedings is not a 'notice to appear under [ Section] 1229(a),' and so does not trigger the stop-time rule.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 2113-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nonetheless, this court observes and finds significant that neither Section 1229, which,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , details the contents of a notice to appear, nor\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   makes any reference to an immigration court's jurisdiction. The court finds nothing in the applicable statutory provisions or in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   expressly providing that a defective notice to appear leaves an immigration court without jurisdiction to conduct removal proceedings. Nor is there an express indication in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   or the applicable statutes that a statutorily defective notice to appear, standing alone, leaves an immigration court without the power to proceed with removal proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The court respectfully disagrees with district courts that have determined in the context of a criminal prosecution for illegal reentry that a statutorily defective notice to appear-one that lacks the time and date of removal proceedings-renders an immigration court without jurisdiction to conduct removal proceedings and issue an order of removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"Characterizing a rule as jurisdictional renders it unique in our adversarial system,\" and the Supreme Court has cautioned against \"profligate use of the label 'jurisdictional.' \"\n   <em>\n    Sebelius v.

Under the facts of this case, it is undisputed that the notice to appear delivered to Monsivais-Lopez does not comply with Section 1229(a) because it does not include time-and-place information required by the statute. Although there is no evidence that Monsivais-Lopez received actual notice or a written notice of the time and place of the removal hearing, he concedes that he was present at his removal hearing. The court concludes that Monsivais-Lopez was not deprived of the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner. The Certificate of Service for the Notice to Appear states that \"[Monsivais-Lopez] was provided oral notice in the Spanish language of the time and place of his ... hearing.\" Removal proceedings took place on May 3, 2010, and \"upon the basis of [Monsivais-Lopez]'s admissions\" an immigration judge ordered Monsivais-Lopez's removal by order dated May 3, 2010, stating that Monsivais-Lopez\n   waived appeal. Although the Government may have, at the outset, violated Section 1229(a), the court concludes that the noncompliance does not rise to the level of a due-process violation that rendered the removal proceedings fundamentally unfair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Moreover, Monsivais-Lopez cannot show that he was actually prejudiced by the deficient notice to appear. To prove actual prejudice, Monsivais-Lopez must show that \" 'there was a reasonable likelihood that but for the errors complained of the defendant would not have been deported.' \"\n   <em>\n    Lopez-Vasquez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11190025\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/227/476/#p483\">\n    227 F.3d at 485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Benitez-Villafuerte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"857864\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/186/651/#p658\">\n    186 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   658-59 ). Monsivais-Lopez argues that \"prejudice is a simple matter\" because he was ordered removed by an immigration judge who did not have authority to issue such an order. Monsivais-Lopez does not make an argument that he was actually prejudiced and instead \"preserves for further review whether he must show actual prejudice.\" Because the record does not include evidence of prejudice, the court concludes that Monsivais-Lopez has failed to show actual prejudice by the deficient notice to appear when he did appear at his removal hearing. Therefore, Monsivais-Lopez cannot meet the requirement of Section 1326(d)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
