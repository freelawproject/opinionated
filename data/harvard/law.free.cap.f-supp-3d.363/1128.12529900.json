Plaintiff points to Defendant's use of an evaluation form from the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (\"MBSAQIP\"), ECF No. 40 at 6-7, as indicative of the control Defendant exercised. However, it appears that Defendant used this evaluation form as part of its accreditation - MBSAQIP is an accreditation program of the American College of Surgeons and the American Society of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgeons.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.

While Plaintiff was required to be on call at least five days per month, Defendant did not have complete control over when Plaintiff would be on call. Before the beginning of each month, Plaintiff informed Defendant of his availability and, under the On-Call Agreement, Defendant was required to make \"best efforts\" to accommodate his availability. ECF No. 38-4 \u00b6 105. While on call, Plaintiff was not required to be on site unless he was informed that an emergency intervention was necessary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 110.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiff could also perform his own elective surgeries while on call, as long as he arranged for backup coverage.

In the instant case, Defendant and Plaintiff made clear that they were creating an independent contractor relationship: prior to Plaintiff beginning to work at the hospital, the two parties signed two written agreements that expressly characterized Plaintiff as an independent contractor. ECF No. 38-5 at 12-14; ECF No. 38-14 at 11-14. This of course strongly suggests that Plaintiff was an independent contractor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Several\n   <em>\n    Darden\n   </em>\n   factors support finding an employee status in this case, including: the skill required, the source of the instrumentalities and tools, and the hired party's role in hiring and paying assistants. Plaintiff performed surgical work that required much skill and training.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CSF \u00b6\u00b6 1, 2. Defendant provided the instrumentalities and tools to Plaintiff. Henry Decl. \u00b6 15. Defendant hired, supervised, and paid the staff who assisted Plaintiff. Henry Decl. \u00b6 18. These factors, however, do not neutralize the other factors and considerations in favor of a finding that Plaintiff was an independent contractor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Plaintiff heavily relies on\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   to contend that he was Defendant's employee. He argues that Defendant's peer review process was akin to the quality assurance program in\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   that the Second Circuit found created an employment relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   While the Second Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   found an employment relationship, it also recognized that other courts have instead \"found that hospital peer review programs do not constitute exercises of control over the manner and means of physician practice.\"\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049012\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/514/217/#p231\">\n    514 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   229 (citing\n   <em>\n    Shah v.

However,\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   determined that in its case the hospital's \"quality assurance program exceeded the control exerted in [the other cases], particularly as evidenced by what occurred after the alleged instances of harassment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1778305\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/847/270/#p273\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   According to the\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   plaintiff, after she complained of sexual harassment by Dr. Michael C.

The\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   plaintiff alleged that the defendants accordingly began to intensively review nearly every one of her cases, on a continuous basis, and continued that practice for years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 229.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   reasoned that state and federal statutes and regulations \"did not dictate the [hospital's] detailed treatment requirements.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 230. Also,\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   explained that, unlike those other cases that found an independent contractor relationship, the defendants in\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   \"did not merely review the quality of [plaintiff's] patient treatment outcomes but went further, by mandating performance of certain procedures (esophageal dilatation) and the timing of others (outpatient endoscopies ), directing which medications she should prescribe, and recommending changes to her practice based on their financial impact to the department.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 229. Further,\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   addressed the motivations of the hospital, concluding that the requirements forced on the plaintiff were \"aimed at maximizing [the hospital's] revenue\n   and punishing her for complaining about Moore's harassment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 230. Thus,\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   determined that \"a reasonable fact-finder could conclude from the present record that the quality assurance standards extended beyond mere health and safety concerns or ensuring [plaintiff's] qualifications,\" and reversed and remanded the case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 231.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Under the present record, even construing all evidence and inferences therefrom on behalf of Plaintiff, there is no genuine issue as to whether the peer review process created an employment relationship.

None of these described objections appear to relate to anything other than health and safety matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The record is unclear as to what recommendations resulted from the peer review process.

As a general matter, a nonmoving party cannot rely on unsupported, conclusory allegations in his or her own affidavit to create an issue of material fact.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Delange v.

To assert that the peer review process was unwarranted, Plaintiff also relies on Dr. Garth Jacobsen's letter reviewing his work, Pl.'s Ex. D, ECF No. 40-7; Pl.'s CSF \u00b6 3, ECF No. 41. Plaintiff has provided no context for Dr. Jacobsen's letter, even basic information like why Dr. Jacobsen's review was performed and the role (if any) this letter played in the peer review process. Without this information, the Court gives little weight to Plaintiff's Exhibit D. Accordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiff does not create an issue of material fact concerning whether the peer review process was \"completely unwarranted.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
