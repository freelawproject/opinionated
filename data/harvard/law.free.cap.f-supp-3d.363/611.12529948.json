(Doc. 71.) In the Recommendation, the Magistrate Judge recommends that Plaintiffs' Second Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 44) be denied and that this action be dismissed for want of subject-matter jurisdiction due to Plaintiffs' lack of standing. The Recommendation was served on the parties to this action on August 24, 2018 (Doc. 72). Plaintiffs have filed objections, (Doc. 73), to the Recommendation. Pursuant to this court's order, (Doc. 74), Plaintiffs filed a Supplemental Memorandum in support of their objections to the Recommendation, (Doc. 75), Defendants responded, (Doc. 76), and Plaintiffs replied, (Doc. 82).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Following\n   <em>\n    de\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    novo\n   </em>\n   review, this court agrees with the Recommendation as the record existed before the Magistrate Judge and, further, agrees with the Magistrate Judge that Plaintiffs failed to establish standing on that record. However, on the record and briefing submitted following issuance of the Recommendation, this court finds that Plaintiffs have established standing to challenge the twenty-week abortion ban set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2014-45.1\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 14-45.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and related statutes. This court further finds that Plaintiffs' second motion for summary judgment should be granted\n   and that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2014-45.1\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 14-45.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) should be enjoined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As noted above, this court agrees with the Magistrate Judge's Recommendation on the record before that court. It bears noting that, in the opinion of this court, Plaintiffs' counsel in this matter completely failed to heed the admonition of the Magistrate Judge as to concerns of standing and instead attempted to proceed on a theory that Plaintiffs have standing as a matter of law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Doc. 66) at 9 (\"Put simply, the standing of abortion providers - like Plaintiffs - to challenge criminal statutes - like the ban - 'is not open to question.' \").)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As this court made clear in its request for supplemental briefing, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Suppl. Briefing Order (Doc. 74) ), this court is not aware of any automatic right of standing to challenge an abortion regulation and \"imaginary or speculative\" fears of prosecution are insufficient to confer standing.\n   <em>\n    Younger v. Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11711728\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/37/#p42\">\n    401 U.S. 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 42,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11711728\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/37/#p42\">\n    91 S.Ct. 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11711728\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/37/#p42\">\n    27 L.Ed.2d 669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1971).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Magistrate Judge quite clearly expressed a sound concern over the parties' failure to address standing - specifically, whether Plaintiffs could establish a credible threat of prosecution. As a result, that court requested further briefing on the issue. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 65 at 3-5.) Rather than respond to the Magistrate Judge's request, Plaintiffs persisted in relying upon an argument that standing \"is not open to question,\" (Doc. 66 at 9), and that \"[d]ecades of black letter law establish that physicians, like Plaintiffs, who challenge criminal laws that prevent them from providing abortion care to patients have Article III standing.\" (Doc. 73 at 6-7.) Plaintiffs' arguments were neither responsive nor persuasive to the issues identified by the Magistrate Judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   It was only after this court requested supplemental briefing on the issues identified by the Magistrate Judge, (Suppl. Briefing Order (Doc. 74) ), and offered to allow Plaintiffs to \"submit the case based solely upon their current position,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8), that Plaintiffs fully addressed the issues critical to standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In light of the foregoing, it appears to this court that there has been unnecessary delay and judicial resources have been wasted to some degree because Plaintiffs' counsel have been unwilling or unable to address the issue of standing as necessary in this case. This court has considered whether the Recommendation should be adopted and the case dismissed in light of the failure of Plaintiffs to establish standing before the Magistrate Judge. \"The party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing\" the three elements of standing,\n   <em>\n    Lujan v.

After further consideration, this court will evaluate the supplemental briefing and enter an opinion which ultimately amounts to a complete\n   <em>\n    de\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    novo\n   </em>\n   review and analysis. Notwithstanding the new review and analysis, this court is concerned by the conduct of Plaintiffs' counsel of the briefing in this case.

That law is the successor statute to a North Carolina law under which abortion doctors were prosecuted.

The 2016 amendment does not erase the historical lack of prosecutions and completely reset the clock, nor does it make this case equivalent to one in which the state legislature had only recently passed an abortion ban.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Isaacson v.

The amendment imposed substantial reporting obligations on abortion providers for any abortion performed after sixteen weeks, expanded the universe of medical facilities from which information is collected, restricted the type of doctor who may perform an abortion in the state, and lengthened the informed consent waiting period\n   from twenty-four to seventy-two hours.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20N.C.%20Sess.%20Laws%202015\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The amendment also completely revamped the medical exception to the twenty-week ban.

Gen. Stat. \u00a7 90-21.81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   This court finds that the 2016 amendment substantively altered a woman's ability to obtain a post-viability abortion in North Carolina. Any other interpretation is inconsistent with the plain language of the amendment, because, as Plaintiffs observe, the new exception does not appear to cover degenerative diseases that may gravely impair the mother's health over a gradual period but never necessitate immediate abortion at any point to save the mother's life. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Supp. Mem. (Doc. 75) at 13.) Defendants' proffered interpretation also is not convincing when viewed in light of the numerous similar statutory alterations enacted by state legislatures nationwide in recent years.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 2016 S.D. Sess. Laws Ch. 180 (S.B. 72) (amending the medical exception to apply only in the event of a \"medical emergency,\" when the prior version of this statute permitted post-twenty-week abortions if \"necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother\"); 2014 Fla. Laws Ch. 2014-137 (C.S.H.B. No. 1047) (amending the medical exception to apply only when an abortion is necessary to \"avert a serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman other than a psychological condition\" rather than simply to \"preserve the health of the pregnant women\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   This court concludes that the 2016 amendment altered the maternal health exception to the twenty-week ban by narrowing the universe of abortions that are permissible under this exception. First, the amendment restricts the health exception to cover only those conditions that create a \"serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function,\" rather than merely a \"substantial risk ... [to] the health of the woman.\" Second, the amendment narrows the threshold medical determination of what conditions qualify for the exception, because a physician must now determine that the condition \"necessitates\" an \"immediate\" abortion. This means that medical-exception abortions are no longer permissible for conditions that cause gradual health damage but never, at any specific point, reach the level of immediacy required under the statute. Third and finally, the amendment explicitly excludes \"any psychological or emotional conditions\" and threats of suicide or self-harm, which were presumptively within the pre-amendment medical exception if they created a substantial risk of gravely impairing the mother's health.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339584\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/386/#p397\">\n    514 U.S. at 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339584\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/386/#p397\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that an amendment to statutory language is presumed to have \"real and substantial effect\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   When one aspect of a statutory scheme is altered, this creates a reasonable presumption that other changes may follow or that the legislature's general intentions regarding the enforcement of the scheme is evolving. This is especially true here, because the abortions that are carved out by the amended medical emergency exception would still be legal but for the continued presence of the twenty-week ban. In this\n   court's view, it is not possible to sever the amendment's effect from the ban itself because these provisions work in tandem. Therefore, by narrowing the maternal health exception to the twenty-week ban, the 2016 amendment revived the threat of future prosecution under the ban.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   This threat is slightly lower than would be present following a newly-enacted ban, but greater than the threat that would exist under a static statute where there had been no prosecutions for over forty years. This court will now proceed to determine whether either the openness of any alleged violations of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2014-45.1\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 14-45.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and related statutes or Defendants' official disavowals mitigate this threat such that Plaintiffs nevertheless lack standing to challenge the ban.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Open and Notorious Violations\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Plaintiffs' discovery responses suggest that Plaintiffs are complying with the ban by not providing abortions to patients past the twentieth week of pregnancy. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Beverly Gray Discovery Resps. (Doc. 53-2) at 4-5 (stating that Plaintiff Gray's practice turned away approximately ten to fifteen women seeking an abortion after the twentieth week of their pregnancy from 2014 to 2016.); Elizabeth Deans Discovery Resps. (Doc. 53-3) at 8-10) (stating that Plaintiff Deans \"does not recall performing any abortion procedure in North Carolina after the gestational limit set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2014-45.1\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 14-45.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\" despite her practice receiving requests to perform such abortions).) There appears to be some dispute, however, regarding whether past abortions provided by Plaintiffs after the twenty-week point fell within the pre-amendment medical emergency exception. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amy Bryant Discovery Resps. (Doc. 53-1) at 5 (describing a total of ten post-twenty-week abortions from 2014 to 2016 that Plaintiff Bryant asserts fell within the medical exception to the ban); (\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Beverly Gray Disc. Resps. (Doc. 53-2) at 6 (stating that Plaintiff Gray performed a single abortion procedure after twenty weeks between 2014 and 2016, which fell within the exception).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   This court agrees with the Magistrate Judge's analysis that Plaintiffs have not conclusively demonstrated that any post-twenty-week abortions were in fact performed pursuant to the statutory exception as it existed at the relevant time. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Recommendation (Doc. 71) at 10-11.) On the other hand, this court recognizes that information or records that might prove the actual medical diagnosis in each such case are likely both not in Plaintiffs' direct possession, (Elizabeth Deans Disc. Resps. (Doc. 53-3) at 6 (stating that abortion records belong to the medical center and may not be divulged for any purposes other than client treatment) ), and subject to medical privacy laws that would prevent their disclosure into evidence.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320d-6(a)(3) (describing penalties for \"disclos[ing] individually identifiable health information to another person\"); 10A N.C. Admin. Code 13B.3903 (restricting access to medical records and stating that records are the exclusive \"property of the hospital\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In any event, Defendants have provided nothing to dispute Plaintiffs' contention that their North Carolina abortion practices have turned away women seeking abortions after the twentieth week of pregnancy. First, even if this court is to assume for argument that Plaintiffs have not scrupulously adhered to the terms of the medical exception (which this court is not able to determine without further evidence), there is nothing in the record to suggest that these were open or notorious violations. This court does not believe that a mis-interpretation of the medical exception constitutes an open or public violation of anything - it certainly does not equate, for example, to an abortion clinic openly advertising\n   to the public that it will provide post-twenty-week abortions. To be relevant to the standing analysis, violations must be open and public; specifically, they must be known to law enforcement or state authorities or easily uncovered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ullman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1785558\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/367/497/#p499\">\n    367 U.S. at 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1785558\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/367/497/#p499\">\n    81 S.Ct. 1752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that \"ubiquitous, open, public sales would mere quickly invite the attention of enforcement officials\" and finding that this fact weighed against standing);\n   <em>\n    S.F.

Any violations here, occurring as they would in the private doctor-patient setting, simply do not come close to the public, open contraceptive sales that the Supreme Court emphasized in\n   <em>\n    Ullman\n   </em>\n   . This court finds, based on the record in this case, no open and notorious violations of the twenty-week ban.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Government Statements regarding Prosecution\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Defendants have submitted to this court a set of e-mail messages and affidavits in which they profess certain intentions regarding the enforcement of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2014-45.1\">\n    N.C.

Defendants urge this court to find that these documents negate standing as a matter of law because they represent an official statement that violations of \u00a7 14-45.1 and related statutes will not be prosecuted. In other words, Defendants appear to argue that the legal authority of the e-mails are of no consequence; rather, the mere fact that Defendants have provided these e-mails should, by itself, settle the issue of standing.

Gen. Stat. \u00a7 14-45.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and related statutes prohibit any pre-viability abortions. Defendants, however, offer three issues that they contend are disputed material facts in this case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Resp. Br. (Doc. 52) at 6-7.) First, Defendants urge that the point of viability is a fact in genuine dispute. However, as discussed above, the Supreme Court has held that the particular point at which viability occurs is legally irrelevant and will necessarily vary under the specific circumstances of each pregnancy.\n   <em>\n    Casey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/#p846\">\n    505 U.S. at 870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/#p846\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants state in their opposition brief that \"evidence developed during expedited discovery tends to show that viability is possible by 22 weeks lmp.\" (Defs.' Resp. Br. (Doc. 52) at 9.) This court infers from Defendants' statement that they concede viability is generally not possible between twenty and twenty-two weeks after a woman's last menstrual period (\"LMP\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   which means that the ban clearly encompasses at least some pre-viability abortions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even if it did not, however, the week-specific point of viability cannot be relevant to this dispute because the Supreme Court has clearly advised that a state legislature may\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   fix viability at a specific week but must instead leave this determination to doctors.\n   <em>\n    Danforth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6176125\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/428/52/#p64\">\n    428 U.S. at 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6176125\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/428/52/#p64\">\n    96 S.Ct. 2831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(Defs.' Resp. Br. (Doc. 52) at 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   McCaffrey Dep. (Doc. 53-5) at 188 (\"[P]rior surgical abortion certainly is associated with a future preterm birth.\").) But\n   <em>\n    Casey\n   </em>\n   is quite clear on this point: no matter what the state's legitimate interest in restricting abortion, this interest can never support an outright ban prior to viability.\n   <em>\n    Casey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/#p846\">\n    505 U.S. at 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/#p846\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Before viability, the State's interests are not strong enough to support a prohibition of abortion or the imposition of a substantial obstacle to the woman's effective right to elect the procedure.\").

In conjunction with \u00a7\u00a7 14-44 and 14-45, North Carolina law criminalizes all non-emergency abortions performed after twenty weeks, without regard to the type of procedure or how the abortion is obtained. Because\n   <extracted-citation index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2014-45.1\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 14-45.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and related statutes operate as a total ban after twenty weeks, any dispute as to the nature or force of the state's interest in addressing maternal health risks from abortion is immaterial as it relates to the statute's prohibition of pre-viability abortions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Finally, Defendants urge that there is a genuine dispute regarding the actual burden that the statute places on women seeking abortions, primarily because Defendants question whether Plaintiffs have shown that any (or, in the alternative, a substantial number of) women seek post-twenty-week abortions in North Carolina. (Defs.' Resp. Br. (Doc. 52) at 11.)
