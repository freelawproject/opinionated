INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Before this Court is the latest volley in a contentious, long-running battle over a stalled casino project in East Windsor, Connecticut. The state of Connecticut (the \"State\") and the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe claim that the United States Secretary of the Interior has unlawfully declined to approve an agreement that would allow them to begin constructing the casino. Defendants-the Secretary, the Department of the Interior, and MGM Resorts Global Development, LLC-argue that the Secretary has violated no law. Having failed to convince this Court of their first theory of the case, Plaintiffs-the State and the Pequot-seek to amend their complaint and take a second bite at the apple. While Plaintiffs' motion appears to be the product of tactical timing more than newly-discovered information or legal theories, allowing the case to proceed would not unduly prejudice Defendants. And while one of Plaintiffs' three proposed claims would not survive a motion to dismiss, the Court cannot say that amendment would be futile as to the other two claims. Thus, for the reasons stated below, the Court will allow Plaintiffs to amend their complaint in certain respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Given documents showing the Department's decision-making process, it may become apparent that the Secretary had good reason to neither approve or deny the proposed Pequot Procedures amendments. On the other hand, given the same documents, Plaintiffs may demonstrate that the Secretary's disparate treatment of the proposed Mohegan Compact amendments and Pequot Procedures amendments was improper, despite their different statutory postures. At this stage, the Court may only consider Plaintiffs' proposed allegations, certain judicially noticed material, and the Secretary's letter \"returning\" the proposed Pequot Procedures amendments; a letter providing little explanation for the Secretary's action. \"[A] fundamental requirement of administrative law is that an agency set forth its reasons for decision; an agency's failure to do so constitutes arbitrary and capricious agency action.\"\n   <em>\n    Amerijet\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5921067,4280636\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/753/1343/\">\n    753 F.3d at 1350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Tourus Records\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3725989,9499806\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/259/731/\">\n    259 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   737 ).

Cir. 2006). The Court's analysis here begins and ends with that plain meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   First, the Court must define a tribal-state compact. The IGRA does not provide a definition but, as Plaintiffs note, the Department's regulations do. The relevant regulations state that a\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   Compact or Tribal-State Gaming Compact means an intergovernmental agreement executed between Tribal and State governments under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act that\n   <em>\n    establishes\n   </em>\n   between the parties the terms and conditions for the operation and regulation of the tribe's Class III gaming activities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20293.2\">\n    25 C.F.R. \u00a7 293.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). This definition prompts the question of what it means to \"establish\" the terms and conditions of gaming. Neither the IGRA nor the Department define the term \"establish,\" but common definitions of \"establish\" are instructive here. Black's Law Dictionary defines the term, in relevant part, as \"to enact permanently ... [t]o make or form; to bring about or into existence.\"\n   <em>\n    Establish\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). Webster's Dictionary similarly defines \"establish\" as \"to institute ... permanently by enactment or agreement\" or \"to bring into existence.\"\n   <em>\n    Establish\n   </em>\n   , Merriam-Webster's Dictionary (Jan. 25, 2019), https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/establish. Thus, a tribal-state compact is an agreement creating the terms under which the tribe may conduct gaming.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Next, the Court must determine whether Plaintiffs' proposed Pequot Procedures amendments meet that definition. The proposal is framed as an \"agreement\" between the Pequot and the state. FAC Ex. 1 at 48. It, in relevant part, seeks to \"modify\" and \"amend\" certain sections of the Pequot Procedures.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20293.2\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20293.2\">\n    at 48-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Those amendments prevent the creation of \"a business entity jointly and exclusively owned by the [Pequot] and the [Mohegan]\" from triggering certain rights for the Pequot under the Procedures, such as the right to conduct Class III gaming based on a state law amendment,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20293.2\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20293.2\">\n    at 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , or the right to negotiate a tribal-state compact governing types of Class III gaming that were not permitted when the Procedures were imposed, but were \"subsequently so permitted by the state,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20293.2\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20293.2\">\n    at 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, the proposal seeks to prevent the establishment of the Tribes' joint venture under Connecticut law from disrupting the existing framework-the Pequot Procedures-governing the Pequot's gaming activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The proposed Pequot Procedures amendments plainly fall outside of the Department's definition of a tribal-state compact. The proposal may be an \"intergovernmental agreement executed\" between the Pequot and the State, unlike the Pequot Procedures. But it does not \"establish\" the terms and conditions of the Pequot's Class III gaming activities. Those terms and conditions are already established by the Pequot Procedures. The proposed amendments do not replace the Pequot Procedures and enact new terms and conditions, but merely protect those terms and conditions against the creation of the Tribes' joint venture. Plaintiffs' proposal makes this clear: it seeks to \"confirm\" that \"the enactment of any Connecticut law to authorize\" the Tribes' joint venture \"shall\n   <em>\n    not affect\n   </em>\n   the rights and responsibilities of the [Pequot] under the [Pequot] Procedures.\" FAC Ex. 1 at 48 (emphasis added). Thus, Plaintiffs' proposed Count III cannot withstand a motion to dismiss, and amendment would be futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that allowing Plaintiffs to amend their complaint would not cause undue delay, but would be futile as to proposed Count III because that claim could not survive a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Foman\n   </em>\n   , 371 U.S. at 182,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"450547\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/371/178/#p182\">\n    83 S.Ct. 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Tribal-state compacts result from negotiations between a tribe and a state; they thus simply require the Secretary's sign-off to the extent that they are consistent with the IGRA. Secretarial procedures, on the other hand, require the Secretary to consider the tribe's wishes and state and federal law, and then draft procedures accordingly. There is no document for the Secretary to \"deem approved\" to the extent it is consistent with the IGRA, because the Secretary must create that document and ensure its consistency with the IGRA\n    <em>\n     before\n    </em>\n    it is approved.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202710\">\n     25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2710\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d)(7)(B)(vii)(I).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    As Plaintiffs note, Defendants' formulation of the standard is pulled from a D.C.
