(Doc. 1 at \u00b6 1). During the relevant time period, N.G., the father of A.G., was an insured by Defendant through his employer-sponsored health insurance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A.G. has struggled for years with mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, eating disorders, suicide ideations, and drug use. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10). After counseling, hospitalization, and other therapies were unsuccessful, A.G. was sent to Blue Ridge Therapeutic Wilderness (\"Blue Ridge\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Blue Ridge is an outdoor/behavioral therapy program located in Clayton, Georgia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Blue Ridge is an intermediate care program licensed by the state of Georgia as an \"Outdoor Child Caring Program\" that treats youths with mental health and substance abuses diagnoses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12). Blue Ridge uses a multidisciplinary approach to treat youths with mental health and substance abuses diagnoses, using wilderness behavioral healthcare therapy to deliver traditional, evidence-based treatments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14). On intake, Blue Ridge patients receive a psychiatric assessment and receive tailored personal treatment including individual therapy, group therapy, and family therapy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A.G. received treatment at Blue Ridge from January 5, 2017 to March 31, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16). N.G. personally paid $ 46,650 for the Blue Ridge services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On October 16, 2017, Anthem denied the claims submitted for A.G.'s treatment at Blue Ridge based on a plan provision that excludes claims for \"wilderness camps.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Plan requires one level of internal appeal, and thus the October 16, 2017 denial, which came in response to an appeal, exhausted the internal appeals process. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18). Anthem had full discretionary authority to administer and pay benefits under the plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Under the terms of the Plan, Anthem is required to pay benefits for \"Covered Services.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 58; Doc. 1-2 at M3, M-22). Covered Services are those \"performed, prescribed, directed or authorized by a Provider.\" (Doc. 1-2 at M-112). The Plan defines \"Provider\" as \"[a] duly licensed person or facility....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at M-117). The Plan defines \"Facility\" as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   a facility including but not limited to, a Hospital, freestanding Ambulatory Surgical Facility, Chemical Dependency Treatment Facility, Residential Treatment Center, Skilled Nursing Facility, Home Health Care Agency or mental health facility, as defined in this Certificate. The Facility must be licensed, accredited, registered or approved by the Joint Commission or the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF), as applicable, or meet specific rules set by [Defendant].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at M-118).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Covered Services are subject to conditions, Exclusions, limitations, terms, and provisions of the Plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at M-22). The Plan states that excluded services are not covered \"even if the service, supply, or equipment would otherwise be considered Medically Necessary.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Medically Necessary is a service known to be effective, as proven by scientific evidence, in materially improving health outcomes; the\n   most appropriate supply, setting or level of service that can safely be provided that cannot be omitted consistent with recognized professional standards of care; cost-effective compared to alternative interventions, not experimental; not primarily for the convenience of the insure; and not otherwise excluded. (Doc. 1 at \u00b6 35;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1-2 at M-114-115).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The pertinent portion of the \"Non Covered Services/Exclusions\" section of the Plan, under which Plaintiff's claim was denied, provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   We do not provide benefits for procedures, equipment, services, supplies or charges:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 Custodial Care, convalescent care or rest cures.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 Domiciliary care provided in a residential institution, treatment center, supervised living or halfway house, or school because a Member's own home arrangements are not available or are unsuitable, and consisting chiefly of room and board, even if therapy is included.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 Care provided or billed by a hotel, health resort, convalescent home, rest home, nursing home or other extended care facility home for the aged, infirmary, school infirmary, institution providing education in special environments, supervised living or halfway house, or any similar facility or institution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 Services or care provided or billed by a school, Custodial Care center for the developmentally disabled, halfway house, or outward bound programs, even if psychotherapy is included.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 Wilderness camps.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (Doc 1-2 at M-55, M-57, \u00b6 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Plan does cover behavioral/mental health services at \"Residential Treatment\" in \"a licensed Residential Treatment Center that offers individualized and intensive treatment that includes observation and assessment by a physician weekly or more often and rehabilitation, therapy, and education.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at M-24). The Plan defines a \"Residential Treatment Center\" as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   A Provider licensed and operated as required by law, which includes:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   1.

Count 1, brought on behalf of A.G. and the proposed class, seeks enforcement of the Plan because Plaintiff contends that the services received at Blue Ridge were not excluded under the Plan. Count 2 seeks enforcement of the Plan for breach of the protections of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Act (\"Parity Act\"), which mandates parity between the \"treatment limitations\" placed on mental health benefits and medical/surgical\n   benefits. (Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 40-48; 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1185a(a)(3)(A)(ii) ). Count 3 is for breach of fiduciary duty for violation of the Parity Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 49-53). Both Counts 2 and 3 are in the alternative to Count 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Importantly, the\n   <em>\n    Gallagher\n   </em>\n   court held that, at the motion to dismiss stage, the relevant analysis\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   is not whether benefits for wilderness therapy are available for medical/surgical patients, but rather whether the Plan has chosen to provide benefits for skilled nursing facilities and rehabilitation centers for medical/surgical patients, but chosen to deny benefits to those with mental health conditions who seek coverage for a residential treatment center offering wilderness therapy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527830\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/339/248/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Vorpahl\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    A.Z.\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Gallagher\n   </em>\n   , the healthcare plans at issue did not cover mental health services at residential treatment centers, but did cover services for medical/surgical services at comparable skilled nursing facilities/rehabilitation hospitals. Here, Plaintiff's claims under the Parity Act ultimately fail because the Plan does provide for coverage of mental health services at residential treatment centers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that the Plan violates the Parity Act because it includes services at intermediate facilities such as rehabilitation hospitals and skilled nursing facilities, but not \"wilderness camps.\" (Doc. 1 at \u00b6 48). But the Plan does explicitly cover services at residential treatment centers - for both medical and mental health services - it simply does not cover any services performed at wilderness camps. (Doc. 1-2 at M-24, M-61, M-118-20). A residential treatment center is an intermediate facility analogue to a rehabilitation hospital and skilled nursing facility. Therefore, applying the standard outlined in\n   <em>\n    Gallagher\n   </em>\n   , because the Plan both provides benefits for services performed at residential treatment centers for medical/surgical patients and for mental health conditions, the Plan\n   does not contain a discriminatory limitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Because the Plan equally covers mental health services and medical/surgical services at residential treatment centers, the Court cannot find that the Plan's blanket exclusion of services at \"wilderness camps\" is a treatment limitation in violation of the Parity Act. Accordingly, Plaintiff fails to state a viable claim under the Parity Act and dismissal of Counts 1 and 2 of the complaint is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendant's Partial Motion to Dismiss Counts 1-3 (Doc. 10) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    A copy of the insurance plan issued to N.G. by Defendant is attached to the complaint.
