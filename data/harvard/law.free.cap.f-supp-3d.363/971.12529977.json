Despite the issuance of the requisite travel document, Tindi asserts his detention is indefinite and unreasonable, and therefore seeks a Writ of Habeas Corpus securing his immediate release.

Though he applied to become a permanent resident, Tindi's application was rejected on September 1, 2007.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On November 14, 2008 ICE initiated removal proceedings against Tindi, which culminated in a March 10, 2009 order for removal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Tindi was taken into custody in October 2009.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   p. 8. He then filed a successful motion to reopen his immigration proceedings, which prompted his release from custody on November 17, 2009.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   p. 46. Tindi remained out on bond under threat of removal for the next two years while his immigration status was under consideration. Lee Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-10, Docket No. 13. On September 21, 2011, an immigration judge reversed the previous removal order, and on April 15, 2014 Tindi's status was changed to lawful permanent resident.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Tindi's Criminal Conviction And Resulting Removal Proceedings\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   December 2014, Tindi was charged with first degree burglary and fourth degree sexual assault for entering his neighbor's apartment without permission and attempting to sexually assault a woman who was asleep there.

Tindi was sentenced to 24 months, the execution of which was stayed for five years, and he was ordered to serve 210 days in the Hennepin County Adult Corrections Facility, which he began serving on April 4, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   pp. 10, 12, 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   ICE took Tindi into custody directly from the Hennepin County Jail on August 16, 2016.

The court identified two separate analytical approaches to answering the question how\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   applies to the time an alien had been detained while shifting in and out of final removal status. Under the first approach - retrospective recharacterization - the issuance of a stay order such as Tindi's causes all \"time served\" to be retrospectively recharacterized as pre-removal detention, thereby resulting in a resetting of the\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   clock. In the \"unencumbered time\" approach, the court aggregates all time during which the alien was in removal and post-removal status, and could have lawfully been removed. In\n   <em>\n    Bah\n   </em>\n   , this Court adopted the unencumbered time approach as the proper one and, applying it to Bah, found his detention exceeded the six-month period that is presumptively reasonable under\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   . Since\n   <em>\n    Bah\n   </em>\n   had demonstrated there was no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future,\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   compelled Bah's immediate release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Tindi's case is different. Under the unencumbered time approach, Tindi has only served - at most - 35 days on the\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   clock and his removal detention time is within the presumptively reasonable six-month limitation. Because Tindi is in custody but not currently subject to a final removal order, \"his [on-going] detention\n   ... is not governed by\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Davies v.

Though Tindi initially overstayed his 2005 Visa, he has, since that time, exclusively utilized the courts to challenge his removal. Through rulings both favorable and unfavorable, Tindi has relied upon the legal process and has shown no indication that he is a flight risk or that he would refuse to comply with a final order of removal should his legal challenges fail. In fact, for a period of almost two years, while Tindi was subject to his initial removal order, Tindi was not in ICE custody (pending what turned out to be a favorable ruling granting him permanent resident status). There is no evidence in the record that Tindi attempted to flee or in any way was a flight risk even though he was in much the same situation as he is here - that is, living under an otherwise final removal order that he was challenging through legal proceedings. While it is possible, had that order not been reversed, Tindi would have fled upon issuance of an adverse decision, there is simply no evidence to establish that supposition. Tindi's current availment of legal process in this matter similarly suggests he is not a flight risk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Tindi has been in ICE custody for over 15 months, with an indefinite period yet to remain. Tindi's Eighth Circuit matter is stayed pending a decision in\n   <em>\n    Dimaya,\n   </em>\n   in which the Supreme Court will decide whether the definition of a \"crime of violence\" in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2016\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), as incorporated into the Immigration and Nationality Act provisions governing removal eligibility, is unconstitutionally vague. Because Tindi's removal is directly predicated on the finding that his sexual assault conviction is a crime of violence, a decision striking down\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2016\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) could lead to reversal of Tindi's removal order; at a minimum it would lead to further, possibly protracted litigation. It is unknown when the Supreme Court will decide\n   <em>\n    Dimaya,\n   </em>\n   and this Court cannot prognosticate what its decision will be or how, if at all, it will affect Tindi's removal. In addition, though seemingly less uncertain than predicting the timing of and holding in\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   , this Court cannot prognosticate when and how Tindi's state court appeal will be decided and, if unsuccessful, whether the Minnesota Supreme Court will grant review. Tindi's removal is thus uncertain, and the period of his continued detention is indefinite. Thus, despite the Government's diligence and the fact that a travel document has been issued, it cannot be said that Tindi's removal will occur in the reasonably foreseeable future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Government suggests that Tindi should not be released because it has diligently worked toward removing Tindi, who would have already been deported had he not filed multiple appeals. Gov't. Resp. pp. 17-18, Docket No. 12. This is true, but misses the mark. While the Government is not at fault for Tindi's delayed repatriation, \"appeals and petitions for relief are to be expected as a natural part of\n   the process. An alien who would not normally be subject to indefinite detention cannot be so detained merely because he seeks to explore avenues of relief that the law makes available to him.\"\n   <em>\n    Ly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9047969\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/351/263/#p271\">\n    351 F.3d at 272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There is no evidence Tindi's appeals were pursued in bad faith or were a dilatory strategy to prolong his deportation proceedings. Tindi may not be detained indefinitely merely because he has pursued his legal rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Government also suggests Tindi's detention should continue because, had Tindi's criminal sentence not been stayed, he would in fact still be in criminal custody. Gov't. Resp. p. 18. This argument appears to be premised on a factor applied by the First Circuit in formulating its reasonableness test - that is, that Tindi's period of detention to date is shorter than the sentence he received in his underlying criminal case. While it is true that Tindi's criminal sentence of two years exceeds the 15 months he has been in ICE custody, that is not, in this Court's view, the proper inquiry. Tindi's criminal sentence\n   <em>\n    was stayed\n   </em>\n   , and the Government has offered no evidence that the stay was predicated on Tindi's imminent deportation, or that Tindi has violated the conditions of his stay. Given the actual state of affairs, but for ICE's detention, Tindi would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be in custody today. Accordingly, the Government may not continue to incarcerate Tindi on those grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In short, balancing the factors that are individual to Tindi's case leads this Court to conclude that his continued detention is not reasonable and does not comport with due process. The decision to recommend releasing Tindi does not come without hesitation. While Tindi's continued detention is unreasonable, it is reasonable to impose conditions on his release to protect the public and to reasonably assure his presence should his final removal be reinstated. As this Court noted in\n   <em>\n    Bah\n   </em>\n   , \"Congress has the right 'to remove aliens, to subject them to supervision with conditions when released from detention, [and] to incarcerate them where appropriate for violations of those conditions.'\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/#p699\">\n    533 U.S. at 695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/#p699\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Section 241.13(h) of Title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulations provides for subjecting aliens who are released from custody under\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   to appropriate release conditions.\"\n   <em>\n    Bah\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5466298\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/489/905/\">\n    489 F.Supp.2d at 923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
