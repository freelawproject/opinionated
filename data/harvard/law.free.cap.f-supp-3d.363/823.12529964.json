Reg. 66514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Dec. 26, 2018). As a result of the new interpretation, devices commonly known as \"bump stocks\" fall under the statutory definition of \"machinegun.\" Members of the public are not allowed to possess machine guns manufactured after 1986. The Final Rule requires bump stock owners to dispose of their devices by March 26, 2019. After March 26, people who possess a bump stock can be charged with a felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs filed a lawsuit challenging the Final Rule. Along with their complaint, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction (ECF No. 9) asserting a likelihood of success on their asserted violations\n   of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA). Because Congress has not spoken on the matter and the statutory terms are ambiguous, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their administrative law claims and their motion for a preliminary injunction must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After Plaintiffs filed their motion for a preliminary injunction (ECF No. 9), Defendants filed a response (ECF No. 34) and Plaintiffs filed a reply (ECF No. 37). Defendants subsequently filed a Notice of Supplemental Authority. (ECF No. 38.) On February 25, 2019, Judge Dabney Friedrich of the District Court for the District of Columbia issued a memorandum opinion denying a motion for a preliminary injunction in the first-filed action challenging the Final Rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Guedes v.

The criminalization of intoxicating liquors created a lucrative, illegal market for alcoholic beverages. During these years, local gangs evolved and organized into criminal enterprises to exploit the demand for illegal alcohol. As these criminal organizations expanded, so too did the danger those organizations posed to each other and the public. Among the weapons adopted and used by these criminal organizations were rapid-fire, hand-held guns, like the Thompson submachine gun, a weapon that began production in the 1920s and could fire several hundred rounds a minute. In 1929, Tommy guns were used in the infamous St. Valentine's Day Massacre, an incident where members of one Chicago gang dressed like police officers killed seven members of a rival gang. On February 20, 1933, Congress proposed the Twenty-First Amendment, which was adopted by the required number of States on December 5, and the experiment with prohibition ended. The threat to the public from criminal organizations, however, remained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Congress began to address the threat that rapid-fire weapons pose to the public, an effort that has continued for decades. A year after Prohibition ended, Congress enacted the National Firearms Act (NFA) as an attempt to protect the public from the dangers posed by military-type weapons likely to be used for criminal purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Congress imposed a tax on both the making and the transfer of NFA firearms. Following the assassinations of Senator Robert Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King, in 1968 Congress amended the NFA by enacting the Gun Control Act (GCA), which, among other things, expanded the NFA's definition of \"machinegun.\" Finally, in 1986, Congress enacted the Firearm Owners Protection Act (FOPA), which makes it \"unlawful for any person to transfer or possess\" a newly manufactured machine gun.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).

The definition of \"machinegun\" is located in Chapter 53.

In a few instances, ATF has promulgated Final Rules concerning a firearm device.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ATF Rul. 2006-2 (Final Rule determining the Akins Accelerator bump stock was a machine gun). More commonly, ATF issues informal letters. ATF encourages, but does not require, manufacturers to seek informal rulings or classification letters prior to offering devices for sale.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sig Sauer, Inc. v.

On October 1, 2017, a gunman in Las Vegas, Nevada, fired over one thousand rounds of ammunition into a crowd gathered for a concert. Fifty-eight people died and several hundred were wounded by the gunfire. The gunman reportedly employed bump-stock devices on several of his weapons. Following this tragic event, members of Congress, a number of non-governmental organizations, and eventually the President of the United States urged AFT to re-examine its prior considerations of bump stocks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On December 26, 2017, the Department of Justice published an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking concerning bump-stock devices. On March 29, 2018, the Department published a notice of proposed rulemaking. The Department received over 185,000 comments, with the comments supporting the proposed rules exceeding those opposing the proposed rules at about a two-to-one ratio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   To appreciate how the new interpretation of the definition of machine gun implicates bump-stock devices, one must understand how the device works. The stock of a rifle is the portion of the weapon behind the trigger and firing mechanism and extends rearward towards the shooter. The forward part of the stock just behind the trigger provides a grip for the shooting hand. The rear end of the stock rests against the shooter's shoulder. A bump stock replaces the standard stock on a rifle. Bump stocks include an extension ledge or finger rest on which the shooter places his or her trigger finger where it is stabilized.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2066514\">\n    83 Fed. Reg. at 66516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The shooter then exerts a constant forward pressure on the barrel of the rifle using the non-trigger hand.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2066514\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As the rifle is pushed forward, the shooter also pulls the trigger, initiating the firing sequence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2066514\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2066514\">\n    at 66532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The bump stock then harnesses the rearward recoil energy from the shot causing the weapon to slide back into shooter's shoulder separating the trigger finger resting on the ledge and the trigger itself. The constant forward pressure exerted by the non-trigger hand on the barrel then pushes the weapon forward \"bumping\" the weapon against the stationary trigger finger. The back-and-forth sequence\n   allows a shooter to fire a semiautomatic rifle at rates similar to automatic rifles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In the Final Rule, the ATF amended its regulations to clarify that bump-stock devices are machine guns, as that term is defined in the National Firearms Act and the Gun Control Act \"because such devices allow a shooter of a semiautomatic firearm to initiate a continuous firing cycle with a single pull of the trigger.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2066514\">\n    83 Fed. Reg. at 66515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Final Rule advances two definitions, both interpreting portions of the statutory definition of machine gun. First, the Final Rule interprets the phrase \"single function of the trigger\" to mean \"single pull of the trigger.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2066514\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2066514\">\n    at 66518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, the Final Rule interprets the term \"automatically\" to mean \"as the result of a self-acting or self-regulating mechanism that allows the firing of multiple rounds through a single pull of the trigger.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2066514\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2066514\">\n    at 66519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based on the two interpretations, the Final Rule clarifies that the term \"machinegun\" extends to devices like bump stocks that permit a semiautomatic weapon to shoot more than one shot with a single pull of the trigger \"by harnessing the recoil energy\" \"so that the trigger resets and continues firing without additional physical manipulation of the trigger by the shooter.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2066514\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   To prevail on this motion for a preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs must demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits.

In the statute, \"automatically\" functions as an adverb modifying the verb \"shoots.\" Relying on definitions from the 1930s, the ATF,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2066514\">\n    83 Fed.

The statutory definition of machine gun does not answer this specific question. Dictionaries contemporary with the enactment of the NFA do not conclusively resolve the issue. The statute is ambiguous as to whether the word \"automatically\" precludes any and all application of non-trigger, manual forces in order for multiple shots to occur. Read in context, a weapon is a machine gun when more than one shot occurs without manual reloading. Putting forward pressure on the barrel with the non-trigger hand is not manual reloading. Judge Friedrich observed, many \"automatic\" devices require some degree of manual input.\n   <em>\n    Guedes,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529265\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/356/109/\">\n    356 F.Supp.3d at 130-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Accordingly, the Court concludes, with respect to the word \"automatically,\" the statutory definition of machine gun is ambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   AFT's interpretation of the word \"automatically\" is a permissible interpretation. The interpretation is consistent with judicial interpretations of the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Defendants and ATF define \"single function of the trigger\" as \"single pull of the trigger.\" Their interpretation considers the external impetus for the mechanical process. Plaintiffs define the phrase as the mechanical process which causes each shot to occur. The statute does not make clear whether function refers to the trigger as a mechanical device or whether function refers to the impetus for action that ensues. Both interpretations are reasonable under the statute.

It is consistent with judicial opinions interpreting the statute. Plaintiffs have not established that ATF exceeded its authority. ATF has been interpreting the disputed phrase in a similar manner at least since 2006.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ATF Rul. 2006-2;\n   <em>\n    Akins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3879539\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/312/197/\">\n    312 F.

Plaintiffs' fear is not well-founded. AFT's interpretations of the statute-the definitions of \"automatically\" and \"single function the trigger\"-which extends to devices specially designed and marketed for the purpose of increasing the rate of fire of a semiautomatic weapon will not pose a danger of prosecution to individuals who own a semiautomatic weapon and also happen to own pants or elastic office supplies. \"[N]othing is better settled than that statutes should receive a sensible construction, such as will effectuate the legislative intention, and, if possible, so as to avoid unjust or an absurd conclusion[.]\"\n   <em>\n    In re Chapman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3593323\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/166/661/#p680\">\n    166 U.S. 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 680,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3593323\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/166/661/#p680\">\n    17 S.Ct. 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3593323\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/166/661/#p680\">\n    41 L.Ed. 1154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1897).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiffs assert the new interpretation is arbitrary and capricious because ATF previously concluded that bump stocks were not machine guns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The United States Supreme Court has rejected a rule that changes in statutory interpretations by agencies are necessarily arbitrary and capricious.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

ATF then set forth sufficient reasons for its new interpretations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Court concludes that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their APA challenges to ATF's Final Rule. With this determination, Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction will be denied. Defendants concede that Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm without an injunction. (Pl. Resp. at 27 n.16 PageID. 279.) The two remaining factors\n   do not weigh heavily in favor of Plaintiffs, if at all. Congress restricts access to machine guns because of the threat the weapons pose to public safety.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Restrictions on bump stocks advance the same interest. All of the public is at risk, including the smaller number of bump stock owners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Most of Plaintiffs' arguments on the final two elements are merely extensions of the first and second elements of a preliminary injunction. Plaintiffs identify the adverse impact on the liberty and property interests of bump-stock owners as supporting the public's interest in a preliminary injunction. The property interest identified overlaps completely with the second element for a preliminary injunction, irreparable harm. Plaintiffs contend that the Final Rule jeopardizes a bump-stock owner's right to bear arms. That assertion overlaps with the merits element; Plaintiffs' assume bump stocks are protected by the right to bear arms. At least one circuit court, post\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   , has found that machine guns are not protected bearable arms under the Second Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Hollis v. Lynch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5923993\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/436/#p451\">\n    827 F.3d 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 451 (5th Cir. 2016). Plaintiffs also assert that the public has an interest in the proper exercise of legislative power and that the Final Rule exceeds ATF's statutory authority. Again, that interest overlaps entirely with the merits of Plaintiffs' claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Accordingly, the balance of the four factors weighs against Plaintiffs and the Court declines to issue a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ORDER\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   For the reasons provided in the accompanying Opinion, Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction (ECF No. 9) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    As of the date of this Opinion, Westlaw had not yet included page numbers to Judge Friedrich's decision.
