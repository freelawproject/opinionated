Among those that died in the assault was Marie Colvin (\"Colvin\"), an American war journalist hailed by many as the greatest war correspondent of her generation, who was there covering the war between the Syrian government and rebel groups. Compl. [Dkt. # 1] \u00b6\u00b6 1, 21, 53. In their complaint, plaintiffs assert that Colvin was the victim of a targeted government policy to surveil, capture, and even kill journalists to prevent reporting on the Syrian government's suppression of the political opposition.\n  <em>\n   Id.\n  </em>\n  \u00b6\u00b6 43, 47, 79. In a comprehensive intelligence gathering effort, the Syrian government discovered that foreign journalists were broadcasting reports from a Media Center in Baba Amr.\n  <em>\n   Id.\n  </em>\n  \u00b6\u00b6 63-64. When the Syrian military uncovered the location of the Media Center, it launched an artillery attack against it, for the purpose of killing the journalists inside.\n  <em>\n   Id.\n  </em>\n  \u00b6\u00b6 65-71. Colvin was killed, as was a French photographer, R\u00e9mi Ochlik.\n  <em>\n   Id.\n  </em>\n  \u00b6 68.

Now pending before the Court is plaintiffs' motion for default judgment. Because the Court finds that it has both personal and subject matter jurisdiction, and that plaintiffs have demonstrated with a satisfactory amount of evidence that Syria is liable for Colvin's death, the Court will grant plaintiffs' motion for default judgment and enter judgment in the amount of $ 302,511,836.00.\n </attorneys>\n <opinion id=\"p-9\">\n  <strong>\n   BACKGROUND\n  </strong>\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-10\">\n  This section details the factual background leading up to the attack and Marie Colvin's death.

While $ 150 million is the typical award per decedent, the Court must also consider the fact that Marie Colvin was a journalist who was killed by the Syrian government while reporting on the atrocities occurring during civil war. She was specifically targeted because of her profession, for the purpose of silencing those reporting on the growing opposition movement in the country. The Court agrees with plaintiffs that the murder of journalists acting in their professional capacity could have a chilling effect on reporting such events worldwide. Pls.' Mem. at 40. As the court observed in\n   <em>\n    Anderson v. Islamic Republic of Iran\n   </em>\n   , targeted attacks on journalists \"inhibit the\n   gathering and reporting of news\" in warzones and warrant punitive damages in order \"to vindicate the interest of society at-large in the collection and dissemination of complete and accurate information about world conflicts.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=90%20F.%20Supp.%202d%20107\">\n    90 F.Supp.2d 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 114 (D.D.C. 2000). By perpetrating a directed attack against the Media Center, Syria intended to intimidate journalists, inhibit newsgathering and the dissemination of information, and suppress dissent. A targeted murder of an American citizen, whose courageous work was not only important, but vital to our understanding of warzones and of wars generally, is outrageous, and therefore a punitive damages award that multiplies the impact on the responsible state is warranted. This is particularly true given that Syria itself carried out the attack - it did not fund a third-party terrorist organization to do so. Considering all these circumstances, this Court will award $ 300 million in punitive damages to plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   For the reasons outlined above, plaintiffs' motion for default judgment is granted.
