R. Crim. P. 12, because the charged offenses stem from an unconstitutional statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2285. Defendants contend that 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2285 exceeds the scope of Congress' enumerated power under Article I, section 8, clause 10 of the U.S. Constitution, and is void for vagueness in that the statute contains essential terms that are not adequately defined, as applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Government opposes Defendants' Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.

The Coast Guard launched a small boat to investigate. The Coast Guard boarded the vessel and conducted an investigation. Defendants were moved to the SENECA while the investigation was conducted; after the investigation Defendants were detained. When the Coast Guard boarded the vessel, the master made a\n   verbal claim of Colombian registry, with no supporting documentation. The government of Colombia neither confirmed nor denied the claim, rendering the vessel stateless. 46 U.S.C. Sec. 70507(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Part I of the \"Law Enforcement Case Package Checklist\" provides the following description of the vessel:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \"Other: ENGINES COMPLETELY COVERED WITH GRAY SPRAY PAINT.

Estupinan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046464\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/453/1336/#p1338\">\n    453 F.3d 1336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1338 (11th Cir. 2006). The Eleventh Circuit further explained that the MDLEA's extraterritorial reach was justified under the universal principle of international law, that a nation may pass laws to define and punish certain crimes considered to be of \"universal concern.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4089527\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/632/1203/\">\n    632 F.3d at 1210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Eleventh Circuit concluded that the DTVIA is also justified under the universal principle, and the exercise of Congress's power under the High Seas Clause is constitutional.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4089527\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/632/1203/\">\n    632 F.3d at 1210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Eleventh Circuit further noted that, in light of Congress's findings that the operation of submersible/semi-submersible vessels without nationality and on an international voyage is a serious international problem, facilitates transnational crime, including drug trafficking and terrorism, and presents a specific threat to the safety of maritime navigation and the security of the United States, the protective principle of international law provides an equally compelling reason to uphold the DTVIA. Under the protective principle, a nation \"may assert jurisdiction over a person whose conduct outside the nation's territory threatens the nation's security or could potentially interfere with the operation of its governmental functions.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Eleventh Circuit noted that those who engage in conduct the DTVIA targets threaten the security of the United States by evading detection while using submersible vessels to smuggle illegal drugs or other contraband, such as illegal weapons, from one country to another, and often into the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Eleventh Circuit further noted that United States Coast Guard reported to\n   Congress that semi-submersible vessels present an emerging and significant threat to maritime law enforcement in that such vessels are difficult to detect and easy to scuttle or sink. The Court noted that semi-submersible vessels facilitate the destruction of evidence and hinder prosecution of smuggling offenses. The Eleventh Circuit concluded that, based on the above significant threat to security, Congress acted properly and within its constitutional authority under the High Seas Clause in passing the DTVIA. The Eleventh Circuit declined to alter its previous conclusion, raised as a challenge to the MDLEA, as to the scope of Congress's power under the High Seas clause, in connection with a challenge to the DTVIA.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4089527\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/632/1203/\">\n    632 F.3d at 1211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As to\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Defendants argue that a nation's authority to seize a stateless vessel applies to the vessel, but not the crew, such that a nation's authority to seize a stateless vessel does not mean its courts can automatically hear cases involving the crew of the vessel. Defendants recognize that in\n   <em>\n    Ibarquen-Mosquera\n   </em>\n   , the Court considered jurisdiction under the objective principle, the protective principle, and the territorial principle of international law. Defendants argue that nothing in the presently charged statute links the crime to any international principle of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In response, the Government looks to the Findings and Declarations of Congress when constructing 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2285, and argues that, based on those findings, Congress determined to criminalize not only the underlying conduct-whatever that conduct may be-but also traveling on the vessel itself.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

While there is no reference to international law within the DTVIA, the DTVIA expressly provides that there is extraterritorial jurisdiction over an offense under this section. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2285(c). The DTVIA further provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    (g) Applicability of other provisions.--\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Sections 70504 and 70505 of title 46 apply to offenses under this section in the same manner as they apply to offenses under section 70503 of such title.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   46 U.S.C.

Sec. 70505 provides:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   A person charged with violating section 70503 of this title, or against whom a civil enforcement proceeding is brought under section 70508, does not have standing to raise a claim of failure to\n   comply with international law as a basis for a defense. A claim of failure to comply with international law in the enforcement of this chapter may be made only by a foreign nation. A failure to comply with international law does not divest a court of jurisdiction and is not a defense to a proceeding under this chapter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Court's consideration of concepts of international law is inherent in adjudication of offenses under the DTVIA. The Court is not persuaded that the protective principle does not apply to offenses under the DTVIA.

Terms: \"semi-submersible vessel\" and \"intent to evade detection\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Defendants contend that 18 U.S.C.

Sec. 2285 is void for vagueness as applied, because, although \"semi-submersible vessel\" is defined, there is no standard provided to limit the policing of the statute; the statute gives law enforcement unbridled discretion to determine whether any vessel is within the definition, without minimal objective guidelines. Defendants also argue that the term \"most\" is overly broad; it invites the exercise of unbridled discretion by law enforcement to arrest any vessel capable of operating with most of its hull and bulk under the surface of the water without providing notice of what percentage of the hull satisfies the term \"most,\" and whether such vessels are capable of riding with most of its hull and bulk under the surface of the water if laden with cargo or in rough seas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Defendants distinguish the analysis in\n   <em>\n    Ibarguen-Mosquera\n   </em>\n   , and argue that the vessel in this case operated far above the measurements in\n   <em>\n    Ibarguen-Mosquera\n   </em>\n   , (4 to 12 inches above the water; nearly completely underwater while moving.) Defendants argue that, in this case, the photographs of the vessel show that the vessel contained outboard motors and a considerable amount of the vessel is above the water. Defendants further argue that no contraband was found aboard the vessel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Defendants also argue that in this case, the vessel is not clearly covered by under the plain-English meaning of \"intent to evade\", and the relevant statutory subsections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Defendants further argue that the vessel in\n   <em>\n    Ibarguen-Mosquera\n   </em>\n   sat very low in the water, was painted ocean blue, and had no headlights or signals. In addition, the Coast Guard observed the path of the vessel to be surreptitious, and the defendants sank the vessel upon the arrival of the Coast Guard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Government responds that the term \"semi-submersible\" is not unduly vague.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The term \"most\" can be quantified; it means more than 50 percent, or, in the context of the burden of proof in a civil case, a preponderance. The term \"capable\" means to have the ability to do something, in plain English.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The Government responds that \"intent to evade detection\" has a plain English meaning, and is further defined by the presence of any indicia referenced in 46 U.S.C. 70507(b)(1)(A), (E), (F), (G) or (b)(4)-(6) as\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   evidence of this term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Government further notes that in this case, the \"low-profile go-fast vessel\" (\"LPGFV\") was first spotted by a marine patrol aircraft operating over eighty-five nautical miles west of Malpelo Island, Colombia, in international waters of the Eastern Pacific Ocean. A recording of the LPGFV shows the vessel was operating almost entirely below the water surface. 46 U.S.C. Sec. 70507(b)(1)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The vessel was green in color, a color commonly used by smugglers to blend in with the ocean. 46 U.S.C. Sec. 70507(b)(1)(F). The vessel had no navigational lights and was operating after nightfall. 46 U.S.C. Sec. 70507(b)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Inspection of the LPGFV revealed the vessel was constructed of fiberglass, which traffickers believe has less of a radar signature. 46 U.S.C. Sec. 70507(b)(1)(E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   When the LPGFV was boarded by members of the Coast Guard from the Coast Guard Cutter SENECA, the master made a verbal claim of Colombian registry for the LPGFV, with no supporting documentation. The government of Colombia could neither confirm nor deny this claim, rendering the vessel stateless. 46 U.S.C. Sec. 70507(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The reports and imagery of the LPGFV were reviewed by Coast Guard Investigative Service Special Agent Erik Holm, whose opinion further supports the Government's contention that the LPGFV was a \"semi-submersible vessel\" designed with \"intent to avoid detection.\".(Dkt. 45, pp. 4-7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   After consideration, he Court finds that the term \"semi-submersible vessel\" is adequately defined in the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   As to the \"intent to evade detection,\" the determination of this issue requires the evaluation of the various indicia, within the context of the totality of the circumstances. The fact that each indicia of the \"intent to evade detection\" may not be present in every case does not render the \"intent to evade detection\" vague.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   After consideration, the Court denies the Motion to Dismiss as to this issue. Accordingly, it is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendants' Motion to Dismiss (Dkt. 35) is\n   <strong>\n    denied.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    DONE and ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   in Chambers in Tampa, Florida on this\n   <em>\n    1ST\n   </em>\n   day of February, 2019.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
