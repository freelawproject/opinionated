Over time, the amount Mr. Couch was required to pay to keep the universal life insurance policy in effect increased, which Mr. Couch contends was contrary to the policy's terms. The policy ultimately lapsed, and Mr. Couch initiated this litigation in June 2018. He asserts claims against Wilco for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and declaratory judgment. Mr. Couch brings his claims on behalf of himself and a class of individuals who he claims have also been subjected to Wilco's impermissible practices. Wilco has filed a Motion to Dismiss all of Mr. Couch's claims, [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 20\n   </em>\n   ], and that motion is now ripe for the Court's review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Under Rule 12(b)(6), a party may move to dismiss a claim that does not state a right to relief.

[\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 13 at 3-4\n   </em>\n   .] Lamar subsequently sold the Policy to Wilco, or Lamar merged into or was acquired by Wilco or one of Wilco's predecessors. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 13 at 4\n   </em>\n   .] As a result, Wilco assumed all liability for the Policy as if it had originally been issued by Wilco. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 13 at 4\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Generally, universal life insurance policies:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   provide[ ] more flexibility than whole or term life insurance. Premium payments, which are variable, are deposited in an accumulation account from which monthly cost of insurance and expense charges are deducted. The accumulation account is credited with monthly interest at a nonguaranteed declared rate, but not less than the guaranteed interest rate specified in the policy. Universal life insurance policies generally allow policyholders to change the amount and frequency of premium payments as long as they make their planned periodic premium and their policy contains sufficient cash value to cover monthly deductions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 13 at 6-7\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Policy, which is attached as an exhibit to the Amended Complaint, includes numerous provisions which are relevant to this litigation, and are reproduced below:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 13-1 at 4-21\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Mr. Couch's Planned Premium when he purchased the Policy in 1987 was $ 81.00 per month, which was to be automatically deducted from his checking account. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 13 at 14\n   </em>\n   .] Wilco's agents assured\n   Mr. Couch that his premium would never increase and that the Policy would offer a death benefit and provide investment income in the form of guaranteed monthly interest. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 13 at 14-15\n   </em>\n   .] Instead, Wilco consistently raised Mr. Couch's premium and cost of insurance (\"\n   <em>\n    COI\n   </em>\n   \") rates far above the initial agreed-upon Planned Premium and to an amount Mr. Couch could no longer afford. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 13 at 15\n   </em>\n   .] By July 2018, Mr. Couch's premium had grown to $ 274.00. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 13 at 15\n   </em>\n   .] Instead of timely disclosing the premium increases, Wilco would take the increased costs from policyholders' cash value in their policies (\"\n   <em>\n    Accumulated Value\n   </em>\n   \"), deplete the Accumulated Value, and then send a letter informing policyholders that their two-month grace period had started and demanding payment to keep the policy in force. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 13 at 15\n   </em>\n   .] Mr. Couch's Policy ultimately lapsed and terminated without cash value, despite the fact that Mr. Couch dutifully paid premiums for several decades. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 13 at 15-16\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Mr. Couch alleges that Wilco raised its COI rates not because of material adverse changes in Wilco's relative risk of insurance, but for a number of other reasons including: (1) that Wilco suffered massive losses due to the self-dealing of its corporate parent, CNO Financial Group, Inc., and other affiliates; (2) litigation involving Wilco's insurance policies which have caused significant losses; (3) to offset the contractual interest payments it owes to policyholders and to recoup losses; and (4) to inflict massive shock lapses through the monthly COI rates and premium increases. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 13 at 16-28\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Mr. Couch filed his initial Complaint on June 11, 2018, and filed the operative Amended Complaint on June 21, 2018.

Charging More Than the Planned Premium\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Mr. Couch alleges in the Amended Complaint that the Policy does not permit Wilco to increase the Planned Premium or the Month's Deduction to an amount beyond\n   the Planned Premium. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 13 at 9\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Wilco contends that Mr. Couch's claim is based on the faulty premise that the Planned Premium is the amount required to sustain coverage under the Policy, but instead the Policy provides that when the Cash Surrender Value is not enough to cover the Month's Deduction, the Policy enters the Grace Period. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 21 at 21\n   </em>\n   .] Wilco distinguishes between \"Planned Premium\" and the Policy's use of the term \"Premium\" in the Grace Period provision. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 21 at 21\n   </em>\n   .] It argues that \"when Wilco...notified [Mr.] Couch that his Policy had entered a Grace Period and that he needed to pay additional 'Premium' to keep the Policy in force, Wilco...did not increase the Planned Premium. It simply notified [Mr.] Couch of the premium amount described in the Grace Period provision.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 21 at 21\n   </em>\n   .] Wilco argues that the Policy unambiguously allows it to request more than the Planned Premium to keep the Policy in force, and points to several Policy provisions which it argues \"make clear that the amount of Premium required to keep the Policy in force could be greater than the Planned Premium.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 21 at 21-23\n   </em>\n   .] Wilco explains that \"[a]s [Mr.] Couch admits, the applicable interest rate decreased substantially after he purchased the policy.... At the same time, the COI charge deducted from [Mr.] Couch's Accumulated Value increased because COI rates go up as the insured gets older.... Because [Mr.] Couch continued to pay the same Planned Premium, the Cash Surrender Value decreased until - as specified in the Grace Period provision - additional Premiums were required to cover the upcoming Month's Deduction.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 21 at 23-24\n   </em>\n   .] Wilco notes that the Annual Reports warn that the Planned Premium may not be enough to keep the Policy in force.

[\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 25 at 21-22\n   </em>\n   .] He asserts that the Grace Period provision can be read to mean that a policyholder only enters the\n   grace period if he or she has stopped paying premiums altogether or where there was an unpaid Policy Loan Balance. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 25 at 22\n   </em>\n   .] Mr. Couch also argues that Wilco's reliance on warnings in the annual reports is misplaced, as \"the Annual Report provision links the risk of insufficient Cash Surrender Value to an outstanding Policy Loan Balance and reinforces the understanding that, so long as a Policyholder pays Planned Premiums and avoids loans, the policy will remain in force.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 25 at 23\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In its reply, Wilco discusses Policy provisions which it contends show that the Planned Premiums were not the only amounts that policyholders would need to pay to keep the Policy in force. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 26 at 6-7\n   </em>\n   .] Wilco contends that Mr. Couch ignores other Policy provisions which require the policyholder to maintain the Accumulated Value to keep the Policy in force, so his reading of the Policy is not reasonable. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 26 at 7\n   </em>\n   .] Wilco notes that the Grace Period and Accumulated Value provisions do not only come into play if the policyholder stops paying premiums completely. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 26 at 7-8\n   </em>\n   .] It argues that Mr. Couch's own characterization of universal life insurance indicates that premiums are flexible, that the annual reports attached to the Amended Complaint warn that the current value of the Policy plus the Planned Premium may not be enough to keep the Policy in force, and that cases Mr. Couch cites in his response brief contradict his theory. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 26 at 9-11\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Policy contains several provisions relating to the Planned Premium. First, the Policy distinguishes between three types of \"Premiums\" - the Initial Premium, the Planned Premiums, and Unscheduled Premiums. [Filing No. 31-1 at 4.] \"Planned Premiums\" are defined as those that the insured intends to make on a regular basis, and the amount of the Planned Premium is chosen by the insured. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 13-1 at 4\n   </em>\n   .] The Policy provides, through several different provisions, that the Planned Premium may not be enough to keep the Policy in effect. These provisions, when given their plain meaning and read together, provide the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (1) 92.5% of Premiums paid each month, which include the Planned Premium and any unscheduled premiums the insured pays, are credited toward the Policy (the \"Gross and Net Premiums\" provision, [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 13-1 at 8\n   </em>\n   ] );\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (2) the Month's Deduction, which includes the COI among other things, pays the cost of the Policy for the previous month (the \"Month's Deduction\" provision, [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 13-1 at 9\n   </em>\n   ] );\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (3) the COI can change, but the rate may not exceed rates listed on the tables included in the Policy, and changes must be applied on a uniform basis for insureds with certain common characteristics (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , age at issuance of the Policy) (the \"Cost of Insurance Rate\" provision, [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 13-1 at 21\n   </em>\n   ] );\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (4) Net premiums, along with the Policy's Accumulated Value for the prior month and any interest credited, minus the Month's Deduction and prior Partial Cash Surrenders, make up the Policy's current Accumulated Value (\"How we calculate the Accumulated Value...(2) on a Monthly Anniversary,\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 13-1 at 10\n   </em>\n   ] );\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (5) the Cash Surrender Value is the Accumulated Value less a surrender charge (the \"Cash Surrender Value\" provision, [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 13-1 at 9\n   </em>\n   ] );\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (6) the Policy can enter a Grace Period when the Cash Surrender Value, minus the value of any Policy Loan Balance less unearned loan interest, on any Monthly Anniversary, is not enough to cover the Month's Deduction for the\n   next Policy Month (the \"Grace Period\" provision, [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 13-1 at 10\n   </em>\n   ) ]; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (7) insureds will receive an Annual Report at least once a year, which will warn them if the Cash Surrender Value plus Planned Premiums for the coming reporting period may not be sufficient to keep the Policy in effect until the end of the period (the \"Annual Report\" provision, [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 13-1 at 15\n   </em>\n   ] ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Applying the Alabama principles of contract interpretation noted above, the plain language of the Policy precludes any claim that Wilco could not increase the Planned Premium. The Planned Premium is an amount chosen by the insured and not Wilco, and the plain language precludes any claim that Wilco could not increase the Month's Deduction because that figure is dependent on the COI, which the Policy specifically states can change over time. Unlike other types of insurance policies such as automobile liability or homeowners insurance policies, where the term \"premium\" is commonly understood to be the amount an insured must pay to keep a policy in force, the Planned Premium for the Policy at issue here is just one piece of the puzzle. Because of the Policy's savings component, and because the COI increases as the insured gets older, the Policy clearly states that the Planned Premium may eventually not be enough to keep the Policy in effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   That is what happened here, and that precise scenario is contemplated by the Policy. Indeed, Wilco warned Mr. Couch of that possibility in several Annual Reports that Mr. Couch attaches to his Amended Complaint, and which he received long before the Policy ultimately terminated. [\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 13-2 at 3\n   </em>\n   (July 24, 2017 Annual Report stating \"NOTICE - THE CURRENT CASH VALUE, PLUS PLANNED PREMIUM PAYMENTS OF $ 81.00 MONTHLY, MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT AT THE GUARANTEED INTEREST RATES TO CONTINUE COVERAGE UNTIL THE NEXT POLICY ANNIVERSARY\");\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 13-2 at 7\n   </em>\n   (July 24, 2016 Annual Report containing same warning and stating that \"IF NO FURTHER PREMIUMS ARE RECEIVED, ASSUMING CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS, ON SEPTEMBER 24, 2017 YOUR POLICY WILL HAVE INSUFFICIENT VALUE TO REMAIN IN FORCE\").]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Mr. Couch's breach of contract claim based on Wilco increasing the Planned Premium or the Month's Deduction fails as a matter of law based on the plain language of the Policy, and Wilco's Motion to Dismiss as to that claim is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    2. Setting COI Rates Based on Impermissible Factors\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In his second breach of contract claim, Mr. Couch alleges that Wilco has \"depleted the accumulation account based on impermissible factors and in order to offset its interest obligations, recoup past losses, and ensure a large percentage of policyholders lapse on or surrender their policies.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 13 at 35\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Wilco argues in its Motion to Dismiss that COI rates did not increase during the time the Policy was in effect and that, while COI rates do increase as a policyholder gets older, the rates were always determined using the Policy's Table of Guaranteed Monthly Cost of Insurance Rates (the \"\n   <em>\n    Table\n   </em>\n   \"). [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 21 at 30\n   </em>\n   .] Wilco contends that Mr. Couch does not allege that Wilco ever charged in excess of the rates specified in the Table. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 21 at 30\n   </em>\n   .] Further, Wilco asserts that the Policy does not restrict or limit how Wilco sets COI rates, as long as those rates remain below the guaranteed maximum set forth in the Table. and that any change in the COI rate is applied on a uniform basis for insureds of the same age at issue, sex, risk class rating, duration, and specified\n   amount. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 21 at 31-34\n   </em>\n   .] Wilco notes that Mr. Couch does not allege \"that the supposed COI rate increase (assuming it occurred) was not implemented on a uniform basis across Insureds 'of the same Age at Issue, Sex, Risk Class Rating, Duration, and Specified Amount.' \" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 21 at 31\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In response, Mr. Couch argues that Wilco increased his COI rates from the time he purchased the Policy to the time the Policy terminated. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 25 at 28\n   </em>\n   .] Mr. Couch contends that Wilco argues that an increase in COI rates was acceptable because the rates were determined when the Policy was sold, but that \"Wilco's argument is premature and the policy's complex history calls for discovery to address Wilco's arguments.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 25 at 28\n   </em>\n   .] Mr. Couch notes that he has alleged that Wilco can only increase the COI rate based on increased mortality risk or \"the relative risk of insurance,\" and that this limitation is consistent with several Policy provisions. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 25 at 28-29\n   </em>\n   .] He asserts that the Policy provisions \"when read together (as they must), only allow Wilco to increase the COI Rate to account for a policyholder's increased mortality risk, not Wilco's profitability.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 25 at 30\n   </em>\n   .] Mr. Couch argues that he has adequately alleged a breach of contract claim because he \"carefully details that Wilco increased COI rates for a number of reasons that violate the Policy.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 25 at 34\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In its reply, Wilco argues that an increase in the amount Wilco deducted from Mr. Couch's cash value \"does not in any way indicate an increase in the COI rate scale established at the pricing of [the] Policy. Even without any change in the COI rate scale, [Mr.] Couch's Monthly Deduction was guaranteed to increase each year because the COI rate used to calculate the Monthly Deduction goes up each year as the policyholder ages and becomes riskier to insure.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 26 at 13\n   </em>\n   (emphasis omitted).] Wilco asserts that the annual statements attached to Mr. Couch's Amended Complaint show that \"the lapse of [the] Policy was consistent with normal operation of [the] Policy, and inconsistent with the alleged increase in the COI rate scale.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 26 at 14\n   </em>\n   .] Finally, Wilco argues that even if it raised COI rates, Mr. Couch has not plausibly alleged that the decision to raise COI rates was somehow connected to impermissible factors. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 26 at 17-19\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Again, the Court turns to the Policy's language. The Policy provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   The COST OF INSURANCE RATE is the amount charged monthly per $ 1,000 of Net Amount at Risk. We guarantee a maximum Cost of Insurance Rate for each Sex, Attained Age, and Risk Class Rating. Some tables of these guaranteed maximum Cost of Insurance Rates are found in the Section entitled \"XI APPENDIX 2.\" These rates are listed for various table ratings.... Any change in the monthly Cost of Insurance Rate will be applied on a uniform basis for Insureds of the same Age at Issue, Sex, Risk Class Rating, Duration and Specified Amount.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 13-1 at 21\n   </em>\n   .] The COI provision refers to the Table, which sets forth the monthly COI \"Per $ 1000 of Net Amount at Risk.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 13-1 at 22-23\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Policy promises two things related to COI: (1) the COI rate for each sex, age, and Risk Class Rating will not exceed the rates in the Table; and (2) any change will be applied on a uniform basis for insureds of the same age at issue, sex, Risk Class Rating, duration and specified amount. Mr. Couch does not allege that Wilco breached the Policy by failing to perform on either of those two promises. He does not allege that the COI he was charged ever exceeded the rates in the Table, nor does he\n   allege that any change in COI was not applied on a uniform basis. Instead, Mr. Couch argues that the Policy promises a third thing: that Wilco would determine the COI\n   <em>\n    based on\n   </em>\n   the policyholder's age, sex, and Risk Class Rating - all factors that are tied to an insured's mortality. But the Policy does not make such a promise. The COI provision does not include the \"based on\" language that Mr. Couch reads into it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Mr. Couch's reliance on other Policy provisions to support his reading of the COI provision is unavailing. First, he argues that the \"Risk Class Rating\" provision \"relate[s]...to a policyholder's mortality risk\" and \"specifically reflects a policyholder's 'relative risk of insurance.' \" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 25 at 29\n   </em>\n   .] But simply including Risk Class Rating in the list of characteristics reflected in the COI rates set forth in the Table does not lead to the conclusion that mortality is the only consideration for determining the COI. Second, Mr. Couch argues that the Policy's guaranteed values \"are based on projections of lifespan established [in the Table], including 'the cost of insurance on a guaranteed basis,' 'minimum Accumulated Values,' 'minimum Cash Surrender Values,' and 'reserves for future benefits.' \" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 25 at 29\n   </em>\n   .] He does not expand on his argument, and the Court fails to see how this shows that Wilco was limited to considering mortality when determining COI. Third, Mr. Couch asserts that because the Month's Deduction includes a $ 4.00 Policy fee and Wilco retains 7.5% of a policyholder's Gross Premiums, \"[p]resumably, Wilco takes a fixed portion of a policyholder's Gross Premiums and a Policy Fee to account for factors outside of a policyholder's mortality risk.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 25 at 30\n   </em>\n   .] Again, this argument does not support Mr. Couch's reading of the COI provision, and is speculative at best. Finally, Mr. Couch argues that Wilco's reading of the COI would render the Policy's interest provision - which guarantees a minimum interest rate of 4.5% per annum, compounded annually - meaningless and that the interest provision and the COI provision \"operate independently of one another, thereby precluding Wilco from offsetting or subsidizing its interest obligations by increasing the [COI] Rate.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 25 at 30\n   </em>\n   .] The plain language of the interest provision and the COI provision does not support the interplay between the two provisions that Mr. Couch advocates. Indeed, as discussed above, the Policy's language contemplates that the COI may change over time, as the policyholder gets older. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 13-1 at 21\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Further, most of the cases Mr. Couch relies upon involved different policy language and specifically set forth the factors the insurer could consider when setting the rates at issue.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vogt v.

Moreover, even if the provision did contain such language, Mr. Couch's claim still would not be viable. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals has determined that where a COI provision lists factors that the insurer will consider, the insurer is not limited to considering only the factors listed.

Declaring that [Wilco] breached the contract there 'add[s] nothing of substance to this case.' \" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 21 at 38\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In response, Mr. Couch argues that \"courts generally refuse to dismiss claims for declaratory relief despite arguments, like the one made by Wilco here, that the claim duplicates a claim for breach of contract.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 25 at 37\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In its reply, Wilco asserts that \"[a]ll of [Mr.] Couch's requested declarations live or die based on the finding of a breach. Because he has failed to allege an actionable breach of contract, he has failed to allege entitlement to the declaratory relief he seeks.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 26 at 20\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Declaratory Judgment Act states that \"[i]n a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction...any court of the United States, upon the filing of an appropriate pleading, may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Even if a declaratory judgment action is within its jurisdiction, \"the federal courts have discretion to decline to hear [it].\"\n   <em>\n    Tempco Elec. Heater Corp. v.

Courts commonly exercise their discretion and dismiss declaratory judgment claims where they are duplicative of breach of contract claims.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cliffs Mining Co. v.

Mr. Couch's first request - that the Court declare the parties' rights under the policies - is essentially moot since the Policy has lapsed. His second request - that the Court declare the premium and COI rate increases to be unlawful and in material breach of the Policy's terms and that Wilco may determine the COI rates only on the grounds authorized under the Policy - is duplicative of Mr. Couch's breach of contract claims. Accordingly, because of its duplicative nature, the Court exercises it discretion and\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Wilco's Motion to Dismiss as to Mr. Couch's declaratory judgment claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sweet v.

Consequently, his claims fail as a matter of law and the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Wilco's Motion to Dismiss, [20], and dismisses all of Mr. Couch's claims with prejudice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Claims of any putative class member are dismissed without prejudic. Final judgment will enter accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Wilco also presents documents which it argues indicate that Mr. Wilco made a Partial Cash Surrender of $ 2,400 from the Policy's Accumulated Value of $ 4,166.55, contends that \"[Mr.] Couch cannot credibly argue that he believed his Planned Premium would be sufficient to maintain his Policy when he withdrew approximately 58% of the Accumulated Value in 1993,\" and attaches a Statement of Policy Costs and Benefit Information that it argues provided notice to Mr. Couch that additional premiums might be needed.

R. Civ. P. 10(c) (\"A copy of a written instrument that is an exhibit to a pleading is a part of the pleading for all purposes\"). The documents attached to Wilco's brief are not central to Mr. Couch's claims, and the Court will not consider them at the motion to dismiss stage.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    One case cited by Mr. Couch,\n    <em>\n     McMahon v. Transamerica Life Ins. Co.\n    </em>\n    , involved policy language which stated that the insurer \"will determine the monthly deduction rate for each policy year at the beginning of that year\" and that the monthly deduction rate would not exceed rates set forth in a table.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203381406\">\n     2018 WL 3381406\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , *3 (N.D. Ia. 2018). The court denied the insurer's motion to dismiss the plaintiff's breach of contract claim related to the insurer basing the monthly deduction rate on impermissible factors, finding that \"[i]t is apparent from the face of the contract that Transamerica cannot consider its past losses in exercising its discretion to set the [monthly deduction rate], and it is plausible that there are other limitations on its exercise of discretion.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *7. While the policy language at issue in\n    <em>\n     McMahon\n    </em>\n    is similar to the language at issue here, this Court is not bound by the\n    <em>\n     McMahon\n    </em>\n    court's decision and finds its analysis unpersuasive, particularly in light of Seventh Circuit precedent to the contrary.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Mr. Couch argues that dismissal of his breach of contract claim related to increasing the COI rate based on impermissible factors is \"premature\" and that \"the policy's complex history calls for discovery to address Wilco's arguments.\" [\n    <em>\n     Filing No. 25 at 28\n    </em>\n    .] But dismissal is not premature where the plain language of the Policy precludes Mr. Couch's claim. In that sense, a motion to dismiss in the breach of contract context becomes similar to a motion for summary judgment. Where Mr. Couch's allegations and the Policy make clear that Mr. Couch's claim fails as a matter of law, dismissal is warranted.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(1)(B), a plaintiff may amend his complaint once as a matter of course in response to a motion to dismiss.\n    <em>\n     Brown v. Bowman\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%201296274\">\n     2011 WL 1296274\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , *16 (N.D. Ind. 2011). The 2009 notes to that rule emphasize that this amendment \"will force the pleader to consider carefully and promptly the wisdom of amending to meet the arguments in the motion. A responsive amendment may avoid the need to decide the motion or reduce the number of issues to be decided, and will expedite determination of issues that otherwise might be raised seriatim.\" Mr. Couch chose not to exercise his right to amend his Amended Complaint pursuant to Rule 15(a)(1)(B) in response to Wilco's Motion to Dismiss but, instead, chose to brief the motion and adjudicate the issues. The Court is not required to give Mr. Couch another chance to plead his claims because he has already had an opportunity to cure deficiencies in his pleadings.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Emery v. American General Finance, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11591569\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/134/1321/#p1323\">\n     134 F.3d 1321\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1323 (7th Cir. 1998). Further, given the plain language of the contract, there is no indication that he could, in fact, successfully amend his Amended Complaint to cure the defects identified above, even if given the opportunity to do so. Consequently, the Court, in its discretion, dismisses Mr. Couch's claims with prejudice.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
