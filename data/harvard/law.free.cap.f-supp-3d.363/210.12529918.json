(\"Defendants\") alleging improper classification as independent contractors and violations of state wage laws. On September 7, 2018, Defendants removed the action to this Court for the second time. Subsequently, Plaintiff filed this motion to remand the action back to state court. (Docket No. 13). For the reasons stated below, Plaintiff's motion is\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      denied\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Background\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 28, 2017, Plaintiff filed a Complaint in Worcester Superior Court against Defendants alleging that Defendants misclassified class members as independent contractors in violation of the Massachusetts Independent Contractor Law, Mass. Gen. L. c. 149 \u00a7 150, (Count I), that Defendants required class members to bear business expenses necessary to perform their work in violation of the Wage Act, Mass Gen. L. c. 149 \u00a7 148, (Count II), and that Defendants failed to ensure that class members were paid at least minimum wage in violation of the Massachusetts Minimum Wage Law, Mass. Gen. L. c. 151 \u00a7\u00a7 1, 7, (Count III).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 29, 2017, Defendants removed to this Court pursuant to the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (\"CAFA\") alleging that the proposed class members exceeded 100 individuals, and the amount in controversy exceeded $ 5 million in the aggregate. Alternatively, Defendants argued that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   provided another basis for removal since Plaintiff and Defendants are diverse and the amount in controversy exceeds $ 75,000. On November 1, 2017, Plaintiff moved to remand to state court. On August 28, 2018, this Court granted Plaintiff's motion concluding that Defendants had not met the amount in controversy requirements of either CAFA or Section 1332.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Waithaka v.

In that case, it was not clear from the face of the plaintiff's complaint whether the amount in controversy was sufficient to confer CAFA jurisdiction, so the defendant removed after conducting its own internal investigation. In allowing the defendant to remove, the court noted, \"[i]t would be odd, even perverse, to prevent removal in this case, and we see nothing in the text of \u00a7\u00a7 1441 and 1446 to require such a result.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058807\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/720/1121/#p1125\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    I agree that, in addition to the troubling practical consequences that would result from holding otherwise, the most natural reading of the statutes is that they do not forbid a defendant from removing outside of the two thirty-day periods on the basis of its own information, so long as it did not allow a thirty-day deadline to lapse following a triggering event.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    Indeed, several courts have reached the same conclusion, including two additional circuit courts.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Cutrone v.

Mass. Oct. 30, 2014) (\"The reasoning applied by [the\n    <em>\n     Roth\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Cutrone\n    </em>\n    , and\n    <em>\n     Walker\n    </em>\n    courts] is persuasive, and is at least partially driven by the same policy considerations discussed by the First Circuit in\n    <em>\n     Romulus\n    </em>\n    .\"). I find, therefore, that although there has been no triggering event, Defendants may remove based on their own information.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    Consequently, I must address the second issue: whether this is a situation where successive removal attempts are permissible. The First Circuit has held that \"[s]uccessive attempts at removal are permissible where the grounds for removal become apparent only later in the litigation.\"\n    <em>\n     Amoche\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3329287\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/556/41/#p49\">\n     556 F.3d at 53\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    Defendants contend that not only did the grounds only become apparent later in the litigation, they did not exist until later. It follows, according to Defendants, that removal must be permissible.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Amoche\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3329287\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/556/41/#p49\">\n     556 F.3d at 51\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (noting that \"a court's analysis of the amount in controversy focuses on whether a removing defendant has shown a reasonable probability that more than $ 5 million is in controversy\n    <em>\n     at the time of removal\n    </em>\n    .\" (emphasis in original) ). Plaintiff contends, on the other hand, that successive removal should only be permissible when new information has become apparent to Defendants. According to Plaintiff, no such new information has been revealed and Defendants' tactical delays have resulted in greater damages that now satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Waters v.

Cal. Apr. 4, 2018) (\"[C]ontinued accrual of putative damages does not constitute a change in circumstances that entitles Koh's to successive removal.\").

In that case, \"the litigation had not developed to a stage where [the defendant] ha[d] shown that the requirements for federal jurisdiction were met under CAFA.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3329287\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/556/41/#p49\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Therefore, the court concluded that it was \"not unfair that [the defendant] wait until the class allegations are more fully developed before attempting to remove, if there is a later basis for removal, especially now that the class actions under CAFA are exempt from the removal statute's one-year time limit.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3329287\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/556/41/#p49\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    Here, after the first attempted removal, Defendants undertook a second investigation of their records which revealed \"between October 2017 and September 2018, the number of independent contractors providing services through the Amazon Flex program had tripled. Combined, these independent contractors had driven nearly\n    <em>\n     six\n    </em>\n    times the number of miles that had been driven as of October 2017 when the First Notice of Removal was filed.\" (Docket No. 17, at 4) (emphasis in original). Consequently, the increase in mileage resulted in a higher amount in controversy, which Plaintiff does not dispute is now above the $ 5 million threshold. Just like the defendant in\n    <em>\n     Amoche\n    </em>\n    , Defendants' first removal attempt was reasonable since the thirty-day clock potentially began to run. As a result of Defendants' subsequent investigations, they demonstrated that the requirements for CAFA jurisdiction are clearly met and this only became apparent after the first removal attempt since the Flex program grew in the interim. Consequently, Defendants have satisfied the requirements for successive removal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    <em>\n     <strong>\n      Conclusion\n     </strong>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    For the reasons stated above, Plaintiff's motion (Docket No. 13) is\n    <em>\n     <strong>\n      <em>\n       denied\n      </em>\n     </strong>\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    <strong>\n     SO ORDERED\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"1\">\n    <p id=\"p-38\">\n     It is unclear, however, whether prohibiting this sort of successive removal would resolve the problem that Plaintiff identifies because Defendants would be placed in the difficult position of choosing the best moment to remove. On the one hand, they might attempt to remove early in the litigation despite an ambiguous amount in controversy for fear that a Section 1446 triggering condition had been met. On the other hand, defendants might be incentivized to wait until they were certain that damages were greater than $ 5 million. If defendants decide that waiting is the better approach, they would forego early (and if successful efficient) attempts at removal.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
