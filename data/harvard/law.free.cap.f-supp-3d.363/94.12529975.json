Circuit reversed and remanded, finding that the regulation was a content-based\n   speech ban.\n   <em>\n    PAG II\n   </em>\n   , 831 F.3d at 512. It explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   On its face, section 102.14 draws distinctions based solely on what PAG says. As an unauthorized committee, PAG can use a candidate's name in a title of a communication only if the title demonstrates opposition to the candidate. In other words, to know whether to apply section 102.14, the FEC must examine the content of the title of PAG's website or Facebook page and ask whether the title supports or opposes the candidate. That is content-based discrimination pure and simple.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 509. (quotation marks and citations omitted). The Court further found that \"[b]ecause section 102.14(a) restricts political speech based on its content, the FEC may enforce the regulation only if it passes strict scrutiny.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 510.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In analyzing the first strict scrutiny requirement-that the law advances a compelling governmental interest-the Court of Appeals stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   We assume that the government has a compelling interest in avoiding the type of voter confusion identified by the FEC. Here, the FEC reasonably fears that voters might mistakenly believe an unauthorized committee's activities are actually approved by a candidate if the committee uses the candidate's name in its title.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted). However, the Court found that the regulation likely failed the second strict scrutiny requirement-that the law is narrowly tailored-because there was \"a substantial likelihood that section 102.14 [was] not the least restrictive means to achieve the government's interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Narrow tailoring requires that \"[i]f a less restrictive alternative for achieving that interest exists, the government must use that alternative.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quotation marks and citation omitted). As the Court of Appeals noted, \"the FEC could require a large disclaimer at the top of the websites and social media pages of unauthorized committees that declares, 'This Website Is Not Candidate Doe's Official Website.' The Supreme Court regularly views such disclosure requirements as less restrictive alternatives to 'flat bans' on speech.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted). The Court of Appeals found \"no evidence that larger or differently worded disclosures would be less effective at curing fraud or abuse than a ban on speech\" and that \"the FEC [did not] make an effort to explain why such disclosures would be more burdensome.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 511.

The interests advanced by Tennessee obviously are compelling ones. This Court has recognized that the right to vote freely for the candidate of one's choice is of the essence of a democratic society. Indeed, no right is more precious in a free country than that of having a voice in the election of those who make the laws under which, as good citizens, we must live.

The almost limitless statute in\n   <em>\n    McIntyre\n   </em>\n   is not comparable to a regulation designed to prevent a demonstrated type of voter confusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Regulation Is Not Narrowly Tailored\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    PAG II\n   </em>\n   the D.C. Circuit held that because the FEC had \"not shown that its speech ban is the least restrictive means of achieving the government's interest, there is a substantial likelihood that section 102.14 fails strict scrutiny and violates the First Amendment as applied to PAG.\"\n   <em>\n    PAG II\n   </em>\n   , 831 F.3d at 511. The Circuit found that \"[t]he FEC offered no evidence that larger or differently worded disclosures would be less effective at curing fraud or abuse than a ban on speech.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 510-11. Therefore, the decisive question is whether the FEC has sufficiently expanded the record, beyond what it presented to the Court of Appeals, with evidence demonstrating that such disclosures would be a less effective or more burdensome alternative to \u00a7 102.14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   PAG has proposed two examples of additional or different disclosure requirements. First, PAG suggests \"an additional disclaimer at the top of a website (in addition to the 'paid for by' and 'not authorized by any candidate or candidate's committee' disclaimers required at the bottom of the website) declaring: 'This Website Is Not Candidate Doe's Official Website.' \" Pl. Mot. at 31 (citations omitted). Alternatively, PAG points to amici's proposal during litigation before the Court of Appeals that \"the FEC could require that an unauthorized committee's use of a candidate's name must clearly indicate it is a third party.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In claiming that it has successfully expanded the record, the FEC points out that during the rulemaking: 1) a national committee observed that a disclaimer would have to be large to be effective; 2) one Commissioner expressed concern that some disclaimers could be effectively buried; and 3) Commission staff warned that requiring a larger disclosure might upset the regulated community by telling them \"how to draft [their] letters.\" Def. Mot. at 32. These observations are anecdotal, not based on empirical evidence, and simply speculate about potential problems rather than analyze whether the proposed procedures would be feasible and/or effective. Moreover, a concern that some political parties or candidates might object to disclosures does not constitute evidence that those disclosures would be ineffective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The FEC also notes that the Commission agreed with its staff that larger disclaimers \" 'could be more burdensome ... while still not solving the potential for fraud and abuse in this area.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting 1994 Explanation &amp; Justification,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=59%20Fed.%20Reg.%2017%2C267\">\n    59 Fed. Reg. at 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,268 ). However, the FEC has not shown that these conclusions were based on any actual evidence or study of larger and different disclosures. In addition to the rulemaking evidence, the FEC identifies several instances in which some disclaimers failed to prevent viewer confusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=59%20Fed.%20Reg.%2017%2C267\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=59%20Fed.%20Reg.%2017%2C267\">\n    at 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But even if true, such isolated, anecdotal evidence is insufficient for the FEC to carry its burden. \"[T]he FEC must present more than anecdote and supposition to support a regulation subject to strict scrutiny.\"\n   <em>\n    PAG II\n   </em>\n   , 831 F.3d at 511 (quotation marks and citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The FEC cannot offset its failure to present evidence that its regulation is the least restrictive means of achieving the government's interest by relying on \"common sense\" to demonstrate that different or additional disclosures would not effectively prevent confusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mot. at 30 (arguing that \"the Commission may rely on 'common sense' and need not 'empirically' prove that the regulation advances its compelling interest\"). The role of common sense in this context is more limited than the FEC supposes. As the D.C. Circuit has explained, common sense\n   is useful in showing the validity of \"unprovable assumptions\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Furthermore, while [i]t is true that in some First Amendment cases the Supreme Court has demanded an evidentiary showing in support of a state's law, [i]t is also true that in other First Amendment cases the Supreme Court has found various unprovable assumptions sufficient to support the constitutionality of state and federal laws.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Ass'n of Mfrs. v.
