Parole does not constitute admission in a valid immigration or nonimmigrant status, but it allows a foreign national to enter and physically be present in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In 2014, the government instituted a program called the Central American Minors (\"CAM\") Program, which allowed parents who were lawfully present in the United States to apply to bring their children and other qualifying family members in three countries - Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador, collectively known as the \"Northern Triangle\" - to reunite with them in the United States. A goal of the Program was to discourage children from making the long and dangerous journey from the Northern Triangle to the United States to try to reunite with their parents; the Program sought to achieve this goal by allowing applicant parents to apply for their beneficiary children while their children remained in their original countries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The CAM Program had two components: a refugee component and a parole component. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\"), an agency within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"), first evaluated beneficiaries to see if they qualified for refugee status (which, among other things, requires persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution \"on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion\"). If the beneficiaries qualified, USCIS referred them for approval as refugees under the CAM Refugee Program. If they did not qualify, USCIS automatically considered them for parole into the United States under the CAM Parole Program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   By the end of 2016, USCIS had interviewed over 5,500 beneficiaries. It approved 99% for either refugee resettlement or parole under the CAM Program: it approved approximately 30% interviewed beneficiaries as refugees and approximately 99% of the remaining beneficiaries (69% out of 70%) for parole. Over 1,335 beneficiaries arrived in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In January 2017, following a change in presidential administrations, incoming president Donald Trump issued an Executive Order that (among other things) directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to \"take all appropriate action\" to ensure that DHS exercised its parole authority \"only on a case-by-case basis\" and \"only when an individual demonstrates urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit derived from such parole.\" DHS stopped processing CAM Program applications - including the applications for beneficiaries who had been conditionally approved for parole and were awaiting processing to finalize their arrangements to travel to the United States - and began a review of the CAM Parole Program. In August 2017, DHS announced that it was terminating the CAM Parole Program. It also announced that it was rescinding parole for the approximately 2,700 beneficiaries who had been conditionally approved for parole but who had not yet traveled to the United States.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   It stated that those individuals,\n   and other individuals who wanted to apply for parole, could still do so independent of the CAM Parole Program but that it would no longer award parole through the Program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The plaintiffs in this case - applicant parents lawfully residing in the United States who applied to the CAM Program, their beneficiary children in Northern Triangle countries, and the nonprofit immigrant-rights organization CASA - filed this putative class-action lawsuit against President Trump, DHS, USCIS, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of USCIS, the State Department, the Secretary of State, and the United States, alleging that the government's termination of the CAM Parole Program and its rescinding of conditional approvals of parole were unlawful. The plaintiffs bring the following four categories of claims:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   1. claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), arguing that the government's termination of the CAM Parole Program and rescinding of conditional approvals for parole were arbitrary and capricious,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   2. a claim under the Due Process Clause, arguing that the applicant-parent plaintiffs have a constitutionally protected liberty interest in the companionship and society of their family members in Central America, and that the government deprived them of this liberty interest without due process by terminating the CAM Parole Program in an arbitrary, irrational, and unlawful manner,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   3. a claim under the equal-protection component of the Due Process Clause, arguing that the government's termination of the CAM Parole Program was substantially motivated by discriminatory animus by President Trump and the Trump Administration toward Latinos, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   4. a claim for equitable estoppel, arguing that the government engaged in affirmative misconduct by publicly representing between January 2017 and August 2017 that the CAM Parole Program was still in operation, when it actually had been secretly terminated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The putative class is all applicants and beneficiaries who applied for the CAM Program before August 16, 2017, who were denied refugee status under the CAM Refugee Program, and who then were denied parole under the CAM Parole Program due to its termination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction (1) enjoining the government from terminating the CAM Parole Program and (2) requiring the government to reinstate the conditional approvals of parole that were rescinded pursuant to that termination. The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   This order addresses the defendants' motion to dismiss. (The court will address the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction in a separate order.) The court denies the motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' APA claims as they relate to the government's mass-rescinding conditional approvals of parole made under the CAM Parole Program. In all other respects, the court grants the defendants' motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

The DACA courts that have held that DHS's attempts to terminate DACA were arbitrary and capricious did so in large part because DHS tried to blame the courts for its decision instead of assuming responsibility and accountability itself. As the Ninth Circuit explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-293\">\n   [P]ublic accountability for agency action can only be achieved if the electorate knows how to apportion the praise for good measures and the blame for bad ones.

When an agency justifies an action solely with an assertion that the law prohibits any other course, it shifts responsibility for the outcome from the Executive Branch to Congress (for making the law in question) or the courts (for construing it). If the Executive is correct in its interpretation of the law, then the public is correct to blame the other two branches for any resulting problems. But if the Executive is wrong, then it avoids democratic accountability for a choice that was the agency's to make all along.... \"[A]n official cannot claim that the law ties her hands while at the same time denying the courts' power to unbind her.

Order 13,767, 82 Fed. Reg. at 8795. Secretary Kelly similarly memorialized that DHS policy's views were that \"[t]he practice of granting parole to certain aliens in pre-designated categories in order to create immigration programs not established by Congress, has contributed to a border security crisis, undermined the integrity of the immigration laws and the parole process, and created an incentive for additional illegal immigration.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    107\n   </footnotemark>\n   The government recognized that it was changing policy qua policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    108\n   </footnotemark>\n   The issue that was present in the DACA cases - trying to shift responsibility to the courts for the decision to rescind a popular program instead of the agency itself claiming responsibility - is not present in the same way here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-297\">\n   Another factor that distinguishes this case from the DACA cases is that (in the opinion of many DACA courts), the government's legal assessment and analyses of DACA were wrong as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    Regents III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519171\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/908/476/\">\n    908 F.3d at 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[B]ecause\n   the Acting Secretary [of Homeland Security] was ... incorrect in her belief that DACA was illegal and had to be rescinded, plaintiffs are likely to succeed in demonstrating that the rescission must be set aside.\");\n   <em>\n    Batalla Vidal II\n   </em>\n   , 279 F.Supp.3d at 420-27 (\"To the extent the decision to end the DACA program was based on the Attorney General's determination that the program is unconstitutional, that determination was legally erroneous, and the decision was therefore arbitrary and capricious....

Program participants who received conditional approvals of parole (and made arrangements based on those approvals) had more serious reliance interests than individuals who never received approvals. The court holds that DHS's failure to take into account and address those more serious reliance interests when it mass-rescinded parole for those participants was arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-327\">\n   The government first argues that those participants do not have reliance interests because their parole approvals were only \"conditional.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    124\n   </footnotemark>\n   But as the plaintiffs plead in their complaint and as the administrative record confirms, the only steps following conditional approval to travel to the United States and be fully paroled were nondiscretionary ones: the completion of a medical exam, final security checks, and making travel arrangements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    125\n   </footnotemark>\n   (By contrast, participants who had never been approved were subject to discretionary decisions.) This distinction means that CAM Parole Program participants with approved applications for parole had \"serious reliance interests.\" The government argues that the Secretary of Homeland Security retained discretion to rescind parole for participants who had conditionally approval.\n   <footnotemark>\n    126\n   </footnotemark>\n   But that does not mean that participants with approval had no reliance interests in their parole.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Batalla Vidal II\n   </em>\n   , 279 F.Supp.3d at 432 (while DHS could in its discretion rescind DACA at any time,\"it\n   does not follow that [beneficiaries] had no\n   <em>\n    reliance\n   </em>\n   interests therein, such that Defendants were free to end the DACA program without considering such interests\") (emphasis in original) (citing\n   <em>\n    Encino Motorcars\n   </em>\n   , 136 S.Ct. at 2124-26 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-328\">\n   The government next argues that it took reliance interests into account because it did not rescind parole for beneficiaries who had arrived in the United States.\n   <footnotemark>\n    127\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court cannot see how this decision for beneficiaries in the United States takes into account the serious reliance interests of participants with conditional approval who had not arrived or whose family members had not arrived in the United States. The government also argues that it considered reliance interests when it offered to refund fees that participants paid for medical examinations and plane tickets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    128\n   </footnotemark>\n   This does not address the participants' reliance interests in the parole approvals. It also does not adequately address the fees paid because the government offered refunds only for medical exams that were not completed but did not offer refunds for exams that were completed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    129\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-329\">\n   The court holds that when DHS mass-rescinded the conditional parole approvals of CAM Parole Program participants, it did not adequately take into account and address the participants' serious reliance interests. Consequently, its actions in mass-rescinding approvals were arbitrary and capricious and must be set aside under the APA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-330\">\n   The \"serious reliance interests\" requirement does not mean that DHS lacks the authority to rescind conditional approvals of parole for CAM Parole Program participants, notwithstanding the participants' reliance on their approvals. DHS has that authority. It has the authority to rescind parole even from Program beneficiaries who have arrived in the United States and similarly has the authority to rescind conditional approvals of applications where the beneficiaries are still outside the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(5)(A). But DHS must recognize and acknowledge that Program participants who were approved for parole had serious reliance interests in that parole, take those reliance interests into account, and explain why it felt it appropriate to nonetheless mass-rescind their parole in the face of that reliance. This ensures transparency and accountability. If DHS thinks that Program participants' reliance on their parole is less important than its new policies in mass-rescinding that parole, it can make that choice, so long as it explains its reasons so that it can be held accountable.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NAACP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524134\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/209/#p237\">\n    298 F.Supp.3d at 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the government must explain its actions so that \"members of the public know how their elected officials have used their enforcement powers, and they can hold those officials accountable by speaking out, by petitioning their representatives, or ultimately at the ballot box\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-331\">\n   When it mass-rescinded conditional approvals, DHS failed to take into account and address the serious reliance interests of CAM Parole Program participants whom it had approved.

We will: \u2022 Perform final security checks, \u2022 Ensure your medical exam results remain valid until date of travel, and \u2022 Verify that your relative in the United States still has a qualifying legal presence in the United States. If we decide that you have met all requirements for parole under this program, we will issue for you a Form I-512L, Authorization for Parole of an Alien Into the United States.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"126\">\n   <p id=\"p-492\">\n    Defs.
