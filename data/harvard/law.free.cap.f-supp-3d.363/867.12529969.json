Derek's sister, Arlene Love, the administrator of his estate, filed this case against the Defendant Officers and the City of Chicago. In her first amended complaint, she brings wrongful death and survival claims for willful and wanton conduct against the Defendant Officers and the City (Counts I-VIII). She also raises federal claims for excessive force against the Defendant Officers (Count IX) and\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claims against the City for failure to train and investigate, and for the perpetuation of a code of silence (Counts X and XI). The City moves to dismiss the claims for willful and wanton conduct raised against it in Counts I and II of the first amended complaint. It also asks the Court to bifurcate the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claims (Counts X and XI) and stay\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   discovery. The Court concludes that the independent state law claims against the City are not duplicative based on the City's acknowledgment of\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   liability and that the first amended complaint does not reveal a basis for finding immunity. Further, in part because these state law claims, which are based on\n   some of the same allegations underlying Love's\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim, can proceed, the Court does not find bifurcation of the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claims appropriate at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 21, 2016, Derek stopped in the Battle of Fort Dearborn Park on his way home from his mother's house. He had with him a Nike bag, which contained several unopened cans of beer, a cell phone, a computer tablet, his identification, and some items he had just purchased from a store. Derek sat down on a bench in the park and began talking on his cell phone. An individual approached the Defendant Officers, who were on bike patrol in the park, and told them Derek was \"acting suspiciously.\" Doc. 1-1 \u00b6 22. The Defendant Officers then encircled Derek and asked him about his presence in the park. When Derek began walking away, the Defendant Officers drew their weapons and pointed them at him. Benitez discharged his weapon, which caused a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The Defendant Officers then shot at Derek, fatally striking him in his back, chest, left wrist, stomach, left side, right hip, left hip, and left leg. Although Benitez reported in his Tactical Response Report that his gunshot wound was self-inflicted, the City attempted to hide or cover-up this fact. The City did not hold the Defendant Officers accountable for shooting Derek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Under such a scenario, the City's acceptance of\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   liability would not address the City's independent conduct that caused Derek's injury.

First, the City argues that \u00a7 2-201 of the Illinois Tort Immunity Act applies, which provides that \"a public employee serving in a position involving the determination of policy or the exercise of discretion is not liable for an injury resulting from his act or omission in determining policy when acting in the exercise of such discretion even though abused.\" 745 Ill.

The determination of this question, however, does not dispose of the bifurcation issue because, as discussed above, Love also pursues a state law claim based on some of the same City policies\n   and practices. The City has not moved to bifurcate the state law independent claims against the City, meaning that discovery and litigation involving the same conduct would proceed even if the Court bifurcated the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim and stayed related discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   For the same reason, the Court discounts the City's arguments of potentially burdensome and unnecessary discovery.

The City's disclosures of potential witnesses also significantly overlap with those of the Defendant Officers, suggesting bifurcation could be inefficient and require deposing the same individuals twice. And, at least at this point, Love has tailored her additional\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   -related discovery to previous incidents involving the Defendant Officers and complaints or charges arising from City police officers planting evidence or receiving self-inflicted wounds.
