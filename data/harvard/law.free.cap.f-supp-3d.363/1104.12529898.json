(ECF No. 1 (\"Compl.\").) The local law, entitled the \"Child Protection Act,\" was adopted on April 13, 2008 by San Diego City Council and codified as San Diego Municipal Code, Chapter 5, Article 8, Division 6.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   San Diego, Cal., Municipal Code \u00a7 58.0601-58.0607 (hereinafter \"the Ordinance\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   About a year and a half before the City of San Diego adopted the Ordinance, the California voters adopted Proposition 83, known as \"The Sexual Predator Punishment and Control Act: Jessica's Law\", which passed on November 7, 2006 and went into effect on November 8, 2006. Cal. Legis. Serv. Prop. 83 (West) (hereinafter \"Jessica's Law\"). Among other changes, Jessica's Law amended several sections of the California Penal Code, including Section 3003.5.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%203003.5\">\n    Cal.

The newly amended law retained the original language of Section 3003.5, now codified under subsection (a), which\n   restricts Registrants released on parole from residing with other Registrants in a single family dwelling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cal Penal Code \u00a7 3003.5(a). Two additional subsections were also added.

The stated purpose of the Ordinance is \"to reduce the risk of harm to children by impacting the ability of sex offenders to be in contact with children\" and \"to provide additional restrictions beyond those provided for in Proposition 83, Jessica's law (effective November 8, 2006) by adding locations to the residence restrictions imposed by Jessica's Law....\" Ordinance at \u00a7 58.0601.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Ordinance provides three main regulations. First, the Ordinance makes it unlawful for Registrants to reside within 2000 feet of listed restricted areas.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%203003.5\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 58.0603.

Second, the Ordinance describes how to measure the 2000-foot buffer zone surrounding each restricted area.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%203003.5\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 58.0604 (\"The 2000-foot buffer zone is measured in a straight line, in all directions, without regard to intervening structures, from the property line of the places listed in section 58.0603 (a) through (g).\"). Third, two additional sections regulate which Registrants are covered by the residency requirements with provisions specifying an effective date for the Ordinance as well as exemptions.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%203003.5\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7\u00a7 58.0605-58.0606. The Ordinance only applies to a Registrant whose offense was committed on or after April 13, 2008.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%203003.5\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 58.0606. The Ordinance also exempts a Registrant residing outside of the covered entities before April 13, 2008, even if one of the listed entities were to then move within 2000 feet of the Registrant after April 13, 2008.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%203003.5\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 58.0605(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Since the passage of Jessica's Law in 2006, cases challenging the constitutionality of residency restrictions applying to Registrants have been litigated in state and federal courts. Of particular relevance here, the California Supreme Court in 2015 held the \"blanket enforcement of the mandatory residency restrictions of Jessica's Law, as applied to registered sex offenders on parole in San Diego County\" to be unconstitutional because the law could not \"survive even the more deferential rational basis standard of constitutional review.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3991085\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/60/1019/#p1038\">\n    60 Cal. 4th 1019\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1038,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=184%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20682\">\n    184 Cal.Rptr.3d 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=343%20P.3d%20867\">\n    343 P.3d 867\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs John Doe 1 and John Doe 2 filed a complaint on August 7, 2017, challenging the Ordinance on state and federal constitutional grounds. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-3.) The Complaint alleges that both Plaintiffs are required to register as sex offenders under California Penal Code Section 290 for offenses committed after April 13, 2008.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.

P. 12(b)(1)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant City of San Diego challenges the Complaint, in part, on the ground that Plaintiffs lack Article III standing. Standing under Article III of the U.S. Constitution is an element of subject matter jurisdiction. Therefore, Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiffs' Complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Generally, on a 12(b)(1) motion regarding subject matter jurisdiction, unlike a 12(b)(6) motion, a court need not defer to a plaintiff's factual allegations. But the Supreme Court has held that where a 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss is based on lack of standing, the Court must defer to the plaintiff's factual allegations and must \"presume that general allegations embrace those specific facts that are necessary to support the claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">\n    504 U.S. 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 561,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">\n    119 L.Ed.2d 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). \"At the pleading stage, general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant's conduct may suffice.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">\n    at 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In short, a 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss for lack of standing can only succeed if the plaintiff has failed to make \"general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant's conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Fed. R. Civ.

A motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) should be granted only where a plaintiff's complaint lacks a \"cognizable legal theory\" or sufficient facts to support a legal claim.\n   <em>\n    Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Dept.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10533720\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/901/696/#p699\">\n    901 F.2d 696\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 699 (9th Cir. 1988). When reviewing a motion to dismiss, the allegations of material fact in the plaintiff's complaint are taken as true and construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Parks Sch. of Bus., Inc. v.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendant moves to dismiss the Complaint on the grounds that Plaintiffs lack Article III standing and Plaintiffs' claims fail to state a claim as required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). For the reasons discussed below, the Court holds that Plaintiffs have standing to maintain this action. The Court then analyzes Plaintiffs' various claims to determine whether the claims should be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant first argues that Plaintiffs' Complaint should be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) because Plaintiffs lack Article III standing. Standing is a necessary element of federal court jurisdiction under Article III of the U.S. Constitution.\n   <em>\n    Warth v.

Moreover, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs do not have standing because they have not been threatened with prosecution or arrest by city law enforcement. Defendant points out that the Complaint fails to allege that any Registrant has been subjected to prosecution under the Ordinance.

The Complaint further alleges that Plaintiffs are forbidden under the Ordinance from acquiring residency in the City due to the threat of criminal prosecution, including incarceration and/or significant fines.

The fact that they currently reside in, or in geographical proximity to, the City is sufficient when pled along with the allegations that both Plaintiffs intend to establish residency in the City.

Defendant moves to dismiss Plaintiffs' preemption claim because it argues that Proposition 83, or Jessica's Law, amended California Penal Code Section 3003.5 to create an exception that expressly allows municipalities to impose residency restrictions that further regulate where Registrants can reside. The City rests its argument on a textual interpretation of the amended statute, which states that \"[n]othing in this section shall prohibit municipal jurisdictions from enacting local ordinances that further restrict the residency\n   of\n   <em>\n    any person for whom registration is required\n   </em>\n   pursuant to Section 290.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%203003.5\">\n    Cal.

Plaintiffs, however, argue that Section 3003.5(c) is limited to covering parolees only, not all Registrants, and thus, Jessica's Law did not create an exception allowing localities to extend residency restrictions for all Registrants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The California Court of Appeal held in\n   <em>\n    People v. Nguyen\n   </em>\n   that the California state legislature has enacted a comprehensive statutory scheme that fully occupies the field of \"restrictions imposed on a sex offender's daily life to reduce the risk he or she will commit another similar offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Nguyen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4036779\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/222/1168/#p1179\">\n    222 Cal.

The\n   <em>\n    Nguyen\n   </em>\n   Court went on to hold that consequently, a municipal ordinance that required sex offenders to obtain permission from local law enforcement before entering parks and recreational areas was \"impliedly\" preempted by state law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1188-89,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=166%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20590\">\n    166 Cal.Rptr.3d 590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Moreover, as discussed above, the California Court of Appeal has limited the regulation at issue in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   to parolees,\n   <em>\n    Lynch\n   </em>\n   , 2 Cal. App. 5th at 528, while the City's Ordinance applies to all Registrants. The Court agrees that the Ordinance that Plaintiffs' challenge is even more restrictive than the regulation in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   and thus likely unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Defendant argues that to challenge the constitutionality of the Ordinance under the Due Process Clause, Plaintiffs should be required to set forth their post-conviction status. The Court disagrees. The status that is relevant under the Ordinance is whether Plaintiffs are required to register as sex offenders under California Penal Code Section 290. Plaintiffs allege as much in the Complaint. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.) Moreover, Defendant even concedes that \"whether plaintiffs are parolees, probationers, or ex-offenders is of little consequence given the liberty impact of PC \u00a7 290 registration.\" (Def.s' Reply, 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Defendant also requests that Plaintiffs set forth any attempts they have made to secure housing in the City. In\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   , however, the California Supreme Court did not rest its holding on the nature of any attempts that the parolees may or may not have made to find homes in San Diego County. Rather, it was sufficient for the Court to strike down the regulation in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   as unconstitutional because it \"prevented paroled sex offenders as a class from residing in large areas of [San Diego] [county], including most of the downtown area in the City of San Diego.\"\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3991085\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/60/1019/#p1038\">\n    60 Cal. 4th at 1041\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=184%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20682\">\n    184 Cal.Rptr.3d 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=343%20P.3d%20867\">\n    343 P.3d 867\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Restricted Areas\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Section 58.0603 of the Ordinance states that \"[it] is unlawful for any registered sex offender to reside within 2000 feet of any of the follow places: (a) Amusement center (b) Arcade (c) Child day care facility (d) Library (e) Playground (f) Park (g) School.\" Plaintiffs allege that the definitions of these terms are open-ended and lack publication of the facilities that are covered. The definition of \"amusement center,\" for example, includes \"any establishment open to the public who provides entertainment directed at minors, or whose play equipment is primarily used by minors.\" Ordinance at \u00a7 58.0602. Plaintiffs assert that a person of ordinary intelligence cannot be expected to know necessarily what kind of entertainment is \"directed at minors\" or what sort of play equipment is \"primarily used by minors.\" Plaintiffs allege that the insufficient definitions of the terms in Section 58.0603 \"prevent Registrants from knowing the precise identity and size of the facilities that meet these definitions....\" (Compl. \u00b6 47.) Plaintiffs claim that these ambiguities prevent an ordinary person from being able to comply with the Ordinance and risk arbitrary enforcement. Drawing all inferences in Plaintiffs' favor, the Court finds it plausible that the Ordinance does not give fair notice as to what compliance requires and exposes Registrants to arbitrary and discriminatory prosecutions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Defendant asserts that the \"terms and phrases used in the Ordinance have routinely been upheld by California courts.\" (Def.s' Reply, 10.)

Rather, the Florida state court was asked whether the phrase \"\n   <em>\n    or other place where children regularly congregate\n   </em>\n   \" was void for vagueness.\n   <em>\n    Britt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11079924,11079959\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/775/415/\">\n    775 So.2d at 416-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Likewise, this Court in\n   <em>\n    Fantasyland Video\n   </em>\n   did not cite\n   <em>\n    Britt\n   </em>\n   because it informed a constitutional vagueness challenge to the terms school, daycare center, park, or playground. The question in\n   <em>\n    Fantasyland Video\n   </em>\n   was whether the word \"regularly\" in the context of an adult entertainment regulation including the phrase \"regularly appears in a state of semi-nudity\" was impermissibly vague.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8955322\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/373/1094/#p1126\">\n    373 F.Supp.2d at 1125-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The question in\n   <em>\n    Trantham\n   </em>\n   , however, was not about the term \"park\" in and of itself.\n   <em>\n    Trantham\n   </em>\n   addressed whether a late night park closure regulation was void for vagueness.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6035295\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d-supp/161/1/#p6\">\n    161 Cal.

However, as discussed above, these two cases do not address whether the language of the Ordinance is void for vagueness and are not relevant to Plaintiffs' claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Measure of Distance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Section 58.0604 of the Ordinance states that \"[t]he 2000-foot buffer zone is measured in a straight line, in all directions, without regard to intervening structures, from the property line of the places listed in section 58.0603 (a) through (g).\" Ordinance at \u00a7 58.0604. This language, in and of itself, is sufficiently clear. However, Plaintiffs claim that the Ordinance is void for vagueness because it is unclear whether the measure of distance designating the restricted areas includes \"parking lots, storage spaces, and other structures that do not typically shelter or contain people.\" The Court holds that this allegation supports a plausible vagueness challenge because without clarity on what exactly constitutes a given restricted area, Registrants are not able to determine the 2000-foot buffer zone. Without sufficient definiteness as to what is included in \"the places listed in section 58.0603 (a) through (g)\" it is unclear how to measure the buffer zone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Defendant argues that the language is sufficiently precise and provides example of similar language in other California statutes. Defendant is correct that boundary limitations exist throughout California laws. But Plaintiffs do not argue that the buffer zone created by the Ordinance is vague merely because it is a boundary limitation. The Complaint asserts that the measure of distance that Registrants and law enforcement are expected to calculate is impermissibly vague because within the context of the Ordinance, it is difficult to ascertain the property lines of the covered facilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Thus, because the Court finds that Plaintiffs' allegations sufficiently set forth a cognizable legal theory challenging the Ordinance on vagueness grounds, Defendant's motion to dismiss is denied as to the void for vagueness claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    5.
