Weismann, CREW's former Interim Executive Director and current Chief FOIA Counsel (collectively \"CREW\"), have sued the Federal Election Commission (\"FEC\") in connection with the Commission's resolution of an administrative complaint that CREW filed with the agency in 2015. In the administrative complaint it filed with the FEC, CREW alleged that a non-profit organization, American Conservative Union (\"ACU\"); a political action committee, Now or Never PAC; the PAC's treasurer, James C. Thomas III; and an \"Unknown Respondent\" violated the Federal Election Campaign Act (\"FECA\" or \"the Act\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030101\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , by making a $1.71 million campaign contribution from an undisclosed source. The Commission investigated the matter and found that the contribution passed through a previously undisclosed organization, Government Integrity, LLC. It ultimately negotiated a conciliation agreement with ACU, the PAC, Thomas, and Government Integrity. The Commissioners unanimously approved the conciliation agreement and closed the administrative matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   CREW filed suit against the Commission, asserting that its handling of the matter violated FECA and the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"). Specifically, CREW contends that the agency improperly disposed of the administrative complaint without proceeding further to ensure that its investigation encompassed the true sources of the contribution, the individuals or entities that provided the money to Government Integrity that was passed to ACU. CREW contends that the agency should have pursued leads developed during its investigation in accordance with the recommendations of the Office of General Counsel, and it questions the Commission's decision to curtail the investigation in the wake of the conciliation agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Commission has moved to dismiss the complaint arguing that the Court has no jurisdiction to hear it, and the Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Section 30109(a)(1) of FECA authorizes any person who believes a violation of the statute has occurred to file a complaint with the agency. Significantly, under the statute, if the Commission determines that there is probable cause to believe that any person has committed a violation of the Act, it is\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   to attempt to correct or prevent the violation through a process of conciliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The judicial review provision in the statute, subsection (a)(8)(A), states that \"[a]ny party aggrieved by an order of the Commission dismissing a complaint filed by such party ... or by a failure of the Commission to act on such ... may file a\n   petition with the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The FEC is correct that neither of these events took place here. CREW's administrative complaint was brought against three named respondents and one unknown respondent. There was no failure to act on plaintiff's complaint, and the complaint against the four respondents - three named and one unknown - was not dismissed; it was resolved by the conciliation process called for by the statute. Since nothing in the statute gives the Court the power to review investigative decisions made along the way if an administrative complaint was neither dismissed nor ignored, the Court concludes that the challenged agency action is not reviewable under FECA. It further finds that the agency's actions in this circumstance are not reviewable under the APA, and therefore, the Court will grant defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Thus, this opinion will not address, and it should not be interpreted as expressing agreement with, or any view about, the propriety of the agency's actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Sept. 21 Certif.; Oct. 24, 2017 Certif.
