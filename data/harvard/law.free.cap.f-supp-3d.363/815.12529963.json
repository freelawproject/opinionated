LAWSON, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Darren Sensat injured his left foot and ankle while boarding a Southwest Airlines flight departing from the Dominican Republic destined for the United States. He says that his foot became lodged in a gap between the tread and riser of the airstairs that the airline used for passenger boarding at that airport. Sensat brought suit under Article 17 of the Montreal Convention, which renders air carriers liable to passengers injured by accidents that occur on board the aircraft or during embarking or disembarking. Defendant Southwest Airlines has moved for summary judgment contending that the undisputed facts show that Sensat's injuries did not result from an \"accident.\" Because the record demonstrates otherwise, the motion will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The injury occurred on April 9, 2017. Sensat was a passenger on Southwest Flight 1239 from Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic, returning to the United States after a family vacation. He arrived at the airport with his family about two hours before their scheduled departure on a clear sunny day. Sensat checked his bags and carried on a small backpack with personal items that weighed 10 to 12 pounds. He was wearing shorts and athletic running shoes. When the boarding time was called for their flight, passengers went outside the terminal and waited for a bus that drove them across the tarmac to where the plane was parked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After the passengers got off the bus, they went up a set of airstairs to board the plane. Sensat followed his wife and daughters up the stairs as he ascended. There were around 15 passengers in the line ahead of them. Sensat attested that he had used similar airstairs to board planes during at least 10 flights in the past, and he did not notice anything that seemed different or unusual about the stairs on this occasion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Sensat walked up along the left side as he ascended the stairs. He was looking straight ahead at his wife as he walked, when his foot became trapped. When asked to describe his fall, Sensat stated: \"I was walking straight up following my wife and all of a sudden my [left] foot went in and got caught[,] and I didn't know what it was it got caught on[,] and my body went forward and I fell.\" Sensat stated that his entire foot, \"from front to back,\" with the shoe still on, went into a \"gap\" in the airstairs structure. The loss of footing caused Sensat to fall forward, toward his\n   wife, and a passenger immediately behind Sensat reached out to help him. As he fell forward, his foot was \"lodged\" in the gap, which caused his ankle to rotate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Sensat was helped up the stairs onto the plane, but he was \"hopping and cursing.\" He asked for some ice for his ankle, which by then was \"swelling real fast.\" EMTs subsequently were called to attend to him. After examining Sensat's foot for several minutes, the EMTs said that they needed to summon a doctor, which was done. The doctor said that the ankle did not appear to be broken, but asked Sensat if he wanted to go to the hospital for further examination. Sensat declined and said he would rather go to the hospital when he arrived back in the United States. As a result of the fall, Sensat suffered serious injuries to his foot and ankle, including torn ligaments and tendons, which required treatment by surgery and a cast.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Before the flight departed, Sensat asked the flight attendant to use his cellphone to take some pictures of the gap in the air stairs where he had fallen. The photos were presented at Sensat's deposition, where he identified them as depicting the gap in the air stairs where his foot was caught.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Southwest's flight attendant Kimberly Wilburn wrote a report of the incident, which she also described at a deposition. She stated that Sensat was injured at the top of the airstairs when he \"stepped through an opening between two metal slats.\" Although Sensat complained about a \"hole\" in the stairs, Wilburn said that she could not find one. With the help of the captain, though, they \"discovered a horizontal space between two metal slats.\" Beneath one of the steps was a placard that read \"Watch Your Step.\" Boarding continued, but she said that the captain stood on the platform and cautioned the remaining passengers \"to step over the opening.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Wilburn also confirmed that Sensat asked her to take some photos of the stairs with his cellphone. She obliged and returned the phone to him. However, when shown the two photos at her deposition, she testified that she did not recognize them\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Southwest's Regional Manager for the Caribbean Region, Aaron Varnell, testified that Southwest contracted with a company named Aviam to provide ground services at the Dominican Republic airport, such as baggage handling and management of equipment and vehicles used to service Southwest's aircraft on the ground. He said that there are between five and seven different types of airstairs used at the facility for boarding passengers. An Aviam ground crew member would have been responsible for configuring and positioning the airstairs for the plaintiff's flight, but Varnell stated that Aviam had not produced any incident report relating to the accident, so there was no way to identify the driver, operator, or supervisor involved with the boarding operation. Varnell also conceded that he had not inquired, and he believed there was no way to know, which of the various types of airstairs were used for the plaintiff's flight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Varnell was asked to examine the two photographs offered by the plaintiff showing a gap in the airstairs tread, and Varnell stated that he could not tell if the pictured gap was a normal condition for the airstairs. He also conceded that he had never observed any \"properly configured\" airstairs with a gap in a tread. Varnell testified that the airstairs could normally have a gap in the \"riser\" (vertical) portion of the stair steps, which he contrasted with the \"tread\" or horizontal component.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The plaintiff's single-count complaint against Southwest Airlines premises liability on Article 17 of the Montreal Convention. That treaty subjects air carriers to\n   pay damages to passengers suffering injury caused by an \"accident\" that occurs, among other times, during aircraft boarding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Southwest Airlines moved for summary judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a). \"Summary judgment is proper 'if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.' \"\n   <em>\n    Pittman v.

They do not dispute that the plaintiff suffered a \"bodily injury,\" or that the injury occurred during the plaintiff's embarkation on the flight. Thus, the only question of fact that they dispute, other than the extent of the plaintiff's damages, is whether the event was an \"accident\" as that term is used in Article 17(1). The defendant contends that the circumstances here do not fit within the definition that courts have ascribed to that term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The term \"accident\" is not expressly defined in Article 17 or elsewhere in the Convention. There are cases that addressed a definition of that term as it was used in the Warsaw Convention, a predecessor treaty.

Therefore, it was not caused by a \"accident\" as the Warsaw Convention used that term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The defendant contends that Sensat ought to suffer the same fate because his injury was caused by his own internal reaction to a \"normal\" condition of the airstairs during the boarding process. Southwest Airlines apparently maintains that the gap in the airstairs steps was not \"unusual,\" and the plaintiff's injuries were caused by his own \"misstep,\" which the defendant casts as the plaintiff's \"own internal reaction to the usual, normal, and expected operation of the airstairs,\" not caused by anything \"external\" to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As an initial matter, the defendant argues that the Court should disregard the two photographs depicting a horizontal gap in the airstairs tread that the plaintiff submitted, because they cannot be authenticated\n   sufficiently to be admitted into evidence at trial.

Southwest Airlines's contractor apparently expanded the telescoping airstairs so that a substantial gap opened between the tread and the riser. Sensat ascended the stairs in a line with several other Southwest passengers as instructed, unable to see the gap, and apparently unaware of the hazard. His foot became lodged in the gap and he stumbled, damaging hit foot and ankle tissue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The gap in the airstairs certainly was \"external\" to the plaintiff, and the defendant has not seriously contested the plaintiff's account that it was the entrapment of his foot in that space that was the cause of the fall that produced his serious ankle injury. The defendant's position that the fall was caused by the plaintiff's mere \"internal reaction\" to a perfectly routine circumstance of air travel is not borne out by either the record or the case law. On similar facts, applying the construction announced in\n   <em>\n    Saks\n   </em>\n   , the federal courts readily have concluded that such incidents as water on boarding stairs and an improperly lowered overhead monitor screen were \"external\" circumstances that led to passengers' physical mishaps.\n   <em>\n    Gezzi v.

Neither the plaintiff nor anyone else testified that any such antics figured in his ascent of the airstairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Moreover, as the Sixth Circuit explained at length in\n   <em>\n    Doe v. Etihad Airways\n   </em>\n   , where a physical mishap occurs that simultaneously directly injures the plaintiff, while she is on board or in the process of boarding or disembarking an aircraft, there is no need to determine exactly what act of miscalculation by the defendant led to the injury, as long as there is a contemporaneous physical connection between the unexpected incident and the harm.\n   <em>\n    Etihad Airways\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275252\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/870/406/#p411\">\n    870 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   425 n.14 (\"Nothing in the Montreal Convention or in the Warsaw Convention caselaw requires us to separate the accident from the bodily injury in cases like this one where there is no temporal gap between the accident and the bodily injury.\"). Here, the plaintiff has identified the stair tread gap as one unexpected circumstance that directly provoked his fall; his injury occurred contemporaneously with the fall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Relying on a number of non-controlling cases, the defendant attempts to engraft onto the\n   <em>\n    Saks\n   </em>\n   standard an implied requirement that the plaintiff must demonstrate some deviation from \"industry standards\" or the defendant's own documented \"policies\n   and procedures\" before he can establish that an \"unusual\" or \"unexpected\" event occurred. But here a jury readily could conclude that the encounter with a stair tread gap wide enough to entrap a grown man's entire foot was \"unexpected\" by both the plaintiff and the airline's own personnel under the circumstances. And the federal courts have resisted defendants' attempts to import into the \"flexible\" rule of\n   <em>\n    Saks\n   </em>\n   any implied requirement that a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   violation of some standard, policy, or regulation must be shown for a plaintiff to prevail.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phifer v.
