PAUL OETKEN, District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Altareek Grice, on behalf of himself and others similarly situated, brought this action against Defendant Bottling Group, LLC s/h/a Pepsi Beverages Company (\"PBC\") on the basis of PBC's alleged violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (\"FCRA\"), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(b)(2). On November 8, 2018, the same date on which Plaintiff moved for a final approval of a class action settlement of up to $ 1,192,275 (Dkt. No. 54), Plaintiff separately moved for an award of attorney's fees and costs, to be paid out of the settlement fund to Class Counsel (Dkt. No. 56). After a fairness hearing on November 15, 2018, the Court certified the proposed class and approved the settlement as fair and adequate under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e), but reserved judgment on Plaintiff's motion for fees and costs. For the following reasons, the attorney's fees motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On June 19, 2017, Plaintiff filed this action in the California Superior Court for the County of San Diego, alleging that PBC has violated the FCRA by procuring consumer reports of Plaintiff and class members for employment purposes without making the required disclosure in a stand-alone document. (Dkt. No. 1-2 \u00b6 1.) PBC then removed this action to the United States District Court for the Southern District of California (Dkt. No. 1), and the case was transferred to this Court on November 14, 2017 (Dkt. No. 12). On January 31, 2018, following a private mediation held before the parties had engaged in any extensive discovery, the parties notified the Court that they had settled. (Dkt. Nos. 20, 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Under the parties' proposed settlement terms, PBC agrees to pay $ 1,192,275 to a common fund. (Dkt. No. 39 (the \"Settlement Agreement\") \u00b6 23.) The common fund is intended to cover all payments owed under the settlement, including class member payouts, attorney's fees and costs, the cost of settlement administration, and a service award for Plaintiff Grice. (Settlement Agreement \u00b6 24.) After deducting all fees, costs and the service award from the common fund, the rest of the fund (the \"Net Settlement Fund\")-$ 710,850-will be distributed to class members submitting valid claims forms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   However, although the putative class consists of 23,133 members, only 1,879 members have submitted valid claims forms (\"participating class members\"), representing approximately 8.1% of the entire class. (Dkt. No. 52 \u00b6 10.) The low participation rate here triggers a reversionary term under the Settlement Agreement which allows PBC to claw back 40% of the Net Settlement Fund-$ 284,340-with the remaining 60%-$ 426,510-to be distributed equally among participating class members. (Settlement Agreement \u00b6 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Class Counsel now move for an attorney's fees award of $ 397,387, costs reimbursement totaling $ 74,507.79, and a service award for Grice of $ 5,000. (Dkt. No. 56.) The $ 397,387 attorney's fees figure represents one-third of the original $ 1,192,275 common fund created by the terms of the parties' settlement. (Dkt. No. 57 at 2.) In support of this figure, Class Counsel represent that over 450 hours were spent on this matter by attorneys working at hourly rates ranging from $ 500 to $ 875, resulting in a lodestar figure of $ 331,281.25. (Dkt. No. 57 at 5,\n   13.) Per the terms of the Settlement Agreement, PBC agreed not to oppose the attorney's fees award (Dkt. No. 55 at 10), and no class member has objected to the instant motion (Dkt. No. 52 \u00b6 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

However, each of these three cases differs materially from the instant case both in their common fund sizes and in their causes of action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Meredith Corp. v.

Moreover, \"these cases are an extremely limited sample of the totality of cases in which fees were awarded from common fund settlements.\"\n   <em>\n    McGreevy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273502\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/258/380/\">\n    258 F.Supp.3d at 386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The empirical studies cited above, which together survey hundreds of cases, paint a far more comprehensive picture of the average percentage awarded to counsel in common fund settlements, thereby minimizing any potential sampling biases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Finally, the magnitude and complexity of this case favor the adoption of a \"baseline fee percentage that falls in the [lower] end of the median fees found by the empirical studies.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273502\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/258/380/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This case is not very complex. Rather, this case \"involve[s] a single claim involving a single statutory provision and a single form.\"\n   <em>\n    Hillson v.

Mich. Aug. 11, 2017). As in the\n   <em>\n    Hillson\n   </em>\n   case, here too there already existed extensive case law supporting Plaintiff's FCRA claim premised on a stand-alone disclosure requirement at the time his case was filed. In addition, while Plaintiff's need to prove the willfulness of PBC's conduct may \"have been challenging as a factual matter, [ ] the nature of the task was not complex.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203446596\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Furthermore, as reflected by this case's record, Plaintiff's case for PBC's liability was never vigorously contested, as the parties settled early in the litigation before engaging in any extensive discovery (Dkt. Nos. 20, 21) and there have been no objections to the proposed settlement (Dkt. No. 52 \u00b6 14). Finally, Class Counsel's emphasis on the inherently complex nature of Rule 23 class actions does not move the needle, as this fact is true of all class actions and is thus presumably fully accounted for by the Court's reliance on fees awarded in other Rule 23 common fund cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Mindful that in the Rule 23 context the Court acts as a fiduciary that must \"serve as a guardian of the rights of absent class members,\"\n   <em>\n    Goldberger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11449960\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/209/43/#p47\">\n    209 F.3d at 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted), the Court concludes that a reasonable baseline for this case is 27%. Applying that baseline here renders the baseline attorney's fees award for this case as $ 321,914.25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Consideration of Risk, Result and Policy Considerations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Court now examines the three remaining\n   <em>\n    Goldberger\n   </em>\n   factors-the risk of the litigation, the quality of representation and any remaining policy considerations-in order to consider whether there is any basis for further adjusting the reasonable baseline fee in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Risk of Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Class Counsel took considerable, but not extraordinary, risk in prosecuting this case. Class Counsel represent that they took this case on a contingency basis and have invested over 450 hours of work and advanced around $ 16,537.57 of costs. (Dkt. No. 57 at 13-14.) Class Counsel also assert that this case was a risky undertaking due to the factual and legal hurdles of proving the willfulness of PBC's conduct. (Dkt. No. 57 at 7.) For example, Class Counsel note that absent a showing of willfulness, Plaintiff and Class Counsel would not have recovered anything under the FCRA, because Plaintiff sought only statutory damages which are available only for willful violations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   However, very little discovery had taken place in this case before the parties settled, and PBC never filed any dispositive motions throughout the proceedings. As this case was resolved rather swiftly, Class Counsel's investments of time and money were never made in the face of a particular hurdle to their clients' recovery. The Court is also mindful that contingency risk does \"not always compel enhanced fees,\" especially where such an enhanced fee would result in overcompensation.\n   <em>\n    Goldberger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11449960\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/209/43/#p47\">\n    209 F.3d at 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, as in other cases involving similarly few risks beyond the risks generally inherent to litigation, \"the risk in this case was not so unusual as to merit a change in the reasonable baseline fee for this case.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McGreevy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273502\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/258/380/\">\n    258 F.Supp.3d at 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Quality of Representation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Court next considers whether the quality of counsel's representation warrants adjusting the reasonable baseline fee. \"[T]he quality of representation is best measured by results, and that such results may be calculated by comparing 'the extent of possible recovery with the amount of actual verdict or settlement.' \"\n   <em>\n    Goldberger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11449960\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/209/43/#p47\">\n    209 F.3d at 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Lindy Bros.

Because the class members could have obtained statutory damages ranging from $ 100 to $ 1000 if they had prevailed in trial, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681n(a)(1)(A), the class members are receiving only approximately 5% of their maximum potential recovery. But considering the factual and legal hurdles that the class would have had to overcome before securing a favorable judgment, the current settlement represents a good result for the class members. Such a good result, however, is not so exceptional as to merit an increase in the baseline percentage, especially where the Court does not have the benefits of an adversarial examination of the issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Colgate-Palmolive Co. ERISA Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4338326\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/36/344/#p352\">\n    36 F.Supp.3d 344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 352 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (\"Without the benefit of an adversarial examination of the issues, there is no reason on the submissions before the Court to conclude that the result is so exceptional as to warrant an increase in the baseline percentage.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Policy Considerations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The last\n   <em>\n    Goldberger\n   </em>\n   factor calls for this Court to evaluate whether public policy considerations counsel in favor of adjusting the reasonable baseline fee. Plaintiff's FCRA claim implicates the genuine public interest in the protection of consumer privacy. Private litigation is a particularly important mechanism by which this public interest is vindicated in the employment context, given the power asymmetry between employers and job applicants and the lack of other remedies for job applicants whose private information is shared with employers without required disclosures. Since recoveries under the FCRA for such violations are generally low and individuals may not have enough incentives to bring claims to vindicate their rights, ensuring appropriate incentives for attorneys to bring such claims as class actions is crucial to attaining the goals of consumer privacy protection embodied in the FCRA. That said, the public policy concerns implicated by the FCRA do not differentiate this case from other types of common fund cases also reflecting important policy goals-for example, wage-and-hour or securities fraud cases that provide protections to workers or investors. Therefore, while public policy weighs in favor of incentivizing class actions such as Plaintiff's FCRA lawsuit, that incentive argument is not unique to this case and thus does not warrant increasing the baseline percentage here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   What does distinguish this case from other common fund cases is the reversionary nature of the settlement fund, which the Court concludes merits a reduction to the baseline percentage. When some portion of a common fund goes unclaimed, there are generally four ways of distributing it: \"(1) reversion to the defendant; (2)\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   redistribution among the class members who did make claims; (3) escheat to the state; and (4)\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   distribution to charitable organizations.\" Rubenstein,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 12:29. Reversion, the method adopted by the parties in this action, is the least favored of these four methods because of its potential to create perverse incentives.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In particular, if attorney's fees are pegged to the size of the fund made available prior to reversion, it might \"decouple class counsel's financial incentives from those of the class, increasing the risk that the actual distribution will be misallocated between attorney's fees and the plaintiffs' recovery.\"\n   <em>\n    Int'l Precious Metals Corp. v.

Class counsel also have incentives to acquiesce in such arrangements if an attorney's fees award is calculated based on the gross settlement amount prior to reversion.\n   <em>\n    Allen v.

The settlement here has been structured such that 40% of the Net Settlement Fund will never be paid out by PBC, because the participation rate of class members is lower than 60%. (Dkt. No. 55 at 10.) However, the attorney's fees award requested by Class Counsel is calculated as one-third of the gross settlement amount prior to that reversion. (Dkt. No. 57 at 1.) Given that this case's class members will actually receive only $ 426,510 from PBC, granting Class Counsel's request of $ 397,387 in fees would result in nearly half of PBC's net payout going to Class Counsel. This result would appear to be just the sort of misallocated distribution \"between attorney's fees and the plaintiffs' recovery\" flagged as problematic by Justice O'Connor.\n   <em>\n    Int'l Precious Metals Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9425603,9425511,9425577,9425491,9425652,9425532\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/1223/\">\n    530 U.S. at 1223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20S.%20Ct.%202237\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Weighing the significant policy considerations against such reversionary settlements and the low participation rate of class members alongside the important goals of encouraging lawyers to bring common fund cases to vindicate consumers' rights under the FCRA, the Court concludes that a decrease of 5% of the baseline fee percentage is appropriate in this case.

To support their claimed hourly rates, Mr. Dion-Kindem and Mr. Blanchard rely on the Laffey Matrix for attorney billing rates, which purportedly represents reasonable rates in the Washington D.C.-Baltimore area. (Dkt. No. 57-1 at 6-7; Dkt. No. 57-2 at 6-7.) Mr.\n   Dion-Kindem and Mr. Blanchard also rely on salary tables for the Washington-Baltimore-Arlington and Los Angeles-Long Beach areas. (Dkt.

Despite this shortcoming, the Court will take their representations as true, given that \"where [the lodestar is] used as a mere cross-check, the hours documented by counsel need not be exhaustively scrutinized by the district court.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Goldberger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11449960\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/209/43/#p47\">\n    209 F.3d at 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
