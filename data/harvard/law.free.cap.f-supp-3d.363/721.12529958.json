As previously summarized by the court, Plaintiffs assert five causes of action against six Defendants. Plaintiffs' allegations and causes of action, however, can be divided into two groups. First, Plaintiffs challenge the adequacy of redress procedures established to contest inclusion in the TSDB,\n   contending that the procedures are unconstitutional and also unlawful under the APA. Second, Plaintiffs challenge their alleged placement on the \"No Fly List\" and \"Screening List,\" arguing that their continued inclusion on these lists is unconstitutional and also unlawful under the APA.

In support, Plaintiffs rely primarily on an unpublished Fourth Circuit decision in which the court held that an action seeking removal from the No Fly List and challenging the adequacy of redress procedures was properly before the district court, as any remedy would involve both the TSA and the TSC, and the circuit court's authority under section 46110 only extended to the TSA's orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mohamed v.

The court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   While there are deficiencies in the Redress Program process, we agree with the district court that Shearson should be required to exhaust her administrative procedures by submitting a traveler inquiry form through the Redress Program before she can proceed with this case. There is very little guidance in any Circuit considering administrative exhaustion as it pertains to the Redress Program and there is no case law in this Circuit. However, when considering the purposes of the exhaustion doctrine, making Shearson submit a Traveler Redress inquiry is reasonable to promote judicial efficiency and allow the agencies involved an opportunity to resolve problems with their procedures.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <em>\n    Shearson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070942\" index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/725/588/#p594\">\n    725 F.3d at 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, in contrast to the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Shearson\n   </em>\n   , Defendants concede that Mr. Kovac submitted a redress inquiry to the DHS TRIP and, in their reply, confirm that he has been notified of his \"No Fly List\" status.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply 3 (Doc. 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Under these circumstances, the court rejects as untenable Defendants' position that Mr. Kovac's claims are not ripe and that he must further exhaust administrative remedies before he can proceed in this court. No order or remedy would necessarily result from further administrative process. In addition, in cases relied upon by Defendants, the plaintiffs had not even sought redress through DHS TRIP. Here, Mr. Kovac has not only filed a redress inquiry, but he has also been notified that he is on the No Fly List. Therefore, the court concludes Mr. Kovac's claims are ripe and declines to prevent review of his claims by creating an exhaustion requirement when none has been statutorily mandated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Plaintiffs' Constitutional and APA Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss Counts I through V of the Complaint on numerous grounds, some of which overlap. With respect to Plaintiffs' substantive due process claims (Count II), Defendants' overriding argument is that the court should dismiss these claims because Plaintiffs' inclusion in the TSDB has not deprived them of any \"fundamental right\" as required to establish a substantive due process violation. In particular, Defendants contend that inclusion on the No Fly List (in the case of Mr. Kovac) or Screening List (in the case of the remaining four Plaintiffs) does not result in a burden sufficient to maintain a substantive due process claim. Defendants make similar arguments in support of their motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' procedural due process claims (Count I), contending that Plaintiffs have not alleged a sufficient deprivation of any liberty interests and that, even if they have, the DHS TRIP redress procedures are constitutionally adequate. Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiffs' APA claims (Count III) on similar grounds, arguing that their APA claims are largely coextensive with their constitutional claims and, therefore, fail for the same reasons. Defendants further contend that Plaintiffs cannot separately demonstrate that the DHS TRIP redress process is arbitrary or capricious in violation of the APA. In support of their motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' equal protection claims (Count IV), Defendants contend that the watchlist criteria are facially neutral and Plaintiffs' allegations of disparate impact are conclusory, formulaic, and insufficient to state a claim for a violation of their rights to equal protection. Finally, in support of their motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims that the watchlist constitutes an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power in violation of the non-delegation doctrine (Count V), Defendants argue that Plaintiffs fail to state a claim because consideration of the applicable statutes reveals that Congress has provided \"intelligible principles\" both as to the goals the TSA should seek to achieve and also how it should go about achieving them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In the interest of clarity and to minimize redundancies, the court will first address Plaintiffs' substantive due process claims (Count II), as many of Defendants' arguments undergird and overlap with those made in support of dismissing Plaintiffs' procedural due process claims (Count I).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Plaintiffs' Substantive Due Process Claims (Count II)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   In Count II, titled \"Deprivation of Protected Liberties in Violation of Fifth Amendment Right to Substantive Due Process,\" Plaintiffs contend that their inclusion on the watchlist and the associated stigmatizing label of \"known or suspected terrorist,\" unduly burden \"their liberty interests in travel, freedom from false stigmatization, and nonattainder.\" Compl. \u00b6 260. Plaintiffs further allege that Defendants' interference is not necessary to further a compelling governmental interest and has not been narrowly tailored to achieve that interest, in violation of their\n   constitutional right to substantive due process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 259-270. Plaintiffs also contend that Defendants' actions are arbitrary and capricious, lack even a rational relationship to any legitimate government interest, and have unduly deprived them of their constitutional rights. The court first addresses Plaintiffs' contention that Defendants' actions have unduly burdened their right to travel, sometimes referred to in the pleadings as their right to movement, in violation of the substantive due process clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Right to Travel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that, by maintaining them on the No Fly List (in the case of Mr. Kovac) and Selectee List (in the case of Messrs. Sbyti, Aljame, and Allababidi, and Ms. Warsame, sometimes collectively, the \"Screening List Plaintiffs\"), Defendants have placed an undue burden on their fundamental right to travel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants contend that Plaintiffs have failed to allege an undue burden on a fundamental right and any substantive due process challenge based on the right to travel or to movement must, therefore, be dismissed. For the reasons that follow, the court rejects Defendants' argument with respect to Mr. Kovac, who is on the No Fly List, but agrees with their argument with respect to the Screening List Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment guarantees that \"[n]o person shall be...deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" U.S. Const. amend.

In response, the Government informed the court that it was revising its DHS TRIP procedures to address the constitutional deficiencies noted by the court and filed a notice describing the revised procedures. Ultimately, the district court concluded that the revised procedures satisfied procedural due process in principle, granted summary judgment in the Government's favor on the plaintiffs' claims challenging the adequacy of the redress procedures, and dismissed their challenges to placement on the No Fly List for lack of jurisdiction, reasoning that under the revised DHS TRIP procedures, only the TSA administrator had ultimate authority to remove a DHS TRIP applicant from the No Fly List.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Latif v.

As the Defendants have also acknowledged, however, an individual placed on the No Fly List or Screening List does not receive any notice of his or her placement on the list, pre-deprivation, or the reasons for his or her inclusion. Further, an individual's inclusion on the No Fly List or Screening List and the dissemination of that list are accomplished without any judicial involvement or review, and according to a standard of proof that is far less than that typically required when the deprivation of significant constitutional liberties are implicated.\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    Safeguarding Privacy and Civil Liberties While Keeping Our Skies Safe: Hearing Before the H.

To resolve the procedural due process claim, therefore, the court must engage in a fact-intensive consideration of the personal liberties involved, the Government's compelling interest in combating terrorism, the procedures used in connection with the No Fly List and Screening List, and the use made of the No Fly List and Screening List.
