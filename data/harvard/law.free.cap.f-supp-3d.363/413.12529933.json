(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Motion for Class Certification,\" Dkt. No. 91.) NYU opposes class certification, largely on the grounds that each class member's case would require individualized proof. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Opposition,\" Dkt. No. 97.)

Feb. 24, 2017). Briefly, Plaintiffs allege that NYU induced students to enroll at Tisch Asia -- a performing-arts-focused graduate school which opened in 2007 and closed in 2015 -- by representing that Tisch Asia would offer an educational experience equal to NYU's renowned Tisch School of the Arts in New York City (\"Tisch New York\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"First Amended Complaint,\" Dkt. No. 22 \u00b6\u00b6 2-3.) Plaintiffs allege that \"except for the cost of tuition, Tisch Asia never lived up to the standards of Tisch New York,\" and \"Tisch Asia students were not provided with the same education, professional training, and equipment as their New York counterparts.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint asserted seven causes of action on behalf of the putative class: (1) breach of contract; (2) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (3) violation of the New York General Business Law (\"G.B.L.\") Section 349 ; (4) violation of G.B.L. Section 350 ; (5) negligent misrepresentation; (6) fraud; and (7) unjust enrichment. By Order dated February 24, 2017, the Court dismissed counts (2), (3), and (4).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Basso\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201019505\">\n    2017 WL 1019505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Discovery closed in June 2018. Plaintiffs thereafter moved to (1) certify a proposed class, pursuant to Rule 23(b) (3), consisting of \"all students who attended New York University Tisch School of the Arts, Asia\" (the \"Proposed Class\"); and (2) appoint Giskan, Solotaroff &amp; Anderson LLP and Schwartz, Ponterio &amp; Levenson, PLLC as class counsel. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion for Class Certification at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the Proposed Class meets the class certification requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) (\" Rule 23(a)\"). First, Plaintiffs assert that the Proposed Class is ascertainable, because the Court can \"easily and objectively determine[ ] based on NYU enrollment records\" whether a particular person attended Tisch Asia. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Class Cert. Mem.,\" Dkt. No. 92 at 21.) Second, Plaintiffs contend that, because the Proposed Class consists of over three hundred individuals, it is sufficiently numerous to make joinder impracticable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Third, Plaintiffs maintain that the Proposed Class members' claims share common questions of law and fact, including: (1) whether NYU failed to disclose material facts regarding the differences between Tisch Asia and Tisch New York; (2) whether NYU breached its contract to provide certain educational benefits and services it had promised would be provided to the Proposed Class members; (3) whether NYU intentionally and/or negligently misrepresented that it would provide certain educational benefits and services, and then failed to provide them; (4) whether NYU concealed that Tisch Asia was a five-year experiment; and (5) whether NYU was unjustly enriched by promising to provide but failing to deliver to the Proposed Class members certain educational benefits and services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Fourth, Plaintiffs argue that their claims typify those of the Proposed Class, because all class members entered into the same contract with NYU and \"were subject to the same misrepresentations and omissions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25.) Fifth, Plaintiffs claim that they are adequate representatives of the Proposed Class, because their \"interests are aligned with other class members,\" they \"do not have any interests antagonistic to those of the other class members,\" and they \"are committed to the\n   vigorous prosecution\" of this suit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-26.) In addition, Plaintiffs argue that their lawyers are \"highly experienced in handling class actions\" and have \"pursued this matter vigorously and competently.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Next, Plaintiffs contend that the case meets the class certification requirements of Rule 23(b)(3). First, Plaintiffs argue that common questions of law and fact -- especially \"whether Tisch Asia was the same program as Tisch NY,\" which Plaintiffs view as the \"predominant common question in this case\" -- predominate over any questions that affect only particular class members. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27-28.) Second, Plaintiffs contend that a class action is superior to other available methods of adjudicating these claims, because the alternative would be wastefully duplicative separate suits that share \"the core issue\" of whether NYU misrepresented \"that Tisch Asia and Tisch NY were equal programs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   NYU opposed class certification. As to the requirements of Rule 23(a), NYU first argues that Plaintiffs fail to establish numerosity because joinder is, in fact, practicable. NYU maintains that the Proposed Class members are sufficiently sophisticated -- and have large enough claimed damages -- such that it would be more appropriate to join them as individual plaintiffs. Second, NYU argues that the Proposed Class lacks common questions, because the case will require \"an individualized analysis of the circumstances surrounding each class member\" -- particularly on the question of each class member's reliance. (Opposition at 16.) Third, NYU contends that Plaintiffs' claims are not typical of class members' claims, because each Tisch Asia student \"had different reasons for attending\" and \"allege[s] different grievances about different aspects\" of Tisch Asia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.) Fourth, NYU asserts that Plaintiffs are inadequate class representatives because \"their testimony raises credibility issues as to key facts,\" and \"they generally lack knowledge about the issues in the case.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.) In particular, NYU notes that Hartman once described Tisch Asia as \"bar none the best decision of my life.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As to the requirements of Rule 23(b)(3), NYU first argues that predominance is not met because the \"issues subject to individualized proof far outweigh any issues subject to generalized proof.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22.) For instance, NYU maintains that Plaintiffs relied on different representations in deciding to enroll at Tisch Asia. NYU also argues that Plaintiffs allege that \"NYU injured them in different ways over different periods of time.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26.) Second, NYU asserts that superiority is not met, because \"the exceedingly individualized nature of each putative plaintiff's educational experience ... would be judicially inefficient and would risk jury confusion\" if the case were tried as a class action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In the reply brief Plaintiffs filed in further support of class certification, they abandoned their request to certify a class action as to the breach of contract claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Reply,\" Dkt. No. 104 at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As to the Rule 23(a) factors, Plaintiffs first counter that numerosity is presumed because NYU does not assert that the Proposed Class contains fewer than forty members. Plaintiffs argue that joinder would be impracticable, because the Proposed Class members live around the world and are fairly young professionals with student debt and limited budgets. Second, Plaintiffs contend that commonality is satisfied (1) because all three Plaintiffs relied on NYU's representation that Tisch New York and Tisch Asia \"were the same program\" and (2) because reliance is presumed, to the extent that the claims are based on omissions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) Insofar as\n   reliance requires individualized proof, Plaintiffs submit that, like damages, it \"can be dealt with in subsequent proceedings.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) Third, Plaintiffs argue that their claims are typical of the Proposed Class members' claims, because the common issues are central in all of their claims. Fourth, Plaintiffs assert that they are adequate class representatives, and the inconsistencies in their testimony identified by NYU are immaterial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As to the Rule 23(b)(3) factors, Plaintiffs argue that the common question of whether NYU concealed material facts predominates over any individualized questions. While Plaintiffs \"acknowledge that this is not the simplest case for certification[,]\" they submit that \"[t]o the extent it is even a close call, the Court should err towards granting certification.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"The class action is 'an exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and on behalf of individual named parties only.' \"\n   <em>\n    Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.

(Class Cert. Mem. at 22.) NYU disputes this figure, arguing that Plaintiffs overlook \"a number of factors that will preclude certain T[isch Asia] students from the putative class.\" (Opposition at 12.) NYU also argues that Plaintiffs have not shown that joinder would be impracticable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   First, the Court finds that the Proposed Class is sufficiently ascertainable, because membership can be established via the \"objective criteria\" of Tisch Asia enrollment records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Petrobras\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275849\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/862/250/#p260\">\n    862 F.3d at 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As to numerosity, the Court agrees with Plaintiffs that joinder would raise logistical complexities, given that the Proposed Class -- all alumni of the Singapore branch of an American university -- is spread across the globe. As NYU points out, however, this consideration is somewhat counterbalanced by the fact that Proposed Class members are adults with graduate education and claimed damages in the six figures, and who therefore perhaps have the incentive and means to join this suit as individual plaintiffs. The Court also notes that Plaintiffs' argument that joinder would be impracticable is in tension with their decision not to seek class certification on their breach of contract claim; it is not clear why joinder would be so impracticable for the fraud, negligent representation, and unjust enrichment claims as to require proceeding as a class action, if it is not equally impracticable for the breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   However, because NYU does not allege that the Proposed Class contains fewer than forty members, the Court gives Plaintiffs the benefit of the\n   <em>\n    Consolidated Rail\n   </em>\n   presumption. The Court declines NYU's invitation to find the Proposed Class insufficiently numerous on the basis of determinations that overlap with merits questions (for instance, on the basis that certain Proposed Class members should be excluded from the class enumeration because they may have no damages). Although NYU argues strongly that the case probably could proceed on a non-class basis with hundreds of individually joined plaintiffs, the Court finds that such a course of action would not be so much more economical from a case management perspective as to rebut the presumption and justify denying class certification on numerosity grounds alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court therefore finds that numerosity is satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Commonality\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Rule 23(a) requires class members' claims to share common questions of fact and law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

For example, the \"special relationship\" element of Plaintiffs' negligent misrepresentation claim will require a close examination of the Tisch Asia enrollment forms in order to determine how the nature of the relationship between matriculants and the school was memorialized. Whether, in fact, a \"special relationship\" formed in those documents is an open question of fact yet to be determined in this litigation, but the Court finds that the answer to that question would not necessarily vary from student to student.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Similarly, the Court notes that, in denying Plaintiffs' motion to further amend their complaint, Magistrate Judge Kevin Fox (who supervised the parties' pretrial proceedings) held that Plaintiffs have the option of establishing the second element of their negligent misrepresentation claim -- a false representation by NYU that NYU should have known was incorrect -- with proof of NYU's \"failure to impart information,\" as opposed to specific affirmative misrepresentations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 78 at 6.) Because Plaintiffs allege that NYU failed to impart the true state of Tisch Asia -- that is, that the institution was unviable, and the educational experience it provided was not equal to that of Tisch New York -- to the entire Tisch Asia student body with an intent to induce reliance for enrollment purposes, the question posed by that element stands to be answered class-wide with a single yes or no.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dukes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5930529,12450492\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/338/\">\n    564 U.S. at 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5930529,12450492\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/338/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defining a \"common question\" as one that yields a \"common answer[ ]\" and hence gives \"cause to believe that all [the Proposed Class members'] claims can productively be litigated at once\" (quoting Richard Nagareda, \" Class Certification in the Age of Aggregate Proof,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20N.Y.U.%20L.%20Rev.%2097\">\n    84 N.Y.U.

They allege different grievances about different aspects of T[isch Asia].\" (Opposition at 19.) \"It logically follows,\" NYU argues, \"that putative class members also would have relied on varying sources of information and factors in their decision to enroll at T[isch Asia], and would have had unique experiences at the School.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Court finds that Plaintiffs' claims typify those of the Proposed Class to the extent required by Rule 23(a).

Plaintiffs counter that these purported inadequacies are illusory and immaterial. The Court finds that the conflicts identified by NYU are not sufficiently \"fundamental\" to preclude class certification; there is no indication, for instance, that a recovery by the named Plaintiffs would preclude or impede recovery by other members of the Proposed Class.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Flag Telecom Holdings, Ltd.

If Tisch Asia dissolved because it was improperly managed and based on misrepresentations -- to be sure, a question that remains open and may well\n   be answered in the negative -- it is that harmful activity that tarnishes the brand, not the efforts of the victims to redress their claimed injuries. Moreover, members of a Rule 23(b)(3) class have the ability to opt out and need not associate themselves with the suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Court is also mindful that, given Plaintiffs' decision not to seek certification of their breach of contract claim, class certification would likely foreclose the other Proposed Class members' contract claims due to claim preclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Vitamin C Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4279683\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/279/90/#p114\">\n    279 F.R.D. 90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 114 (E.D.N.Y. 2012). Such \"splitting\" of class members' claims by the class representatives can raise an adequacy concern sufficient to defeat class certification, especially where -- unlike Plaintiffs here -- the class representatives seek certification only on minor claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feinstein v.

The Court finds that no such concern is present here. Not only are the fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims significant causes of action, Plaintiffs also seek certification with respect to the unjust enrichment claim -- which they originally pleaded as an alternative to the contract claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Amended Complaint \u00b6 112.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Finally, the Court notes that Plaintiffs have seen this case through the discovery process, which included full-day depositions for each of them.
