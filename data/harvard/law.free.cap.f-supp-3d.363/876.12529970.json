[Dkt. # 8]. The case was reassigned initially to another Magistrate Judge. It was only recently reassigned to me on January 10, 2019. [Dkt. # 30]. Plaintiff asks the court to reverse and remand the Commissioner's decision, while the Commissioner seeks an order affirming the decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff was 54 years old at the time of the ALJ's decision. (R. 32, 190). He worked steadily from 1983 through 2003 (R.219), most recently as a maintenance man for a church. (R. 219). That job involved lifting and carrying no more than 10 pounds, and an hour each of walking, standing, sitting, climbing, stooping and crawling. (R. 220). His previous job, as a city sanitation worker, was more strenuous, requiring him to lift up to 20 pounds and stand and walk all day. (R. 221). Earlier in his tenure in that position, he had to lift over 50 pounds with a co-worker. (R. 222). Plaintiff last worked in 2007 when the church maintenance job was phased out. (R. 57).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The medical record in this case is a little over 200 pages - relatively small, as these case go. (R. 268-479). Very little of it is pertinent. Indeed, Plaintiff's brief cites just 10 pages of it. [Dkt. # 18, at 3, 5]. Moreover, the evidence he is pointing to only dates back to October of 2012, and the more significant findings are from the July 2013 and later periods. [Dkt. # 18, at 2]. That makes things difficult for plaintiff to establish that he was disabled before the expiration of his insured status on December 31, 2012 (R. 27) - and of course the\n   burden is his.\n   <em>\n    Shideler v. Astrue\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3496621\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/688/306/#p311\">\n    688 F.3d 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 311 (7th Cir. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After an administrative hearing - at which plaintiff, represented by counsel, and a vocational expert testified - the ALJ determined he was not disabled. The ALJ found that plaintiff's medically determinable impairments - \"pulmonary embolism in 2012 and left hip osteoarthritis obliterated in 2013\" - were not severe prior to the expiration of plaintiff's insured status. (R. 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the ALJ's summarization of the medical evidence, she reviewed the records of plaintiff's trips to the clinic in 2009 and 2010. Significantly, the plaintiff denied any health issues at those visits and, aside from a \"waddling gait\" from an old leg injury, examinations were normal. It was not until October of 2012 that plaintiff began to experience pain in the right side of his chest. This was due to a pulmonary embolism, which was treated. By the next visit in November 2012, the findings were normal. They remained normal through the next summer, and Coumadin was discontinued. In July 2013, however, an x-ray of plaintiff's left hip showed advanced osteoarthritis in left hip. He was limping and had a decreased range of motion. (R. 29-30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The ALJ correctly noted that there was very little medical evidence prior to the expiration of plaintiff's insured status. She acknowledged that plaintiff had no health insurance but, even so, when he went to the free clinic he had no complaints, had normal exams and sought no treatment. His pulmonary embolism, which occurred while he was insured, resolved in fewer than 12 months. (R. 30). The ALJ noted that plaintiff testified that he did not stop working due to any impairment, but because his job was phased out. He said he did not seek employment after that because he was taking care of his daughter. (R. 29, 30). He cooked, did household chores, and drove. (R. 29, 30). In the end, the ALJ concluded that plaintiff's allegations that his symptoms were disabling prior to December 31, 2012, were \"not entirely consistent with the medical evidence and other evidence in the record ....\" (R. 30). That conclusion was then explained by the ALJ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The ALJ considered the reports of the state agency physicians who reviewed the record and found the evidence did not establish a severe impairment prior to the date last insured. She found these opinions to be supported by the record. (R. 31). But, the ALJ found the opinion of Dr. Barry that plaintiff should be found disabled so, as Dr. Barry said, he could obtain health insurance and a hip replacement. That request - for that is what it was - was entitled to no weight. There was nothing in the Opinion dealing with plaintiff's condition prior to the expiration of his insured status, and need for health insurance was not the dispositive factor for a finding of disability. (R. 31). In the end, the ALJ concluded that plaintiff had failed to prove he was disabled before his insurance expired and was, therefore not entitled to benefits under the Act. (R. 31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   If the ALJ's decision is supported by substantial evidence, the court on judicial review must uphold that decision even if the court might have decided the case differently in the first instance.

On the one hand, an x-ray of Plaintiff's left hip from July 16, 2013, revealed \"advanced arthritic changes ... with essentially total destruction of the joint space itself ....\" (R. 390). Of course, that came seven months after Plaintiff's insured status expired. But, as the ALJ noted, Plaintiff's hip didn't deteriorate within those seven months. (R. 30). There was some level of impairment prior to that. But there's simply little or no evidence for the ALJ to have considered, and, importantly, it was Plaintiff's burden to come up with some.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eichstadt v.

[Dkt. # 18, at 7]. The ruling, which has never been applied in a federal court case, notably reminds us that, \"[a]t the second step of sequential evaluation, ...\n   <em>\n    medical evidence alone\n   </em>\n   is evaluated in order to assess the effects of the impairment(s) on ability to do basic work activities.\" https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/rulings/di/01/SSR85-28-di-01.html. When discussing whether he can perform his past work, however, Plaintiff cites absolutely no medical evidence, relying instead on a snippet of testimony from his hearing. [Dkt. # 18, at 6-7]. As such, SSR 85-28p is no help to Plaintiff. Moreover, despite Plaintiff's description in his brief of his past work, his job as a church janitor, according to him, did not involve lifting up to 50 pounds or standing or walking six hours a day. (R. 56-57; 220). It was - again, according to Plaintiff, far less demanding than that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff also points to a March 7, 2014 letter from one of his doctors, Dr. Baker, who wrote a letter on Plaintiff's behalf stating that the Plaintiff had been receiving care at the health center for the past few years, that his left hip pain was \"severe and intermittently progressive.\" He needed a hip replacement and medical insurance. The doctor didn't indicate when or whether the hip problem left Plaintiff disabled, but said that Plaintiff deserved \"disability insurance or even Medical Insurance so that he can get the hip replacement ... and help restore [his] quality of life.\" (R. 389). The ALJ rejected this opinion, giving it no weight. (R. 31). Plaintiff argues that this was improper. [Dkt. # 18, at 7-9].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Paraphrasing what the ALJ is thought to have stated about this letter in her Opinion, is not particularly helpful to plaintiff's case. (R. 31).

The ALJ said that this fact suggested that plaintiff, himself, felt he could work at that time. After all, a person who believes he is incapable of work generally will tend not to look for work. While the behavior is not conclusive, it is certainly a fact that an ALJ can\n   consider along with the other relevant facts of the case in determining disability. (R. 30). Unlike the case Plaintiff relies on, the ALJ never said that this was evidence of an ability to work,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gerstner v.

After all, a person who is incapable of work will tend generally not to seek out that which he believes he cannot do.

An inability to afford treatment can be a valid reason for not seeking care; but that's not remotely the case here, and the plaintiff's contention that it is misreads and distorts the ALJ's Opinion, which refutes the reading accorded to it by the plaintiff's brief:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   The claimant alleged he did not seek treatment due to a lack of insurance; however, the objective evidence demonstrates the claimant sought treatment from a low income/free clinic, suggesting the claimant was aware of these types of clinics in the area.... His lack of health insurance does not explain why the claimant continued to deny any limitations and fail to report any symptoms to the providers at the free clinic. (R. 30).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The reasons given by the ALJ were more than sufficient to allow rejection of the plaintiff's testimony that he could not stand for more than an hour or walk for more than ten minutes.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schloesser v.

There was nothing preventing Plaintiff from going to the clinic - as he in fact did - and once there, nothing prevented him from reporting his problems to the doctors there - if, in fact, his claims to the ALJ were true.
