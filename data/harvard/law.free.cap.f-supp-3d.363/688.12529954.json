Plaintiff alleges that on April 20, 2018,\n   while riding in the passenger seat of a vehicle owned by his employer, he filmed a video that criticized Defendant's driving and posted it on his own personal Facebook profile. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-6.) Defendant, who was a sitting state senator and a candidate for United States Congress at the time, posted a response video later that night to his official \"OjedaForCongress\" Facebook page. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-10.)

The following Monday morning, April 23, 2018, the owner fired Plaintiff and stated that Plaintiff \"shouldn't have posted the video\" because he was \"interfering in a federal election.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff filed this action shortly thereafter.

The court further emphasized that the page was \"categorized as that of a government official,\" identified the defendant according to her official title, and provided an official email address in the contact information.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519694\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/912/666/#p679\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519694\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/912/666/#p679\">\n    at 680-81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court concluded, \"A private citizen could not have created and used the Chair's Facebook Page in such a manner.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519694\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/912/666/#p679\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519694\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/912/666/#p679\">\n    at 681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court also noted that \"the specific actions giving rise to [the plaintiff's] claim ... are linked to events which arose out of h[er] official status.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519694\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/912/666/#p679\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In this case, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant posted the response video on his \"OjedaForCongress\" Facebook page, \"over which he exerts plenary control\" and which he uses \"as his official Facebook account, both as a member of the West Virginia Senate[ ] and as a candidate for [United States Congress].\" (ECF No. 1 at 13.) Plaintiff further alleges that Defendant, like the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Davison\n   </em>\n   , uses his official Facebook page \"to share information with his constituents, as well as for campaign purposes.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant \"discusses political issues ... and invites discussion from members of the public,\" as well as \"promot[ing] and invit[ing] attendance at events related to [Defendant's] work as a senator.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He signs posts with \"WV Sen. Richard Ojeda\" and posts videos \"from the floor of the legislature.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) These allegations suggest that the \"OjedaForCongress\" Facebook page, like the page at issue in\n   <em>\n    Davison\n   </em>\n   , is an official Facebook page maintained by a government actor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that in the response video, Defendant accused Plaintiff of driving erratically in the company vehicle and stated that Plaintiff was \"mad at me because I beat his person in the last political race.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7.) Defendant also mentioned Plaintiff's employer, stating that he \"hope[s] the people that are running [the company employing Plaintiff] ... sees [sic] this video\" and claiming that he is \"gonna go to [the company] and I'm gonna let them know point blank ... that [Plaintiff's driving] is unacceptable.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) Defendant posted this video not to his personal Facebook account, but to his official Facebook page with more than 50,000 followers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6, 14.) Many of these followers are Defendant's constituents, with whom he communicates regularly via the page. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.) In fact, Plaintiff's employer \"has been in business in [Defendant's] district for 70 years[ ] and did not want to suffer retaliation and economic harm due to Plaintiff's political expression.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.) Plaintiff further alleges that the day after the incident, Defendant spoke with the owner of the store that employed Plaintiff, and that Plaintiff was fired on the following business day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.) When Plaintiff was fired, his employer told him that he was \"interfering in a federal election.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) These facts, which this Court must accept as true in ruling on Defendant's motion to dismiss, support an inference that Defendant used his position as a state senator to pressure Plaintiff's employer to fire Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nemet Chevrolet, Ltd. v. Consumeraffairs.com, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3506947\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/591/250/#p253\">\n    591 F.3d 250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 253 (4th Cir. 2009) (explaining that in ruling on a motion to dismiss, this Court \"must assume all [well-pled facts] to be true\" and \"draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In sum, under the facts pled in Plaintiff's complaint, the totality of the circumstances points to a conclusion that Defendant acted under color of state law in both posting the response video to his official Facebook page and making a phone call to Plaintiff's employer in an effort to have Plaintiff fired. Defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint on this basis is therefore\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    B. First Amendment Violation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant also contends that Plaintiff fails to plead a First Amendment retaliation claim because the complaint does not allege threats or coercion by the government or describe the conversation between Defendant and Plaintiff's employer. To make out a \u00a7 1983 First Amendment retaliation claim, \"a plaintiff must allege that (1) he engaged in protected First Amendment activity, (2) the defendant took some action that adversely affected his First Amendment rights, and (3) there was a causal relationship between his protected activity and the defendant's conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Martin v. Duffy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276329\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/239/#p249\">\n    858 F.3d 239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 249 (4th Cir. 2017) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). Defendant's challenge to the complaint goes to the second and third elements. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 6 at 11-14; ECF No. 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   With respect to the second element, Plaintiff has adequately pled an adverse effect on his First Amendment rights. \"Determining whether a plaintiff's First Amendment rights were adversely affected by retaliatory conduct is a fact intensive inquiry that focuses on the status of the speaker, the status of the retaliator, the relationship between the speaker and the retaliator, and the nature of the retaliatory acts.\"\n   <em>\n    Suarez Corp. Indus. v. McGraw\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"917937\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/202/676/#p686\">\n    202 F.3d 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 686 (4th Cir. 2000). Generally, \"a plaintiff suffers adverse action if the defendant's allegedly retaliatory conduct would likely deter 'a person of ordinary firmness' from the exercise of First Amendment rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276329\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/239/#p249\">\n    858 F.3d at 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, where, as here, \"a public official's alleged retaliation is in the nature of speech, in the absence of a threat, coercion, or intimidation intimating that punishment, sanction, or adverse regulatory action will imminently follow, such speech does not adversely affect a citizen's First Amendment rights, even if defamatory.\"\n   <em>\n    Suarez Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"917937\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/202/676/#p686\">\n    202 F.3d at 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Such coercion is present in the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant's statements about Plaintiff's employer \"can reasonably be interpreted as intimating that [Defendant] would punish, sanction, or take an adverse action against\" Plaintiff or \"utilize [his] government power to silence\" Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"917937\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/202/676/#p686\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"917937\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/202/676/#p686\">\n    at 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff alleges that Defendant threatened in the response video to \"go to [Plaintiff's employer] and ... let them know point blank ... that [Plaintiff's driving] is unacceptable.\" (ECF No. 1 at 7.) Plaintiff further alleges that Defendant did indeed contact Plaintiff's employer and that Plaintiff was fired when he arrived at work the next business day after the phone call. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.) When firing Plaintiff,\n   the owner told Plaintiff that Plaintiff \"shouldn't have posted the video\" because he was \"interfering in a federal election.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This alleged stated reason for firing Plaintiff implies that Defendant did not allow Plaintiff's employer \"to determine its own course of action,\"\n   <em>\n    Suarez Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"917937\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/202/676/#p686\">\n    202 F.3d at 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , because Plaintiff's employer \"has been in business in [Defendant's] district for 70 years[ ] and did not want to suffer retaliation and economic harm due to Plaintiff's political expression,\" (ECF No. 1 at 15). Taken together, these facts are sufficient to establish an adverse effect on Plaintiff's First Amendment rights at the motion to dismiss stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff has also adequately pled a causal relationship between the response video, Defendant's telephone call to Plaintiff's employer, and Plaintiff's termination. Defendant argues that Plaintiff's failure to plead any facts about the content of the phone call between Defendant and Plaintiff's employer is fatal to Plaintiff's claim. (ECF No. 6 at 14; ECF No. 8 at 4-5.) However, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant threatened to contact Plaintiff's employer in the response video posted to Defendant's official Facebook page, that Defendant did in fact contact Plaintiff's employer the following day, and that Plaintiff was fired on the first business day after the phone call. (ECF No. 1 at 7, 10.) Given this alleged course of events, this Court need not speculate about the conversation between Defendant and Plaintiff's employer to understand what Plaintiff alleges Defendant said during the call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff further alleges that his employer \"has been in business in [Defendant's] district for 70 years[ ] and did not want to suffer retaliation and economic harm due to Plaintiff's political expression,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15), and that Plaintiff's employer mentioned the video Plaintiff posted and the \"federal election\" in which Defendant was a candidate when firing Plaintiff, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10). Accepting these facts as true and construing all reasonable inferences in Plaintiff's favor, as this Court must do in ruling on the motion to dismiss,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nemet Chevrolet\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3506947\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/591/250/#p253\">\n    591 F.3d at 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Plaintiff has demonstrated that in response to the video Plaintiff posted, Defendant contacted Plaintiff's employer in order to pressure the owner to fire Plaintiff. Accordingly, Plaintiff has adequately pled a First Amendment violation, and Defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint on this basis is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendant's motion to dismiss, (ECF No. 6), is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Court\n   <strong>\n    DIRECTS\n   </strong>\n   the Clerk to send a copy of this Order to counsel of record and any unrepresented party.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Plaintiff argues that he is not required to plead \"a threat, coercion, or intimidation,\"\n    <em>\n     Suarez Corp.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"917937\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/202/676/#p686\">\n     202 F.3d at 687\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , because Defendant's response video and phone call concerned \"private information\" about Plaintiff.
