Brinkema, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In September 2016, Krista McClellan (\"plaintiff\"), an opera singer who often performs on public sidewalks in Alexandria, Virginia (\"Alexandria\" or the \"City\"), was arrested for violating the City's noise ordinance. In response, she filed a five-count complaint against the City and her arresting officer, Michael Dunkwu (\"Dunkwu\"). Plaintiff claims that the noise ordinance, on its face and as applied to her, violates the First Amendment (Count I); that the ordinance is unconstitutionally vague (Count II) and overbroad (Count III); and that her arrest violated her rights under the Equal Protection Clause (Count IV) and the Fourth Amendment (Count V). Counts I through III are asserted against the City only; Counts IV and V are brought against the City and Dunkwu (together, \"defendants\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. After oral argument on defendants' motion, the Court ruled as to Counts IV and V\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and took Counts I through III under advisement [Dkt. No. 32]. For the reasons stated below, defendants' motion to dismiss will be denied as to Counts I and II and granted as to Count III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff is an opera singer who has a music degree from Boston University, is a member of the Wagner Society of Washington, D.C., and has performed at the First Lady's Luncheon at the Congressional Club and in several countries around the world. Compl. [Dkt. No. 1] (\"Compl.\") \u00b6 6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   More locally, she often performs on public sidewalks in Old Town, Alexandria, with the aid of a small, portable Bluetooth speaker\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   from which she plays accompaniment music.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 2, 2016, at about 7:00 PM, plaintiff began to perform on a public sidewalk near the intersection of King and Lee Streets in Alexandria. Compl. \u00b6 15. She was not alone: Other musicians performing in the area that evening included a glass harpist, a guitarist, a saxophonist, a bongoist, and a dulcimerist.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. Plaintiff\n   placed her portable speaker inside the small wicker basket she uses to collect tips and set the basket a few feet in front of her on the sidewalk.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17, 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Because plaintiff had been performing in downtown Alexandria for years, she was aware that a City ordinance prohibits anyone from generating noise louder than 75 decibels (\"dB\") as measured from at least 10 feet away.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 7, 19. She took several precautions to ensure that her singing, together with the accompaniment music played through her speaker, would not exceed that threshold. The night before, her husband had adjusted the levels of the accompaniment tracks such that they would remain under 75 dB, as measured from approximately 10 feet away, when played at maximum volume.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. Once she began singing that evening, her husband also used a cellphone software application (\"app\") to measure her sound output from 10 to 15 feet away and confirmed that she was below 75 db.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff's performance on the night of September 2 started out well. Her husband as well as her mother and young daughter were in attendance, and many people stopped to listen or leave a tip. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 18, 23. Allison Silberberg, Alexandria's former mayor, even stopped to listen at one point; between songs, she complimented plaintiff on her singing and promised to put her in touch with people Silberberg knew at the Washington National Opera.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. Silberberg gave plaintiff her business card, which plaintiff deposited in her tip basket.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Things changed around 9:30 PM, when Dunkwu and another City police officer approached plaintiff and demanded that she turn off her speaker. The officers claimed that the City prohibited people from performing on public sidewalks with noise amplification devices. Compl. \u00b6 25. Plaintiff declined to turn off the speaker, explaining that she had been performing in Alexandria that way for years and that a week earlier, a different police officer had told her she could perform there.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. Dunkwu asked whether plaintiff had a permit to use the speaker; she did not.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's husband tried to show Dunkwu that the noise generated by the speaker and plaintiff's singing fell below 75 dB, but Dunkwu refused to look at the app, instead claiming \"that if he could hear [plaintiff's] performance from ten to fifteen feet away, then the performance must be in violation\" of the City's noise ordinance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Dunkwu told plaintiff that if she failed to turn off the speaker, he would issue her a citation. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 29-30. Plaintiff replied that \"she understood, and would accept the citation.\" Compl. \u00b6 30. Dunkwu backed off but returned a few minutes later, this time stating that if plaintiff continued to perform, he would forgo the citation and arrest her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31-32. Plaintiff responded, \"I understand,\" and continued to perform.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32. Her husband again attempted to come to her aid, telling Dunkwu that arresting plaintiff would constitute a violation of the First Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. Dunkwu responded that plaintiff's husband \"better back up\" or face an arrest \"for obstruction of justice.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's husband complied.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Around 9:45 PM-while plaintiff was performing Schubert's\n   <em>\n    Ave Maria\n   </em>\n   -three additional officers arrived, and plaintiff was handcuffed and placed under arrest. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 36-37. When asked why plaintiff had been arrested, Dunkwu responded, \"disorderly conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. The officers walked plaintiff across the street to where a squad car was parked, patted her down,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and placed her in the back of the car.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39-40. Officers seized her speaker, cellphone, and tip basket.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff was taken to a municipal detention center, subject to a second pat-down search, and forced to change into \"prison garb.\" Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 46-48. Plaintiff objects that other than a \"long-term, convicted inmate,\" no other individual held in police custody had been forced to change clothes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48. Plaintiff also protests that she was forced to change in front of detention staff officers,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49, and that the shoes she was forced to wear were too tight and caused her significant pain,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Around 10:50 PM-roughly an hour after she had been arrested-plaintiff was brought before a magistrate. Compl. \u00b6 51. Her hearing lasted about three minutes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55. Dunkwu appeared at the hearing and testified that he had booked plaintiff for violating section 11-5-4(b)(2) of the City Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff also testified that she had never had an issue with performing in that area of downtown Alexandria before, that spectators (including the mayor) had enjoyed her performance, and that she felt her arrest was in violation of the Constitution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53. The magistrate ordered that plaintiff be released on her own recognizance; however, officers at the detention center \"had difficulty entering the requisite arrest codes into their electronic system, as they had never before seen or used\" them, and consequently plaintiff was not actually released until 1:00 AM.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 56-58. Detention center officials gave plaintiff back her cellphone but held her basket and speaker overnight.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60. When plaintiff returned to collect those items the next day, Mayor Silberberg's business card and approximately $ 60 in tips were missing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On September 7, 2016, Assistant Commonwealth Attorney Sean Sherlock called plaintiff and left a voicemail stating that the charges against her would be dropped.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61. The charges were dismissed later that day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Also on September 7, the City issued a press release stating that plaintiff \"should have first been [issued] a civil notice\" and quoting the city manager as saying, \"I would like to publicly apologize to [plaintiff] for the way this situation was handled .... While we are obligated to enforce certain restrictions, we did not follow the correct procedure in this case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. B. The press release also stated that the City would review plaintiff's arrest as well as \"the general application of noise ordinances to street performers, so that performers, enforcement staff, and the community have a clear understanding of the rules.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ultimately, the City produced a memorandum to the chief of the Alexandria Police Department providing detailed guidance on the City Code's noise control provisions. Compl. Ex. C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that her arrest caused her a wide range of physical, psychological, emotional, and personal harms. She had a miscarriage in late September or early October 2016 and suffered heavy uterine bleeding that required surgery to correct. Compl. \u00b6 64. She was bedridden with anxiety and depression, was prescribed Xanax, and was referred to a psychiatrist, who \"provided her with educational materials concerning post-traumatic stress disorder and severe anxiety.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 66-67. Plaintiff suffered from preexisting foot conditions,\n   including \"plantar fasciitis, bursitis, and ligamentous laxity,\" which she claims were aggravated by being forced to wear shoes that were too tight while she was held in the municipal detention center.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 68-69. Plaintiff also avers that her arrest caused her reputational and stigmatic harm, reducing the frequency with which she has been hired to sing at private events and causing her considerable anxiety anytime she performs in public.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70. She also claims that for months after her arrest, police officers would constantly \"hover near her\" whenever she performed in downtown Alexandria, scaring away pedestrians and reducing her tips.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71. As a result, plaintiff claims her income was reduced to such an extent that she and her family were homeless for over a month and had to rely on emergency food providers and personal loans.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 72-73.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In Count I of her five-count complaint, plaintiff alleges that the City's noise ordinance, both on its face and as applied to her, violates her rights under the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. Counts II and III allege that the City's noise ordinance is void for vagueness and overbroad, respectively. Counts IV and V, asserted against both defendants, allege that plaintiff's arrest violated the Equal Protection Clause and the Fourth Amendment, respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendants moved to dismiss all five counts of the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). After oral argument on defendants' motion, Count IV was dismissed because plaintiff had failed to allege adequate facts to support her \"class of one\" equal protection claim. Count V was dismissed as to the City because plaintiff had failed to state a claim for failure to train under\n   <em>\n    City of Canton v.

Finally, Counts I through III were taken under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Title 11, Chapter 5 of the City Code is known as the \"Noise Control Code.\" As relevant here, the Noise Control Code contains two sets of regulations: One general set of provisions applies to the entire city, and a more specific set of provisions applies only in an area known as the \"central business district.\" The parties disagree about which provisions governed plaintiff's conduct on the night she was arrested, a fundamental issue that affects the analysis of defendants' motion to dismiss. Accordingly, the precise nature and interaction of the city-wide and central business district-specific provisions must be analyzed before defendants' motion as to Counts I through III may be addressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The city-wide provisions declare it \"unlawful for any person to make, continue, or cause to be made any excessive, unnecessary or unusually loud noise or any noise which unreasonably annoys, disturbs, injures or endangers the comfort, health, safety, welfare, or environment of others.\" Alexandria, Va., City Code (\"Code\") \u00a7 11-5-4(a). Section 11-5-4 contains a nonexhaustive list of acts \"declared to be unlawful\" in the city.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 11-5-4(b).

These include the \"level of noise\"; \"whether\n   the nature of the noise is usual or unusual\"; \"whether the origin of the noise is natural or unnatural\"; how close the noise is \"to residential sleeping facilities\"; the nature, zoning, and density of the area within which the noise emanates; the time of day the noise occurs; the duration, intensity, and frequency of the noise; and \"whether the noise is produced by a commercial or noncommercial activity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Noise Control Code makes clear that this list is nonexhaustive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The city-wide provisions also contain exemptions. Several relate to public utilities and public safety.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Code \u00a7 11-5-6. Another allows the city manager to issue permits for otherwise unlawful noise \"on the basis of undue hardship\" if the manager (or his designee) concludes that the applicant needs additional time to conform his noise-producing activity to the law or that the noisy activity is unavoidable or temporary.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 11-5-7(a).

Anyone who violates the Code is liable for a civil fine of $ 50, with escalating fines for repeat offenders. Code \u00a7 11-5-12(a). And \"[a]ny person who knowingly refuses or neglects to comply with any written order to cease or abate any violation of this chapter, issued by an authorized enforcement officer, shall be guilty of a class 2 misdemeanor.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 11-5-12(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Noise Control Code designates the City's \"special business district,\" which comprises a roughly 60-square-block area of downtown Alexandria,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. Ex. C [Dkt. No. 1-3] 4, for special treatment. Section 11-5-4.1 provides in pertinent part: \"Notwithstanding any conflicting provision of this chapter or other law, it shall be unlawful for any person to engage in ... any sound generation, as defined in this section, in or on any public or private street, sidewalk or alley ... within the central business district.\" Code \u00a7 11-5-4.1(a). \"Sound generation,\" in turn, is defined as \"any conduct, activity or operation, whether human, mechanical, electronic or other, ... which produces or generates sound in excess of the volume levels ... specified in this section.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 11-5-4.1(b). Those volume levels are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m., ... no sound generation shall result in sound having a volume of 75 db(A)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   or more, at a distance greater than 10 feet from the place at which the sound is being generated or produced, for an aggregate duration of time greater than 60 seconds in any one[-]hour period. Any sound that is plainly audible above the background noise level to a person of normal hearing acuity at a distance greater than 50 feet from the place at which the sound is being generated or produced shall be presumed to exceed 75 db(A) at 10 feet of distance and thus violate this subsection, and the burden shall be on the person responsible for such sound generation to prove otherwise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m., no sound generation shall exceed a volume of 65 db(A) at a distance greater than 10 feet from the place at which the sound is being generated or produced, for an aggregate duration of 60 seconds between such hours. Any sound that is plainly audible above the background noise level to a person of normal hearing acuity at a distance greater than 50 feet from the place at which the sound is being generated or produced shall be presumed to exceed 65 db(A) at 10 feet of distance and thus violate this subsection, and the burden shall be on the person responsible for such sound generation to prove otherwise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 11-5-4.1(c)-(d). Thus, section 11-5-4.1 employs two types of standards for unlawful noise within the central business district: a decibel threshold to be measured with an approved device from more than 10 feet away and a statutory presumption based on \"normal hearing acuity\".\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 11-5-4.1(\n   <em>\n    i\n   </em>\n   ) (providing that a violation may be proved by evidence demonstrating that either or both standards had been met).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   There is no doubt that on the night plaintiff was arrested, she was performing within the central business district. The more challenging question is which of the Noise Control Code's provisions governed her noise-generating conduct that night. This appears to be an issue of first impression, as the parties have not cited, and independent research has not revealed, any federal or state case law addressing the current version of the Noise Control Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   One aspect of that question is easily answered: Section 11-5-4.1 applies \"[n]otwithstanding any conflicting provision of this chapter of other law,\" Code \u00a7 11-5-4.1(a), so plaintiff faced liability for making noise that (i) exceeded 75 db as measured from over 10 feet away or (ii) was plainly audible to a person of normal hearing acuity from over 50 feet away.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 11-5-4.1(c). Another question remains: To what extent was plaintiff also subject to the other, city-wide provisions of the Noise Control Code? That is, does section 11.5.4-1 wholly supplant the Code's city-wide provisions within the central business district, or do the city-wide provisions also apply within the district unless they squarely conflict with section 11.5.4-1's terms? Put another way: Is the Code's carve-out in section 11-5-4.1 more like field preemption or conflict preemption?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The best reading of the Code is that people making noise in the central business district are subject to liability under\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   the city-wide and district-specific provisions.

To begin, it is far from clear that plaintiff's arrest had anything to do with the 75-db threshold. She alleges that she took precautions designed to ensure that her performance remained under that threshold, and nothing in the facts (as pleaded) indicates otherwise. Plaintiff's description of Dunkwu's comments to her on the night of the arrest-that she was violating the City's noise ordinance not because she was over 75 db, but rather because she was using a speaker without a permit and because her performance was audible from 10 to 15 feet away-supports her claim. Indeed, when she was brought before a magistrate, she was charged with violating section 11-5-4(b)(2)-that is, for using a sound reproduction device \"in such manner as to disturb unreasonably the\n   comfort, health, peace, safety, or welfare and environment of the neighboring inhabitants.\" Plaintiff's allegations, if proved, would indicate that she was arrested while making noise below the threshold, which gives the lie to defendants' claim that all she had to do to comply with the ordinance was to lower her volume.
