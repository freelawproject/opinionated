INTRODUCTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Cali Longtin (\"Plaintiff\") brings this action against Organon USA, Inc., N.V. Organon, Schering Corp., Merck &amp; Co., Inc., and Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme (\"Defendants\"), for claims related to a stroke she suffered in New Jersey following her use of NuvaRing, a prescription contraceptive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Presently before the court is Defendants' motion for summary judgment as to all counts. (Dkt. No. 90.) For the following reasons, the court will grant Defendants' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   II. BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following facts, which are construed in a light most favorable to Plaintiff, are not disputed, except as otherwise noted. In 2008, while living in Massachusetts, Plaintiff began using NuvaRing following an appointment with Mary Casartello, a certified nurse midwife at Riverbend Medical Group. (Dkt. No. 98, Pl's Resp. to Def's Statement of Material Facts (\"Pl's Resp. to Def's SOF\") \u00b6 33; Dkt. No. 104, Def's Resp. to Pl's Statement of Additional Material\n   Facts (\"Def's Resp. to Pl's SOF\") \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.) NuvaRing is a combination hormonal contraceptive (\"CHC\") containing the hormones estrogen and progestin. (Pl's Resp. to Def's SOF \u00b6 1.) Unlike oral contraceptives, NuvaRing is a flexible ring that is inserted in a woman's vagina once every 28 days and is removed after day 21 for a seven-day ring-free interval, after which a new NuvaRing is inserted and the 28-day process begins again. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) Between 2008 and 2010, while living in Massachusetts, Plaintiff used NuvaRing as prescribed and did not use any other form of hormonal contraceptive. (Def's Resp. to Pl's SOF \u00b6 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In October of 2010, Plaintiff moved to New Jersey for a new job, where she continued using NuvaRing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-19.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On September 27, 2013, Plaintiff saw Dr. Kimberlee Austin, an obstetrician/gynecologist in New Jersey, for an appointment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) At that appointment, Dr. Austin prescribed Plaintiff NuvaRing, recognizing Plaintiff was using the medication, and provided samples. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23-24; Pl's Resp. to Def's SOF \u00b6 39.) From September 27, 2013 to January 16, 2014, Plaintiff used the NuvaRing samples Dr. Austin provided, as instructed. (Def's Resp. to Pl's SOF \u00b6 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 16, 2014, Plaintiff suffered a left middle cerebral artery stroke, resulting in cognitive and physical deficits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) In May of 2014, Plaintiff moved back to Massachusetts to live with her parents. (Dkt. No. 90-19 at 66, 96.) Plaintiff has since remained in Massachusetts, but moved to her own apartment in June of 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 65-66.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Organon had submitted a New Drug Application (\"NDA\") for NuvaRing on December 28, 1999, seeking the approval of the Federal Drug Administration (\"FDA\") to market the product in the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) The NDA included proposed language for the labels addressed to both doctors and patients warning of the risk of stroke, among other complications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12, 14.) Following some minor changes to the proposed stroke warning labels requested by the FDA and accepted by Organon, those warnings ultimately provided as follows. The label addressed to doctors stated, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   NuvaRing \u00ae (etonogestrel /ethinyl estradiol ring) and other contraceptives that contain both an estrogen and a progestin are called combination hormonal contraceptives. There is no epidemiologic data available to determine whether safety and efficacy with the vaginal route of administration of combination hormonal contraceptives would be different than the oral route. Practitioners prescribing NuvaRing \u00ae should be familiar with the following information relating to these risks.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The use of oral contraceptives is associated with increased risks of several serious conditions including myocardial infarction, thromboembolism, stroke, hepatic neoplasia, and gallbladder disease, although the risk of serious morbidity or mortality is very small in\n   healthy women without underlying risk factors....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Cerebrovascular diseases\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Oral contraceptives have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes ), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (&gt;35 years), hypertensive women who also smoke.... In a large study, the relative risk of thrombotic strokes has been shown to range from 3 for normotensive users to 14 for users with severe hypertension. The relative risk of hemorrhagic stroke is reported to be 1.2 for non-smokers who used oral contraceptives, 2.6 for smokers who did not use oral contraceptives, 7.6 for smokers who used oral contraceptives, 1.8 for normotensive users and 25 for users with severe hypertension. The attributable risk is also greater in older women.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (Dkt. No. 90-2 at 15-16, 18-19.) The label addressed to patients stated, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   NuvaRing \u00ae contains a combination of a progestin and estrogen, two kinds of female hormones....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Contraceptives that contain both an estrogen and a progestin are called combination hormonal contraceptives. Most studies on combination contraceptives have used oral (taken by mouth) contraceptives. NuvaRing \u00ae may have the same risks that have been found for combination oral contraceptives. This leaflet will tell you about risks of taking combination oral contraceptives that may also apply to NuvaRing \u00ae users.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    What are the possible risks and side effects of NuvaRing \u00ae?\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    Heart attacks and strokes\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Hormonal contraceptives may increase your risk of strokes (blockage of blood flow to the brain) or heart attacks (blockage of blood flow to the heart). Any of these conditions can cause death or serious disability....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37, 46.) The FDA approved NuvaRing and its doctor and patient labels on October 10, 2001. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff commenced this action on January 29, 2015. (Dkt. No. 1.) On March 2, 2015, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (\"JPML\") issued a Conditional Transfer Order transferring this action to MDL No. 1964 in the Eastern District of Missouri for consolidated pretrial proceedings pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201407\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Dkt. Nos. 6-7.) On November 1, 2016, the JPML remanded this action from the MDL to this court for case-specific discovery and further proceedings. (Dkt. Nos. 9-10.) Defendants filed a motion for\n   summary judgment on July 9, 2018, Plaintiff filed an opposition on August 16, 2018, and Defendants filed a reply on August 30, 2018. (Dkt. Nos. 90, 97, and 103.)

ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Choice of Law\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendants assert New Jersey law applies because Plaintiff was a New Jersey resident when she suffered her stroke, she obtained the NuvaRing which allegedly caused her stroke in New Jersey from a New Jersey physician, and New Jersey is Defendants' principal place of business and the location where Defendants engaged in the labeling and marketing of NuvaRing. In contrast, Defendants assert, Massachusetts has a minimal connection to this case. Plaintiff, on the other hand, argues Massachusetts law applies, citing that Plaintiff first started using NuvaRing in Massachusetts and she obtained most of the medication in Massachusetts. Plaintiff also points out that she lived in Massachusetts most of her life and moved back to Massachusetts shortly after her stroke. In addition, Plaintiff's counsel asserted at the hearing it was not clear whether the NuvaRing Plaintiff was using at the time of her stroke was obtained from Massachusetts or New Jersey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Where, as here, a federal court exercises diversity jurisdiction, \"[t]he question of which state's law applies is resolved using the choice of law analysis of the forum state-in this case, Massachusetts.\"\n   <em>\n    Reicher v.

Contrary to Plaintiff's counsel's point raised at the hearing, there is no evidence to support the assertion that the NuvaRing Plaintiff was using on the day of her stroke was obtained in Massachusetts. In Plaintiff's affidavit, filed in support of her opposition to Defendants' motion for summary judgment, she attests: \"From September 27, 2013 to the date of my stroke, I used the NuvaRing\u00ae samples Dr. Austin gave me, as instructed.\" (Dkt. No. 98-1 \u00b6 27.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, both the injury and the conduct causing the injury occurred in New Jersey.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ogburn-Sisneros v.

As a result, New Jersey has the \"dominant interest\" in both regulating Defendants' conduct and in determining whether, as a result of the injury, Plaintiff is entitled to recourse.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws (1971) \u00a7 146, cmt. d (explaining that when the \"conduct and injury\" occur in the same state, that state \"will usually be the state of dominant interest\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ricci v.

This will be so, for example, when the place of injury can be said to be fortuitous or when for other reasons it bears little relation to the occurrence and the parties with respect to the particular issue ....\"). Moreover, the fact that Plaintiff first started using NuvaRing in Massachusetts and subsequently moved back to the state does not, under these circumstances, give Massachusetts a more significant relationship to the underlying claims.

One of Defendants' experts, Mitchell S. V. Elkind, MD, MS, who\n   is both a medical doctor and a stroke epidemiologist, explained that Dr. McGwin's analysis\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   inappropriately combines venous and arterial thrombotic events. Venous and arterial events, however, are very distinct, with different risk factors and causes, and combining them in an analysis of the risk of stroke associated with a medication, such as NuvaRing, is not reliable. The event rates for arterial events are much lower than for venous events among users of hormonal contraceptives. Folding together arterial events with venous events is not helpful to clinicians as it does not allow one to draw independent conclusions about those arterial events if the effects are driven by the outcome of venous events. Other studies on the effect of hormonal contraceptives do not combine venous and arterial events.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   (Dkt. No. 90-12 \u00b6 101.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   This evidence, regarding the medical differences between arterial strokes and VTEs and the flaws in combining the two injuries, has not been contested. In fact, Plaintiff's own experts agree with Dr. Elkind that stroke and VTE are distinct injuries. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 90-24 at 83-89; Dkt. No. 90-25 at 99.) Moreover, the FDA-approved label for NuvaRing discusses stroke and VTE separately, as do the various studies relied upon by the FDA and the experts in this case. The court also notes that most of the previous NuvaRing cases dealt with VTE, not stroke, and the one case that did address stroke specifically rejected a similar attempt to conflate the two injuries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re NuvaRing Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%201874321\">\n    2013 WL 1874321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *23 (\"All of Plaintiff's arguments regarding post-approval disputes, in attempt to rebut the 'super-presumption' using the\n   <em>\n    Perez\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    McDarby\n   </em>\n   exceptions, are based on VTE injuries, which are unrelated to Ms. Mariconda's cause of death.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Accordingly, the court concludes Plaintiff has not met her burden of demonstrating that the\n   <em>\n    McDarby\n   </em>\n   exception applies. The \"super-presumption\" in favor of the FDA-approved warning label is therefore dispositive of these claims under the PLA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"861620,23935\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/734/1245/\">\n    734 A.2d at 1259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   There is also an independent reason to dismiss these claims. Even if Plaintiff could somehow surmount the \"super-presumption,\" she has presented no expert testimony that the NuvaRing warning label was inadequate. \"Pursuant to New Jersey law, in a case involving the adequacy of a prescription medication's label and warnings, expert testimony is necessary for Plaintiff to prove his case.\"\n   <em>\n    Nelson v.

In any event, as Defendants argue (and Plaintiff has not disputed), because Plaintiff received her last NuvaRing prescription and samples in September of 2013, before the updated labeling went into effect, the October of 2013 updated labeling is not relevant to Plaintiff's claims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    The Supreme Judicial Court in\n    <em>\n     Cosme\n    </em>\n    , after stating it was \"guided by the Restatement,\" explained that \"[s]ection 145 of the Restatement provides the general principle 'applicable to all torts and to all issues in tort,' ... and \u00a7 146 of the Restatement provides a principle applicable in issues concerning causes of action involving person injury.\"\n    <em>\n     Cosme\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=632%20N.E.2d%20832\">\n     632 N.E.2d at 834-35\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting Restatement (Second) Conflict of Laws \u00a7 145, cmt. a).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Section 145 of the Restatement, entitled \"The General Principle,\" provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n    (1) The rights and liabilities of the parties with respect to an issue in tort are determined by the local law of the state which, with respect to that issue, has the most significant relationship to the occurrence and the parties under the principles stated in \u00a7 6.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n    (2) Contacts to be taken into account in applying the principles of \u00a7 6 to determine the law applicable to an issue include: (a) the place where the injury occurred, (b) the place where the conduct causing the injury occurred, (c) the domicil, residence, nationality, place of incorporation and place of business of the parties, and (d) the place where the relationship, if any, between the parties is centered.
