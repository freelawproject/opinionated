INTRODUCTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 21, 2017, Goodman filed a petition (Doc. No. 2-2) in the Iowa District Court for Woodbury County against Performance Contractors, Inc. (PCI), Kelly Pabst and Derek Racca, in which he made allegations about events that occurred while he was employed at a PCI construction site in Sergeant Bluff, Iowa. This case was removed to this court on October 6, 2017, on the basis of diversity jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In his state court petition, Goodman asserted claims for (1) discrimination on the basis of race and retaliation in violation of the Iowa Civil Rights Act, Iowa Code Chapter 216 (ICRA) and (2) defamation. Doc. No. 2-2. Goodman filed an amended complaint (Doc. No. 23) on January 23, 2018, in which he added a third count alleging discrimination on the basis of race and retaliation in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 2, 2018, Goodman dismissed Pabst as a defendant. Doc. No. 28. Thus, as currently situated, Count I asserts retaliation and discrimination claims, against PCI only, pursuant to the ICRA; Count II asserts defamation claims against PCI and Racca; and Count III asserts retaliation and discrimination claims, against PCI only, pursuant to Title VII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II. RELEVANT FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following facts are undisputed, except where noted otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   PCI is a private industrial construction contractor, headquartered in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. PCI engages in industrial construction throughout the United States in various industries including fertilizer, chemical and steel. PCI was hired by CF Industries to construct and expand a fertilizer plan in Sergeant Bluff, Iowa. The project began in 2013. Goodman began work as a rigger\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   at the Sergeant Bluff\n   site on September 21, 2015. In mid-October 2015, Goodman was assigned to work with crane operator Kelly Pabst. Derek Racca was another employee who knew Pabst and had worked with Goodman on one occasion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Goodman claims that from mid-October through mid-November 2015, Pabst made a racial comment to him or around him every other day, which included references to black people as thugs, repeating stereotypes and telling him a story in which someone else used the word \"nigger.\" Pabst did not direct that word at Goodman and no one else at Performance referred to Goodman by that word. Goodman additionally claims that on November 10, 2015, he got coffee for Pabst and she said, \"that's all you black people ever do is put a lot of cream in your coffee.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, Goodman claims he told Pabst not to stereotype him. For the remainder of that day, Goodman avoided talking to Pabst about anything other than work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On Wednesday, November 11, 2015, Pabst made a written report to Human Resources (HR) alleging that Goodman had made threats of violence against the workplace by threatening to \"shoot up\" the job site. Goodman asserts that he never made any threats.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   That same day Racca similarly told HR that Goodman had made threats of violence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response to Pabst's and Racca's allegations, Goodman was escorted off the job site that day. Both Pabst and Racca state that they spoke to Leon Strickland, a general foreman at PCI, about Goodman's threats.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Strickland testified that he does not recall any discussion of the alleged threats with Pabst or Racca.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On Thursday, November 12, 2015, Goodman returned to the job site to pick up his check and ask about his employment status. The parties dispute what Andrew Morel, the HR Manager, told Goodman at this meeting. Goodman argues that Morel did not tell Goodman about Pabst's and Racca's accusations, but the defendants contend that Morel informed Goodman about the accusations. Both parties agree that Goodman completed a written statement. In that statement, Goodman wrote that Pabst had made racially stereotyping comments \"the day before yesterday\" - presumably November 10-and that he objected to those comments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On Friday, November 13, 2015, Morel contacted Corporate HR Manager Sarah Borne to ask how he should proceed. Borne instructed Morel to re-question Pabst and Racca in light of Goodman's statement. Morel called Goodman later that day and mentioned the allegations that Goodman had threatened to shoot up the job site. Goodman told Morel during that phone call that another employee named Silas Thompson had heard Pabst make racist statements. Morel never contacted Silas Thompson to discuss with him whether or not he had heard Pabst make racist statements. Goodman moved to Texas on either that same day or on Saturday, November 14, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On Monday November 16, 2015, Goodman went to PCI's office in Deer Park,\n   Texas and completed a second written statement complaining that Pabst made false allegations against him because she thought he was going to report her to HR for her discriminatory comments. As of 11:06 a.m. on November 16, Morel had not made a final decision on whether or not to fire Goodman. Morel received Goodman's second complaint via email at 12:09 p.m. Morel sent an email at 2:01 p.m. indicating that he had decided to fire Goodman. Goodman's employment was officially terminated that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Additional facts will be discussed below, as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     III.

In fact, Goodman agrees that after he complained of discrimination, Morel told him of the accusations against him during a phone call the following day. Doc. No. 69-1 at 99.

For example, of those four employees, Frederick Thomas' firing was closest in time to Goodman's. Daniel Thomas was fired almost a year after Goodman and Quinonez and Hafner were fired around six to seven months before Goodman. While Quinonez was fired close in time to her complaint, like Goodman, Frederick Thomas was not.

However, that policy states that PCI reserves the right to\n   proceed directly to termination if deemed necessary. Doc. Nos. 70-1 at 45-46; 68-3 at 66. Goodman also relies on Morel's description of how he generally conducts investigations. Morel testified that a history of complaints can be a factor in determining credibility, that he tries to \"get deep in the situation,\" that he likes to talk to the complainant to get as much information as he can in order to compare that information to a written statement and that he does what he can with what he has.

Those statements do not establish the existence of a policy that Morel violated during the investigation.

While there appears to be no Iowa authority directly on point, I predict that the Iowa Supreme Court would concur that an employee does not act within the scope of his or her employment if the employee makes false statements to the employer about a co-worker, at least in the absence of evidence that the employee was authorized to do so. Thus, even assuming Racca and Pabst published false statements about Goodman to PCI, such conduct cannot be imputed to PCI because it was not within the scope of Racca's and Pabst's employment. Because there is no evidence that PCI re-published the statements, PCI is entitled to summary judgment on Goodman's defamation claim, as set forth in Count II. This leaves for consideration Goodman's defamation claim against Racca.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. Qualified privilege\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Racca contends that he is entitled to qualified privilege as to the defamation claim against him. A qualified privilege exists when an otherwise defamatory statement was (1) made in good faith; (2) \"the defendant had an interest uphold; (3) the scope of the statement was limited to the identified interest; and (4) the statement was published on a proper occasion, in a proper manner, and to proper parties only.\"\n   <em>\n    Barreca v.
