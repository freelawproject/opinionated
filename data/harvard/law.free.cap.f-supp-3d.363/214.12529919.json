For instance, in\n   <em>\n    American Antenna Corp. v.

Therefore, the court concluded \"Plaintiff has not alleged that defendant disclosed the trade secrets to a third party or that defendant's manner of using the trade secrets to manufacture the components was inconsistent with the terms of the contract.\n   <em>\n    Defendant's use of the trade secrets was the use specifically contemplated by the contract\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=546%20N.E.2d%2041\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    David Mizer Enterprises, Inc. v.
