(Nautilus I MJP, ECF No. 14; Nautilus II MJP, ECF No. 41.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In each of these Motions, Nautilus seeks a declaratory judgment that it does not have a duty to defend and indemnify 200 Christian Street Partners, Virgil Procaccino, and Arthur Elwood (collectively, \"Defendants\") in two underlying lawsuits. We will deny Nautilus's Motions. Nautilus has a duty to defend Defendants in the underlying actions because the plaintiffs in the underlying actions sufficiently allege products-related tort claims such that there may have been an \"occurrence\" as that term is defined in Defendants' policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This action relates to two homes that Defendant constructed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. One of the homes is located at 501A South 12th Street and the other is located at 507 South 12th Street. The owners of each of the homes (collectively, the \"Owners\") allege that the homes were defectively constructed. They have each brought lawsuits against Defendants for damages regarding the defects. On November 4, 2016, the owners of the home located at 501A South 12th Street filed a complaint in this Court. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl.,\n   <em>\n    Milo, LLC v. Procaccino et al.\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-5759 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 4, 2016) (\"\n   <em>\n    Milo\n   </em>\n   \") (ECF No. 1).) On September 21, 2017, the owners of the home located at 507 South 12th Street filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl.,\n   <em>\n    Zachary Klehr et al. v. Procaccino et al.\n   </em>\n   , No. 170902547 (Ct. Com. Pl., Phila. Cty., Pa. Sep. 21, 2017) (\"\n   <em>\n    Klehr\n   </em>\n   \") ) (\n   <em>\n    Klehr\n   </em>\n   complaint, together with\n   <em>\n    Milo\n   </em>\n   complaint, the \"Underlying Complaints\"). On January 9, 2018, and May 2, 2018, Defendants filed joinder complaints adding subcontractors and product suppliers as defendants in each underlying action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In their respective underlying complaints, the Owners assert similar allegations that Defendants purposefully marketed themselves as sellers of luxury homes yet sold the Owners homes that were riddled with construction defects. The Owners allege that Defendants, when confronted with the defects, failed to adequately remedy the defects or inform the Owners of the significance of the defects. Each lawsuit alleges: (1) violations of the Pennsylvania Uniform Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law for Defendants' misrepresentation of the quality and character of the home; (2) breach of contract and violation of the Pennsylvania Real Estate Seller Disclosure Law for failure to disclose material defects in the property; (3) breach of Defendants' implied warranty of habitability for construction of an unsafe home, use of faulty materials, and failure to construct the homes in a workmanlike manner according to sound building standards and architectural drawings; (4) breach of express warranty that all defects would be remedied; (5) negligence in construction of the home; (6) negligence in selecting, training, and supervising employees and subcontractors; and (7) civil conspiracy for conspiring to fraudulently represent that they had constructed a home free from major defects. The Owners seek actual, treble, and punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Nautilus is providing Defendants with a defense against the Owners' lawsuits pursuant to a Commercial Lines Policy of insurance that it issued to Defendants for the time periods covering the damages to the Owners' homes. (Nautilus Policy, Nautilus I MJP Ex. A, Nautilus II MJP Ex. B.) On April 2, 2018, and April 12, 2018, Nautilus filed Complaints in this Court against Defendants and the respective Owners\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   seeking, in each of the above cases, a declaratory judgment that it is not required to defend Defendants in either case. (Nautilus I, ECF No. 1; Nautilus II, ECF No. 1.) On August 6, 2018, and October 2, 2018, Nautilus filed the instant Motions for Judgment on the Pleadings, which are largely identical. (Nautilus I, ECF No. 14; Nautilus II, ECF No. 41.) On August 20, 2018, and October 23, 2018, Defendants filed Responses to the Motions. (Nautilus I, ECF No. 16; Nautilus II, ECF No. 44.) Nautilus filed Replies on August 24, 2018, and October 29, 2018. (Nautilus I, ECF No. 17; Nautilus II, ECF No. 45.) The Responses and Replies between the two actions are also largely\n   identical. The Owners filed their respective Responses to the Motions on September 4, 2018, and October 15, 2018. (Nautilus II ECF No. 18; Nautilus II ECF No. 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Nautilus contends that all of the allegations in the Underlying Complaints stem from issues regarding Defendants' faulty workmanship. The parties agree that Pennsylvania law does not consider faulty workmanship to be an \"occurrence\" that is covered under a Commercial General Liability (\"CGL\") policy. However, Defendants and the Owners counter that Pennsylvania law does recognize product-related tort claims, such as product malfunctions, as \"occurrences,\" and the Underlying Complaints allege such malfunctions. Moreover, Defendants argue that there were no bargained-for standards between the Owners and Defendants regarding Defendants' work product, the homes. Defendants argue that, without such standards in place, any defects in the homes are sufficiently accidental to constitute \"occurrences.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Applicable Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In order to determine whether Nautilus is required to defend Defendants in the underlying lawsuits, we must (1) \"determine the scope of coverage under the insurance policy itself\" and (2) \"ascertain whether the complaint against the insured states a claim that is potentially covered under the policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Allstate Ins.

Scope of Coverage Under the Nautilus Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The policy between Nautilus and Defendants includes CGL coverage. With regard to such coverage, the policy states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   a. [W]e will have no duty to defend the insured against any \"suit\" seeking damages for \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" to which this insurance does not apply ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   b. This insurance applies to \"bodily injury\" and \"property damage\" only if: (1) The \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" is caused by an \"occurrence\" ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (Nautilus Policy \u00a7 I(A)(1)(a-b).) The policy defines \"occurrence\" as \"an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\" (Nautilus Policy \u00a7 V(13).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Therefore, whether Nautilus has a duty to defend Defendants in the underlying suits depends upon whether there was an \"occurrence\" triggering coverage. When an \"occurrence\" is defined as an \"accident\" under a CGL policy, as it is here, courts look to the ordinary definition of the word \"accident\" to examine \"whether the damage that is the impetus of [the] suit was caused by an accident, so as to constitute an occurrence under the policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Kvaerner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8458945,2573580\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/908/888/\">\n    908 A.2d at 897-98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Whether an Underlying Complaint States a Claim That is Potentially Covered Under the Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Faulty workmanship is not considered an \"occurrence\" triggering an insurer's duty to defend because \"such claims simply do not present the degree of fortuity contemplated by the ordinary definition of 'accident.' \"\n   <em>\n    Kvaerner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8458945,2573580\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/908/888/\">\n    908 A.2d at 897-99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defining \"accident\" as \"[a]n unexpected and undesirable event,\" or \"something that occurs unexpectedly or unintentionally.\" (quoting Webster's II New College Dictionary 6 (2001) ) ).

The homeowners detailed specific concerns with certain products, including\n   the windows, which caused water damage and mushrooms inside the home. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75 (\"Defendants ... represented that the water infiltration was the result of a limited problem with a bedroom window ...\").) Defendants themselves recognized the defect with the window because they stated \"that the entire window-including the sash-would be replaced to ensure that the mushroom would not reoccur,\" yet they failed to follow through. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 76-77.) The complaint also alleges that the homeowners' damages were caused by the home's lack of an \"effective moisture-barrier,\" which is comprised of several products.(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68.) Finally, the complaint states that the homeowners were forced to relocate because of the safety hazards in the home, and the hazards may have caused respiratory problems in their newborn child. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10, 71.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The underlying complaint in Nautilus II similarly alleges that Defendants \"represent[ed] that they do not 'skimp' on construction\" and that the home was constructed with \"faulty materials.\" (\n   <em>\n    Klehr\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 33, 224, 227, 237, Nautilus II Ex. A.) The complaint also alleges issues with specific products, such as windows, a door, the air conditioning, and the moisture barrier. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 60-61, 98, 106.) As in the underlying complaint in Nautilus I, the underlying complaint in Nautilus II alleges that Defendants acknowledged that water damage \"was from one of [the] windows.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 88.)

First, Defendants argue that the Owners did not contract with them for the construction of the Owners' homes; rather, they contracted for the purchase of the completed homes. Defendants argue that they did not have any bargained-for contractual standards to live up to and any defects contained in the homes were unforeseeable malfunctions. This argument fails because the focus of our inquiry is whether damages stemming from faulty workmanship are foreseeable; the presence of a contract with bargained-for standards contributes to foreseeability, but is not required.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CPB Int'l\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5895926\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/562/591/#p596\">\n    562 F.3d at 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[I]t is largely within the insured's control whether it supplies the agreed-upon product, and the fact that contractual liability flows from the failure to provide that product is too foreseeable to be considered an accident.\");\n   <em>\n    Kvaerner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8458945,2573580\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/908/888/\">\n    908 A.2d at 898\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The key term in the ordinary definition of 'accident' is 'unexpected.'

According to\n   <em>\n    CPB International\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    under a breach of contract theory\n   </em>\n   , this would not\n   be an \"occurrence,\" but the result of Defendants' failure to perform quality control on the homes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   However, the court in\n   <em>\n    CPB International\n   </em>\n   did not address whether the use of a defective product could be considered an \"occurrence\" when the underlying complaint alleged a negligence claim for use of the defective product, rather than solely for breach of contract, and when it caused personal injuries. As mentioned above, the Pennsylvania Superior Court in\n   <em>\n    Indalex\n   </em>\n   found that an insurer's duty to defend was triggered by an occurrence when the underlying complaints alleged product-related tort claims that caused personal injuries. In\n   <em>\n    Indalex\n   </em>\n   , the parties' submissions to the court sampled from and discussed language from at least one of the underlying complaints that included allegations similar to those alleged in this case: \"[window] products were in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user/consumer or its property\"; \"[a]s a result of the defective products ...

In\n   <em>\n    Lenick\n   </em>\n   , the Third Circuit found that a subcontractor's insurer did not have a duty to defend the subcontractor in a construction suit because the underlying complaint insufficiently pleaded a product-related tort claim: \"though the various complaints assert that others may be liable for the property damage, they do not allege that [subcontractor] should be held liable (in negligence or under any other theory) for the faulty products or poor workmanship of others.\"\n   <em>\n    Lenick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=737%20F.%20App%27x%2092\">\n    737 F.

The breadth of the negligence claim, in combination with allegations regarding use of faulty materials, issues with specific materials, and personal injuries, persuades the Court that the Underlying Complaints could encompass product-related tort claims.
