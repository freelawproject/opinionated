Before the court is Defendant Thomas M. Hodgson's (\"Sheriff Hodgson\")\n   <em>\n    Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   [# 26] and Defendant Securus\n   Technologies, Inc.'s (\"Securus\")\n   <em>\n    Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   [# 28]. Finding that the\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   [# 1-1] states claims upon which relief may be granted, but that certain matters alleged may not proceed, the motions are ALLOWED in part and DENIED in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Factual Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The facts alleged in the\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   [# 1-1] are as follows. Thomas M. Hodgson is the Sheriff and head of the Bristol County Sheriff's Office (the \"Sheriff's Office\"). Compl. \u00b6 4 [# 1-1]. In May 2011, the Sheriff's Office issued a \"Request for Responses\" seeking bids to operate the inmate telephone calling services (\"Inmate Calling Services\") at the Bristol County Jail, Bristol County House of Correction, Bristol County Sheriff's Office Women's Center, Carlos Carreiro Immigration Detention Center, and Ash Street Jail and Regional Lock-Up (collectively, \"Bristol County Correctional Facilities\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18, 28. Section 5.1.21 of the Sheriff Office's Request for Responses required each bidder to include in its bid site \"commissions\" or other \"compensations\" that the bidder would pay to the Sheriff's Office based on gross revenues that the bidder receives from operating its Inmate Calling Services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29-30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 23, 2011, Securus responded to the Sheriff Office's Request for Responses and offered to pay to the Sheriff's Office monthly site commission payments in the amount of 48% of Securus's gross revenues from the Inmate Calling Services at the Bristol County Correctional Facilities if Securus was awarded the contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31, 34. On August 8, 2011, the Sheriff's Office awarded Securus a five-year exclusive contract to operate the Inmate Calling Services at the Bristol County Correctional Facilities through a Coinless Inmate &amp; Public Telephone System.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32. The contract included Securus's payment of site commissions as one of its contractual terms and provided options for four additional one-year contract renewals.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 33-34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   From August 2011 to June 2013, Securus operated the Inmate Calling Services for the Bristol County Correctional Facilities and paid the Sheriff's Office monthly site commissions totaling $ 1,172,748.76.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35. This amounted to nearly half of all gross revenues that Securus received from collect and debit calls made from the Bristol County Correctional Facilities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. Securus passed on the cost of these site commission payments to the recipients of telephone calls from the Bristol County Correctional Facilities, including inmates' families, friends, attorneys, and others, by nearly doubling the cost of receiving credit and debit telephone calls made from the Bristol County Correctional Facilities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, 24. The additional charge was used to pay these site commissions and bears no relationship to the actual cost of providing Inmate Calling Services or the quality of the Inmate Calling Services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-25. This contract remained in effect for over four years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32, 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2013-2014, the Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\") limited\n   <em>\n    interstate\n   </em>\n   site commissions by requiring that rates for inmates' interstate telephone calls be based on the cost of operation, and finding that site commission payments are not a legitimate cost of providing Inmate Calling Services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36-37. In August 2016, the FCC attempted to set rate caps for local and long-distance inmate calling, but those rates were stayed by a court order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40 (citing Order,\n   <em>\n    Securus Techs. v.

Nov. 2, 2016) ). Thus, the FCC's rate caps existed for interstate calling, but not local or intrastate long-distance calling.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206591778\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On October 21, 2015, the Sheriff's Office and Securus amended the contract by altering the form and timing of the site\n   commission payments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. In lieu of monthly site commission payments, the amendment provided that Securus would pay the Sheriff's Office a lump-sum payment of $ 820,000 for the duration of the contract term, ending June 30, 2020.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 42-43. In exchange, Securus retained its exclusive contract with the Sheriff's office for an additional four years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44. While the form and timing of the site commission payments differed, Securus continues to increase the cost of calls from Bristol County Correctional Facilities and uses the additional charge to compensate the payment to the Sheriff's Office.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46. The contract remains in effect today.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 42-43, 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Up until June 2016, Securus filed a tariff, or a filing of its Inmate Calling Services call rates, with the Massachusetts Department of Telecommunications and Cable (\"DTC\"). In June 2016, the DTC limited intrastate calling rates to the same rates set by the FCC for interstate Inmate Calling Services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47. On August 1, 2016, Securus withdrew and cancelled its tariff with the DTC, claiming exemption from regulation under Mass. Gen. Laws c. 25C, \u00a7 6A.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48. Since then, Securus has charged Inmate Calling Service consumers more than the DTC rates for intrastate calls.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff Kellie Pearson (\"Pearson\") received and paid for phone calls from her deceased fianc\u00e9, Michael T. Ray, while he was incarcerated at the Bristol County House of Corrections from September 2015 to June 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. While incarcerated, Mr. Ray regularly called to speak to Pearson and their daughter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Pearson states that the high cost of Securus phone calls placed a financial strain on her, forced her to decide whether to pay to receive her fianc\u00e9's calls or pay other bills, and caused stress to both her and Mr. Ray.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff Roger Burrell (\"Burrell\") was previously incarcerated at the Bristol County House of Corrections, where he used the Inmate Calling Services operated by Securus to call his mother, sister, and legal counsel, all of whom are Massachusetts residents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. Burrell could not write letters by hand due to a medical issue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The cost of Securus phone calls subjected his mother and sister to financial hardship and prevented them from having more regular contact with Burrell.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff Brian Givens (\"Givens\") was previously incarcerated at the Bristol County House of Corrections, during which time he called his attorney and his friend to coordinate his medical, financial, and legal needs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. Both his attorney and his friend were Massachusetts residents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He also regularly called his grandmother.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Givens felt anxious and alone when he was unable to reach his loved ones, and the cost of the phone calls was a source of hardship for himself and the recipients of his calls.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff The Law Offices of Mark Booker is a criminal defense law firm in Boston that receives and pays for calls from its incarcerated clients.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.

Plaintiffs further stated at the hearing that, despite naming Sheriff Hodgson in both his individual and official capacity, they do not object to dismissal of claims against Sheriff Hodgson in his individual capacity. Accordingly, to the extent that the Plaintiffs assert claims against Sheriff Hodgson in his individual capacity or seek monetary damages from Sheriff Hodgson in either his individual or official capacity, such claims are DISMISSED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Next, Plaintiffs Burrell and Givens, two former inmates at Bristol County Correctional Facilities, seek injunctive relief. Defendants argue that because Plaintiffs Burrell and Givens were released from custody prior to the filing of this\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   [# 1-1], their claims for injunctive relief are moot. Therefore, they lack standing to bring these claims. Plaintiffs concede that Plaintiffs Burrell and Givens were released from custody and that their claims for injunctive relief are moot.
