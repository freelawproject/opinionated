Engelmayer, United States District Judge\n   The plaintiff in this case, a corporate shareholder, seeks to recoup for the corporation \"short-swing\" profits that he claims were unlawfully obtained by a corporate insider. Plaintiff Aaron Rubenstein brings this case in the right and for the benefit of nominal defendant AdTalem Global Education Services, f/k/a DeVry Education Group, Inc. (\"DeVry\") pursuant to \u00a7 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78p(b). He sues defendants International Value Advisers, LLC (\"IVA\"), an investment advisor; Charles de Vaulx (\"de Vaulx\") and Charles de Lardemelle (\"de Lardemelle\"), who were portfolio managers at IVA; and John Doe, an IVA client in whose account (the \"JD Account\") there were trades of DeVry stock. Rubenstein alleges that IVA, de Vaulx and de Lardemelle (collectively, the \"IVA Defendants\"), and John Doe were insiders of DeVry by virtue of their combined beneficial ownership of DeVry, which exceeded 10% during the relevant period. Rubenstein alleges that the IVA Defendants and John Doe constituted a \"group\" within the meaning of \u00a7 13(d) of the Exchange Act, and made short-swing trades in Doe's account that, in light of their \"group\" status, violated \u00a7 16(b). Rubenstein seeks disgorgement by Doe of the profit he\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   made from those trades, and by the IVA Defendants of any benefit they received from those trades under any performance-based fee arrangement with Doe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The IVA Defendants now move to dismiss. They do not dispute that they constituted a control group with respect to DeVry. But, they argue, on the facts pled, John Doe never became part of such a control \"group\" with them. All that is pled about Doe, they note, is that he was an IVA client who gave IVA discretion to manage his money. They argue that these allegations do not adequately plead, as would be required for Doe to be a member of a control group, that Doe ever \"agreed to act together\" with the IVA Defendants to advance their disclosed control purpose regarding DeVry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons that follow, the Court agrees, and on this basis grants the motion to dismiss. The Court separately denies as moot, and as belated and uninvited, the parties' respective attempts-made in supplemental letters following briefing on the motion to dismiss-to move for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The IVA Defendants and DeVry\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    On June 22, 2016, the IVA Defendants filed a Schedule 13D with the SEC. In it, they disclosed their aggregate beneficial ownership of approximately 19.5% of the outstanding shares of DeVry common stock.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 21.

It does not allege when Doe authorized IVA to make investment decisions on behalf of the JD Account, or whether the trading authority given by Doe to the IVA Defendants was general or specific to trades in a specific issuer or issuers such as DeVry. The Complaint conclusorily alleges that Doe \"understood, agreed to, and authorized-either affirmatively, or through silence and the continued designation of the IVA Defendants as their agents and discretionary investment managers-the DeVry 'change of control' strategy implemented by the IVA Defendants.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 24.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    <strong>\n     3.

Procedural History\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    On January 5, 2017, Rubenstein filed the Complaint, on behalf of nominal defendant DeVry, against IVA, de Vaulx, de Lardemelle,\n    and John Doe, to recover short-swing profits made between June 16, 2016 and December 22, 2016 from Doe's purchase and Doe and the IVA Defendants' sale of DeVry's stock.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    On March 6, 2018, the IVA Defendants moved to dismiss.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkts. 14-16.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    On March 13, 2018, the Court issued an order notifying Rubenstein of his right to file, in lieu of a brief in opposition, an amended complaint in response to the motion to dismiss, while noting that \"[n]o further opportunities to amend will ordinarily be granted.\" Dkt. 18. On March 26, 2018, Rubenstein filed a letter asking that he be given leave to amend the complaint at a later date for the limited purpose of adding John Doe's proper name. Dkt. 20. The following day, the Court adjourned\n    <em>\n     sine die\n    </em>\n    the deadline to amend the complaint for that limited purpose. Dkt. 21.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    On April 10, 2018, Rubenstein filed his brief in opposition. Dkt. 26 (\"Pl. Br.\"). On April 25, 2018, the IVA Defendants filed their reply.

Dkt. 34. It argued that (1) the Complaint does not pursue a theory of liability for the IVA Defendants other than the claim that they and John Doe had formed a control group; and (2) in any event, no other \u00a7 16(b) claim could lie against the IVA Defendants because they lack a pecuniary interest in the JD Account.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at\n    <em>\n     2-4\n    </em>\n    . In support of the latter argument, the IVA Defendants attached an Investment Management Agreement between them and John Doe, which, they claimed, demonstrates that they receive an asset-based fee for managing the JD Account and thus cannot be held liable under SEC Rule 16a-1(a)(2) for any short-swing profits made by that account.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkts. 34-1, 34-2. The IVA Defendants asked the Court to convert the pending motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment and, for that purpose, to consider the Investment Management Agreement. Dkt. 34 at 4.\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    On May 18, 2018, Rubenstein filed a response. Dkt. 35. He reiterated the Complaint's claim that the IVA Defendants had entered into a control \"group\" with John Doe, requiring Doe to disgorge any short-swing profits from the DeVry trades.\n    <em>\n     See generally id.\n    </em>\n    He asked the Court to enter summary judgment in his favor against Doe.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 4. He did not, however, argue that the IVA Defendants could be held liable for any short-swing profits independent\n    of the Complaint's theory of \u00a7 16(b) \"group\" liability with Doe.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    <strong>\n     II.

The question then is what, if any, common objective or objectives can be inferred from the arrangement between IVA and John Doe as pled.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    The Complaint's allegations certainly cannot support a claim of a \"common objective\" of any sort between Doe and the holders of any other accounts that the IVA Defendants managed or owned that had any investment stake in DeVry. The hiring by separate investors of the same investment advisor does not imply any form of agreement among these investors.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Criterion\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202720208\">\n     2017 WL 2720208\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *6-7 (declining to find a \"group\" even where complaint alleged that the investment advisor \"employed a common investment strategy\" for a number of funds and made trades for those funds \"in virtual lockstep\" with one another).

Investors may have vastly different investment priorities, different tolerances for risk, different time horizons, different liquidity constraints, and different tax concerns.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    For a complaint to plead a common objective among an advisor's clients-let alone the objective of \"act[ing] together for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of equity securities of an issuer,\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n     17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .13d-5(b)(1) -much more would need to be pled.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Rubenstein alternatively argues that the arrangement between John Doe and IVA supports treating at least the two of them as a 13(d) \"group.\" As to an agreement between John Doe and the IVA Defendants, the allegations in the Complaint here-to the effect that IVA managed the JD Account with respect to the acquisition, holding, voting, and disposition of shares in it-do support inferring\n    <em>\n     some form\n    </em>\n    of agreement and common objective. But these allegations suggest no more than John Doe and the IVA Defendants shared a common objective regarding the purchase, sale, holding, and voting of the securities in the JD Account. Such an agreement does not imply an intent to \"pool\" the voting interests (or other interests) of the shares owned by JD with shares owned or otherwise controlled by IVA-let alone \"pool\" those interests in any particular security, such as DeVry stock. Under the applicable regulations, more is needed to make out the allegation of a \"group\" necessary to support liability under \u00a7 13(d) and its implementing Rule 13d-5(b)(1).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Rule 13d-5(b)(1) provides that \"[w]hen two or more persons agree to act together for the purpose of acquiring ... securities\n    <em>\n     of an issuer,\n    </em>\n    the group formed thereby shall be deemed to have acquired beneficial ownership ... of all equity securities\n    <em>\n     of that issuer\n    </em>\n    beneficially owned by any such persons.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n     17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .13d-5(b)(1) (emphasis added);\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78m(d)(3) (also using the language \"securities\n    <em>\n     of an issuer\n    </em>\n    \" (emphasis added) ). Each of these provisions pointedly uses the phrase \"of an issuer\" or \"of that issuer\" to modify the word \"securities.\" These provisions thereby require the members of the \"group\" to have agreed to act together for the purpose of acquiring not just any security, but securities of a particular issuer.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    The Complaint here, however, is devoid of that allegation or any remotely close. The Complaint does not allege, for example, that John Doe invested knowing of IVA's other positions in DeVry or of a particular investment strategy by IVA regarding DeVry. In fact, it does not allege that Doe's agreement with IVA envisioned any particular investment, let alone the investment at issue in DeVry securities-or even that John Doe was\n    <em>\n     aware\n    </em>\n    of IVA's decision to invest the JD Account in DeVry. The Complaint alleges no more than the fact that Doe delegated investment authority to the IVA Defendants that was broad enough to permit IVA to decide to invest money from the JD Account in DeVry securities (presumably as it could similarly have chosen to invest such money in thousands of other securities).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    That is not enough.

That is correct but beside the point, because the IVA Defendants do not invoke that exception-nor could they, given that IVA has disclosed a control purpose with respect to DeVry.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Dkt. 34. The IVA Defendants instead argue that, based on the allegations in the Complaint, John Doe never \"agreed\" to form a \"group\" with the IVA Defendants with respect to DeVry shares. The Court confines its analysis to this question.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"8\">\n    <p id=\"p-100\">\n     Two cases from this District have applied found a \"group\" without inquiring about agreement within the group with respect to a particular issuer.

It is not clear that this situation presents at all a common circumstance. And there is a significant disincentive to such conduct. An advisor with a pecuniary interest in the client's account risks liability under \u00a7 16(b) for such trading independent of whether they have formed a \"group\" with their clients, potentially requiring disgorgement of the investment advisors fees attributable to the short-swing trades.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n      17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240\n     </extracted-citation>\n     .16a-1(a)(2).
