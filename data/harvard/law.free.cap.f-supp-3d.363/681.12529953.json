The plaintiff Secretary of Labor (\"Secretary\") has filed a motion to bar Team from excluding certain employee compensation (e.g., payment for days not worked due to inclement weather) from the calculation of the employees' regular rate of pay (which, if lowered, would correspondingly lower any overtime compensation owed). The defendant Team has filed a motion to permit it to receive credit for payments made to employees for non-compensable time (e.g., payment for days not worked due to inclement weather) against any overtime compensation owed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In an order entered December 29, 2017, the court granted the Secretary's motion for partial summary judgment that Team failed to pay overtime compensation in violation of section 7 of the FLSA (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Accordingly, each of these motions concerns the amount of damages owed, which is to be determined at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The motions deal with two types of payments: payments on days when Team's employees could not work due to inclement weather (\"weather days\"); and payments for non-work days when Team's employees received pay because they were guaranteed a certain number of paid days per week but were not required to work all of those days (\"guaranteed days\"). Accordingly, the two main issues here are: first, whether payment for weather days and guaranteed days not worked should be included or excluded from the regular rate when calculating overtime due; and second, whether, if either of those payments is included in the regular rate, the payment may be credited towards the amount of overtime due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. Calculating the regular rate\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Turning first to the calculation of the regular rate (on the basis of which the\n   overtime is determined), the plaintiff contends that pay for both weather days and guaranteed days should be included in the regular rate; the defendant claims they should be excluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Section 207 mandates that employers pay employees at one and one-half times their \"regular rate\" for hours worked over forty in each workweek.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).

It has no relation to regular \"absences\" such as lunch periods nor to regularly scheduled days of rest.... The term holiday ... does not refer to days of rest given to employees in lieu of or as an addition to compensation for working on other days....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The term \"failure of the employer to provide sufficient work\" is intended to refer to occasional, sporadically recurring situations where the employee would normally be working but for such a factor as ... weather conditions affecting the ability of the employee to perform the work and similarly unpredictable obstacles beyond the control of the employer. The term does not include ... any type of routine, recurrent absence of the employee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Regarding occasional weather days, it is apparent that they fall within the \u00a7 207(e)(2) exception, particularly inasmuch as the regulations thereunder, though not the subject of notice and comment rulemaking, reasonably and explicitly include, in the exceptions, \"occasional, sporadically recurring situations where the employee would normally be working but for ... weather conditions affecting the ability of the employee to perform the work.\" Thus, evidence of pay for such days when employees were paid but performed no work due to inclement weather, is relevant to the calculation of the regular rate of pay in that such payments are excluded in fixing the regular rate of pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Secretary nonetheless argues that Team's poor recordkeeping will prevent it from meeting its burden of proving that the exclusion applies to weather days, and that Team should therefore be denied the opportunity to present any such evidence regarding the exclusion of weather day payments from the regular rate. The court declines to decide this fact-dependent issue in a motion in limine; rather, Team may present its relevant evidence on the issue at trial. The court will then decide, based on the evidence presented, whether Team has satisfied its burden. The Secretary's motion is therefore denied as to occasional weather days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As for guaranteed days, where, based on a given contract with Team and a third-party, Team employees were guaranteed payment for a certain number of days (typically six), but regularly worked fewer days (typically five), the regulations contemplate that payment for such non-work days is included in the regular rate. The\n   guaranteed days were not \"infrequent or sporadic or unpredictable,\" but were guaranteed each week. They were essentially a \"day[ ] of rest given to employees ... as an addition to compensation for working other days[,]\" or a \"type of routine, recurrent absence of the employee.\" Thus, the pay for these guaranteed days should be included in the regular rate. Any evidence regarding the exclusion of pay for guaranteed days from the regular rate is therefore irrelevant to the calculation of damages and inadmissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The defendant Team argues, however, that if payment on guaranteed days is included in the regular rate calculation, so too must the hours for which those payments are associated be included in the calculation. In other words, Team contends that if the payment for guaranteed days is added to the numerator, then hours representing those non-work payments should be added to the denominator to calculate the regular rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The denominator in the regular rate calculation is comprised of all hours worked. \"The regular hourly rate of pay of an employee is determined by dividing his total remuneration for employment (except statutory exclusions) in any workweek by the total number of hours actually worked by him in that workweek for which such compensation was paid.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20778.109\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 778.109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smiley\n   </em>\n   at 331. \"As a general rule the term 'hours worked' will include: (a) All time during which an employee is required to be on duty or to be on the employer's premises or at a prescribed workplace and (b) all time during which an employee is suffered or permitted to work whether or not he is required to do so.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20778.223\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 778.223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, the regulation takes further note that hours not worked are excluded from the calculation of the regular rate:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   If [employees who are] on call are not confined to their homes or to any particular place, but may come and go as they please, provided that they leave word where they may be reached, the hours spent \"on call\" are not considered as hours worked.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20778.223\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20778.223\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Here, the employees in this category were not even \"on call,\" but were afforded one extra day of pay for a non-work day. The defendant is free, however, to provide evidence that work was performed on such days, in which case those hours of work will be included in the regular rate calculation. Otherwise, non-work days will not be added to the denominator for hours worked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The court having found that occasional weather day payments may be excluded from the regular rate and guaranteed day payments may not, the Secretary's motion is accordingly granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   II. Credits\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In defendant's motion in limine to permit it to credit paid, non-compensable time against any overtime compensation allegedly due and owing, the defendant contends that it is entitled to credit the amount paid for weather days and guaranteed days as a set-off against any amount found to be owed for overtime compensation. The Secretary disagrees, claiming that the FLSA does not allow for such a credit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Section 207(h) of the FLSA is the only provision that addresses credits against overtime compensation owed. It states the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), sums\n   <em>\n    excluded\n   </em>\n   from the regular rate pursuant to subsection (e) shall not be creditable toward wages required under section 206 of this title or overtime compensation required under this section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (2) Extra compensation paid as described in paragraphs (5), (6), and (7) of\n   subsection (e) shall be creditable toward overtime compensation payable pursuant to this section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n    27 U.S.C. \u00a7 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h) (emphasis added). The statute only addresses sums excluded from the regular rate, and states that they may not be credited towards overtime compensation owed unless they meet one of the three enumerated exceptions contained in \u00a7 207(e)(5)-(7). Those three enumerated exceptions each relate only to \"extra compensation provided by a premium rate\" (premium rate being defined in the regulations as an hourly rate that must be greater than the regular rate or one and one-half times or more of the regular rate, dependent upon context,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20778.308\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 778.308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), for any one of three categories, each consisting in the main of:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00a7 207(e)(5) Hours worked in excess of 8 in a day or, e.g., 40 hours in a week\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00a7 207(e)(6) Hours worked on a Saturday, Sunday, holiday or the 6th or 7th day of the workweek, where the premium rate is at least time and one-half of the regular rate\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00a7 207(e)(7) Hours worked outside the hours established in good faith by the applicable employment contract or collective-bargaining agreement as the basic, normal or regular workday of 8 hours or workweek of, e.g., 40 hours, where the premium rate is at least time and one-half of the regular rate\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Insofar as inclement weather days are excluded from the regular rate, see discussion,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , and do not meet the three enumerated exceptions, they are not creditable toward overtime compensation owed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The paid guaranteed days which are included in the regular rate, but for which no work was performed, remain at issue.

Notably, neither opinion addresses the most relevant provision in the FLSA on the issue of offsetting -\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h).\"\n   <em>\n    Smiley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175466\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/839/325/#p330\">\n    839 F.3d at 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The court finds the Third Circuit's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Smiley\n   </em>\n   to be persuasive. Inasmuch as the only instances explicitly included in the offset portion of the FLSA, \u00a7 207(e)(5)-(7), require a \"premium rate paid,\" it is reasonable to infer that payments made at the regular rate cannot be considered \"extra compensation\" that may offset the amount owed for overtime compensation. As the court in\n   <em>\n    Smiley\n   </em>\n   explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   The statutory scheme that limits crediting to the three types of \"extra compensation\" excluded from the regular rate against overtime obligations makes sense.... Excludable premium compensation may offset other excludable premium compensation. To allow compensation included in the regular rate to offset premium-rate pay, however, would facilitate a \"pyramiding\" in the opposite direction by allowing employers to pay straight time and overtime together. This approach fundamentally conflicts with the FLSA's concern that employees be compensated for all hours worked.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Smiley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175466\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/839/325/#p330\">\n    839 F.3d at 334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the court finds that guaranteed days, which are included in the regular rate, may not be credited towards overtime compensation due. As noted above, occasional weather days, which are excluded from the regular\n   rate, also may not be credited towards overtime compensation due. Any evidence concerning credit calculations for these days is therefore irrelevant, and Team's motion in limine is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   III.
