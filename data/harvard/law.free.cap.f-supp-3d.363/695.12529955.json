Noting \"no significant difference between Rules 803(8)(B) and 803(8)(C),\" the Fifth Circuit utilized the matters observed three-requirement test set forth in\n   <em>\n    Central Gulf I\n   </em>\n   to admit the reports and certificates.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10516466\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/974/621/#p626\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 626 &amp; n.10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Notably, while both\n   <em>\n    Central Gulf I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Central Gulf II\n   </em>\n   considered non-governmentally-produced records, neither opinion squarely addressed what makes a report public within the meaning of Rule 803(8). From the results of these decisions, it can be fairly presumed that a non-governmental report is public when the person preparing the report (1) personally observed the matters set forth in the report; and (2) had a duty to report the matters to a public official. While this test is useful, it does not cover the vast majority of investigative reports, which \"[a]s the name indicates, ... embody the results of investigation and accordingly are often not the product of the declarant's firsthand knowledge, required under most hearsay exceptions.\" 2 MCCORMICK ON EVID. \u00a7 296 n.16 and accompanying text (7th ed.) (collecting cases).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Case law on the public nature of third-party reports prepared without personal knowledge is limited. District courts in the Second Circuit have taken a narrow view of the public nature of third-party reports by holding that reports prepared by non-governmental entities, even those authorized by law, do not fall within the public records hearsay exception.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ricciuti v.

Blackburn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11957715\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/992/666/#p672\">\n    992 F.2d 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 672 (7th Cir. 1993). According to the Seventh Circuit, \"a private company that conducts tests independently with its own equipment and prepares reports by itself based on those tests, even if at the instance of a governmental agency,\" is not the equivalent of a government investigator.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11957715\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/992/666/#p672\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Largely consistent with the Seventh Circuit's view, a district judge in Rhode Island has held that a non-governmental report procured by a public agency may be admissible under Rule 803(8) if the agency \"closely managed\" the investigation.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3830755\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/826/617/#p621\">\n    826 F.Supp. 617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 621 (D.R.I. 1993).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In considering these approaches, this Court notes that the hearsay exception for public records is grounded on the \"assumption that a public official will perform his duty properly and the unlikelihood that he will remember details independently of the record.\" Advisory Committee Note to Fed. R. Evid. 803(8). This assumption, necessarily, is undermined when the person or entity preparing the report is not a public official. Given this, the Court, like the Seventh Circuit, concludes that a non-governmental\n   report should be admissible under Rule 803(8) only when it has been prepared by \"the equivalent of government investigators.\" This Court further concludes that this standard may be met when a public agency closely manages the relevant investigation. Having reached these conclusions, the question becomes: what rises to the level of a closely managed investigation?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   , an EPA contractor report was held admissible under Rule 803(8) when:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   the EPA remained in charge of and closely involved with the Remedial Investigation at the Davis Site. EPA appointed the Remedial Project Manager (\"RPM\") for the Site as the primary contact between EPA and its contractor. EPA selected CDM in accordance with its requirements regarding the qualifications for Remedial Investigations. The field work and analysis were performed at the direction and under the guidance of EPA; proposed work plans were reviewed for conformity with EPA methodology and standards. This review included making sure that the contractor followed EPA's quality assurance/quality control guidelines for sampling and chemical analysis. EPA remained in close contact with its contractors during the remedial investigation, and required its contractors to submit regular reports concerning the project. Finally, EPA reviewed prior drafts of the RI Report for technical accuracy and compliance with the 1985 NCP, requiring all necessary changes and additions to ensure the report's accuracy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3830755\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/826/617/#p621\">\n    826 F.Supp. at 621-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   While the closely managed inquiry is necessarily fact specific, this Court believes that the factors considered in\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   , which related to an EPA site inspection similar to the one at issue here, are appropriate in this case. Accordingly, the Court will consider the admissibility of the Tetra Tech Report under the framework of\n   <em>\n    Davis.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Here, there is no evidence of how the EPA selected Tetra Tech to conduct the ESI and whether such selection was in accordance with relevant requirements. Nevertheless, Tetra Tech was required to operate under a detailed EPA-approved quality assurance plan, which included numerous requirements regarding the collection and testing of materials.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. # 734-5. However, there is no evidence that the EPA remained in \"close contact\" with Tetra Tech or otherwise required Tetra Tech to \"submit regular reports concerning the project.\" Indeed, the quality assurance plan governing the project made clear that \"[f]ield and laboratory audits will not be conducted for this project.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3830755\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/826/617/#p621\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 3.1. Finally, pursuant to the plan, any report submitted to the EPA would be subjected to a multi-level and detailed review.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3830755\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/826/617/#p621\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In sum, while it appears the EPA maintained significant oversight at the beginning and late stages of Tetra Tech's investigation, there is no evidence of EPA involvement during the crucial middle stage. Under these circumstances, the Court concludes that Tetra Tech was not the equivalent of a governmental investigator and that, therefore, its report may not be deemed a public record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the motion to exclude will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    III\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \"Defendants Meritor Inc., The Boeing Company, and Rockwell Automation, Inc.'s Motion in Limine to Exclude Tetra Tech's\n   Final Expanded Site Inspection Report, Revision 1\" [706] is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   , this 11th day of February, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Sites placed on the EPA's Superfund National Priorities List are \"eligible for Federally funded remedial action.\" Doc. # 734-2 at 2.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Although less than clear, the Meritor Defendants also appear to argue that the use of the report, which Meritor itself disclosed, after the discovery and expert deadlines is somehow improper because they have not been given an opportunity to cross-examine the authors of the report.
