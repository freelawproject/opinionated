(Doc. 15.) The Court grants the motion in part and denies it in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Ronald Brothers's romantic relationship with Jennifer Schultze began in 2010 and lasted approximately six years. (Doc. 13 at 5.) It was rocky, particularly near its end, and in March 2016, Brothers became suspicious that Schultze was romantically involved with someone else. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) While visiting Schultze in her apartment, Brothers unlocked her cell phone with a passcode she had previously shared with him, and he found what he perceived to be confirmation of his suspicions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Brothers confronted Schultze, and both became \"upset.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Less than two weeks later, Brothers and Schultze got into a particularly nasty argument while in Schultze's vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The same day, March 15, 2016, Schultze lodged a complaint against Brothers with the Ravalli County Sheriff's Office, alleging that Brothers had unlawfully entered Schultze's apartment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ravalli County law enforcement officers Guisinger and Monaco interviewed Schultze. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Without further corroboration and without a warrant, Guisinger and Monaco arrested Brothers and booked him into the Ravalli County jail, where he stayed for over 24 hours. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Brothers appeared in justice court the next day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) He was released on his own recognizance, but not before agreeing, as a condition of release, to give the passcode to his cell phone, which had been confiscated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Officer Burlingham applied for and received a search warrant to search Brothers's phone, attesting in the application that Schultze \"reported that she had searched her home and discovered she was missing a cell phone and that someone had been rummaging through her personal property.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Burlingham did not attempt to corroborate the information given by Schultze before applying for the warrant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On March 17, 2016, Schultze sought an order of protection against Brothers, which was denied on the basis of insufficient evidence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 14, 2016, Brothers was charged with felony burglary and misdemeanor theft. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In July 2016, Schultze stated in a recorded interview with counsel\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   that she had found the missing cell phone-presumably, the basis for the theft charge-in her car. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Several months later, on November 1, 2016, an amended information against Brothers was filed, charging Brothers with felony burglary, misdemeanor stalking, and misdemeanor privacy in communications charges, but not with misdemeanor theft. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) In the affidavit filed in support of the amended information, deputy county attorney Geist attested that Schultze's cell phone had been found in Brothers's vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 5, 2017, in response to Brothers's motions to suppress and to dismiss charges, the Ravalli County district court found that there had been no probable cause to arrest Brothers and that his arrest was unlawful. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The County was ordered to return Brothers's phone. The court dismissed the felony burglary\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and misdemeanor privacy in communications charges and remanded to justice court for consideration of any misdemeanor charges. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 17, 2017, county prosecutors Lower and Geist sought leave to file a second amended complaint charging Brothers with misdemeanor unlawful use of computer and felony burglary. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The court denied the motion, finding that the affidavit filed in support of the motion included \"verbatim use of the concerning 'self-confirming, conclusory, and vague' allegations\" that had been previously used to support the dismissed charges. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 23, 2017, a complaint was filed in justice court, charging Brothers with misdemeanor stalking, misdemeanor criminal trespass to property, and misdemeanor unlawful use of a computer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The affidavit filed in support of the complaint was nearly identical to those previously filed in and rejected by the district court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.) In response to Brothers's motion to dismiss, the presiding justice of the peace dismissed the charges on August 10, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Through counsel, Brothers brought this lawsuit under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , alleging violation of his federal constitutional rights.

At this early stage of litigation, dismissal is warranted as to: (1) claims against prosecutor Lower; (2) federal claims against Ravalli County; (3) state law claims brought against individual actors in their individual and official capacities; and (4) state law negligence claims against officers Guisinger, Monaco, and Burlingham. Although some of Brothers's remaining claims are on relatively thin ice, the remainder of his claims may proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Prosecutorial Immunity-claims against Lower and Geist\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The County argues that prosecutorial immunity insulates deputy county attorneys Lower and Geist, as well as Ravalli County itself,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   from Brothers's claims arising from the alleged wrongful prosecution of Brothers. (Docs. 15 at 10-13, 19 at 2-5.) Federal prosecutorial immunity law applies to Brothers's \u00a7 1983 claims, and Montana prosecutorial immunity law applies to the remainder of Brothers's claims, all of which are brought under state law.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cousins v.

However, he argues that his allegations do not fall under\n   <em>\n    Imbler\n   </em>\n   because Lower and Geist acted as witnesses rather than prosecutors when they submitted affidavits supporting the charges brought against Brothers. Because the County raises no other arguments in support of its motion to dismiss these claims,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court addresses whether Lower and Geist acted in their roles as prosecutors at all times relevant to Brothers's claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kalina v.

Under the County's interpretation, a prosecutor is always immune from suit if the prosecutor attributes the facts in a certification to law enforcement's investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Court disagrees. A prosecutor submitting a probable cause affidavit summarizing investigative findings certifies that the findings set forth in the affidavit are consistent with the findings presented to the prosecutor. She is a material fact witness regarding how the investigation was presented to her, but she is not a material fact witness as to what the underlying investigation actually revealed. Thus, if a prosecutor's affidavit includes a falsehood, it matters whether that falsehood is attributable to law enforcement's misstatement of its own investigation or rather to the prosecutor's misstatement of the investigation as it was presented to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Ultimately, the facts of this case fall somewhere between\n   <em>\n    Kalina\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Fratzke\n   </em>\n   . Although the issue is close, the Court finds that Brothers may pursue claims against Geist but not Lower. That said, the claims are on shaky ground, and, although they survive this motion to dismiss, their continued survival is uncertain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Geist submitted an affidavit in support of the State's motion for leave to file an amended information substituting a misdemeanor privacy in communications charge for the misdemeanor theft charge included in the first information. In his affidavit, Geist certified that he \"ha[d] reviewed an investigation conducted by the Ravalli County Sheriff's Office.\" (Doc. 15-1.) He went on to summarize the investigation. Couched within that summary was the line, \"[t]he Iphone was later recovered in the Defendant's vehicle.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Brothers alleges that Geist's affidavit was submitted months after Schultze stated in a recorded interview with counsel that she had found the missing cell phone in her car. (Doc. 13 at 8.) Geist is entitled to absolute prosecutorial immunity if he had no reason to know that his affidavit included false information, as he is entitled to rely on the Sheriff's Office's investigation. However, if he knew that the affidavit he submitted was inconsistent with the investigation, then Brothers may have a claim that his injuries arose from Geist's conduct as a material witness. The Court determines that Brothers has plausibly alleged that Geist did, in fact, insert a falsehood into his affidavit and that Brothers may proceed with his claims arising from that alleged fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The issue is more straightforward as to Lower. Like Geist, Lower submitted an affidavit for probable cause, certifying that \"[a]n investigation conducted by Ravalli County law enforcement has established\" certain facts, summarized in the affidavit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 15-2.) However, Brothers has not alleged that Lower's affidavit included a fact known to be false to Lower at the time of certification. Indeed, the affidavit submitted before the justice court corrects the error in Geist's earlier submission; Lower correctly certifies that the investigation revealed that \"[t]he Iphone was later recovered in Schulze's vehicle.\" (Doc. 15-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As Brothers alleges and as the state district court found, it is likely true that Lower should have known that there was no probable cause to pursue additional charges against Brothers because the affidavit includes \"self-confirming, conclusory, and vague\" allegations previously rejected by the court. (Doc. 18-2.) But this allegation\n   relates directly to Lower's performance of his duties as a prosecutor, and Lower is entitled to absolute prosecutorial immunity for his probable cause findings and for his attempt to pursue charges against Brothers.\n   <em>\n    Kalina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11470940\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/118/#p126\">\n    522 U.S. at 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11470940\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/118/#p126\">\n    118 S.Ct. 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

He may not pursue claims arising from Geist's: (1) reliance on false information; (2) probable cause certification; or (3) decision to pursue charges against Brothers in reliance on information not known to be false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

He alleges no specific facts regarding what those policies and practices are. Instead, he essentially recites the legal requirements for a\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim and states that they are met, alleging:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   The policies customs, and practices implicitly or explicitly adopted by Defendant Ravalli County regarding training, supervision, and discipline amounted to deliberate indifference to and conscious disregard of Ron's constitutional rights and ratification of violation of those rights.

There, the Montana Supreme Court addressed a constitutional claim arising from an unlawful search and seizure of the plaintiff's property.

Public Duty Doctrine\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Finally, the County argues that the public duty doctrine bars Brothers's common-law negligence claims against officers Guisinger, Monaco, and Burlingham. Brothers contends that the public duty doctrine does not apply where, as here, the plaintiff \"alleges that the affirmative acts of the defendant harmed the plaintiff while the defendant was engaged in law-enforcement activities.\" (Doc. 18 at 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   There is considerable tension in Montana law on this issue, and both parties find support in recent cases. If the Court were to look only to the general\n   formulation of the public duty doctrine, discussed at length in\n   <em>\n    Bassett v. Lamantia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567250\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/417/299/12567250/\">\n    391 Mont. 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567250,12567251\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/417/299/\">\n    417 P.3d 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2019), it would allow Brothers's claims to proceed. Under Montana law, \"[t]he public-duty doctrine recognizes that, because [law enforcement officers'] duty to protect is owed to the public generally, an officer does not have a legal duty to protect each individual plaintiff absent a special relationship.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567250,12567251\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/417/299/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567250,12567251\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/417/299/\">\n    at 310-11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"However, independent of the duty to protect and based on generally applicable principles of negligence, an officer may owe a legal duty to a person injured directly by the officer's affirmative actions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567250,12567251\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/417/299/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567250,12567251\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/417/299/\">\n    at 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Bassett\n   </em>\n   , the Court summarized its earlier decisions involving the public duty doctrine as addressing claims that \"officers allegedly breached a duty to protect the victim from outside or third-party harm.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567250,12567251\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/417/299/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567250,12567251\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/417/299/\">\n    at 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The doctrine simply shields officers from lawsuits stemming from an alleged failure to perform law enforcement duties.

Under\n   <em>\n    Renenger\n   </em>\n   , because investigation is a core law enforcement function, a duty owed to an individual under investigation is apparently subsumed under the broader duty to the general public.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12570132\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/426/559/#p564\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   No principle distinguishes the facts presented here from those discussed in\n   <em>\n    Renenger\n   </em>\n   .
