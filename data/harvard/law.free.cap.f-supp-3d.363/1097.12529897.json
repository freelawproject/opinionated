(AR 226.) A month later, he filed an application for supplemental security income. (AR 216.) In both applications, he listed his disability onset date as November 23, 1988-his date of birth. (AR 216, 226.) His applications were denied initially and on reconsideration. (AR 21.) Plaintiff then filed a request for a hearing before an ALJ. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On May 9, 2016, a hearing was held before ALJ Daniel Heely in Stockton, California during which both Plaintiff, his sister, and Vocational Expert Joy Yoshioka testified. (AR 45.) Plaintiff was represented by the same counsel as he is represented by here. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On June 9, 2016, the ALJ issued a \"fully favorable\" decision granting his application for supplemental security income and finding that he was disabled as of September 12, 2013, the date he filed his application for supplemental security income. (Dkt. No. 31.) When Plaintiff's counsel raised the issue of Plaintiff's application for disabled adult child insurance benefits which was also pending, the ALJ issued a new \"partially favorable decision\" on July 12, 2016 which denied his application for disabled adult child insurance benefits, but again granted his application for supplemental security income. (AR 17.) The Appeals Council later denied Plaintiff's request for review and this appeal followed. (AR 1; Dkt. No. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The ALJ's Decision is Arbitrary\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The sole issue raised in Plaintiff's appeal is his disability onset date. While both Plaintiff's applications for benefits list his disability onset date as his date of birth, the ALJ found that although he was disabled at the age of 23, he was not disabled before that date. According to the ALJ, \"[t]he evidence failed to establish significant functional limitations prior to November 23, 2010, the claimant's 22nd birthday, but did establish he was disabled as of September 12, 2013, the date the application for supplemental security income was filed.\" (AR 21.) The ALJ based his non-disability finding on Plaintiff's \"absence of regular treatment\" prior to 2010 and \"improvement in 2005 and 2010.\" (AR 25.) The ALJ's decision is not supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   First, and most strikingly, the ALJ relied on the\n   <em>\n    same\n   </em>\n   evidence for the finding of disability as he did for the finding of non-disability. In particular, the ALJ relied upon a November 25, 2013 report from Plaintiff's treating psychologist, Dr. Janice DeCovnick, whose relationship with Plaintiff began in 2000 (when he was 12 years old) to find that Plaintiff could not manage gainful employment on a regular and continuing basis due to his \"anxiety, somatization, autism spectrum disorder, OCD, depression, social phobia, and need for constant supervision.\" (AR 27, 29) (citing Exhibit 4F 1-9 (AR 551-558).) In reaching this conclusion, the ALJ discussed at length Dr. DeCovnick's findings that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 Plaintiff had had \"anxiety, thinking [ ] and learning problems since 1st grade, social isolation in the 4th and 5th grade, and severe emotional difficulties since age 11, all leading to a breakdown in middle school.\" (AR 26.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 In 2000, Plaintiff suffered \"major depression with psychotic features and obsessive compulsive disorder with extreme difficulty concentrating, anxiety, frustration, belligerence, and fidgetiness.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 In 2005, he had problems with conceptional reasoning, spatial planning and reasoning, fluency of thought, deductive reasoning, problem solving, cognitive processing speed, and integrating information. (AR 26-27.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 He continued to have \"severe anxiety about working and extreme difficulty socializing with others.\" (AR 27.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 Plaintiff's diagnosis of Asperger's disorder, social phobia, obsessive compulsive disorder, and recurrent and severe major depressive disorder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 \"Plaintiff had poor ability to perform complex instructions, maintain attention and concentration, perform activities within a schedule and maintain regular attendance, complete a normal workday or workweek without interruptions from psychologically bases [sic] symptoms, interact with others, and respond appropriately to changes in the work setting.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The ALJ, however, ignored all this evidence when it came to the portion of his decision finding that Plaintiff was not disabled prior to 2010-although much of this evidence concerns\n   <em>\n    the pre-2010\n   </em>\n   time-period. Instead, the ALJ cited to the attachments to Dr. DeCovnick's 2013 report which include an evaluation prepared following Dr. DeCovnick's examinations of Plaintiff on October 14, 21, and November 11, 2005. (AR 24-25 (citing Exhibit 4F 9, 12, 14, 15, 20 (AR 551-576) ).) Dr. DeCovnick's 2013 report attached these earlier evaluations because they \"are highly relevant to this case\" noting that \"Mr. Lizer has been suffering severe emotional difficulties since he was 11 years old.\" (AR 551.) The ALJ then culled one line out of Dr. DeCovnick's 12-page 2005 evaluation to support his conclusion that as of 2005 Plaintiff was \"less anxious, and less depressed than previously.\" (AR 25 (citing 4F 12 (AR 562) ).) However, in doing so, the ALJ ignored the numerous issues identified in this same 2005 evaluation: \"Sam has extensive difficulties with problem solving\" (AR 566); \"Sam scored on the low end of the low average range for several verbal executive functions\" (AR 567); \"Sam's cognitive fluency scores were all below average to very poor\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ); \"slow motor speed, which was in the very low to deficient range\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ); \"very poor accuracy\" (AR 568); \"he cannot apply what he has learned one day to the next day's problems\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ); and \"difficulties with conceptual thinking\" (AR 569).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The ALJ erred in relying only on the evidence which supports his disability determination, while ignoring the medical evidence which contradicts it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holohan v. Massanari\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11112308\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/246/1195/#p1207\">\n    246 F.3d 1195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1207 (9th Cir. 2001) (concluding that the ALJ's basis for rejecting the treating physician's medical opinion was not supported by substantial evidence because the ALJ \"selectively relied on some entries ... and ignored the many others that indicated continued, severe impairment\");\n   <em>\n    Williams v. Colvin\n   </em>\n   , No. ED CV 14-2146-PLA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204507174\">\n    2015 WL 4507174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (C.D. Cal. July 23, 2015) (\"An ALJ may not cherry-pick evidence to support the conclusion that a claimant is not disabled, but must consider the evidence as a whole in making a reasoned disability determination.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Second, although the ALJ fully credited and gave substantial weight to Dr. DeCovnick's opinion, the ALJ ignored Dr. DeCovnick's finding in his 2013 report regarding Plaintiff's status in 2010 and earlier. (AR 27.) In particular, Dr. DeCovnick\n   noted that following Plaintiff's graduation from high school, \"he took a two year break from school, during which time he was 'just hanging out at home.' \" (AR 552.) Further, while Plaintiff attended community college for a year in 2009-2010, he was unable to afford to attend school beyond that year, and the plan was for Plaintiff to get a job in 2010, but he \"had and continues to the present day to have severe and extreme anxieties about entering the work world. He is too frightened to fill out job applications and interview for jobs.\" (AR 552-53.) Indeed, Dr. DeCovnick noted that Plaintiff's therapist \"worked with him diligently to get him ready for the work world over the past three years but to no avail.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The ALJ, however, did not mention\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of this in his opinion. Rather, the ALJ found that Plaintiff had showed \"improvement in 2005 and 2010\" such that \"the evidence does not support even mild limitation in activities of daily living, social functioning, or concentration, persistence, or pace and does not establish he suffered any episodes of decompensation\"-during the same period that Dr. DeCovnick reported that Plaintiff was unable to work and suffering from extreme anxiety. (AR 25.) The ALJ's findings in this regard are illogical, unsupported by the record, and contrary to the opinion of Plaintiff's treating physician whose opinion the ALJ fully credited. \"Although the ALJ's analysis need not be extensive, the ALJ must provide some reasoning in order for us to meaningfully determine whether the ALJ's conclusions were supported by substantial evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown-Hunter v. Colvin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358706\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/806/487/#p495\">\n    806 F.3d 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 495 (9th Cir. 2015) ;\n   <em>\n    Holohan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11112308\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/246/1195/#p1207\">\n    246 F.3d at 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"An ALJ may reject the uncontradicted medical opinion of a treating physician only for 'clear and convincing' reasons supported by substantial evidence in the record.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Finally, the ALJ cites to two \"Progress Notes\" in support of his conclusion that in September 2010, Plaintiff had no depression, anxiety, sleep problems, or issues with low energy. (AR 25 (citing 2F 26, 31, 32).) However, these \"Progress Notes\" appear to be check-box forms which Plaintiff completed when visiting his primary care physician during an unspecified period of time. (AR 457-545.) Further, the notes are inconsistent with respect to Plaintiff's responses; for example, while some indicate that he does not have weakness, fatigue or low energy level, others indicate that he does. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   AR 487-88\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   AR 501.) And the same record which the ALJ relies upon to find that Plaintiff did not have sleep problems or low energy indicates that Plaintiff does have anxiety.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (AR 487-89.)

Remand\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff asks the Court to remand for immediate benefits under the credit-as-true rule.

This evidence, if taken as true, demonstrates that Plaintiff has been disabled at least since the age of 11, and thus is entitled to both disabled adult child benefits and supplemental security benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garrison\n   </em>\n   , 759 F.3d at, 1022 n.28 ;\n   <em>\n    Brown-Hunter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358706\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/806/487/#p495\">\n    806 F.3d at 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The touchstone for an award of benefits is the existence of a disability, not the agency's legal error.\"). The Commissioner insists that remand for an award of benefits is improper because the \"there is no question that Plaintiff's childhood disability improved over time.\" (Dkt. No. 25: at 8:18.) The Commissioner offers no evidentiary support for this statement-because there is none. Indeed, the ALJ offered no explanation for his decision that although Plaintiff was disabled as a child, he was not disabled shortly before his 22nd birthday, but was disabled again after his 24th birthday. Nor does the record reflect any such evidence. \"[T]he credit-as-true rule foreclose[s] the argument that a remand for the purpose of allowing the ALJ to have a mulligan qualifies as a remand for a useful purpose under the first part of credit-as-true analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garrison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4157089\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/759/995/#p1014\">\n    759 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1021 (citing\n   <em>\n    Benecke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2180220\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/379/587/#p595\">\n    379 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   595 ) (\"Allowing the Commissioner to decide the issue again would create an unfair 'heads we win; tails, let's play again' system of disability benefits adjudication.\") In sum, there is no serious doubt based on the Court's evaluation of the record as a whole\n   that Plaintiff was and is disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court is particularly disheartened by the arbitrariness of the ALJ's decision here and the absence of any subsequent exercise of discretion upon review by either the Appeals Council or the Agency to acknowledge that there is no basis for the ALJ's decision-despite the vigorous efforts of Plaintiff's counsel. As a result, two and a half years have passed since the ALJ's decision during which time Plaintiff has been denied benefits to which he would otherwise be entitled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. No. 18) and DENIES Defendant's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. No. 25). The Court VACATES the ALJ's final decision and REMANDS for an award of disabled adult child benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Both parties have consented to the jurisdiction of a magistrate judge pursuant to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c).
