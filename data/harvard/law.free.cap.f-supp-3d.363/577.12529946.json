The employer's internal drug policies mandated termination for a failed drug test and warned employees the Assistance Program would not prevent later termination. This employer decided to first place the employee in the Assistance Program for several weeks with pay and then, when he finished, hold a disciplinary hearing. Following the hearing, the employer terminated him for marijuana use as required in its internal policies. He claims, among other things, the employer fired him in retaliation for being enrolled in the Assistance Program. But the Family and Medical Leave Act only allows a retaliation claim when the employee shows his employer retaliated against him for invoking his federal rights. The evidence today is the employee never invoked his federal rights. His employer automatically placed him in the Assistance Program and then, consistent with its policy, terminated him for admitted marijuana use several weeks later. There is also no disputed fact issue as to the employee's lack of foot disability when terminated as his doctor cleared him for work over seven months earlier. We grant the employer's motion for summary judgment in the accompanying Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

In his report to PECO, Dr. Baer cleared Mr. Parrotta for \"full duty\" work effective January 10, 2017, with no restrictions, no prescribed medications, and no further treatment. No reasonable fact-finder would believe PECO regarded Mr. Parrotta as having an impairment when it terminated him after Dr. Baer cleared Mr. Parrotta for full duty without restrictions seven months before it terminated him. While Mr. Parrotta told Mr. Fenico and Ms. Shaw at the August 16, 2017 fact-finding he took marijuana to treat the pain in his foot, an employer's awareness of an employee's pain is not enough to establish the \"regarded as\" prong.\n   <footnotemark>\n    134\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Parrotta fails to raise a genuine issue of fact as to whether PECO regarded him as having an impairment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   As Mr. Parrotta fails to show he was \"disabled\" under the Act, he fails to establish a prima facie case for disability discrimination. Even assuming we found a prima facie case for disability discrimination, we also find no evidence creating genuine issues of material fact precluding summary judgment in PECO's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. PECO articulates a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Mr. Parrotta.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Upon showing a prima facie case, the burden shifts to PECO to proffer a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Mr. Parrotta. PECO proffers a reason: \"At all times, [PECO] made clear that [Mr. Parrotta] was terminated based on his first verified positive drug test, which, for exempt employees called for termination under [PECO]'s policies.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    135\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Parrotta does not dispute this contention. We find PECO proffers a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Mr. Parrotta.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    iv. Mr. Parrotta fails to show pretext.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Since PECO articulates a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating him, Mr. Parrotta must show the proffered reason is pretextual. Mr. Parrotta offers two reasons for pretext: (1) because PECO maintained a \"zero-tolerance\" Drug and Alcohol policy, PECO would have terminated him immediately following his positive drug test rather than waiting 107 days to terminate him; and, (2) PECO terminated three other exempt employees for a first-time positive drug test for marijuana \"in a very short period of time\" compared to Mr. Parrotta's termination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    136\n   </footnotemark>\n   PECO argues Mr. Parrotta fails to adduce evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could find discrimination was \"more likely than not\" the reason for termination. PECO further argues because it terminated\n   the three other exempt employees, Mr. Parrotta fails to show PECO treated similarly-situated employees more favorably.\n   <footnotemark>\n    137\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   To show pretext, Mr. Parrotta must offer evidence \"from which a factfinder could reasonably either (1) disbelieve [PECO's] articulated legitimate reasons; or (2) believe that an invidious discriminatory reason was more likely than not a motivating or determinative cause of [PECO's] action.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    138\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Under the first option, Mr. Parrotta must \"demonstrate such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in [PECO's] proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find them 'unworthy of credence,' and hence infer 'that [PECO] did not act for [the asserted] non-discriminatory reasons.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    139\n   </footnotemark>\n   To discredit PECO's reason, Mr. Parrotta \"must show, not merely that [PECO]'s proffered reason was wrong, but that it was so plainly wrong that it cannot have been [PECO]'s real reason.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    140\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[T]he factual dispute at issue is whether discriminatory animus motivated the employer, not whether the employer is wise, shrewd, prudent, or competent.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    141\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Under the second option, Mr. Parrotta must offer evidence showing \"(1) [he] has previously been discriminated against by [PECO]; (2) [PECO] has discriminated against other persons with disabilities; or (3) [PECO] has treated similarly situated persons without a disability more favorably.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    142\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    a.

Because of the delay-and Exelon's Drug and Alcohol Policy allowing for management's discretion concerning termination-PECO's proffered reason for termination suffers from \"too many weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, and contradictions\" and thus suggests PECO terminated him because of his alleged disability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    143\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Mr. Parrotta acknowledges while Exelon's Drug and Alcohol Policy provides \"[f]or exempt employees, the first positive drug test will result in termination of employment,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    144\n   </footnotemark>\n   elsewhere the Policy provides \"[e]mployees who violate this Policy are subject to discipline, up to and including immediate termination of employment, as determined in management's discretion.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    145\n   </footnotemark>\n   After his positive drug on May 15, 2017, PECO did not immediately terminate him.

Mr. Parrotta admitted to PECO representatives he used an illegal drug. PECO provides in its Drug and Alcohol Policy \"[f]or exempt employees, the first positive drug test will result in termination.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    160\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The fact PECO waited 107 days before terminating him does not make PECO's reason unbelievable, nor does it suggest PECO fired him because of his alleged disability. As Mr. Parrotta admits, PECO must still \"go through a process\" before terminating employees for positive drug tests. The process involves the Employee Assistance Program, a fact-finding hearing, a consensus call, and an executive termination call. While he argues PECO representatives told him or suggested he could return to work after completing the Employee Assistance Program, PECO ultimately terminated him. The Drug and Alcohol Policy provides \"participation in the [Employee Assistance Program] or seeking treatment will not prevent disciplinary action, up to and including termination, for a violation of this Policy[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    161\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Fenico advised Mr. Parrotta completion of the program was not a \"guarantee of continued employment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    162\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Parrotta does not suggest anyone told him PECO would not terminate him for a positive drug test. PECO importantly never changed its reason for terminating Mr. Parrotta. Nor does Mr. Parrotta's evidence suggest PECO terminated him for his alleged disability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    163\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Mr. Parrotta seems to argue because the Drug and Alcohol Policy allowed for PECO's discretion to terminate him for a positive drug test or it otherwise failed to automatically fire him as exempt employee\n   with a positive drug test, a factfinder could infer a discriminatory motive. We cannot agree. Mr. Parrotta must offer evidence showing a factfinder would rationally disbelieve PECO terminated him for violating the Drug and Alcohol Policy. Merely pointing to a discretionary policy does not undermine the proffered reason.\n   <footnotemark>\n    164\n   </footnotemark>\n   If Mr. Parrotta showed PECO used its discretion to treat employees without a disability more favorably, he could raise an issue of fact concerning whether PECO's reason was pretextual since such evidence shows a discriminatory motive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    165\n   </footnotemark>\n   But he fails to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Mr. Parrotta points to alleged deficiencies in, and witnesses' inability to recall details from, the fact-finding and consensus call, including (1) Mr. Fenico and Ms. Shaw's failure to ask follow-up questions during, or locate their notes from, the fact-finding hearing; (2) the failure to discuss Mr. Parrotta's medical condition and FMLA leave during the consensus call and executive termination call; and (3) the failure to determine whether Mr. Parrotta engaged in protected activity in violation of its termination policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   This evidence does not render PECO's reasons \"unworthy of credence.\" We do not inquire whether PECO \"conducted a comprehensive investigation or whether they made a wise or prudent decision,\" but \"whether [PECO's] decision was motivated by discriminatory animus.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    166\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Parrotta's evidence does not suggest PECO terminated him because of the disability he alleges-the second plantar plate tear in his left foot. Mr. Parrotta does not show discriminatory animus based on his disability; at the time of his termination, PECO had no reason to believe Mr. Parrotta was disabled when his treating doctor cleared him for \"full duty\" with no restrictions, no prescribed medications, and no further treatment more than seven months before his termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Mr. Parrotta admits he tested positive for an illegal drug and no medical professional prescribed the drug. Mr. Parrotta also admits PECO's Drug and Alcohol Policy provides \"[f]or exempt employees, the first positive drug test will result in termination of employment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    167\n   </footnotemark>\n   While he points to deficiencies in the fact-finding hearing, consensus call, and the termination call, such deficiencies do not establish pretext.\n   <footnotemark>\n    168\n   </footnotemark>\n   No reasonable fact-finder would disbelieve PECO terminated Mr. Parrotta for a positive drug test because of these\n   deficiencies. Most importantly, these deficiencies fail to show PECO terminated him because of his alleged disability. Such evidence does not render PECO's reason for termination \"so plainly wrong that it cannot have been [PECO]'s real reason.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    169\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Mr. Parrotta fails to show PECO treated similarly-situated employees more favorably than him.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   To show disability discrimination was \"more likely than not\" the reason for his termination, Mr. Parrotta argues PECO treated similarly-situated employees without a disability more favorably than it treated him. Mr. Parrotta argues \"three other exempt employees who [PECO] terminated for positive drug tests (none of who presented medical explanations during their fact findings) were all terminated in a very short time period.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    170\n   </footnotemark>\n   While PECO terminated Mr. Parrotta 107 days after his positive drug test, PECO terminated these three comparator employees eight, thirty-eight, and forty days after their respective positive drug tests.\n   <footnotemark>\n    171\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Mr. Parrotta's argument misses the mark. Mr. Parrotta must show PECO treated similarly-situated employees\n   <strong>\n    more favorably\n   </strong>\n   than it treated him. PECO terminated these three exempt employees following their first positive drug tests for marijuana; in other words, PECO treated Mr. Parrotta\n   <strong>\n    the same\n   </strong>\n   as it treated these three employees. Although PECO terminated these employees sooner after their positive tests, we fail to see how such evidence proves PECO treated these employees more favorably. In fact, as PECO approved Mr. Parrotta for paid leave following the drug test,\n   <footnotemark>\n    172\n   </footnotemark>\n   PECO likely treated Mr. Parrotta more favorably than the comparator employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   We are not reviewing a situation where an employer terminated an employee for using a legitimate, lawful drug. In such a case, the plaintiff may be able to claim discrimination. Mr. Parrotta used an illegal drug without a prescription from a medical professional and PECO terminated him under its Drug and Alcohol Policy. While PECO employed Mr. Parrotta longer than the three comparator employees following their respective positive drug tests, this does not show PECO treated the other employees more favorably. Mr. Parrotta points to deficiencies in the termination process, but such evidence does not suggest PECO's reason for termination was \"plainly wrong.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Mr. Parrotta fails to raise an issue of fact as to whether PECO's proffered reason for terminating him is pretextual.

Mr. Parrotta fails to establish a prima facie case for FMLA retaliation for his FMLA leave from May 19, 2017 to August 12, 2017.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Mr. Parrotta argues PECO retaliated against him by terminating shortly after he returned from his second FMLA leave on August 12, 2017. PECO argues Mr. Parrotta cannot establish a prima facie case because he did not invoke his rights under the FMLA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Mr. Parrotta cites his lawyer's Rule 26 Report to show he invoked his rights: \"On May 23, 2017, [PECO]'s FMLA Coordinator informed [Mr. Parrotta] that [he] was eligible for FMLA leave and that [PECO] had approved [his] FMLA leave\n   <strong>\n    request,\n   </strong>\n   beginning on May 19, 2017.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    192\n   </footnotemark>\n   But PECO\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   cites Mr. Parrotta's own deposition showing he did not request FMLA leave:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-166\">\n   Q: You state or your Complaint asserts that \"On May 22\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   , 2017, [Mr. Parrotta] informed [PECO] that he needed FMLA leave beginning on May 22\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   , 2017.\" Who did you inform that you needed FMLA leave?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-167\">\n   A: May 22\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   ? I don't remember....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-168\">\n   Q: And so your contention is that you requested FMLA, so you could attend the diversion program?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-169\">\n   A: I didn't request it. It was just-it was just a letter I got in the mail. I didn't request it....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-170\">\n   Q: So you agree with me that it is not really accurate to say that you notified [PECO] that you needed FMLA leave; correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-171\">\n   A: Correct. It was just assigned. It was just given.\n   <footnotemark>\n    193\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Regardless of his lawyer's position in a Rule 26 Report, Mr. Parrotta admitted under oath he did not request FMLA leave; rather PECO assigned him to the Employee Assistance Program and internally treated him as subject to FMLA leave to complete the Employee Assistance Program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   We recognize the apparent facial unfairness; one might argue PECO places Mr. Parrotta on leave to participate in the Employee Assistance Program so he does not invoke his FMLA rights and thus cannot sue when he is fired shortly after his FMLA leave for the conduct leading to the Employee Assistance Program. But this facial inequity fades when PECO's Policy reminded Mr. Parrotta the Employee Assistance Program did not affect a later finding leading to termination. Mr. Parrotta neither invoked his federal rights nor knew of his FMLA protections as there is no evidence PECO told Mr. Parrotta of the FMLA internal treatment. Mr. Parrotta admitted using an illegal marijuana drug as a Senior Engineer. PECO provided him with an Employee Assistance Program to address his marijuana use. It did not guarantee his job after completing the Employee Assistance Program. Another alternative would be PECO firing Mr. Parrotta for the marijuana use as required under its Policy and not providing him with the Employee Assistance Program while being paid. Federal law, including the FMLA, does not allow a retaliation claim when Mr. Parrotta fails to establish he invoked his rights under the FMLA. It is incongruous to argue an employer retaliates against an employee for taking FMLA leave when the employer puts the employee on leave and there is no evidence the employee knows he is on FMLA leave. He just knows he is getting paid while participating in the Employee Assistance Program. He thus fails to establish a prima facie case for FMLA retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   We grant PECO summary judgment on Mr. Parrotta's FMLA retaliation claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   <strong>\n    D. We dismiss Mr. Parrotta's tortious interference claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   PECO argues Mr. Parrotta fails to establish a claim for tortious interference as a matter of law. Mr. Parrotta argues PECO had no justification for interfering with his new employment with Burns because its \"Rehiring Retirees\" policy applies only to \"retirees\" and Mr. Parrotta was not a \"retiree.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    194\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   As we grant summary judgment to PECO on Mr. Parrotta's federal claims, we decline jurisdiction on his state law claim. When \"all federal claims are eliminated before trial, a federal court should\n   normally hesitate to exercise jurisdiction unless considerations of judicial economy, convenience, and fairness to litigants counsel otherwise.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    195\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Bloom\n   </em>\n   , Judge McHugh declined jurisdiction over the plaintiff's state law claims after granting summary judgment for the defendant on the plaintiff's federal claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    196\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, we are similarly at the summary judgment stage. The parties are not diverse as they are both citizens of Pennsylvania.\n   <footnotemark>\n    197\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties may be able to use the discovery from this case in state court. We dismiss Mr. Parrotta's state law claim for tortious interference without prejudice to Mr. Parrotta bringing this claim in state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   In an accompanying Order, we grant PECO summary judgment on Mr. Parrotta's claims for (1) disability discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act, (2) retaliation under the Disabilities Act and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act, and (3) retaliation under the FMLA.
