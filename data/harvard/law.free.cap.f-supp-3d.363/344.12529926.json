In short, the Employment Agreement mandates arbitration for all disputes arising from Plaintiff's employment with Defendant, and the Loyalty Agreement, subject to this requirement, provides for exclusive jurisdiction in Virginia for any judicial proceedings between the parties.

Even assuming \"it is sufficient for an employee seeking to avoid arbitration to show a likelihood that he or she will be responsible for significant arbitrators' fees, or other costs which would not be incurred in a judicial forum,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ball v.

The only costs she alleges involve the expense of travel to Virginia, where the arbitration will be located. As Defendant points out, however, if cost of travel is prohibitive, Plaintiff can request that the arbitrator order depositions to be held in New York or utilize expedited procedures, authorized by the American Association of Arbitration, including submission without an oral hearing. Reply at 7. As the Second Circuit stated in\n   <em>\n    Harrington\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Atl. Sounding Co.\n   </em>\n   , \"[Plaintiff]'s contention that the Agreement is substantively unconscionable because the financial cost of arbitration essentially 'extinguish[ed] [his] ability to pursue' his claims, fails because the Rules of Employment for the American Association of Arbitration ('AAA') expressly provide that '[t]he AAA may, in the event of extreme hardship on any party, defer or reduce the administrative fees,' and [Plaintiff] has not explained why the fees would not be deferred or reduced in his case.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3921293\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/602/113/#p126\">\n    602 F.3d 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 126 (2d Cir. 2010) (citations omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doctor's Assocs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1540680\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/150/157/#p163\">\n    150 F.3d at 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting a franchisee's argument that the arbitration clause was unconscionable as it would require him to travel from New Jersey to Connecticut to pursue his claims). The same is true here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff's argument that \"the arbitration clause is unenforceable because it allows Defendant-but not Plaintiff-to file for injunctive and declaratory relief in a court of law\" is also unconvincing.

The provision in the arbitration clause allowing Defendant to seek injunctive relief upon violation of the\n   <em>\n    Loyalty Agreement\n   </em>\n   does not reflect a broader lack of mutuality in Employment Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Plazza v.

Under New York law, the defense of economic duress or coercion is \"reserved for extreme and extraordinary cases, where the party asserting economic duress can show (1) threats of an unlawful act by one party that (2) compel performance by the other party of an act that it had a legal right to abstain from performing.\"\n   <em>\n    Adler v.
