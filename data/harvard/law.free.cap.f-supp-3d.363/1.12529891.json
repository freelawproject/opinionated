KELLY, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   As part of its effort to improve the collection of work-related injury data, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\"), an agency of the Department of Labor, requires qualifying employers to record work-related injuries and illnesses on a set of standardized forms. Initially, OSHA only occasionally collected these forms from employers, either during on-site inspections or as part of broader industry surveys. But in May 2016, OSHA issued a new rule requiring employers to submit them-three in total-electronically each year. In May 2018, however, and after the first filing deadline had passed, OSHA announced employers were only required to submit one of the three forms while it considered revising or rescinding the existing rule, citing privacy and waste concerns. In fact, OSHA stated that, until it completed its review, it would not accept two of the three forms from employers at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs in this action, three public-health advocacy groups, view these forms as valuable sources of workplace health data, and they allege that they intended to use that data in their research and advocacy efforts once OSHA collected it. Plaintiffs\n   commenced this action after OSHA announced that it was suspending the rule while it engaged in notice-and-comment rulemaking, and that it would not accept two of the forms during that time. Their complaint alleges that OSHA's conduct violated the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20500\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and thus unlawfully deprived them of access to an important source of workplace health data.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 (\"Compl.\"). They seek declaratory and injunctive relief requiring OSHA to lift its suspension of the filing deadlines and to accept all three forms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Over six weeks after filing their complaint, Plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction. ECF No. 7 (\"PI Mot.\"). Plaintiffs did not request a hearing on their motion. While that motion was pending, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, on the grounds that Plaintiffs lack standing, and for failure to state a claim, on the ground that the challenged conduct was an exercise of discretion not subject to judicial review under the APA. ECF No. 13 (\"MTD\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court finds that Plaintiffs have standing to proceed with their claims and that the challenged agency conduct was not simply an exercise of enforcement discretion, but rather a complete suspension of a regulatory deadline subject to review. As a result, the Court will deny Defendants' motion to dismiss. Nonetheless, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that they will suffer irreparable harm absent preliminary injunctive relief, and it will therefore deny Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction as well.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

They did not, however, request a hearing on their motion. In addition to elaborating on their claims under the APA, Plaintiffs describe the harm that they are allegedly suffering as a result of Defendants' conduct. Specifically, they maintain that when OSHA decided to suspend the submission deadline and to refuse to accept any submissions of Forms 300 and 301, it deprived them of \"access to an important source of timely injury and illness information, which will make it more difficult for each of them and their members to analyze the causes of workplace injuries and illnesses and work toward preventing them.\" PI Mot. at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On October 29, 2018, with Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction pending, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and (b)(6), arguing that Plaintiffs do not have standing to bring their claims and that they seek to challenge nonjusticiable exercises of OSHA's enforcement discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 1-2, 7. Defendants contend first that Plaintiffs lack Article III standing because the relief that they seek-an injunction requiring OSHA to lift the suspension of\n   the Electronic Reporting Rule and accept forms submitted under the Rule-is not likely to redress the injury they have alleged. Specifically, they argue that OSHA has no intention of making the information it would collect under the Rule publicly available and that the information would be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") even if Plaintiffs requested access to it.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2036%2C494\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2036%2C494\">\n    at 10-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As an initial matter, Plaintiffs have cited no authority for the proposition that a\n   <em>\n    proposed\n   </em>\n   rule can justify preliminary injunctive relief. And the Court finds such a proposition dubious. OSHA is under no obligation to adhere to its original proposal-nor must it issue any new rule at all-and thus Plaintiffs' speculation that the result of the rulemaking will mirror the proposal and completely rescind the Electronic Reporting Rule is not so \"certain and immediate\" as to amount to irreparable harm.\n   <em>\n    Elec.Privacy Info.

Plaintiffs are challenging Defendants' allegedly unlawful\n   <em>\n    suspension\n   </em>\n   of the Electronic Reporting Rule in May 2018, which they contend amounted to substantive rulemaking subject to the requirements of the APA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 20-29; PI Mot. at 9-10, 12. And OSHA will not affect any alleged harm caused to Plaintiffs by its original suspension of the July 2018 deadline-loss of access to data employers were required to submit by that date-by permanently rescinding the Rule\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   that compliance deadline passed and the obligations of covered employers were allegedly unlawfully postponed.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Natural Res.

Thus, assuming that Plaintiffs are successful on the merits of their claims, the Court may still declare the earlier suspension of the Rule unlawful, require OSHA to recognize the July 2018 submission deadline, and give Plaintiffs the relief they seek-data that employers should have been required to submit to OSHA by July 2018. But to the extent Plaintiffs claim that they will suffer irreparable harm because OSHA may unlawfully rescind the Electronic Reporting Rule in the future, that action is not before the Court-nor can it be-and Plaintiffs cannot rely on it to claim irreparable harm here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Second, the Court is not persuaded by Plaintiffs claim that even\n   <em>\n    delay\n   </em>\n   in their ability to access and use the information submitted under the Rule inflicts irreparable harm.

But the Court of Appeals in that case, consistent with well-established case law, held further that to be\n   <em>\n    irreparable\n   </em>\n   , that organizational injury must also be irremediable absent preliminary relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    League of Women Voters,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172291\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/838/1/#p9\">\n    838 F.3d at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Moreover, and equally telling, Plaintiffs waited over three months after learning that OSHA had suspended the Electronic Reporting Rule in May 2018-and over six weeks after filing their complaint-to seek preliminary relief.

Nonetheless, the Court need not address that question, because even if the records qualify under either Exemption, the Court finds that OSHA likely could not withhold so substantial a portion of those records as to deprive Plaintiffs of significant redress.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    The Court recognizes that, ordinarily, it is the withholding agency's burden to show that requested records are exempt.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Assassination Archives &amp; Research Ctr. v. CIA\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702331,1530069\" index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/334/55/\">\n     334 F.3d 55\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 57 (D.C. Cir. 2003). But Plaintiffs bear the burden of sufficiently alleging standing, including the redressability requirement. Thus, to satisfy that burden here, Plaintiffs must show that it is likely that OSHA would be unable to carry its burden to claim an exemption in a subsequent FOIA suit. The Court finds that Plaintiffs have done so.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Though the Court has focused exclusively on the organizations' claimed injuries, the analysis would not differ for their individual members. Those members claim the same injury as a result of their inability to use the data, and thus suffer from the same deficiency for purposes of irreparable harm.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Plaintiffs did not attach this declaration to their original motion, and thus filed a motion for leave from the Court to file this declaration and another declaration Plaintiffs attached to their reply.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Supp. Decl.
