Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff first filed his DIB and SSI applications on February 15, 2011, alleging disability beginning July 15, 2007. Plaintiff's application was denied initially and he did not appeal. Plaintiff filed the underlying DIB and SSI applications on July 30, 2013, again alleging disability beginning July 15, 2007. Tr. 260-263, 266-271. Plaintiff's application was denied initially, as well as on reconsideration. A hearing was held before an Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") on March 2, 2016. Tr. 52. The ALJ issued his decision on April 8, 2016. Tr. 32. He determined that Plaintiff had medically determinable impairments of \"proctalgia with irritable bowel syndrome, rectal pain with history of congenital rectal reconstruction, constipation and diarrhea,\" and that these impairments could reasonably be expected to cause Plaintiff's alleged symptoms. Tr 35. However, he further determined that Plaintiff's \"statements concerning the intensity, persistence and limiting effects of [Plaintiff's] symptoms [were] not entirely credible.\" Tr. 40. Thus, the ALJ concluded that Plaintiff was not under a disability within the meaning of the Social Security Act. Tr. 46. Plaintiff filed a request for review of the ALJ's decision, which was denied by the Appeals Council on June 13, 2017, making the ALJ's decision the \"final decision\" of the Commissioner. Tr. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 14, 2018, Plaintiff filed his brief challenging the ALJ's decision on four grounds: (1) the ALJ failed to adequately explain his findings regarding Plaintiff's residual functional capacity, as required under Social Security Ruling (\"SSR\") 96-8p; (2) the ALJ erred in finding that Plaintiff's \"decreased concentration and memory impairment were not medically determinable impairments and subsequently fail[ed] to consider those impairments in the [residual functional capacity (\"RFC\") ] assessment\"; (3) the \"ALJ failed to properly assess the medical source opinion evidence\"; and (4) the ALJ failed to properly consider Plaintiff's subjective complaints as required under SSR 16-3p. ECF No. 18 at 17, 18, 22, 27. The Commissioner filed her response to Plaintiff's brief on April 19, 2018.

On October 17, 2018, the Magistrate Judge filed her Report recommending that the Commissioner's decision to deny benefits be affirmed. ECF No. 21. The Magistrate Judge addressed Plaintiff's first and fourth arguments together, on the basis that \"Plaintiff's allegations of error largely center on the ALJ's treatment of Plaintiff's alleged limitations as a result of his rectal issues including constipation and diarrhea.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As to Plaintiff's fourth issue, the Magistrate Judge concluded that \"after a thorough discussion of the record, the ALJ ultimately found Plaintiff's testimony as to the severity of his fecal urgency [ ] inconsistent with the available evidence,\" and that \"[w]hile Plaintiff argues that there is evidence in the record to support his subjective statements regarding his fecal urgency, such reweighing of the evidence is not within the province of this Court.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   at 12. As to Plaintiff's third argument regarding the ALJ's assessment of his treating physician's medical opinions, the Magistrate Judge concluded that the ALJ properly explained his reasons for affording the treating physician's opinion little weight and for affording the opinions of the state medical consultants great weight, and further concluded that Plaintiff has \"failed to demonstrate that the ALJ's conclusions regarding the medical opinions are unsupported by substantial evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. Lastly, as to Plaintiff's contention that the ALJ failed to consider Plaintiff's decreased concentration and memory loss as medically determinable impairments, the Magistrate Judge disagreed and found that the ALJ's opinion includes an examination of the evidence relevant to those limitations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    at 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The court is charged with making a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   determination of any portions of the Report to which a specific objection is made.

Although he testified he was unable to sit for longer than 15-20 minutes at a time, I note he sat through his entire hearing, which began at 10:15 am and ended at 11:34 am using a cushioned chair pad and did alter his position or stand [sic]. The claimant's assertions regarding activities, and the statements from examining sources with regard to non-exertional limitations, led to a conclusion that the degree of incapacitation is not as severe as expressed in the testimony and pre-hearing statements.

For instance, Plaintiff asserts, \"his ability to sit is not the issue, although Peterson maintains that he has rectal pain while sitting and the record shows he had a special chair at the hearing and that he said he was in pain and needed to move around a little (Tr. 57, 76).\" ECF No. 23 at 3. In addition, Plaintiff contends he testified \"he could not sit to watch a 2-hour movie, he did not perform any household chores, when shopping he had to run to the bathroom and he did not stay in the store for a long time, and he sat around the house,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, and therefore \"his activities of daily living are not indicative of an ability to stay at a workstation without needing additional bathroom breaks.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, Plaintiff argues the ALJ improperly attributed significance to the fact that he does not use adult diapers, stating the ALJ \"fail[ed] to explain how adult diapers would restore his ability to work.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Whether the ALJ adequately supported his decision not to account in the RFC for the frequency and duration of Plaintiff's daily bathroom breaks is a close call. However, the court finds that the omission is not supported by substantial evidence, and therefore remand is appropriate. In assessing the RFC, the ALJ relied on Plaintiff's testimony regarding his activities of daily living, Plaintiff's decision not to use prescribed suppositories or wear adult diapers, and Plaintiff's conduct\n   during the hearing. The court addresses these bases seriatim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   First, the court finds that Plaintiff's activities of daily living are not particularly relevant to the limitation caused by Plaintiff's frequent need to use the bathroom. While Plaintiff testified to walking his dog, helping his sister with errands and chores, and attending church services, he expressly qualified his participation in those activities on account of his pain.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 77, 78, 80. Accordingly, when Plaintiff participates in the above activities, his participation is limited in nature and short in duration. And his participation does not appear to prevent him from accessing the bathroom whenever the need arises. For instance, when he walks his dog he does not travel far from the house.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 84 (\"I walk halfway down the road....\"). When he accompanies his sister on a grocery store errand, he anticipates he will need to use the bathroom,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 81 (\"I don't walk too much because I know when I walk with her with the buggy and everything, I got to run to the bathroom\"), or he will simply wait for her in the car.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff testified that \"[m]ost of the time, I sit around the house,\" or that he \"might walk over next door to [his] aunt's house.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 83. Plaintiff also testified that he will occasionally sit outside and watch his nieces and nephews for a few minutes at a time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 84, 85. In each of these scenarios, Plaintiff has unlimited access to a bathroom; therefore, Plaintiff's participation in these activities is not at odds with the average number of daily bathroom visits he purports to need.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As for medication, Plaintiff testified that he could not afford the suppositories his physician prescribed to help him with the sensation of needing to use the bathroom. ECF No. 8-2 at 76. Plaintiff also testified that while his doctors had recommended surgery, he could not afford a surgical consultation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 70-71. As the Magistrate Judge noted, the ALJ may not discredit Plaintiff's symptoms on the basis that he did not avail himself of medicine, supplies, or procedures that he could not afford. ECF No. 21 at 11 n.2 (citing\n   <em>\n    Lovejoy v. Heckler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1579002\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/790/1114/#p1117\">\n    790 F.2d 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1117 (4th Cir. 1986) ). The ALJ also noted that Plaintiff does not wear adult diapers. However, the ALJ did not account for the fact that Plaintiff has access to the bathroom at any time throughout the day because he spends his days at home. And Plaintiff testified that he visits the bathroom multiple times during the night. ECF No. 8-2 at 79. There is no need for Plaintiff to wear adult diapers, and incur the associated expense and effort, if he can take a bathroom break whenever he requires, day or night. Accordingly, whether Plaintiff currently wears adult diapers has no bearing on his ability to perform work in the national economy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   With respect to Plaintiff's demeanor during the hearing, the hearing lasted approximately one hour and fifteen minutes. Plaintiff's ability to sit for this length of time without requiring a bathroom break is not necessarily at odds with his representation that he requires on average ten bathroom breaks a day. And, the court notes that the ALJ did not ask Plaintiff if he was wearing an adult diaper at the time of the hearing, or if he had otherwise taken preparations that would ensure he could sit for a period of time without access to the bathroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The court will not substitute its judgment for that of the ALJ; however, the ALJ must support his factual findings with substantial evidence.\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

The ALJ did not take specific issue with Plaintiff's credibility, but rather pointed to references in the record to show that Plaintiff is not as limited by the sensation of fecal urgency as he represents himself to be. However, the court finds on examination of the ALJ's references that the evidence supports, rather than detracts from, Plaintiff's representations regarding how often he visits the bathroom.

There are no treatment records after September 2014. Treatment records in February, May and September 2014, showed he reported improvement in his anorectal pain (Exhibits 12F, 15F and 16F). Treatment records from his primary treating physicians at Sumter Family Healthcare repeatedly showed normal physical examinations and diagnoses of controlled adult onset diabetes mellitus and controlled benign essential hypertension.

The medical record does not contain any follow-up treatment records from Dr. Thomas.

In reviewing Plaintiff's complaints, the ALJ determined not merely that the alleged memory loss and concentration deficit do not qualify as severe impairments, but that these conditions are not medically determinable impairments. Therefore, the ALJ did not thereafter consider the allegations of memory loss and concentration deficit at subsequent steps of the sequential evaluation. Because the ALJ ceased to consider the allegations of memory loss and concentration deficit after his step two analysis, the court agrees with the Magistrate Judge that Plaintiff's objection implicates the step two determination.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    As the Magistrate Judge noted, Plaintiff appears to use learning disability and concentration deficit interchangeably.
