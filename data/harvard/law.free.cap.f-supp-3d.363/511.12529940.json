(\"Citrix\") filed suit against Defendant Avi Networks, Inc. (\"Avi\") on December 21, 2017. (D.I. 1) Citrix alleges infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 9,148,493 (\"the '493 patent\"), 8,631,120 (\"the '120 patent\"), 8,230,055 (\"the '055 patent\"), and 7,720,954 (\"the '954 patent\"). (D.I. 21) Citrix also asserts claims for false advertising and unfair competition under the Lanham Act, the Delaware Deceptive Trade Practices Act, and common law.\n   <em>\n    (Id.)\n   </em>\n   On June 6, 2018, Avi moved to partially dismiss the First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\") for failure to state a claim, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), contending that the asserted claims of the '055 and '954 patents are not directed to patent-eligible subject matter under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The asserted claims of the '055 and '954 patents allow one to identify whether a network service is available by determining whether the service's response time exceeds the service's average response time by a predefined amount.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the response time is greater than the average response time plus the predefined amount, the service is deemed unavailable. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   '055 patent, 26:34-61) According to the patent, this \"dynamic\" approach provides more accurate identification of service availability than the prior art, which determines availability using a static, pre-defined response time, because the dynamic approach takes into account variations due to increased load or type of request. ( '055 patent, 1:17-47)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The '055 patent is entitled \"Method and Appliance for Using a Dynamic Response Time To Determine Responsiveness of Network Services.\" Claim 1 of the '055 patent recites:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   A method for determining responsiveness of a service via a particular protocol, the method comprising:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (a) determining, by a device intermediary to a plurality of clients and a plurality of services, response times from each of a plurality of services to respond to requests via a first type of protocol of a plurality of protocols;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (b) calculating, by the device, an average response time for the first type of protocol from each of the response times of the plurality of services;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (c) establishing, by the device, a predetermined threshold for which a response time of a service for the first type of protocol may deviate from the average response time; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (d) identifying, by the device, a service as available responsive to determining that a deviation of the response time of the service from the average response falls within the predetermined threshold.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The '954 patent is the parent of the '055 patent and shares with it a title and specification.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 33 at 10-12) Instead, the purported technical benefits flow directly from the idea of using a dynamic - as opposed to a static - response time to determine availability. In virtually every context, technical and non-technical, an average of prior response times will be a better gauge of availability than a static threshold. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   D.I. 25 at 11-12) (providing non-technical examples of using dynamic response time to determine availability) Contrary to Citrix's contention, then, the use of dynamic response times is not \"necessarily rooted in computer networks.\" (D.I. 33 at 13-14) The technical context recited by the claims - service availability in a computer network - does not change the nature of this idea, and every technical advantage identified by Citrix ultimately stems from the same\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     generalized\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   improved determination of availability that the use of a dynamic response time would provide in any other context.

(\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   D.I. 38, 46, 55) In\n   <em>\n    BSG Tech,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518052\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/1281/#p1290\">\n    899 F.3d at 1283-85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Federal Circuit evaluated the patent-eligibility of claims directed to a \"self-evolving generic index\" that assisted users entering data into a database by providing the users with information from prior data entries. The Court found that the claims were directed to the abstract idea of \"considering historical usage information while inputting data,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518052\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/1281/#p1290\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518052\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/1281/#p1290\">\n    at 1286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and that the claims lacked an inventive concept because the only allegedly unconventional feature of the claims was the abstract idea,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518052\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/1281/#p1290\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518052\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/1281/#p1290\">\n    at 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Avi contends that\n   <em>\n    BSG Tech\n   </em>\n   requires rejection of Citrix's argument that the claims are \"directed to\" a technical improvement in computer networks. (D.I. 38 at 1, 3-5) Citrix distinguishes the case, contending that its own claims solve technical problems with technical solutions, while arguing that the claims in\n   <em>\n    BSG Tech\n   </em>\n   were instead directed to \"the very human activity of organizing information about various items based on their attributes.\" (D.I. 46 at 1-2) The Court agrees with Avi. Fundamentally, both this case and\n   <em>\n    BSG Tech\n   </em>\n   involve patents that apply an abstract idea in a technological context to obtain a purported technical benefit. In\n   <em>\n    BSG Tech,\n   </em>\n   the technological context was in \"wide access databases,\" and the technical improvement was to \"allow[ ] users to quickly and efficiently access hundreds of thousands or even millions of records, and still find only those few records that are relevant.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518052\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/1281/#p1290\">\n    899 F.3d at 1286, 1288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the technological context is computer networks, and the purported benefits arise from more accurate determination of whether a network service is available. Accordingly, here, as in\n   <em>\n    BSG Tech,\n   </em>\n   the claims are not directed to a technical improvement as the purported technical benefit flows solely from an abstract idea. That in\n   <em>\n    BSG Tech\n   </em>\n   the abstract idea was a method of organizing human activity, and here is a mathematical formula, is of no consequence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   As claim 1 of each of the asserted patents are directed to an abstract idea, the Court must proceed to step two of the analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Step Two\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   A claim directed to an abstract idea is nevertheless patent eligible if it captures an \"inventive concept\" beyond what was \"well-understood, routine, and conventional\" at the time of the invention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alice,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/#p2355\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The only allegedly unconventional feature of the claims is the use of dynamic (as opposed to static) response time to determine availability. (D.I. 33 at 12-14, 17-20) But the Court has already determined this feature to be an abstract idea, and so this idea, no matter how beneficial when applied in a technical context, cannot provide an inventive concept.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BSG Tech,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518052\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/1281/#p1290\">\n    899 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1290 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ass'n for Molecular Pathology v.
