BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n    Adrian McGonigal is 40 years old and lives with his brother in Pea Ridge, Arkansas. He used to have a job working in the shipping department of Southwest Poultry, a food-service company located nearby, although he received no medical insurance through his employer. Like many Americans, he has several serious medical conditions. Beginning in 2014, McGonigal was able to receive medical care - including regular doctor visits and numerous prescription drugs - through the state's expanded Medicaid program. In mid-2018, however, McGonigal learned that he would be subject to new work requirements, which he would have to report online, as a condition of receiving health benefits. These were imposed by the Arkansas Works Amendments (AWA), approved by the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services in March 2018. Despite his lack of access to, and difficulty working with, computers, he was able to report his employment in June 2018, but he did not know he needed to continue to do so each month. As a result, when he went to pick up his prescriptions in October, the pharmacist told him that he was no longer covered, and his medicines would cost him $ 800. In the absence of Medicaid, he could not afford the cost of the prescriptions and so did not pick them up. His health conditions then flared up, causing him to miss several days of work, and Southwest Poultry fired him for his absences. He thus lost his Medicaid coverage and his job.\n   </opinion>\n   <opinion id=\"p-69\">\n    a.\n    <em>\n     Other Objectives\n    </em>\n   </opinion>\n   <opinion id=\"p-74\">\n    b.\n    <em>\n     Kentucky Remand\n    </em>\n   </opinion>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    * * *\n   </p>\n   <opinion type=\"majority\">\n    <p id=\"p-9\">\n     Anna Book is 38 years old and lives in Little Rock. She currently rents a room in an apartment but was homeless for most of the last eight years. In July 2018, she got a job as a dishwasher in a restaurant, for which she works about 24 hours each week. Before that, she was unemployed for two years. She nevertheless also had health care provided through Arkansas's Medicaid program, which a local pastor helped her sign up for in 2014. Book learned last August that, pursuant to AWA, she would have to report 80 hours each month of employment or other activities to keep that coverage. While she reported her compliance in August and September with the pastor's help - she does not have reliable internet access - Book has several health conditions and worries that she will not maintain sufficient hours at her job to keep her coverage.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-10\">\n     Russell Cook is 26 and also lives in Little Rock. He is currently homeless. While he has spent time working as a landscaper, he is not presently employed and has minimal job prospects. The state's Medicaid program has previously given him access to health care for various health conditions, including a torn Achilles tendon and serious dental problems. Cook, however, does not believe he will be able to comply with the new AWA work requirements, which began applying to him in January 2019. Lacking access to the internet or a phone, he also worries that he will be unable to report compliance with those requirements. He thus expects to lose his Medicaid coverage.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-11\">\n     These are three of the ten Arkansans who come to this Court seeking to undo the work requirements the state added in 2018 to its Medicaid program. They sued the Secretary of Health and Human Services in August 2018, arguing that the\n     federal government's approval of the state's new requirements violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Constitution.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-12\">\n     Plaintiffs' suit does not offer an issue of first impression. Indeed, this Court just last summer considered a challenge to the Secretary's approval of very similar changes to Kentucky's Medicaid program - including work or \"community engagement\" requirements - in\n     <em>\n      Stewart v. Azar\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525485\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/237/\">\n      313 F.Supp.3d 237\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (D.D.C. 2018) (\n     <em>\n      Stewart I\n     </em>\n     ). There, it vacated the agency's decision because it had not adequately considered whether the program \"would in fact help the state furnish medical assistance to its citizens, a central objective of Medicaid.\"\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525485\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/237/\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525485\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/237/\">\n      at 243\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . Plaintiffs point to the identical deficiency in the record in this case. Despite the protestations in its (and intervenor Arkansas's) briefing, HHS conceded at oral argument that the administrative decision in this case shares the same problem as the one in\n     <em>\n      Stewart I\n     </em>\n     .\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Oral Argument Transcript at 6-7. The Court's job is thus easy in one respect: the Secretary's approval cannot stand.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-13\">\n     Yet a separate question remains: what is the proper remedy? In\n     <em>\n      Stewart I\n     </em>\n     , the Court vacated the approval and remanded to the Secretary. Here, however, the Government argues that vacatur is improper both because, unlike Kentucky, AWA is already active and halting it would be quite disruptive, and because any error is easily fixed, just as it has been for Kentucky. The challengers disagree, positing that the deficiency in the approval is substantial and that any resulting disruption is outweighed by the ongoing harms suffered by the more than 16,000 Arkansans who have lost their Medicaid coverage. Given the seriousness of the deficiencies - which, as this Court explains in a separate Opinion issued today, the remand in Kentucky did\n     <em>\n      not\n     </em>\n     cure - and the absence of lasting harms to the Government relative to the significant ones suffered by Arkansans like Plaintiffs, the Court will vacate the Secretary's approval and remand for further proceedings.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-14\">\n     <strong>\n      I.

The Commonwealth of Kentucky proposed a demonstration project - called Kentucky HEALTH - with similar community-engagement requirements and cutbacks to retroactive coverage. (It also contained other elements not relevant here.) Kentucky, unlike Arkansas, did estimate the coverage effects of its project, explaining that thousands of persons would lose their Medicaid benefits over the course of the project; indeed, their estimate corresponded to about 95,000 persons losing Medicaid for one full year. As it did in Arkansas, the Secretary approved that project on the ground that it was likely to \"improv[e] health outcomes\" and \"increas[e] individual engagement in health care decisions.\"\n     <em>\n      Stewart I\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525485\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/237/\">\n      313 F.Supp.3d at 258\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (quoting AR 7).\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-34\">\n     Before the project took effect, several Medicaid recipients challenged the Secretary's approval in this Court. They argued, among other things, that the agency had failed to adequately explain why Kentucky HEALTH promoted the objectives of Medicaid and that approval of the project exceeded HHS's statutory authority. The Court concluded that the plaintiffs were right in one central and dispositive respect: \"[T]he Secretary never adequately considered whether Kentucky HEALTH would in fact help the state furnish medical assistance to its citizens, a central objective\n     of Medicaid.\"\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525485\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/237/\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525485\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/237/\">\n      at 243\n     </extracted-citation>\n     .

On review, the Court easily concludes that at least one Plaintiff has established all three elements. Consider, for example, Adrian McGonigal, whom we encountered in this Opinion's opening paragraph. He attests that he has lost his Medicaid coverage as a result of the community-engagement requirement and has thus been unable to pay for certain medical bills and prescription drugs.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     ECF No. 27-3 (McGonigal Declaration). Or look to Russell Cook, also mentioned in the introduction, who avers that he will be unable to meet the community-engagement requirement once it applies to him and thus believes that loss of his health-care coverage is imminent.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     ECF No. 27-7 (Cook Declaration). From these declarations and others submitted with Plaintiffs' Motion, there is little doubt that at least one Plaintiff has suffered an injury (or will suffer an injury in the future) - the loss of Medicaid coverage - that is attributable to the Secretary's approval of AWA, and that a favorable decision from the Court would redress it.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      NB\n      <em>\n       ex rel.\n      </em>\n      Peacock v.

Merits\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-48\">\n     With that threshold issue easily dispatched, the Court turns to the merits. Plaintiffs' central position is identical to that of the challengers in\n     <em>\n      Stewart I\n     </em>\n     : the Arkansas Works Amendments \"fundamentally alter the design and purpose of Medicaid.\" ECF No. 27 (MSJ) at 13. They thus assail the Secretary's approval of the Amendments on similar fronts. First, with regard to the project as a whole, Plaintiffs assert that HHS did not sufficiently consider whether it would promote the objectives of Medicaid, including how it would affect the provision of medical assistance to the needy. Second, they maintain that the Secretary lacked statutory authority to approve numerous aspects of AWA. Finally, Plaintiffs posit that a letter CMS issued in January 2018 violates the APA because it did not go through notice and comment.

Indeed, he neither offered his own estimates of coverage loss nor grappled with comments in the administrative record projecting that the Amendments would lead a substantial number of Arkansas residents to be disenrolled from Medicaid.

That is, in reviewing his interpretation, the Court must first ask whether \"Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,\" and, if not, whether \"the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\"\n     <em>\n      Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v.

According such deference is not of much practical significance here, however, because the Secretary agrees with the Court's understanding of a \"core objective\" of the Medicaid Act.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     ECF No. 52 (HHS Reply) at 5.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-54\">\n     In\n     <em>\n      Stewart I\n     </em>\n     , the Court explained that \"one of Medicaid's central objectives\" is to \"furnish medical assistance\" to persons who cannot afford it.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525485\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/237/\">\n      313 F.Supp.3d at 243, 261, 266, 273\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . That conclusion followed ineluctably from \u00a7 1396-1 of the Act, which provides that Congress appropriated Medicaid funds \"[f]or the purpose of enabling each State, as far as practicable under the conditions in such State, to furnish (1) medical assistance ...

Under these circumstances, the agency must grapple with the risk of coverage loss.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Nat'l Lifeline Assoc. v.

If so, it might elucidate whether it expects the loss to be minor or substantial, and how that weighs against the advancement of other Medicaid objectives. Nothing close to this appears in the Secretary's approval letter. That does not mean that the Government must \"recit[e] and refut[e] every objection submitted in opposition to the proposed demonstration.\" HHS MSJ at 22. It just means that, at a minimum, the agency cannot \"entirely fail[ ] to consider an important aspect of the problem,\" repeatedly raised in the comment period.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      State Farm\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n      463 U.S. at 43\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n      103 S.Ct. 2856\n     </extracted-citation>\n     .\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-63\">\n     Arkansas maintains that the Secretary did not need to consider any reduction in coverage because it - unlike Kentucky - did not predict that the project would even cause coverage loss.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Ark. MSJ at 24. But the state's failure in that respect does not alter HHS's inquiry. Under the Medicaid Act, the Secretary may approve only those demonstration projects that are \"likely to assist in promoting the objectives of [Medicaid],\" and the parties agree that the provision of health coverage is a \"central\" objective of the Act.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201315\">\n      42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1315\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (a) ; HHS MSJ at 12-13; Ark.

Whether a state gives the Secretary excellent data or no data at all about coverage, his duty remains the same: to determine whether the proposed project will promote the objectives of the Act, including whether it advances or hinders the provision of health coverage to the needy. If it were otherwise, HHS could approve a project that would decimate Medicaid coverage without so much as addressing the issue where the state did not submit its own estimate of coverage loss. Even putting to one side the agency's affirmative obligation to address coverage loss, however, the Secretary unquestionably has a duty to consider that issue where multiple commenters provide credible forecasts that it will occur.\n     <em>\n      See, e.g.\n     </em>\n     , AR 1269, 1277, 1285, 1294-95. Here, as has been said, the agency had and neglected that duty.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-64\">\n     In a last attempt to resist this conclusion, the Secretary says that he did not need to consider coverage because he had no obligation to offer\n     <em>\n      any\n     </em>\n     explanation of his decision to approve a demonstration project.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     HHS MSJ at 22-23;\n     <em>\n      see also\n     </em>\n     Tr. at 9.

HHS's regulations - which require CMS to maintain and publish an administrative record of public comments, any CMS responses, and a written approval or disapproval letter - are fully consonant with this axiomatic administrative-law requirement.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20431.416\">\n      42 C.F.R. \u00a7 431.416\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (f).

In a single sentence, he noted that \"a more limited period of retroactive eligibility will encourage beneficiaries to obtain and maintain health coverage, even when they are healthy.\" AR 8. Little needs to be said on this score. It is well established that \"conclusory or unsupported suppositions\" do not satisfy the agency's obligation to engage in reasoned decisionmaking.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.

Cir. 2004). That is particularly so in the face of numerous comments taking the opposite position. As the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, among others, explained, limiting retroactive coverage may lead \"Medicaid-eligible persons [to] wait even longer to have their conditions treated to avoid incurring medical bills they cannot pay.\" AR 1279. And when they do eventually arrive for treatment, they will be covered for less time than they would have been before AWA took effect, by definition reducing their Medicaid coverage.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     AR 1338 (National Health Law Program describing this risk). HHS's brief reference to the potential coverage-promoting effects of the changes to retroactive eligibility thus does not get it across the line.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-67\">\n     2.\n     <em>\n      Counterarguments\n     </em>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-68\">\n     Defendants offer two separate reasons for the Court to overlook the Secretary's failure to consider coverage, neither of which is persuasive. They say first that the Arkansas Works Amendments promote several other important objectives of Medicaid, including the health of Medicaid-eligible persons. Second, Defendants maintain that any deficiency in the administrative record in this case is cured by the agency's subsequent approval of Kentucky's similar project on remand from the Court's decision in\n     <em>\n      Stewart I\n     </em>\n     .\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-70\">\n     Defendants justify the proposed demonstration project on the ground that, regardless of its effect on Medicaid coverage, it advances other objectives of the Act. HHS specifically insists, as it did in\n     <em>\n      Stewart I\n     </em>\n     , that the Secretary was on solid ground in finding that the project would improve health outcomes, thereby advancing the goals of Medicaid.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     HHS MSJ at 17-18. Faced with this argument previously, this Court expressed skepticism that health, generally construed, was properly considered an objective of the Act.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Stewart I\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525485\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/237/\">\n      313 F.Supp.3d at 266\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . It ultimately held that the agency's \"focus on health is no substitute for considering Medicaid's central concern: covering health\n     <em>\n      costs\n     </em>\n     \" through the provision of free or low-cost health coverage.\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525485\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/237/\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     The Court reached the same conclusion in response to assertions that Kentucky HEALTH promoted independence and self-sufficiency.\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525485\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/237/\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525485\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/237/\">\n      at 271-72\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . HHS has offered no argument here that calls those conclusions into question.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-71\">\n     Arkansas presses the point in a somewhat different way, asserting that the provision of Medicaid coverage is (1) the purpose only of Medicaid\n     <em>\n      appropriations\n     </em>\n     , not Medicaid, (2) in \"irreconcilable tension\" with other purposes of the Act, and (3) not applicable to the Medicaid expansion population.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Ark. MSJ at 10-22. At the same time, it concedes, seemingly in conflict with its other contentions, that it is \"readily apparent\" that providing \"Medicaid coverage for Medicaid-eligible people\" is \"\n     <em>\n      an\n     </em>\n     objective of Medicaid.\"\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 13. The Court has said this before and will say it again: if, as Arkansas and HHS admit (and\n     this Court has found), ensuring Medicaid coverage for the needy is a key objective of the Act, the Secretary's failure to consider the effects of the project on coverage alone renders his decision arbitrary and capricious; it does not matter that HHS deemed the project to advance other objectives of the Act.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-72\">\n     While the Court might stop there, a brief foray into Arkansas's arguments is nevertheless worthwhile. As to the first, Medicaid is an appropriations statute enacted pursuant to \" Congress's power under the Spending Clause.\"\n     <em>\n      NFIB\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/#p538\">\n      567 U.S. at 542\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/#p538\">\n      132 S.Ct. 2566\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . What better place could the purpose of a spending program be found than in the provision that sets up the \"\n     <em>\n      purpose\n     </em>\n     \" of its appropriations? Arkansas's second objection is even more puzzling. The Court does not understand how the objectives of a statute all agree was designed to provide free or low-cost medical care to the needy could nevertheless stand in \"irreconcilable tension\" with the goal of providing free or low-cost medical care to that population. The third sits on more comprehensible ground, though it yields Arkansas no more success. Addressing the purpose of the Medicaid expansion in\n     <em>\n      Stewart I\n     </em>\n     , the Court explained that \"the Medicaid statute - taken as a whole - confirms that Congress intended to provide medical assistance to the expansion population.\"\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525485\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/237/\">\n      313 F.Supp.3d at 269\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . HHS conceded as much in that case.\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525485\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/237/\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     Neither party has offered any reason to retreat from that determination.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-73\">\n     Defendants' attempts to find refuge in other purposes of the Act and the propriety of\n     <em>\n      Chevron\n     </em>\n     deference as to those purposes are thus all hat, no cattle. Because they agree that the provision of low-cost medical care to Medicaid-eligible persons is a \"core\" purpose of the Act,\n     <em>\n      see\n     </em>\n     HHS Reply at 5, there is no legally significant dispute over the meaning of the Medicaid Act. What matters, instead, is the question addressed above: whether the Secretary adequately considered this issue. As has been made abundantly clear, he did not. Perhaps understanding as much, HHS largely attempts to justify its approval of the project in this case not on the Arkansas record but on another record entirely.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-75\">\n     This brings the Court to the argument that leads off the Secretary's Reply Brief: that his approval of AWA \"is amply justified by the reasoning in his November 20, 2018, approval of Kentucky's materially similar project.\" HHS Reply at 1. In particular, HHS argues that the project on review here will, like the one approved on remand in Kentucky, help adults \"transition from Medicaid to financial independence,\" thereby enhancing \"the fiscal sustainability of Arkansas's Medicaid program\" - an objective of the Act.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 6. The Government clarified at oral argument that this is not merely a contention against vacatur - although it was principally offered as such - but also an argument in favor of sustaining the Secretary's approval entirely.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Tr. at 8-10. The Court addresses the latter position here, leaving the remedy question for the end. In short, three weighty and independent rationales require rejecting HHS's assertion that the Amendments should be approved based on the record in the Kentucky remand proceeding.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-76\">\n     First, it runs headlong into the \"fundamental rule of administrative law\" that a reviewing court \"must judge the propriety of such action solely by the grounds invoked by the agency.\"\n     <em>\n      SEC v. Chenery Corp.\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"365064\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/332/194/#p196\">\n      332 U.S. 194\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 196,\n     <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=67%20S.%20Ct.%201760\">\n      67 S.Ct. 1760\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"365064\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/332/194/#p196\">\n      91 L.Ed. 1995\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (1947). Nowhere in the Secretary's approval letter does he justify his decision based on concerns about the sustainability of Arkansas's Medicaid program, or on a belief that the project will help Medicaid-eligible persons to gain sufficient\n     financial resources to be able to purchase private insurance. And the Court \"may not accept [ ] counsel's\n     <em>\n      post hoc\n     </em>\n     rationalizations for agency action.\"\n     <em>\n      State Farm\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n      463 U.S. at 50\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n      103 S.Ct. 2856\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ;\n     <em>\n      see also\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Burlington Truck Lines\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"451399\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/371/156/#p168\">\n      371 U.S. at 168-69\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"451399\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/371/156/#p168\">\n      83 S.Ct. 239\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (\"\n     <em>\n      Chenery\n     </em>\n     requires that an agency's discretionary order be upheld, if at all, on the same basis articulated in the order by the agency itself.\"). The Government responded at oral argument that the Secretary did not need to provide any basis for his decision approving Arkansas's proposed project, so it does not matter on what justification his decision is judicially upheld.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Tr. at 9-10. The Court has already explained why that assertion is inconsistent with the APA,\n     <em>\n      see\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      supra\n     </em>\n     at 20-21, and it will not spill more ink on the matter here.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-77\">\n     HHS's argument suffers from a second and equally significant flaw. The demonstration project under consideration in Kentucky involves different considerations from the Arkansas project, and the rationales in favor of approving one may well not apply to approving the other. The Secretary said as much in opposing this case's designation as related to the Kentucky one.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     ECF No. 17 (\"The two cases involve two separate approvals of two distinct projects in two different States.\"). Consider the principal arguments the Secretary relies upon on remand in Kentucky. First, he says that the project promotes coverage because in its absence, the expansion population would have no Medicaid coverage.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Stewart v. Azar\n     </em>\n     , No. 18-152, 308 F.Supp.3d at ----, ECF No. 108 (HHS MSJ) at 18-20. A necessary ingredient of this argument appears to be that the Kentucky Governor has conditioned the Commonwealth's continued expansion of Medicaid on the Secretary's approval of the proposed project.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 19. There is no suggestion that Arkansas's Governor has made any similar kind of threat with regard to the Arkansas Works Amendments. Second, the Secretary justifies the Kentucky program on the ground that it advances the fiscal sustainability of the state's Medicaid program, which is at risk due to Kentucky's dire budgetary situation.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 15-18. Yet there is no assertion that Arkansas is suffering from similar fiscal problems. The Government's argument that the Kentucky approval justifies the decision on review in this case is particularly unpersuasive considering these significant differences.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-78\">\n     The final reason to reject this argument is the simplest: the justification the Secretary has given for sustaining Kentucky's program on remand is insufficient and the Court today rejects it in its latest Opinion in\n     <em>\n      Stewart\n     </em>\n     .\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Stewart v. Azar\n     </em>\n     , No. 18-152,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525001\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/308/239/#p244\">\n      308 F.Supp.3d 239\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 244-45, Slip Opinion at 3,\n     <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201375496\">\n      2019 WL 1375496\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (Mar. 27, 2019) (\n     <em>\n      Stewart II\n     </em>\n     ). If the explanation does not even justify affirmance of Kentucky's project, it cannot support upholding a different administrative decision approving a different state's project.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-80\">\n     In sum, the Secretary's approval of the Arkansas Works Amendments is arbitrary and capricious because it did not address - despite receiving substantial comments on the matter - whether and how the project would implicate the \"core\" objective of Medicaid: the provision of medical coverage to the needy. Neither his consideration of other Medicaid Act objectives nor his subsequent approval of Kentucky's separate demonstration project cure that deficiency. This failure infected the Secretary's approval of AWA as a whole, such that those Amendments are invalid.

For starters, in\n     <em>\n      Stewart I\n     </em>\n     , the Court concluded that the same legal error was a \"major shortcoming\" going \"to the heart of the Secretary's decision.\"\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525485\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/237/\">\n      313 F.Supp.3d at 273\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . It explained that the D.C.

MSJ at 37-38. Not so. As explained at length in\n     <em>\n      Stewart II\n     </em>\n     , the Court finds that the remand has not cured this \"major shortcoming.\"\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Op. at 182. Because the agency failed to provide a legally sufficient rationale upon remand from\n     <em>\n      Stewart I\n     </em>\n     , the Court is even less sanguine that it will be able to do so in this case than when it vacated the Secretary's Kentucky approval the first time.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-86\">\n     This does not mean it will be impossible for the agency to justify its approval of a demonstration project like this one. The Court's decision does not go that far. But after at least two attempts for Kentucky, it has yet to do that analysis. Indeed, HHS may find it\n     <em>\n      more\n     </em>\n     difficult to offer a sufficient rationale in its second attempt in this case than in Kentucky. Arkansas does not appear to face the kind of fiscal issues asserted in Kentucky; instead, the state's data suggest that the Medicaid expansion has\n     <em>\n      reduced\n     </em>\n     the amount Arkansas will spend on health care for this population between 2017 and 2021.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     ECF No. 53-6, Exh. 55 (Final Report of Arkansas Health Reform Legislative Task Force) (explaining that if Arkansas rejects Medicaid expansion,\n     \"the negative impact to the state budget is approximately $ 438 [million]\" during this time frame). It stands to reason that the state will have an uphill climb making the case that the expansion has pressed its annual budget, such that eligible persons should be pushed off the rolls. Such fiscal considerations would, in any event, need to be balanced against the more than 16,000 persons who have already lost their coverage because of the new requirements.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Arkansas Works Reports at 18, 27, 36, 45. The upshot is that the road to cure the deficiency in this case is, at best, a rocky one, strongly weighing in favor of vacatur.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-87\">\n     2.\n     <em>\n      Seriousness of Disruption\n     </em>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-88\">\n     The second factor is a closer call. Arkansas began implementing its demonstration project in June 2018, imposing work requirements on adults ages 30-49 and implementing the changes to retroactive coverage; it began enforcing work requirements as to adults ages 19-29 in January 2019. HHS and Arkansas assert that any interruption in the project would be enormously disruptive because it would interfere with the \"State's data collection efforts,\" HHS Reply at 22, and \"undermine\" its \"extensive efforts to educate Arkansas Works beneficiaries\" on the work requirements.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Ark. MSJ at 38-39. They emphasize that, because the Kentucky program had not yet taken effect at the time of its vacatur, these concerns were not present in\n     <em>\n      Stewart I\n     </em>\n     .\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525485\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/237/\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     The Court is not insensitive to the practical concerns Defendants raise about pausing enforcement of the Amendments, nor does it take lightly the effect of its ruling upon the state today. For the reasons that follow, however, it finds that the probable disruptions are not so significant as to require deviation from the ordinary rule of vacatur.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-89\">\n     Consider first the nature and extent of the disruptions. If the Court vacates the Secretary's approval of AWA, the state would no longer condition certain Medicaid recipients' coverage on reporting 80 hours of qualifying activities each month and would restore the number of months of retroactive coverage to three. In other words, vacatur would return matters to the way they were before the project was approved. Both changes, HHS asserts, will disrupt the state's data-collection efforts.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     HHS MSJ at 29. If Arkansas - as the party responsible for collecting and analyzing data from the project - has concerns about data collection in the event of vacatur, it does not say as much.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Ark. MSJ at 38-40 (mentioning only disruptive effects on education and outreach); ECF No. 45 (Ark. Reply) (same). Indeed, one amicus points out that the Secretary approved this project without \"a proposed evaluation design.\"\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Amicus Brief of Deans, Chairs, and Scholars at 19-20.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-90\">\n     The Court assumes, however, that vacatur would interrupt the state's efforts to collect data on the effects of the work requirements and changes to retroactive coverage. While such concerns are not insignificant, they are tempered in the context of this case. Experimental projects are intended to help states like Arkansas \"test out new ideas\" for providing medical coverage to the needy, thereby influencing the trajectory of the federal-state Medicaid partnership down the line.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      supra\n     </em>\n     S. Rep. No. 1589 at 1961. If, after further consideration or after prevailing on appeal, the Secretary and Arkansas wish to move ahead with work requirements, they will remain able to do so in the future. And if they are dissatisfied with the data gathered from the initial months of the project because of the interruption caused by vacatur, Defendants could extend the project for an additional period of time to collect more information. This is not to minimize the importance of data collection in the context of an experimental project; it is just to say that vacatur will have little\n     lasting impact on HHS's or Arkansas's interests. That distinguishes this case from others in which the D.C. Circuit has declined to vacate on account of irreversible harms that such a remedy would inflict on the status quo.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Allied-Signal\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3813033,10510774\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/988/146/\">\n      988 F.2d at 151\n     </extracted-citation>\n     .\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-91\">\n     Defendants also maintain that vacatur will harm \"Arkansas's education and outreach efforts.\" Ark. MSJ at 39. In that regard, they explain that a decision invalidating the work requirements will be confusing to Medicaid recipients who have just recently been informed that they have to meet those requirements.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 38-39. The Court grants that vacatur of work requirements that have already been implemented may send mixed messages. But any disruption in this respect is not sufficiently significant to avoid vacatur. For one thing, Defendants have expressed confidence throughout this case that they can communicate with Medicaid recipients regarding the terms of the work requirements.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     HHS MSJ at 8; Ark MSJ at 27, 34-35. If that is so, they should be able to inform them that the requirements are paused for now and, if later reapproved, that they are put back into effect. It bears mentioning here, however, that the State's outreach efforts may well be falling severely short. Notably, only 12.3% of persons not exempt from the requirements reported\n     <em>\n      any\n     </em>\n     kind of qualifying activity.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Arkansas Works Reports June-November 2018 at 47, 52. The numbers are even lower for several other months.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     Arkansas might use the time while the program is paused to consider whether and how to better educate persons about the requirements and how to satisfy them. Admittedly, vacatur could make such outreach complicated. Ultimately, however, the Court finds that the harms to prior and ongoing education do not tip the scales against vacatur.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-92\">\n     In fact, the structure of the Amendments, considered with the timing of this Opinion, renders vacatur less disruptive that might be expected. As mentioned before, Arkansas Works recipients only lose coverage after three months of non-compliance with the work requirements.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     AR 31. And the three-month clock starts over at the beginning of the calendar year.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     Because fewer than three months have elapsed in 2019, the work requirements have not yet resulted in anyone's being disenrolled, as such actions cannot take place until April 1. As a consequence, vacatur of the Amendments will not require Arkansas to re-enroll persons who have lost their coverage, with the administrative and communication-related headaches that might entail. Instead, it just requires them to communicate to providers that they should\n     <em>\n      not\n     </em>\n     disenroll persons moving forward on account of the requirements. The bottom line: \"This is not a case in which the 'egg has been scrambled,' and it is too late to reverse course.\"\n     <em>\n      Allina Health\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4240928,5900386\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/746/1102/\">\n      746 F.3d at 1110-11\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (quoting\n     <em>\n      Sugar Cane Growers Co-op of Fla. v.
