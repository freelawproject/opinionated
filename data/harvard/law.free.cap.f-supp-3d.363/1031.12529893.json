Doc. 42. Plaintiffs have filed a partial motion for summary judgment (Doc. 96) and Defendant has filed a motion for summary judgment (Doc. 94). The motions are fully briefed (Docs. 100, 102, 108, 109), and although Defendant requests oral argument, the Court concludes that such argument will not aid its decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 78(b) ; LRCiv 7.2(f). For reasons stated below, the Court will deny Plaintiffs' motion and grant Defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are undisputed unless otherwise noted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs Marcus Labertew and John McDermott were former employees and officers of BioNovix, Inc., a business engaged in the distribution and sale of health products. Doc. 95-3 at 3 \u00b6\u00b6 2, 6. Loral Langemeier was a BioNovix investor and director.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. Ms. Langemeier held a homeowner's insurance policy and an excess insurance policy issued by Defendant for the period from June 26, 2009 to June 26, 2010, both of which included personal liability coverage. Doc. 95 \u00b6 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs sued Ms. Langemeier and Fred Auzenne in state court, asserting breach of contract, defamation, fraud, and other claims arising out of their employment\n   with BioNovix. Doc. 95-3;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Labertew v. Auzenne\n   </em>\n   , No. CV2010-051209 (Ariz. Super. Ct. Mar. 11, 2010). This lawsuit will be referred to in this order as the \"underlying lawsuit.\" Plaintiffs alleged that Ms. Langemeier and Mr. Auzenne committed the wrongful acts in their personal capacity and not on behalf of BioNovix.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 \u00b6 3. After more than two years of litigation, Ms. Langemeier tendered the defense of the underlying lawsuit to Defendant. Her tender letter cited Arizona case law and included a copy of Plaintiffs' first amended complaint, eight pages of deposition from Mr. McDermott, and seven pages of an oral argument transcript. Doc. 95 \u00b6 6. In a letter dated February 4, 2013, Defendant informed Ms. Langemeier that the claims in the underlying lawsuit were excluded by the director's errors or omission exclusion and the business pursuits exclusion of her insurance policies. Doc. 48 at 11-15. The letter stated that if Ms. Langemeier disagreed, she should provide additional materials including transcripts of all depositions, pleadings, summary judgment motions, pleadings for other related cases, and any other documents that may be helpful.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The underlying lawsuit went to trial in state court, and, on the third day of trial, Plaintiffs and Ms. Langemeier entered into a stipulated judgment against Ms. Langemeier for $ 1.5 million. Doc. 1-16 at 27-28. The judgment was part of what is commonly called a \"\n   <em>\n    Damron\n   </em>\n   agreement\" under Arizona law. It included a covenant not to execute on the judgment against Ms. Langemeier and an assignment to Plaintiffs of Ms. Langemeier's insurance coverage and bad faith claims against Defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 103-1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Damron v.

Doc. 1-16 at 41-45. Plaintiffs initiated the garnishment action in state court, and Defendant removed it to this Court and answered the writs of garnishment, denying that it owed any funds to Plaintiffs. Docs. 6, 7. Plaintiffs did not file timely objections to the answers, and Defendant requested that the Court enter judgment in its favor. Doc. 9. The Court did so, finding that under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 69(a), Arizona procedures governed the removed garnishment proceeding and Plaintiffs had failed to comply with Arizona's ten-day objection requirement. Docs. 26; 27. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that Rule 69 did not apply to this case because there was no federal judgment. Doc. 38. The court of appeals remanded the case with instructions to allow re-pleading. Doc. 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After remand, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint asserting the insurance coverage and bad faith claims assigned to them by Ms. Langemeier and seeking to recover the $ 1.5 million stipulated judgment, as well as damages for insurance bad faith. Doc. 42 at 3-4. Plaintiffs now move for summary judgment on the choice of law in this case, arguing that California law should apply. Doc. 96. Defendant moves for summary judgment on Plaintiffs' claims. Doc. 94.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7\u00a7 6, 188, 193.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Section 193 provides that the rights created by a contract of fire, surety, or casualty insurance \"are determined by the local law of the state which the parties understood was to be the principal location of the insured risk during the term of the policy.\" That is \"unless with respect to the particular issue, some other state has a more significant relationship under the principles stated in \u00a7 6 to the transaction and the parties, in which event the local law of the other state will be applied.\" Restatement (Second) of Conflicts \u00a7 193 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beckler v.

But the liability insurance would not exist without her homes, and, under\n   <em>\n    Beckler\n   </em>\n   , the homes therefore are the \"insured risks\" for purposes of construing her insurance contracts. Ms. Langemeier's homeowners' insurance policy covers three homes in Nevada. See Doc. 103-3 at 3-40. And her excess liability policy covers three homes in Nevada and one in California. Doc. 103-3 at 80.

Defendant also argues that the place of insured risk is less important because this is a multiple risk policy, considered under comment f to \u00a7 193. Doc. 100 at 7-8. A multiple risk insurance policy is one in which a single policy insures risks in several states. Restatement (Second) of Conflicts \u00a7 193 cmt. f. A multiple risk policy usually incorporates any special local laws of the location of the insured risk.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   While Ms. Langemeier's excess liability policy does appear to be a multiple risk policy, Defendant does not explain why that fact would affect the Court's analysis because none of the insured risks were located in Arizona.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

The Court cannot conclude that California has a significant interest in determining whether the Arizona-based Plaintiffs, acting on claims assigned by an Arizona-based insured, are entitled to coverage and bad faith damages against a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in New York. Arizona, on the other hand, has an interest in whether its citizens are entitled to such coverage and damages.

The Undisputed Complaint Facts.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   All of Ms. Langemeier's actions at issue in the underlying lawsuit were related to the BioNovix business. Plaintiffs do not contend that Ms. Langemeier and Plaintiffs had any relationship whatsoever outside of the business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Plaintiffs concede that Ms. Langemeier made the allegedly defamatory statements at issue in the underlying lawsuit during conference calls with BioNovix customers, distributors, shareholders, and vendors,\n   and that the statements accused Plaintiffs of converting BioNovix assets, taking BioNovix distributors' property, and acting in a disloyal and unprofessional manner towards BioNovix. For example, during an April 2, 2009 conference call with distributors and investors, Ms. Langemeier accused Plaintiffs of stealing company property, running the company into the ground, taking company files, taking the company server, and selling the distributor list to other companies. Doc. 95-3 \u00b6 13. According to the complaint in the underlying lawsuit, Ms. Langemeier \"controlled the [April 2] call.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10526121\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/861/224/#p226\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   During a June 2009 investor call, Ms. Langemeier again stated that Plaintiffs stole and sold distributor lists.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. Plaintiffs' complaint alleged that BioNovix itself made press releases defaming them, and, because Ms. Langemeier was the only board member of BioNovix at the time, she likely issued the press releases.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. In another example from early 2009, the complaint alleges that a former BioNovix CFO entered the company office and told Plaintiffs they had been fired and were going to jail for embezzlement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. When Plaintiffs resisted, the former CFO called Ms. Langemeier, who said that Plaintiffs were terminated, she was the chairman of the board, and the other employees must turn the keys and operations over to the former CFO or they would be terminated as well.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nor do Plaintiffs dispute that their false arrest claim arose from a BioNovix business trip to South Korea. According to the complaint, Ms. Langemeier told BioNovix's Korean distributor that Mr. McDermott was withholding funds. Docs. 95 \u00b6\u00b6 19, 40-42; XX \u00b6 19. In short, all of the allegedly wrongful actions asserted in the underlying lawsuit directly related to the operations of BioNovix and Ms. Langemeier's involvement in those operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   And Plaintiffs do not dispute that Ms. Langemeier had a substantial ownership interest in BioNovix. That ownership interest clearly would bring BioNovix and her actions related to the company within the \"investment activity or any activity intended to realize a profit\" language of the insurance policies' exclusion. Doc. 103-3 at 53, 93.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Plaintiffs' Arguments.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the business pursuits exclusion does not apply because Ms. Langemeier was a passive investor and was not conducting \"regular\" business or serving in an operations role. Docs. 102 at 12. According to Plaintiffs, the plain language of Ms. Langemeier's insurance policies limits the business pursuits exclusion to an insured's \"trade, occupation, or profession.\" Doc. 102 at 9;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Teufel v.

According to Plaintiffs, the business pursuits exclusion does not apply because Ms. Langemeier was never employed by BioNovix, spent 99.9% of her time working as a promotional speaker, and only passively invested in BioNovix. Doc.102 at 12. The Court disagrees for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   First, this argument does not address the \"investment activity or any activity intended to realize a profit\" language of the insurance policies' exclusion. Doc. 103-3 at 53, 93. This language, which Plaintiffs do not contend is ambiguous, clearly covers more than regular business activities at a trade, occupation, or profession. And it clearly covers Ms. Langemeier's substantial investment in BioNovix, regardless of whether she was ever employed by the company or authorized to act on its behalf.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Second, the undisputed facts simply do not support Plaintiffs' assertion that Ms. Langemeier was nothing more than a passive investor in BioNovix. As noted above, the underlying lawsuit arose out of her\n   <em>\n    actions\n   </em>\n   with respect to the company - making defamatory statements during conference calls with BioNovix customers, distributors, shareholders, and vendors regarding Plaintiffs' disloyalty, dishonesty, and lack of professionalism with respect to BioNovix; causing BioNovix to issue press releases with similar statements; terminating Plaintiffs' employment with the company and threatening other company employees if they did not comply with her demands; and making statements to a BioNovix Korean distributor that resulted in Plaintiff McDermott's arrest while on a business trip for BioNovix. These undisputed actions are not the stuff of passive investors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   True, Arizona cases have stated that a business pursuit is a \"continued or regular activity for the purpose of earning a livelihood such as a trade, profession, or occupation, or a commercial activity.\"\n   <em>\n    Industrial Indem.

The policies thereby make clear that the exclusion is not limited to the insured's primary, full-time job.

Under Arizona law, a claim \"arises from business pursuits\" if it originates from or shares a causal connection with the insured's business activities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fimbres v.

Here, the statements that formed the basis of Plaintiffs' defamation and false imprisonment claims were made while Ms. Langemeier was communicating with BioNovix investors, customers, and business affiliates. And her termination of Plaintiffs' employment at BioNovix was directly connected to the business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that an issue of fact exists as to whether Ms. Langemeier's actions were properly taken on behalf of BioNovix because at the time there was no legally constituted board. Doc. 102 at 3. But whether Ms. Langemeier was acting lawfully on behalf of BioNovix and therefore was entitled to personal immunity from liability - the issue on which the superior court found a question of fact in the underlying lawsuit - is a different question from whether her actions originated in or shared a causal connection with her BioNovix-related business activities - the issue in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fimbres\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1470062\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/147/75/\">\n    708 P.2d at 757-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The business pursuits exclusion encompasses more than actions made with legal authorization of the business and therefore entitled to personal immunity. Indeed, if it was limited to the latter, there would be no need for the exclusion because the insured would not be liable. As discussed above, actions sufficient to fall within the business pursuits exclusion need only be connected to or flow from the business activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that the exclusion violates the insured's reasonable expectation of coverage. Doc. 102 at 9. The test for reasonable expectation \"focuses on whether the insurance carrier has reason to believe that the insured would not have assented to the terms of the policy as a whole if the insured had known that it contained the clause being contested.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <em>\n    Do by Minker v.

The Ninth Circuit explained that \"[a]lthough there was\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   evidence that either Lozier or McDonald (or both) had acted intentionally [triggering the policy's intentional act exclusion], Auto Owners never confirmed this.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520942\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/951/251/#p255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Ninth Circuit also found that the coverage question in\n   <em>\n    Lozier\n   </em>\n   involved difficult issues of whether the actions of an intoxicated individual can trigger the intentional acts exclusion - issues the insurer did not investigate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   This case is different. In tendering her defense, Ms. Langemeier provided Defendant with a copy of Plaintiffs' complaint in the underlying case, eight pages of deposition from Mr. McDermott, and seven pages of an oral argument transcript where Plaintiffs argued that Ms. Langemeier did not act on behalf of BioNovix. Doc. 95 \u00b6 6. The complaint did not plead a covered claim. It was replete with allegations that the wrongful acts of Ms. Langemeier and others occurred as part of the BioNovix business.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 95-3. Although Plaintiff also included a transcript of an oral argument in the underlying lawsuit, the transcript suggests only that Ms. Langemeier's actions were not authorized by the BioNovix board of directors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 103-1 at 81. It did not suggest that her actions were unrelated to BioNovix. Rather, as the complaint alleged, she was hip-deep in the company's operations, making defamatory statements during conference calls with customers, distributors, shareholders, and vendors; causing BioNovix to issue press releases with similar statements; terminating Plaintiffs' employment with BioNovix and threatening other company employees if they did not comply with her demands; and making statements to a BioNovix Korean distributor that resulted in Plaintiff McDermott's arrest. Doc. 95-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Given the documents included in the tender of defense, particularly the complaint in the underlying action, application of the business pursuits exclusion was clear.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court cannot conclude that Defendant had an obligation to conduct an investigation when the complaint clearly indicated that Defendant's insured committed the allegedly wrongful acts as part of the BioNovix business in which she was a major investor, and other documents in the tender package did not contradict this assertion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Defendant responded with a letter, based on the complaint, stating that all of the claims in the complaint appeared to arise from Ms. Langemeier's business pursuits or her actions as a director. Doc. 103-3 at 4-5.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520942\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/951/251/#p255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The letter requested for more information if Ms. Langemeier disagreed with the coverage position.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. She never responded. Instead, she assigned her claims against Defendant to Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs accepted that assignment in satisfaction of their claims against Ms. Langemeier, taking the assignment subject to\n   whatever infirmities the assigned claims possessed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The Court concludes that Defendant properly considered the facts alleged in the complaint and determined there was no coverage.\n   <em>\n    Advance Roofing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1537883\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/163/476/\">\n    788 P.2d at 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (where complaint did not allege a proper \"occurrence\" under the policy, insurer had no duty to take further action). Additional investigation was not required to deny coverage, and the Court will grant summary judgment for Defendant on Plaintiffs' bad faith claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   : that Plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment (Doc. 96) is\n   <strong>\n    denied\n   </strong>\n   . Defendant's motion for summary judgment is (Doc. 94)\n   <strong>\n    granted\n   </strong>\n   . The Clerk is directed to enter judgment accordingly and terminate this matter.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    Plaintiffs state that Ms. Langemeier expected Nevada or California law to apply to the policy but fail to cite supporting evidence in the record. Doc. 96 at 5.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    Arizona courts have found the place of injury to be Arizona because that is where the insured's personal injury or distress from the bad faith manifested.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Bates\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1517720\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/156/46/\">\n     749 P.2d at 1370\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In those cases, the insured alleged a personal injury resulting from the bad faith, but no such injury has been alleged here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    Plaintiffs argue that Ms. Langemeier was domiciled in Nevada because her policy indicates a Nevada post office box mailing address.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Docs. 96 at 7; 97 \u00b6 6. But Plaintiffs' complaint alleged that Ms. Langemeier resided in Maricopa County. Doc. 95-3 \u00b6 2. A post office box cannot alone show that she was domiciled in Nevada.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    Plaintiffs argue that Defendant did not mention investment and profit-realizing activities when arguing the business pursuits exclusion in its motion for summary judgment, and the Court therefore cannot consider those parts of the exclusion.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. 102 at 10. The Court does not agree. The argument section of Defendant's motion focuses primarily on Arizona case law (Doc. 94 at 8-10), but the factual predicate for the argument clearly includes the investment and profit-realizing language of the exclusion. That language is specifically quoted at the outset of the motion's business exclusion argument.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. 94 at 8. And the motion asserts that Langemeier was one of the largest investors in BioNovix, a fact not disputed by Plaintiffs.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 4; Doc. 95, \u00b6 10; Doc. 103.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    Other facts support this conclusion. Ms. Langemeier testified that she \"stepped in\" when BioNovix was \"falling apart.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Docs 103 \u00b6\u00b6 6,7,9; 103 1 at 29:9-11, 38:10-12. She unofficially stepped down from the board in 2008 (Docs. 103 \u00b6 13; 103-1 at 67), but she thereafter led conference calls, discussed BioNovix business with investors and distributors, and terminated employees (Docs. 95-3 \u00b6\u00b6 13-20; 103 \u00b6 15). Plaintiffs alleged in the underlying lawsuit that Ms. Langemeier also participated in interviews and tried to bring in more investor money.
