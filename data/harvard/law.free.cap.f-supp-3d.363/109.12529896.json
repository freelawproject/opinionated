For the reasons that follow, the Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   ERISA governs employee benefit plans arising from employment relationships. It provides that some employer associations acting \"in the interest of\" employer members are sufficiently employer-like to fall within the statute's scope. Health plans offered by these associations may qualify as single ERISA plans, a designation that confers regulatory advantages under the ACA. For decades, DOL has interpreted these provisions narrowly so as to allow only so-called \"bona fide associations\" with close economic and representational ties to their employer members to qualify as \"employers\" under the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2018, DOL abruptly reversed course, issuing the Final Rule challenged in this case. The Final Rule allows virtually any association of disparate employers connected by geographic proximity to qualify as single ERISA plans. These associations no longer have to be viable apart from offering an association health plan (\"AHP\") and may form solely for the purpose of creating an AHP. In addition, the Final Rule brings sole proprietors without any employees within ERISA's scope by counting them as both \"employers\" and \"employees.\" Because the ACA defines terms key to its implementation-including \"employer\" and \"employee\"-according to the definition of these terms in ERISA, the Final Rule expands AHPs in a way that allows small businesses and some individuals to avoid the healthcare market requirements imposed by the ACA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Final Rule is clearly an end-run around the ACA. Indeed, as the President directed, and the Secretary of Labor confirmed, the Final Rule was designed to expand access to AHPs in order to avoid the most stringent requirements of the ACA. Exec.

But equally important for the analysis that follows, the Final Rule does violence to ERISA. The Final Rule scraps ERISA's careful statutory scheme and its focus on employee benefit plans arising from employment relationships. It purports to extend ERISA to cover what are essentially commercial insurance\n   transactions between unrelated parties. In short, the Final Rule exceeds the statutory authority delegated by Congress in ERISA. For the reasons that follow, the Final Rule's provisions defining \"employer\" to include associations of disparate employers and expanding membership in these associations to include working owners without employees are unlawful and must be set aside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Statutory schemes created by ERISA and the ACA shape the content and context of the Final Rule.

ERISA AND THE ACA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   ERISA is the key statute at issue in this case. It regulates employee benefit plans, including welfare plans and pension plans, arising out of employment relationships. Congress enacted ERISA in 1974 \"following almost a decade of study[ ]\" of employment benefits and pension systems and after making \"detailed findings which recited, in part, 'that the continued well-being and security of millions of employees and their dependents are directly affected by [employee benefit] plans.' \"\n   <em>\n    Nachman Corp. v.

ERISA states that its purpose is to address the \"growth in size, scope, and numbers of employee benefit plans\" across the country and to protect \"the interests of participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) - (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The ACA is a statutory scheme that regulates health insurance markets more broadly. The ACA, among other things, establishes standards that apply differently to individual, small-group, and large-group health insurance markets. Congress targeted the individual and small-group healthcare markets for special heightened protections. Individual and small-group healthcare plans are required by the ACA to provide ten essential health benefits to insured individuals. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300gg-6, 18022(a). Large-group market participants face a choice: They may decline to provide these essential health benefits and instead pay a tax-the so-called \"employer shared responsibility payment.\" I.R.C. \u00a7 4980H, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4980H. Congress differentiated small employers from large employers-for the purpose of placing them in small- or large-group markets-by the number of employees these employers employed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-91(e)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The ACA absorbs key ERISA definitions into the ACA statutory scheme. Under ERISA, an employer is \"any person acting directly as an employer, or indirectly in the interest of an employer, in relation to an employee benefit plan; and includes a group or association of employers acting for an employer in such capacity.\" ERISA \u00a7 3(5),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5). An employee under ERISA is simply \"any individual employed by an employer.\" ERISA \u00a7 3(6),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6). The statutory definitions of \"employer\" and \"employee\" in ERISA have remained unchanged since ERISA's enactment in 1974.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Congress codified many of the ACA's key provisions in the Public Health Service Act (\"PHS Act\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq. At the time that Congress passed the ACA, the PHS Act already defined the term \"employer\" as having \"the meaning given such term under [ERISA \u00a7 3(5) ], except that such term shall include only employers of two or more employees,\" and defined \"employee\" as having the meaning\n   given to the same term under ERISA \u00a7 3(6) without exception. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300gg-91(d)(5)-(6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Congress preserved these definitions of \"employer\" and \"employee\" when it passed the ACA, and thus ERISA's definitions of those terms were incorporated into the ACA's statutory scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS AND THE FINAL RULE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   AHPs are group health plans offered through an association of employers, such as an industry group. DOL has always permitted\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   AHPs meeting stringent criteria to qualify as a single ERISA employee benefit plan, as if the plan was sponsored by a single employer for its employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Under DOL's longstanding sub-regulatory guidance, only so-called \"bona fide associations\" could sponsor an AHP under ERISA. Bona fide associations had to display certain employer-like characteristics, because \"the Department's regulation of employee benefit plans [was] focused on employment-based arrangements, as contemplated by ERISA, rather than merely commercial insurance-type arrangements that lack the requisite connection to the employment relationship.\" Final Rule,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2028%2C912\">\n    83 Fed. Reg. at 28,914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The \"overall structure\" of ERISA \"contemplates employment-based benefit arrangements,\" and since these AHPs qualify as ERISA plans, they had to fit within an employment context, notwithstanding the fact that they were sponsored by employer associations rather than directly by single employers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2028%2C912\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2028%2C912\">\n    at 28,913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Of most relevance to the issues raised in this case, DOL's sub-regulatory guidance analyzed bona fide associations based on three criteria: \"(1) Whether the group or association [was] a bona fide organization with business/organizational purposes and functions unrelated to the provision of benefits; (2) whether the employers share[d] some commonality and genuine organizational relationship unrelated to the provision of benefits; and (3) whether the employers that participate[d] in a benefit program, either directly or indirectly, exercise[d] control over the program, both in form and substance.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2028%2C912\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2028%2C912\">\n    at 28,914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This opinion will refer to these three criteria as requirements for purpose, commonality of interest, and control, respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Passage of the ACA raised the regulatory stakes. The majority of AHPs-which were not sponsored by associations qualifying under DOL's bona fide association test-were \"treated as the mechanism by which each individual employer obtains benefits and administrative services for its own separate plan.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2028%2C912\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing CMS Ins. Standards Bulletin, \"Application of Individual and Group Market Requirements under Title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act when Insurance Coverage Is Sold to, or through, Associations,\" Sept. 1, 2011, at 1-3, A.R. at 2211-13). In other words, the fact that the insurance came from an AHP did not matter for purposes of determining which ACA market standard applied. A small employer purchasing coverage through an AHP had to meet the ACA's requirements for small employers, individuals purchasing coverage through an AHP had to meet the ACA's individual market requirements, and so on.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2028%2C912\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Most AHPs providing coverage to individuals and small groups, then, had to satisfy the ACA's essential health benefits requirement. However, in the \"rare instances\" in which AHPs were sponsored by associations meeting DOL's bona fide association\n   criteria, the \"association coverage [would be] considered a single group health plan,\" and the number of total employees of all employer members would be counted to determine whether small or large group rules applied.\n   <em>\n    CMS Ins. Standards Bulletin at 3, A.R. at 2213.\n   </em>\n   If a bona fide association served as \"employer\" of \"an average of at least 51 employees\" over the past year, then the bona fide association would qualify as a \"large employer,\" and its AHP would be subject to \"large group market\" rules. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-91(e)(2)-(3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hence, AHPs sponsored by these bona fide associations avoid the more comprehensive requirements for healthcare coverage in the individual and small group markets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Final Rule loosens the requirements for associations to qualify as ERISA-covered \"bona fide associations,\" thereby allowing the AHPs they sponsor to qualify as single ERISA plans and avoid the ACA's individual and small-group market requirements. President Trump prompted DOL to undertake this change. In October 2017, President Trump issued an Executive Order titled \"Promoting Healthcare Choice and Competition Across the United States,\" which directed DOL to \"[e]xpand[ ] access to AHPs\" by \"allow[ing] more small businesses to avoid many of the [ACA's] costly requirements.\" Exec.

Reg. at 28,912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Associations can satisfy the new \"commonality of interest\" test if their members are either in the same trade or business or in the same geographic area (the same state or same metropolitan area, even if that area includes multiple states).\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202510.3-5\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2510.3-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).

The States also maintain that the Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious under the APA. DOL disagrees with the contention that this case has anything to do with the ACA and urges the Court to consider the Final Rule narrowly as an interpretation of ERISA. Defs.' Mot. at 1-2; Tr. at 65:16-18\n   (\"[T]his is a case about ERISA[.]\"). Because Congress granted DOL statutory authority to interpret ERISA, DOL argues that the Court should defer to DOL's reasonable interpretation under the narrow judicial review permitted under the APA. Defs.'

However, the Court concludes that DOL has failed to reasonably interpret the statute. The Final Rule's bona fide association standard fails to establish meaningful limits on the types of associations that may qualify to sponsor an ERISA plan, thereby violating Congress's intent that only an employer association acting \"in the interest of\" its members falls within ERISA's scope. The Final Rule's working owner provision similarly exceeds ERISA's scope because it seeks to extend ERISA's coverage to plans arising outside of any employment relationship. For the reasons that follow, then, the Court concludes that these provisions of the Final Rule exceed DOL's authority and must be set aside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

But the broad contours of the statutory text make clear that Congress intended that only benefit plans arising from employment relationships would fall within ERISA's scope.

But the statutory text is not infinitely elastic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The phrase \"in the interest of an employer\" distinguishes employer associations that stand in the shoes of an \"employer\" for the purpose of sponsoring an ERISA plan from every other employer association.

The Final Rule adopted the same three overall criteria\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   that DOL previously employed\n   for determining which associations are \"bona fide\" and thus act in the interest of an employer for the purpose of establishing an AHP: purpose, commonality of interest, and control. However, the Final Rule departs significantly from DOL's prior sub-regulatory guidance in the way it measures these criteria. This is the heart of the States' challenge to the Final Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   These three criteria form the primary basis for DOL's examination of which associations qualify as ERISA \"employers,\" and they must be viewed holistically to determine whether in sum they limit bona fide associations to those contemplated by Congress in ERISA. The analysis that follows describes each criterion individually, then considers whether together they place reasonable constraints on the types of associations that act \"in the interest of\" employers under ERISA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   a. Purpose Test\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The purpose test allows an association to sponsor an AHP so long as the association has \"at least one substantial business purpose\" unrelated to the provision of health care, even if its\n   <em>\n    primary\n   </em>\n   purpose is \"to offer and provide health coverage to its employer members and their employees.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202510.3-5\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2510.3-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). The rule does not define \"substantial business purpose,\" but it creates a safe harbor \"if the group or association would be a viable entity in the absence of sponsoring an employee benefit plan.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202510.3-5\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The preamble to the Final Rule provides examples of \"substantial business purpose[s],\" including \"convening conferences or offering classes or educational materials on business issues of interest to the association members,\" acting \"as a standard-setting organization that establishes business standards or practices,\" or engaging \"in public relations activities such as advertising, education, and publishing on business issues of interest to association members unrelated to sponsorship of an AHP.\" Final Rule,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2028%2C912\">\n    83 Fed. Reg. at 28,918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The problem with the purpose test as DOL now interprets it is that it fails to set meaningful limits on the character and activities of an association. The Final Rule permits associations to form for the primary purpose of establishing an AHP, and hence the only limitation imposed by the purpose test is its undefined \"substantial business purpose\" requirement. The possible scope of qualifying substantial business purposes ranges from the resource intensive-\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , setting business standards and practices-to the de minimis-\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , publishing a newsletter on business issues. Of course, the latter is something that most associations already do and thus is not a defining characteristic of a subset of organizations that would fall within ERISA's scope.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Final Rule's \"safe harbor\" provision reveals how flimsy the purpose test really is. The safe harbor provision specifies that an association that \"would be a viable entity in the absence of sponsoring an employee benefit plan\" will satisfy the purpose test.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202510.3-5\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2510.3-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). This phrasing suggests, however, that at least\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   associations would still meet the purpose test even if they were outside of this safe harbor-that is,\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   viable but for sponsoring an AHP. Sponsoring an AHP, then, may serve not only as the \"primary purpose\" of an association under the first part of the purpose test-sponsoring an\n   AHP may serve as its\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   real purpose. The \"substantial business purpose\" test, then, is only an ex post facto, perfunctory requirement-merely a box to check-that virtually any association may fulfill on the side and thereby qualify to sponsor an AHP under the Final Rule. This business purpose does not, in fact, need to be \"substantial\" in the ordinary sense of that term, because it need not make the association viable in the absence of the association's AHP. This requirement therefore is more aptly called the \"other business task\" test. It sets such a low bar that virtually no association could fail to meet it. Indeed, it is likely that nearly every employer association that exists today already satisfies the Final Rule's substantial business purpose requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In short, the Final Rule's purpose test provides no meaningful limit on the associations that would qualify as \"bona fide\" ERISA \"employers.\" It does no work towards narrowing extant associations to only those that act \"in the interest of\" employers. Although it describes its requirement in terms of a \"substantial business purpose,\" this requirement gives way under the slightest pressure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   b. Commonality of Interest Test\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   To form an association sponsoring an AHP under the Final Rule, employers also must display a \"commonality of interest.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202510.3-5\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2510.3-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5). This requirement may be met through two alternative routes: employers must either share a common \"trade, industry, line of business, or profession,\" or else each employer must have \"a principal place of business in the same region that does not exceed the boundaries of a single State or a metropolitan area (even if the metropolitan area includes more than one State).\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202510.3-5\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2510.3-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1). The States object to the latter, which deems employers to be united in interest solely because of common geographical location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The commonality of interest test is arguably the most important of the three criteria because it most directly relates to the core concern of the statute: employers' interests. Before an association can act \"in the interest of\" an employer member, that interest must be defined. But common geography does not necessarily correlate with any common interest. The Final Rule thereby permits unrelated employers in multiple, unrelated industries to associate and be deemed to act \"in the interest of\" the employer members, notwithstanding the fact that the interests of these employer members may be very different or even conflicting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   DOL does not provide a rationale that would connect geography and common employer interest. The preamble to the Final Rule explains the desired\n   <em>\n    effect\n   </em>\n   of the geography requirement, which is that this requirement will \"provide employer groups and associations with important flexibility and allow more employers to join together to secure lower cost healthcare coverage for themselves and their employees through AHPs.\" Final Rule,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2028%2C912\">\n    83 Fed. Reg. at 28,924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, the geography requirement is desirable because it lowers barriers to AHP formation. In this way, the Final Rule responds to the President's direction to \"consider ways to promote AHP formation on the basis of common geography.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2028%2C912\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2028%2C912\">\n    at 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,912 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Exec.

For example, in both\n   <em>\n    MDPhysicians\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    WEAIT\n   </em>\n   , the plans at issue were geographically focused (in the Texas panhandle and in Iowa, respectively), yet both courts concluded that the plans fell outside of ERISA's scope.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MDPhysicians\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520030\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/957/178/#p182\">\n    957 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   180 ;\n   <em>\n    WEAIT\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1662910\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/804/1059/#p1063\">\n    804 F.2d at 1060\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . ERISA imposes a common\n   <em>\n    interest\n   </em>\n   requirement, not merely a something-in-common requirement. Accordingly, courts have \"consistently rejected the contention that heterogenous businesses that share nothing more than a common size and a high regard for the 'entrepreneurial spirit' \" satisfy ERISA's commonality of interest requirement.\n   <em>\n    Gruber\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1615701\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/159/780/#p786\">\n    159 F.3d at 788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

These rejected characteristics included \"ownership characteristics (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , an association of owners who are women, minorities, or veterans), business models or structures (such as businesses owned by ESOPs, franchises, or not-for-profits), size of business (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , small businesses), [and] shared religious and moral convictions.\" Final Rule, 83 Fed. Reg. at 28,926. DOL noted some commenters' belief that \"employers within these relationships often share unique bonds, interests, needs, and regulatory schemes, and may have significantly more commonality of interest than those in the same industry or region due to these shared traits.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But DOL rejected these characteristics because \"a test that would treat all nationwide franchises, all nationwide small businesses, or all nationwide minority-owned businesses[ ] as having a common employment-based nexus-no matter the differences in their products, services, regions, or lines of work-would not be sufficient to establish commonality of interest for a national group or association and AHP because it would be impossible to define or limit ... and, in the Department's view, would eviscerate the genuine commonality of interest required under ERISA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The same concerns that animated DOL's decision to reject these other designators of commonality apply with equal force to DOL's geography test. Take, for example, an association composed of employers with principal places of business in California. The association could form for the primary purpose of creating an AHP, so long as participating employer members elected directors and the association published a quarterly newsletter on business issues of interest to California-based businesses. The employer members (of varying sizes) might include a restaurateur in Oakland, a physicians practice group in the Hollywood Hills, an almond farmer in the Central Valley, an importer in Long Beach, a technology company headquartered in San Diego but doing business primarily in New York, and a Fresno fast-food franchise. These employers share no \"unique bonds, interests, needs, [or] regulatory schemes\" and exhibit a wide range of \"differences in\n   their products, services, regions, [and] lines of work.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   They would be no more or less united in interest if their principal places of business happened to be in various states. The Court concludes, therefore, that the geography standard under the Final Rule fails to account in any way for employers' commonality of interest. This standard effectively eviscerates the genuine commonality of interest required under ERISA, thereby expanding the scope of the statute beyond what ERISA intended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Because the geography test does not, in fact, ensure that associations qualifying to sponsor AHPs under the Final Rule share a \"commonality of interest,\" it creates no meaningful limit on these associations.

DOL has observed that \"the control test is necessary to satisfy the statutory requirement in ERISA section 3(5) that the group or association must act 'in the interest of' the employer members in relation to the employee benefit plan in order to qualify as an employer.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28,919, 28,955.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The control test limits the types of associations that qualify as employers under the Final Rule by ensuring that employer members direct the actions and decisions of the association with respect to the AHP. The control test alone, however, does not mean that employer members are united in interest, but rather only that the employer members can steer the association's decision-making when working in concert. Courts have concluded-and this Court agrees-that the control test complements\n   and supplements the commonality of interest test but cannot replace it. For example, the Third Circuit has held that \"to qualify as an 'employer' for ERISA purposes, an employer group or association must satisfy\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   the commonality of interest and control requirements.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Gruber\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1615701\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/159/780/#p786\">\n    159 F.3d at 787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MDPhysicians\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520030\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/957/178/#p182\">\n    957 F.2d at 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (determining that the subject plan was not an ERISA plan because it failed to meet both the commonality of interest and control requirements).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In other words, the control test is only meaningful if employer members' interests are already aligned. If employer members have opposed interests, the control test does nothing to resolve those differences. For example, in the case of an association whose employer members display widely disparate interests, the existence of indicia of control such as election of officers and voting on plan amendments would make it more likely that the association might further the interests of\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   -perhaps those that are most powerful or most numerous-but not all employers in the organization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The Final Rule is a lawful interpretation of ERISA only so long as it limits the \"bona fide associations\" that may qualify as employers to those acting \"in the interest of\" their employer members, as mandated by ERISA's text.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ERISA \u00a7 3(5);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5). Here, the three criteria that limit association membership fall short of ERISA's statutory requirements. The Final Rule's purpose test sets no meaningful limitation on associations because its requirements are largely cursory, describing activities in which an association must participate but not meaningfully addressing whether the association's activities align with or further employer members' interests. So, too, the geography pathway for meeting the commonality of interest requirement does little to ensure that the association will act in its employer members' interests because shared geography does not reflect any common interest. The purpose and commonality of interest criteria-even when combined-fail to establish an interest-based bond between associations and employer members, which in turn undermines the effectiveness of the control test: disparate employers pursuing their own varied interests through an association's AHP-even if the employers exert a modicum of control over the organization-simply do not come within ERISA's statutory scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The three criteria set by the Final Rule for qualification as a \"bona fide association,\" then, even acting in combination, ultimately fail to respect the statutory limitations set by Congress because the Final Rule does not functionally constrain bona fide associations to those acting \"in the interest of\" employers. The Final Rule would permit a group of employers with no common characteristic other than presence in the same state to qualify as a single employer under ERISA so long as that group had an election-based officer structure and some modest business-related side project. Yet as summarized in\n   <em>\n    WEAIT\n   </em>\n   , ERISA is premised on the idea that employers and employees are connected by an employment nexus: \"[a]n employee depends on his employer,\" and vice versa.\n   <em>\n    WEAIT\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1662910\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/804/1059/#p1063\">\n    804 F.2d at 1063\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This\n   nexus is reproduced at the level of associations and their employer members. Yet there is no reason to believe that the employee of an employer joining such a loosely defined association under the Final Rule would have real ties to that association or that any associational bonds would provide inherent limits on the activities of the association with respect to its employer members or their employees. The Final Rule allows groups that closely resemble entrepreneurial, profit-driven commercial insurance providers to qualify for ERISA's protections-an outcome that longstanding interpretations of ERISA have explicitly forbidden.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gruber\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1615701\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/159/780/#p786\">\n    159 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   786 ;\n   <em>\n    MDPhysicians\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520030\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/957/178/#p182\">\n    957 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   183-84 ;\n   <em>\n    Wayne Chem.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"906160\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/567/692/#p699\">\n    567 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   699 ;\n   <em>\n    Activity Report of the House Committee on Education and Labor\n   </em>\n   , H.R.

The Court concludes that a working owner's membership in an association does not bring him within ERISA. And the contention that two working owners without employees, neither of whom is within ERISA's scope alone, could associate with one another and thereby come within the statute's reach is absurd. Congress did not intend for working owners without employees to be included within ERISA-either as individuals or when joined in an employer association. ERISA clearly contemplates regulation of benefits arising from employment relationships. The Final Rule's attempt to bring sole proprietors with no employees into ERISA's fold stretches the statute too far.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   As a practical matter, one does not have an employment relationship with oneself. Notwithstanding the broad sweep of ERISA's definition of employer, a sole proprietor neither acts \"directly as an employer\" or \"indirectly in the interest of an employer\"-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , of himself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ERISA \u00a7 3(5);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5). There is no indication that Congress crafted the statute with the intent of sweeping working owners without employees-who employ no one-within ERISA's scope through the statutory definition of \"employer.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The statutory conflict is even clearer when one considers the statute's definition of \"employee.\" Unlike the more expansive definition of \"employer,\" the definition of \"employee\" under ERISA is limited: simply an \"individual employed by an employer.\" ERISA \u00a7 3(6);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6). The text of the statute clearly anticipates a relationship between two parties. Congress constructed the definition of \"employee\" with a transitive verb (to employ), which necessarily describes a relationship between a subject and object-employer and employee. If such a relationship were not intended, then Congress could have defined \"employee\" as simply a \"working individual.\" But it did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Further, the Supreme Court has read ERISA's definition of \"employee\" to \"incorporate traditional agency law criteria for identifying master-servant relationships,\"\n   <em>\n    Nationwide Mut.

If an otherwise qualifying association provides benefits to such a working owner without employees through its AHP, it has severed the economic and representational ties that bind its \"employer\" members together because the working owner without employees would be a\n   <em>\n    non-employer\n   </em>\n   member.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   By offering benefits to unaffiliated individuals through its AHP, the association would not qualify as an ERISA \"employer,\" and its AHP would not qualify as a single ERISA plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The Final Rule's expansion of the definition of employer to include working owners without employees also does not further ERISA's purposes.

DOL's interpretation does not \"interpret\" ERISA, it rewrites it, obliterating the statute's references to \"employers,\" employees \"employed by\" those employers, and plans \"established or maintained by an employer ... for the purpose of providing for\" those employees. It is also unsupported by case law interpreting ERISA from the Supreme Court and other courts. For these reasons, the Court concludes that the working owner provision of the Final Rule is contrary to ERISA and must be set aside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    C. DOL's Unreasonable Regulatory Interpretation of ERISA Creates Absurd Results Under the ACA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Finally, the Final Rule creates absurd results under the ACA. This conflict further highlights that DOL's regulatory interpretation of \"employer\" under ERISA is unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   As noted above, the ACA defines \"employer\" and \"employee\" generally based on how those terms are defined in ERISA. The ACA's definition of \"employee\" is the same as under ERISA: it is simply an\n   \"individual employed by an employer,\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-91(d)(5),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6), which the Supreme Court has held to \"incorporate traditional agency law criteria for identifying master-servant relationships,\"\n   <em>\n    Darden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6227709\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/318/#p319\">\n    503 U.S. at 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6227709\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/318/#p319\">\n    112 S.Ct. 1344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the ACA's definition of \"employer\" adopts ERISA's definition of \"employer\" with a\n   <em>\n    critical exception\n   </em>\n   : \"such term shall include only employers of two or more employees.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-91(d)(6). Under the ACA, then, an \"employer\" must have two or more \"employees,\" and, under\n   <em>\n    Darden,\n   </em>\n   one expects these individuals to be cognizable as such under the common law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Darden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6227709\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/318/#p319\">\n    503 U.S. at 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6227709\" index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/318/#p319\">\n    112 S.Ct. 1344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   DOL contends that an ERISA \"bona fide association\" comprised solely of two working owners without employees would qualify as both an \"employer\" and \"employee\" under the ACA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final Rule, 83 Fed. Reg. at 28,940 -41. DOL's explanation for how these self-employed individuals fit inside ACA's definition of employer is a magic trick. First, DOL asks the Court to imagine each working owner without employees wearing two hats: an employer hat and an employee hat. Tr. at 75:4-15. When two working owners without employees associate, they keep their employer hats, but the association also gains an employer hat.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 75:16-25. The association counts as an employer under the ACA because the two working owners without employees also wear their employee hats, and therefore the association is an \"employer[ ] of two or more employees.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 76:1-11; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-91(6). Note that the working owners without employees must hang on to their employer hats as well, because otherwise the association would not qualify as an employer under ERISA, which requires the association to act in the interest of its employer members. ERISA \u00a7 3(5);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5). As DOL explained, this analysis \"squares everything regarding working owners into one very neat package,\" and the association qualifies as an employer under the ACA \"as long as the association has at least two individuals to whom it is providing benefits, be it individuals, be it small companies, it doesn't matter.\" Tr. at 76:10-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   This logic is clever but ultimately not persuasive. When one counts the employees employed by two self-employed persons without employees, the sum is zero. DOL's feat of prestidigitation transforms two individuals, neither of whom works for the other, into a total of three employers and two employees. This interpretation strains the ERISA definition of \"employee,\" which contemplates an individual \"employed by\" another. It doubly strains the ACA's express limit of employers to \"employers of two or more employees,\" which contemplates\n   <em>\n    two\n   </em>\n   individuals employed by another. An association of two working owners without employees has no employers or employees-DOL's explanation is pure legerdemain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The absurdity of DOL's interpretation is compounded when one considers an association of fifty-one working owners without employees. Counting the number of employees employed by fifty-one working owners without employees, the Court again reaches a sum of zero. Yet under DOL's explanation, this group of fifty-one associated individuals, none of whom employ anyone, counts fifty-two employers (counting the association \"employer\") and fifty-one employees. This association would qualify not only as an ACA \"employer,\" but as a \"large employer\" free from the ACA's individual and small-group market requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-91(e)(2)-(3). The Court cannot believe that Congress crafted the ACA, with its careful statutory scheme distinguishing rules that apply to individuals, small employers, and large employers, with the intent that fifty-one distinct individuals employing no others\n   could exempt themselves from the individual market's requirements by loosely affiliating through a so-called \"bona fide association\" without real employment ties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   DOL's explanation of how the Final Rule operates under the ACA relies on a tortured reading of the ACA's statutory text that undermines the market structure that Congress so carefully crafted. DOL's regulatory interpretation sows discord among the Final Rule, ERISA, and the ACA, which serves as further evidence that the Final Rule unreasonably interprets ERISA and fails to carry out congressional intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Upon consideration of the parties' positions, as argued orally and in their briefs, as well as the administrative record, the relevant statutes, legal precedent, and the entire record herein, the Court concludes that the bona fide association and working owner provisions of the Final Rule, codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202510.3-5\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 2510.3-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), (c) and (e), are unreasonable interpretations of ERISA. The Final Rule was intended and designed to end run the requirements of the ACA, but it does so only by ignoring the language and purpose of both ERISA and the ACA. DOL unreasonably expands the definition of \"employers\" to include groups without any real commonality of interest and to bring working owners without employees within ERISA's scope despite Congress's clear intent that ERISA cover benefits arising out of employment relationships. Accordingly, these provisions are unlawful and must be set aside, pursuant to this Court's authority under the APA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
