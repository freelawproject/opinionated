For the reasons stated herein, the Court finds that Hudson has a duty to defend Defendant Magio's Inc. (\"Magio's\") and Defendant Riverwalk Centre, Ltd. (\"Riverwalk\") in the state court lawsuit (the \"Underlying Lawsuit\") filed by Defendants Regina and Kiril Spiroff (the \"Spiroffs\"). Accordingly, Hudson's Motion [DE 49] will be\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   and the Spiroffs' Motion [DE 52] will be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Hudson brings this declaratory judgment action seeking an order that it is not obligated under a commercial general liability insurance policy (the \"Policy\") to indemnify or defend Magio's or Riverwalk in the Underlying Lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the Underlying Lawsuit, the Spiroffs allege that on October 5, 2013, Ms. Spiroff was a patron at a nightclub owned, operated, managed, and/or controlled by Magio's, and that Riverwalk rented and/or leased to Magio's the property where the club is located. DE 26-3 \u00b6\u00b6 15-16. The Spiroffs allege that while at this nightclub, Ms. Spiroff was given a beverage \"which had been adulterated by a drug and/or medication,\" and was then driven away from the club and sexually assaulted by four individuals, including Hector Perez, who the Spiroffs allege was \"an employee, agent, or apparent agent of [Magio's].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10, 17, 20-21. The Spiroffs claim that, \"[a]s a result of being abducted and sexually assaulted, [Ms. Spiroff] suffered emotional distress, psychological trauma, and physical injuries,\" which are \"permanent in nature and [that she] will continue to suffer in the future.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37, 82, 89, 93. In the Underlying Lawsuit, the Spiroffs assert claims against Magio's for negligent supervision, negligent security, and vicarious\n   liability, a claim for negligent security against Riverwalk, and a loss of consortium claim against both Defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   The Underlying Lawsuit also includes a crossclaim filed by Riverwalk against Magio's for contractual indemnification, negligence, and common law indemnity. DE 26-4. Hudson has agreed to defend Magio's and Riverwalk in the Underlying Lawsuit subject to a reservation of rights. DE 26 \u00b6\u00b6 19-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In the instant action, Hudson now moves for summary judgment on the ground that \"the damages alleged against Magio's and Riverwalk in the Underlying Lawsuit arise from a sexual assault and battery and are therefore excluded from coverage under the assault and battery exclusion contained in the relevant ... [P]olicy issued by Hudson to Magio's.\" DE 49 at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Policy's assault and battery exclusion, however, excludes from coverage:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Claims or 'suits' to recover damages for 'bodily injury', 'property damage', 'personal and advertising injury' or medical payments arising from the actual or alleged 'assault' and/or 'battery' and claims or 'suits' for false arrest, false detention or false imprisonment, where such false arrest, false detention or false imprisonment is connected to or arises in the sequence of events related to actual or alleged 'assault' and/or 'battery.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9292155\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/864/31/#p35\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9292155\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/864/31/#p35\">\n    at 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Hudson points to the broad \"arising out of\" language in this exclusion,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and argues that coverage is excluded here because each claim alleged in the Underlying Lawsuit \"arose from\" the alleged sexual assault and battery of Ms. Spiroff. DE 49 at 6, 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Initially, Defendants responded by essentially arguing that the Spiroffs' claims were covered because the assault and battery exclusion does not apply to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the Spiroffs' claims as some \"arose from\" Magio's and/or Riverwalk's alleged negligence in failing to prevent Ms. Spiroff from being drugged and abducted, not from the sexual assault of Ms. Spiroff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 50 at 9-10 (\"Because at least some of Ms. Spiroff's injuries allegedly arose out of her being drugged, incapacitated, and led off the premises, the Assault and Battery Exclusion ... does not apply.\"); DE 51 at 11 (\"the damages claimed by Plaintiff in the Underlying Lawsuit do not solely arise from an assault, batter (sic) or molestation.\"); DE 52 at 11 (\"Mrs. Spiroff was the victim of multiple negligent and criminal acts perpetrated against her ... many of which occurred before she was finally sexually assaulted.\").

Thus, the Court cannot find that these perils were independent. The concurrent cause doctrine is therefore inapposite. That does not end the inquiry, however, as there are \"two competing Florida doctrines used for determining the appropriate theory of recovery to apply when multiple perils converge to cause a loss and at least one of the perils is excluded from the insurance policy\"-the concurrent cause doctrine and the efficient proximate cause doctrine.\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

Thus, the efficient proximate cause doctrine should permit coverage under the Policy. Hudson, however, argues that the efficient proximate cause doctrine should not be applied in this case because application of the doctrine: (1) would render the assault and battery exclusion in the Policy a nullity; and (2) would \"conflict with the significant body of case law in which courts have determined that claims of negligence against restaurants and bars in assault and battery cases are not covered where the subject policy contains an assault and battery exclusion.\" DE 60 at 3-5. The Court finds no merit to either of these arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   First, application of the efficient proximate cause doctrine in this case would not render the Policy's assault and battery exclusion a nullity.

The policy at issue, however, covered only one peril: liability related to the sale of alcohol.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=719%20Fed.%20Appx.%20951\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=719%20Fed.%20Appx.%20951\">\n    at 954\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the Eleventh Circuit held that if it applied the efficient proximate cause doctrine and found coverage for the sexual assault (despite an assault and battery exclusion) because the assault was caused by the plaintiff's intoxication, then the assault and battery exclusion would have been rendered meaningless because every claim against the bar involving an assault would either involve: (1) an assault committed after the service of alcohol (in which case the exclusion would not apply because of the efficient proximate cause doctrine) or (2) an assault unrelated to the service of alcohol (in which case there would not be coverage under the policy because it only covered liability related to alcohol sales).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=719%20Fed.%20Appx.%20951\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The same concern is not present here-it simply does not follow that the Court's application of the efficient proximate cause doctrine on the facts of this case means that the Policy's assault and battery exclusion will never apply. If, for example, a patron was sexually assaulted at Magio's nightclub without having first been drugged at the nightclub, the assault and battery exclusion would still apply to preclude coverage for,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , a claim that any negligence on Magio's part had allegedly led to the assault.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Essex Ins.

Big Top of Tampa, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7042384,7042337,7042486\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/53/1220/\">\n    53 So.3d 1220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 2d DCA 2011) (\"Policy provisions that exclude coverage for claims based on an assault or battery have been extended to exclude coverage for claims of negligence which arise out of the alleged assault or battery.\"). This also illustrates why the application of the efficient proximate cause doctrine in this case does not conflict with the Florida case law holding that assault and battery exclusions extend to exclude coverage for negligent conduct connected to assaults or batteries. Here, the Spiroffs' negligence claims do not all directly pertain to the assault of Ms. Spiroff. If they did, as in the above example, the assault and battery exclusion would still apply. But the Court cannot apply that exclusion here where the Spiroffs' negligence claims are in part related to Magio's and/or Riverwalk's negligence in failing to prevent the drugging of Ms. Spiroff. Because this alleged negligence set in motion the events that resulted in the sexual assault, the efficient proximate cause doctrine applies and permits coverage under the Policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
