KIYO A. MATSUMOTO, United States District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On April 3, 2018, plaintiffs Yu Mei Chen (\"Ms. Chen\") and Xiu Qing You (\"Mr. You\"), also known as Xian Chin Yu, filed a complaint for a writ of mandamus against Kirstjen Nielsen, L. Francis Cissna, and Christopher Way, seeking to compel the United States Citizen and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\") to rule on Ms. Chen's pending I-130 petition and Mr. You's pending I-485 application. (ECF No. 1, Complaint.) The government requested an extension to respond to the complaint on May 7, 2018, noting that USCIS expected to adjudicate the application and petition. (ECF No. 5, Defs. May 7, 2018 Letter.) After the plaintiffs received a response from the government and Mr. You was detained by United States Immigrations &amp; Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\"), the plaintiffs\n   filed an amended complaint, which named additional defendants and challenged USCIS's ruling on the I-485 application, among other things. (ECF No. 7, Amended Complaint.) The defendants served their motion to dismiss the action on July 30, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 15, Notice of Motion.) For the reasons stated below, the court grants the government's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Xiu Qing You (\"Mr. You\") is a Chinese citizen who came to the United States in January 2000 without a valid entry document. (ECF No. 1, Complaint \u00b6 2.1.) Mr. You indicated that he was afraid of returning to China. (ECF No. 6-1, USCIS I-485 Decision at 1.) He was subsequently placed into removal proceedings in March 2000 and filed an application for asylum. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) An immigration judge denied Mr. You's application in December 2000 and ordered him removable to China. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. You appealed that decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") the same month, and the BIA dismissed his appeal in November 2002. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. You did not comply with the order of removal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In May 2008, Mr. You moved to have his case reopened, but the BIA dismissed the motion in September 2008. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In October 2013, Mr. You married plaintiff Yu Mei Chen (\"Ms. Chen\"), who was a U.S. permanent resident at the time. (ECF No. 1, Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 2.2, 5.2.) On December 4, 2013, Ms. Chen filed an I-130 Petition for Alien Relative on Mr. You's behalf. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.2) Ms. Chen became a U.S. citizen in January 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. You filed an I-485 Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status on March 11, 2015, with a request to upgrade the I-130 petition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2.2, 5.5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. You was fingerprinted for his I-485 application on April 9, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.6.) USCIS scheduled an adjustment of status interview for Mr. You to take place on December 21, 2015 at the New York City field office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.7.) The agency informed Mr. You on December 9, 2015 that his interview would be canceled due to unforeseen circumstances, and that he would receive further updates, including an announcement of a rescheduled announcement, under separate notice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.8.) Because he did not receive further information from USCIS, Mr. You contacted USCIS about the pending I-130 petition and I-485 application on July 6, 2017, but he did not receive a response. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 3, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a complaint seeking a writ of mandamus. (ECF No. 1, Complaint.) The suit was brought against Kirstjen Nielsen, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"); L. Francis Cissna, the Director of USCIS, a department within DHS; and Christopher Wray, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2.3-2.5.) The action sought to compel action on the I-130 Petition for Alien Relative and the I-485 Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1.1.) The plaintiffs noted that the petition had been pending for over four years and the application for approximately three years at the time of filing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.11.) According to the USCIS website approximately a week before the plaintiffs filed their complaint, the processing time for I-485 applications filed before and up to September 8, 2016 was about 19 months. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.10.) The plaintiffs generally argued that the defendants' failure to adjudicate the filings for such long periods of time violated the defendants' duties under the Immigration &amp; Nationality Act and the Administrative Procedures Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 VII.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendants requested an extension of time to respond to the complaint because USCIS was in the process of adjudicating\n   the I-130 petition and I-485 application. (ECF No. 5, Defs. May 7, 2018 Letter.) USCIS had scheduled an interview for May 23, 2018, and the defendants requested until July 23, 2018 to respond, which would give USCIS sufficient time to adjudicate the petition and application. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The plaintiffs attended an interview with USCIS on May 23, 2018. (ECF No. 6, Defs. June 7, 2018 Letter at 1; ECF No. 7, Amended Complaint \u00b6 5.13.) After the interview, two ICE Officers detained Mr. You, due to his outstanding removal order. (ECF No. 6, Defs. June 7, 2018 Letter at 1; ECF No. 7, Amended Complaint \u00b6 5.14.) That same day, USCIS granted the I-130 relative petition and denied the I-485 adjustment application. (ECF No. 6, Defs. June 7, 2018 Letter at 1.) The defendants subsequently sought the plaintiffs' agreement to stipulate to dismiss the mandamus action after the application and petition were adjudicated, but the plaintiffs refused. (ECF No. 6, Defs. June 7, 2018 Letter at 3.) The defendants requested a pre-motion conference with the court, announcing their intention to move for dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because they believed the agency's action on the application and petition mooted the issue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.) The defendants further argued that the court lacked jurisdiction to review plaintiffs' contention that USCIS had relied on improper considerations in denying the I-485 application, and that USCIS had considered appropriate factors in its ruling. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, n.1.) The defendants attached the approved I-130 petition and decision denying the I-485 application to their pre-motion conference letter. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 6-1, USCIS I-485 Decision; ECF No. 6-2, Approved I-130 Petition.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The I-485 Application Decision USCIS released stated that Mr. You's application was denied \"[a]fter a thorough review of [Mr. You's] application and supporting documents, and [his] testimony during [his] interview ....\" (ECF. No 6-1 at 1, USCIS I-485 Decision.) The decision contains a history of Mr. You's presence in the United States and interaction with the immigration system. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.) It explains that the \"granting of adjustment of status to that of a lawful permanent resident is a discretionary benefit\" and that \"[m]ere eligibility is not the only factor considered in adjustment of status.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) USCIS \"determined that [Mr. You was] eligible for adjustment of status,\" but that \"significant adverse factors [showed] that discretion should not be exercised in [Mr. You's] favor.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) These adverse factors included that Mr. You entered the U.S. without documentation, was found to have an asylum claim that was not credible, disregarded a removal order from the Board of Immigration Appeals, and was continuously employed without authorization while in the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The factors in Mr. You's favors were Mr. You's immediate family (Ms. Chen and their two minor children), evidence of paying taxes, and part-time employment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) \"After careful review of all the facts, USCIS ... determined that the favorable factors ... [did] not warrant a favorable exercise of discretion in light of the adverse factors.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The decision also highlighted that the \"positive equities were accrued after [Mr. You] violated the court's order and while [Mr. You] knew [he was] under an order of removal and faced deportation from the United States.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The decision advised that Mr. You could not appeal the decision, but that he could file a motion to reopen or reconsider if he believed the denial was in error. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After the defendants announced their intent to file a motion to dismiss, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on June 11, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 7, Amended Complaint.) The amended complaint added as\n   defendants: Thomas Cioppa, Director of USCIS's New York District Office; Thomas Decker, ICE New York Field Office Director for Detention and Removal; and \"Officer Syed,\" the ICE Officer in charge of Mr. You's case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2.6-2.8.) In addition to retaining the original request to have the I-130 and I-485 filings adjudicated, the amended complaint sought to compel the defendants to adjudicate Mr. You's Motion to Reopen and asked the court to stay Mr. You's removal pending adjudication of his motion to reopen and/or other appeals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1.1-1.3; 8.1) The complaint states that USCIS \"approved Ms. Chen's I-130 Petition but denied Mr. You's I-485 as a matter of discretion ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.16.) It also states that Mr. You filed a motion to reopen/reconsider, which alleges that the I-485 decision was \"legally erroneous because Section 245 of the INA explicitly permits [the] spouse of [a] U.S. citizen to adjust despite having engaged in unauthorized employment and unauthorized stay in the U.S.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.17.) The plaintiffs' motion to reopen also alleged that USCIS abused its discretion because it \"[paid] lip service to [Mr.] You's long stay in the U.S. and family tie[s].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.18.) Plaintiffs claim that the decision \"did not give any positive weight\" to the following factors: Mr. You's two young children, the plaintiffs' ownership of a nail salon, Ms. Chen's grant of asylum, Mr. You's history of employment and tax payment, and Mr. You's lack of criminal history. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The plaintiffs also noted that they were not asked to submit evidence of any other positive discretionary factors, such as community ties. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The complaint also explains that Mr. You was detained by ICE in a facility in Bergen County, New Jersey. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.15.) The complaint alleges that Mr. You was unable to sign the motion to reopen/reconsider due to his detention, despite multiple attempts to get the motion to him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5.19-5.23.) Plaintiffs alleged that USCIS rejected the first motion because it lacked Mr. You's signature and that their inability to obtain his signature could affect his ability to pursue available administrative options. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.7.) In addition to the relief described above, the plaintiffs requested that the court require ICE to release Mr. You from custody. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After the filing of the amended complaint, the defendants renewed their request for a pre-motion conference on June 12, 2018, noting their continued intention to move to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. (ECF No. 8, Defs. June 12, 2018 Letter.) The defendants again argued that USCIS's decisions on the I-130 petition and I-485 application mooted the mandamus claim, regardless of plaintiff's dissatisfaction with the I-485 application decision or attempts and plan to administratively overturn it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) They also maintained that the court lacked jurisdiction to consider the plaintiffs' challenge of the factors USCIS relied on to render a decision and the plaintiffs' challenge of the denial overall, because the latter would be an indirect challenge to a removal order. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) Finally, the defendants claimed that the court lacked jurisdiction to stay the removal order. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On June 21, 2018, the court scheduled the pre-motion conference for June 28, 2018 and ordered the plaintiffs to respond to the defendants' request for the conference by June 26, 2018. (ECF Entry dated June 21, 2018.) A few days later, the defendants informed the court that plaintiffs had filed a habeas petition in the Southern District of New York on June 14, seeking a stay of the order of removal. (ECF No. 9, Defs. June 25, 2018 Letter at 2.) Judge Torres granted a stay of the removal order and ordered Mr. You's release from detention pending the resolution of the habeas petition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants argued that the stay of the order of removal from the\n   Southern District mooted the request for a stay in this case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiffs, with new representation from the Legal Aid Society, told the court that its position was that their petition for a writ of mandamus was not moot, because the defendants \"did not exercise any discretion in adjudicating Plaintiffs adjustment application.\" (ECF No. 13, Pls. June 26, 2018 Letter.) They claimed that \"USCIS conflated eligibility and discretion with respect to Plaintiffs' I-485 Adjustment Application.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) They alleged that although Mr. You was called in for an I-485 interview, no interview actually occurred. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Additionally, the factors USCIS considered \"adverse to Mr. You's adjustment are all expressly contemplated adjustment process Plaintiffs sought to avail themselves to-unlawful entry, unlawful presence, final order of removal.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs' noted that Mr. You's long-time employment in the U.S. was considered an adverse discretionary factor, despite its citation as a favorable factor in other courts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Mahmood v. Nielsen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525399\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/312/417/#p422\">\n    312 F. Supp. 3d 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 422 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) ) Plaintiffs argued that the defendants conflated eligibility and discretion, which amounted to a failure to exercise discretion and raised reviewable issues before the court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The defendants served their motion to dismiss on July 30, 2018. (ECF No. 16, Defs. August 22, 2018 Letter.) The defendants informed the court on August 22, 2018 that they had not received the plaintiffs' opposition to their motion, which was due on August 20, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The defendants requested that the court deem the motion unopposed and grant the motion in its entirety. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The court subsequently ordered the plaintiffs to respond to the government's letter by August 24, 2018. (ECF Entry dated August 23, 2018.) On August 28, 2018, the plaintiffs acknowledged that they did not oppose the government's motion to dismiss in the time allotted by the court and conceded that the government's motion should be deemed unopposed. (ECF No. 17, Pls. August 28, 2018 Letter). The court deemed the government's motion to dismiss unopposed and fully submitted.

The plaintiffs brought this action to compel the USCIS to adjudicate Mr. You's I-485 application.

Plaintiffs take the position that USCIS has not adjudicated the I-485 Application because it \"conflated eligibility and discretion\" and treated factors that have sometimes been considered positive factors as adverse factors. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 13, Pls. June 26, 2018 Letter.) Mr. You's eligibility is not an issue in this case, because USCIS clearly made a finding on eligibility. (ECF No. 6-1, USCIS I-485 Decision at 1 (\"In your case, USCIS has determined that you are eligible for adjustment of status.\").) USCIS's eligibility determination leaves at issue only plaintiffs' argument regarding USCIS's consideration of Mr. You's discretionary factors.
