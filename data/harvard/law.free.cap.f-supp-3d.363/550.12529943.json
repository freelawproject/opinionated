Brenton (\"Brenton\"), filed the instant action on January 17, 2017, in which she raises several claims relating to her employment with the defendant, F.M. Kirby Center for the Performing Arts (\"Kirby\"). (Doc. 1). Kirby filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings (Doc. 9) and a brief in support (Doc. 10) on March 27, 2017. Brenton filed an amended complaint on June 29, 2017. (Doc. 19). Brenton has alleged the following claims against Kirby: (1) retaliation and discrimination under section 510 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201140\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and (2) breach of fiduciary duty under section 404 of ERISA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201104\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Then, Kirby filed a new motion for judgment on the pleadings (Doc. 22) and brief in support (Doc. 23) on July 3, 2017. Following discovery on November 28, 2017, Kirby filed the pending motion for summary judgment (Doc. 29), along with a brief in support (Doc. 31), and a statement of material facts (Doc. 30). Brenton filed a brief in opposition (Doc. 38) to Kirby's motion for summary judgment on January 19, 2018, along with a response to Kirby's statement of material facts (Doc. 39). On February 2, 2018, Kirby filed a reply brief in support of its motion for summary judgment. (Doc. 40). On July 18, 2018, Kirby's motion for judgment on the pleadings was dismissed as superseded by Kirby's pending motion for summary judgment. (Doc. 43).

MATERIAL FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The following are the undisputed facts material to resolving the pending motion for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Brenton commenced her employment with the Kirby in July of 2007. At the time of her separation from the Kirby on July 1, 2016, Brenton was the Director of Membership and Corporate Giving. The Kirby's Development Department (\"Department\") had three employees-the Director of Development, Brenton, and an assistant. On May 13, 2016, management informed Brenton and the assistant in the Department that the Kirby was consolidating their positions because the Kirby needed to cut thirty-thousand dollars from the budget. Brenton and the assistant in the Department were invited to apply for the new consolidated position, and the Kirby interviewed Brenton for the job. Ultimately, the Kirby did not select Brenton for the newly created position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   During her employment, Brenton was a participant in the 403(B)-plan (\"Plan\") offered by the Kirby to its employees. In October 2015, the Kirby's Director of Finance informed Brenton that money from a former employee's Plan account had been commingled with her Plan account.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Kirby employed a third-party vendor (\"Employee Fiduciary\") to segregate the two Plan accounts, rebuild the accounts to determine how much of the money belonged to both Brenton and the former employee, and ensure the accounts were made whole. Then, a sum of money was withdrawn from Brenton's Plan account without Brenton's permission. Brenton requested and received a copy of the Plan documents from the Kirby. Brenton also consulted her accountant to help investigate the issue with her Plan account. Later, during a conference call, the Employee Fiduciary informed Brenton that her Plan account was understated by about eight-hundred dollars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The parties dispute whether Brenton and her accountant were \"comfortable\" with the account restoration performed by the Employee Fiduciary. However, in her\n   deposition, Brenton states that she told her accountant she was \"comfortable\" and that she was satisfied with the amount of money that the Employee Fiduciary determined was owed to Brenton. (Doc. 30-2, at 56-59). Nevertheless, the Kirby eventually made Brenton's Plan account whole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Retaliation &amp; Discrimination Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Under section 510 of ERISA it is unlawful to \"discharge, fine, suspend, expel, discipline, or discriminate against a participant or beneficiary for exercising any right to which he [or she] is entitled under the provisions of an employee benefit plan,\" ... or \"because he [or she] has given information ... in any inquiry or proceeding relating to [ERISA] ...\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201140\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-22\">\n   The legal standard in \u00a7 510 cases is very clear. To recover, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant had the [\"specific intent\"] to violate \u00a7 510. This requires the plaintiff to show that \"the employer made a conscious decision to interfere with the employee's attainment of pension eligibility or additional benefits.\" The plaintiff may use both direct and circumstantial evidence to establish specific intent, but when the plaintiff offers no direct evidence that a violation of [\u00a7] [sic] 510 has occurred, the court applies a shifting burdens analysis, similar to that applied in Title VII employment discrimination claims. In this burden-shifting analysis, the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case by showing: \"(1) prohibited employer conduct (2) taken for the purpose of interfering (3) with the attainment of any right to which the employee may become entitled.\" If the plaintiff is successful in demonstrating her [or his] prima facie case, the burden then shifts to the defendant-employer, who must articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the prohibited conduct. If the employer carries its burden, the plaintiff then must persuade the court by a preponderance of the evidence that the employer's legitimate reason is pretextual.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    DiFederico v. Rolm Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1757386\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/201/200/#p204\">\n    201 F.3d 200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 204-05 (3d Cir. 2000) (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In her brief in opposition to Kirby's present motion, Brenton incorrectly cites the elements of a Title VII retaliation claim as being enough to establish her\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case under ERISA \u00a7 510. (Doc. 38, at 13). \"[T]he Third Circuit has established a different standard for a [\u00a7 510] plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case than that used in Title VII cases.\"\n   <em>\n    DiFederico v. Rolm Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 94-CV-6901,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1995%20WL%20710561\">\n    1995 WL 710561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *4 (E.D.

The parallel between Title VII and ERISA \u00a7 510 discrimination cases that is often referenced by courts is merely a procedural one. As explained above, it is after an ERISA-\u00a7 510 plaintiff relies on circumstantial evidence and successfully establish their\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case that the court employs a burden-shifting analysis that is most often associated with Title VII claims.\n   <em>\n    DiFederico\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1757386\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/201/200/#p204\">\n    201 F.3d at 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The substantive elements of each claim are not the same. Establishing a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case in a Title VII claim requires a \"causal connection\" between the participation in a protected activity and the adverse employment action.\n   <em>\n    Remp v. Alcon Laboratories, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=701%20Fed.%20Appx.%20103\">\n    701 Fed.Appx. 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 107 (3d Cir. 2017) (citation omitted). Whereas, in an ERISA \u00a7 510 claim, the plaintiff must establish that the employer had the \"specific intent\" to violate \u00a7 510.\n   <em>\n    DiFederico\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1757386\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/201/200/#p204\">\n    201 F.3d at 204-05\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Brenton offers no direct evidence that the Kirby specifically intended to interfere with her attainment of ERISA benefits. Also, Brenton provides no direct evidence of any right or benefit under ERISA that was hindered with by her termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Brenton does allege that she had difficulty obtaining her Plan documents, as well as, some money, which allegedly belonged in her Plan account. Nevertheless, Brenton admits that she received the documents and money before her termination. (Doc. 39, at 21). Brenton also mentions that the Kirby was notoriously late in depositing employees' funds into their benefits accounts. However, once again, Brenton admits that the Kirby began investigating this issue before her termination. (Doc. 39, at 22). Thus, it is unclear what pension eligibility or additional benefits that Brenton is alleging the Kirby intended to interfere with when they terminated her employment. At best, Brenton's argument is construed to assert that her termination was pretextual essentially because she \"started asking questions\" and providing information about her Plan account. But, without the circumstantial evidence to support a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case under \u00a7 510, Brenton fails to advance her case to the burden-shifting analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After hearing a simple summary of the facts surrounding the issue with Brenton's Plan, no reasonable jury could conclude that the Kirby did anything other than try to help remedy an accident. First, it was the Kirby, through a third party, who initially discovered that Brenton's Plan account had been commingled with the account of a former employee. Then, the Kirby relayed the issue to Brenton. Next, a third-party vendor, Employee Fiduciary, was tasked with fixing the problem by determining that both Plan accounts had the proper balance. While too much money was withdrawn from Brenton's account, ultimately, the Employee Fiduciary investigated the issue, and both Brenton and her accountant agreed to accept the refund proposed by the Employee Fiduciary\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   . Also, Brenton admits that the Kirby provided her with a copy of the Plan documents and that her account was made whole before her termination. Now, to establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case under \u00a7 510, Brenton must allege that despite these facts, the Kirby \"made a conscious decision to interfere with [Brenton's] attainment of pension eligibility or additional benefits.\"\n   <em>\n    DeWitt v.

Moreover, there is no evidence in the record to support Brenton's allegation-that she was targeted for termination because of her benefits eligibility. Because Brenton has failed to prove the Kirby specifically intended to violate \u00a7 510 through direct or circumstantial evidence and was unable to state any additional eligibility or benefits that the Kirby intended to interfere with, she has failed to establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case under \u00a7 510 of ERISA.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    The relevant facts are taken from the pleadings (Doc. 8; Doc. 19; Doc. 21), Kirby's statement of facts (Doc. 30), and Brenton's statement of facts (Doc. 39).

Additionally, a generous reading of Brenton's amended complaint and brief in opposition to the present motion indicates that Brenton also seeks to utilize the enforcement provisions in\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n     29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(2), to find relief under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201109\">\n     29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1109\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . When considering a breach of fiduciary duty claim, the distinction between these two enforcement provisions is the type of damages that the parties can obtain. While the parties highly contest the issue of damages, it does not become a relevant inquiry until Brenton establishes a\n    <em>\n     prima facie\n    </em>\n    breach of fiduciary duty claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    Brenton alleges that the Kirby breached its fiduciary duty,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n    (a) by depositing another participant's monies into Brenton's 403(b) account;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n    (b) by transferring monies out of Brenton's account without providing Brenton with an appropriate explanation or accounting and without her authorization;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n    (c) by failing to provide a prompt accounting and requested information after transferring the monies out of Brenton's account; and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n    (d) by terminating Brenton because she exercised her rights under the 403(b) Plan and ERISA and/or because of her inquiries, opposition and/or complaints about ERISA violations after Defendant engaged in unlawful actions related to her 403(b) account.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    (Doc. 19, at 10). To support a claim for breach of fiduciary duty, Brenton must prove that the Kirby (a) was an ERISA fiduciary, (b) breached an ERISA-imposed duty, and (c) that breach caused a loss to the Plan.\n    <em>\n     Leckey v. Stefano\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3705996\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/501/212/#p225\">\n     501 F.3d 212\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 225-26 (3d Cir. 2007). Even if the Kirby is an ERISA fiduciary that breached an ERISA-imposed duty, Brenton fails to establish that any of her breach theories caused a loss to Brenton's Plan account. The only periods when Brenton alleges that her Plan account sustained a loss was when the Kirby made late contributions and when approximately eight-hundred dollars was overdrawn from Brenton's Plan account.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Brenton does not allege a late contribution claim against the Kirby. Also, none of her theories of breach alleged in her amended complaint discuss making late contributions to Brenton's account. In her papers, Brenton briefly mentions that she and her accountant told the Kirby they were frequently late with contributions to her Plan account in the past. (Doc. 19, at 4-5). But, her allegations are nothing more than conclusory with no evidence supporting this claim. Also, Brenton admits that the Kirby investigated the late contributions and then makes no further mention of any continuing issue. Thus, the court finds that no jury could reasonably conclude that the Kirby breached its fiduciary duty and caused a loss to the Plan by making late contribution payments. Considering Brenton's admission that the Kirby investigated this issue and her failure to allege an ongoing problem, the court finds that granting leave so that Brenton can amend her complaint would be futile.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Brenton's only remaining allegation of a loss to the Plan is when funds were overdrawn from Brenton's Plan account. Even viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Brenton, she fails to establish enough evidence that a reasonable jury might conclude that this eight-hundred-dollar withdrawal from her Plan account was anything more than a mistake by the Employee Fiduciary, who was attempting to restore the account to its proper balance. Considering Brenton eventually reached an agreement with the Employee Fiduciary regarding the amount of money that was overdrawn from Brenton's\n    account, it is unclear how Brenton believes that the Kirby breached a fiduciary duty and caused a loss to the Plan. Nevertheless, when a court needs to fill in the details of ERISA fiduciary duties or decide how to review fiduciary actions, it should turn to trust law.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Leckey\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3705996\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/501/212/#p225\">\n     501 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    223 (citing\n    <em>\n     Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v.

Brenton asks us to find that a loss to the Plan occurred merely because the balance of her Plan account was temporarily below its proper balance.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    (Doc. 38, at 33) (\"Moreover, Brenton's account sustained a loss when on October 30, 2015, the Kirby directed that too much money be transferred out of it.\"). However, the most generous reading of the facts would not allow a reasonable fact-finder to find that this withdrawal of excess funds rose to the level of negligence. Thus, the court finds that Brenton has failed to sufficiently establish a\n    <em>\n     prima facie\n    </em>\n    claim of breach of fiduciary duty by failing to establish a loss to the Plan.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Considering the foregoing, summary judgment shall be entered in Kirby's favor concerning the breach of fiduciary duty claim.
