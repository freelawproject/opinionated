Ingram, United States Magistrate Judge\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On October 30, 2018, this\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   civil rights case was consolidated with case\n   number 0:18-CV-38-HRW. D.E. 20. The matters had already been referred to the undersigned to issue a recommended disposition. D.E. 10. The operative complaints are Docket Entry # 1 in this case and Docket Entries # 1 and # 5 in 0:18-CV-38-HRW. Before the Court are three motions filed by Defendants. The first is a motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute. D.E. 21. The second is a motion \"to deem requests for admissions admitted and for summary judgment based on those admissions.\" D.E. 22. The third is a motion for summary judgment, accompanied by a memorandum and affidavit. D.E. 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As District Judge Wilhoit previously explained (D.E. 4 at 2), Plaintiff Eric Anthony Johnson essentially raises five claims in these three complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   First, Johnson alleges that, on February 12, 2018, four fellow-inmates at the Boyd County Detention Center \"jumped\" him and \"kicked out\" his teeth. D.E. 1 at 2. He alleges four prison officers failed to protect him from the assault. Johnson acknowledges he was taken to a hospital that day but claims that severe headaches and pain and infection in his mouth have persisted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He requests $ 150,000 in compensatory damages from each of the four officers, plus $ 75,000 from each in punitive damages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Second, Johnson claims he \"was sexually assaulted by several inmates\" in October 2017, and prison officials displayed deliberate indifference to that situation. 0:18-CV-38, D.E. 1; D.E. 5 at 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Johnson's third claim is that, over several months, a registered nurse at the prison failed to provide him with medication to treat his mental health problems, causing him to see things, hear voices, and suffer from paranoia. 0:18-CV-38, D.E. 1; D.E. 5 at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The fourth claim is that there were unclean and unsanitary conditions at the prison, including black mold, which caused him emotional distress and breathing problems.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   D.E. 1; D.E. 5 at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The fifth claim is that a prison officer \"threatened\" him in November 2017, causing him to fear for his life.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   D.E. 5 at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On the latter four claims, Johnson seeks $ 200,000 in compensatory damages (plus future \"longterm health care costs\"), $ 100,000 in punitive damages, and $ 250 per day \"spent under these conditions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Johnson filed a notice of address change in August 2018 after his release from jail. D.E. 17. But he failed to timely respond to the motion to consolidate in October and to the three pending dispositive motions that the Court now considers. As Joint Local Civil Rule 7.1(c) warns, \"Failure to timely respond to a motion may be grounds for granting the motion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   First, Defendants move for dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b). D.E. 21. That rule states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    (b) Involuntary Dismissal; Effect.\n   </strong>\n   If the plaintiff fails to prosecute or to comply with these rules or a court order, a defendant may move to dismiss the action or any claim against it. Unless the dismissal order states otherwise, a dismissal under this subdivision (b) ... operates as an adjudication on the merits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b). The Sixth Circuit has identified four factors to evaluate a District Court's dismissal for failure to prosecute:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (1) whether the party's failure is due to willfulness, bad faith, or fault; (2) whether the adversary was prejudiced by the dismissed party's conduct; (3) whether the dismissed party was warned that failure to cooperate could lead to dismissal; and (4) whether less drastic\n   sanctions were imposed or considered before dismissal of the action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Carpenter v. City of Flint\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4066316\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/723/700/#p704\">\n    723 F.3d 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 704 (6th Cir. 2013) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Mulbah v. Detroit Bd. of Educ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9496481\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/261/586/#p589\">\n    261 F.3d 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 589 (6th Cir. 2001). These factors weigh against dismissal for failure to prosecute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The first factor \"requires a clear record of delay or contumacious conduct,\" meaning \"behavior that is perverse in resisting authority and 'stubbornly disobedient.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9496481\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/261/586/#p589\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9496481\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/261/586/#p589\">\n    at 704-05\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). The plaintiff's conduct must display either an intent to thwart judicial proceedings or a reckless disregard for the effect of his conduct on those proceedings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9496481\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/261/586/#p589\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9496481\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/261/586/#p589\">\n    at 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Concerning the second factor, a defendant is prejudiced by a plaintiff's dilatory conduct if the defendant is required to waste time, money, and effort in pursuit of cooperation which the plaintiff was legally obligated to provide.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9496481\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/261/586/#p589\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9496481\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/261/586/#p589\">\n    at 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   According to Defendants, they propounded discovery on June 12, 2018, including interrogatories, requests for admissions, and requests for production of documents. D.E. 21 at 2. Johnson filed limited responses in the record, including signed release forms for employment and medical records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.E. 16; 0:18-CV-38, D.E. 18. But no discovery responses were sent by mail, and Johnson never responded to the requests for admissions. D.E. 21 at 2. Defendants argue they \"have been prejudiced by Plaintiff's failure and refusal to answer virtually any discovery regarding Defendants['] claims and at this stage of the litigation there are no less drastic sanctions which may be imposed absent reopening discovery[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Defendants do not specify whether they seek dismissal with or without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court cannot recommend dismissal with prejudice on these grounds. First, the record does not rise to the level of clear delay or contumacious conduct. Defendants could have taken other, less drastic, steps before moving for dismissal. The Court has not yet had an opportunity to order Johnson to comply with his discovery obligations; it could be that he would have done so if given a clear directive. Johnson's incomplete discovery responses could have resulted from an innocent oversight or misunderstanding. The record does not indicate an intent to thwart judicial proceedings or a reckless disregard for the effect of Johnson's conduct on those proceedings. Johnson also has not been warned by the Court that his incomplete discovery responses could result in dismissal. The first and third Rule 41(b) factors thus weigh against dismissal with prejudice. So does the fourth factor, which considers whether less drastic sanctions could be imposed. Here, as Defendants note, discovery could be reopened. Additionally, the case could be dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The only factor that might weigh in favor of dismissal with prejudice is the second, which considers prejudice to Defendants. If Johnson has indeed abandoned this case (which is not clear), then Defendants have expended significant unnecessary resources in defending the case. On the other hand, Johnson did provide some discovery responses (albeit incomplete ones that were not mailed to Defendants). And he noticed a change of address in August 2018. The Court has already noted that, under Joint Local Civil Rule 7.1(c), failure to respond to a motion may be grounds for granting the motion. But, in the current posture, the Sixth Circuit's four-factor test controls. And those factors, considered together, weigh against dismissal with prejudice. Because the Court will recommend granting summary judgment in favor of Defendants, it is not necessary to delve further into the appropriate remedy for Johnson's failure to prosecute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendants' second and third motions operate in tandem. The second motion concerns Johnson's failure to respond to requests for admissions. D.E. 22. Defendants argue that the admissions should be deemed admitted. Once this is done, Defendants argue, there are no disputes of material fact and Defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. Accordingly, the second motion asks that the admissions be deemed conclusively established.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendants' third motion more fully fleshes out how Johnson's claims fail because of his failure to deny the requests for admissions. D.E. 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 36(a)(3) states: \"\n   <strong>\n    (3)\n    <em>\n     Time to Respond; Effect of Not Responding.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   A matter is admitted unless, within 30 days after being served, the party to whom the request is directed serves on the requesting party a written answer or objection addressed to the matter and signed by the party or its attorney....\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 36(a)(3). Further, Rule 36(b) states, \"A matter admitted under this rule is conclusively established unless the court, on motion, permits the admission to be withdrawn or amended....\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Rule 36 permits one party to request admissions as to a broad range of matters by another party, including ultimate facts and the application of law to fact.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Petroff-Kline\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3382203\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/557/285/#p293\">\n    557 F.3d 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 293 (6th Cir. 2009). By operation of law, \"[a] matter\n   <em>\n    is admitted unless\n   </em>\n   , within 30 days after being served, the party to whom the request is directed serves on the requesting party a written answer or objection addressed to the matter and signed by the party or its attorney.\" Fed.

Johnson has not moved under Rule 36 to withdraw or amend the admissions. Nor has he responded to the motion for summary judgment.

D.E. 23-1 at 9.

D.E. 23-1 at 9. To succeed on an Eighth Amendment claim related to a prisoner's medical treatment, the prisoner must prove that the prison officials unnecessarily and wantonly inflicted pain by acting with deliberate indifference toward the prisoner's serious medical needs.\n   <em>\n    Estelle v.

Ky. Sept. 4, 2007). To prove a deliberate indifference claim, the plaintiff must establish both an objective element\n   (that the medical condition was sufficiently serious) and a subjective element (that prison officials knew of, but consciously disregarded, a substantial risk of harm to the plaintiff's health).\n   <em>\n    Blackmore v. Kalamazoo Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9143103\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/390/890/#p895\">\n    390 F.3d 890\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 895 (6th Cir. 2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Here, Johnson has admitted that he \"received appropriate care and treatment to any and all medical complaints that he has incurred during the time he has been incarcerated at Boyd County Detention Center.\" D.E. 22-1 at 1; D.E. 22-2 at 1. This admission prevents Johnson from proving his allegations that (1) a nurse withheld important medications, (2) Johnson did not receive proper medical treatment following the February 2018 attack or the October 2017 sexual assault, and that (3) deliberate indifference by prison officers led to hazardously unsanitary conditions in his cell. Thus, Johnson's admissions provide a basis for granting summary judgment to defendants on these aspects of his complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Third, Defendants argue that Johnson's admissions prevent him from proving any other civil rights claim. D.E. 23-1 at 13. A claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   requires a showing that the named defendants personally violated the plaintiff's rights. A supervisory official's failure to supervise, control, or train the offending individual is not actionable, unless the supervisor either encouraged the specific incident of misconduct or in some other way directly participated in it.\n   <em>\n    Poe v. Haydon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10543181\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/853/418/#p429\">\n    853 F.2d 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 429 (6th Cir. 1988).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Here, Johnson has admitted that the named defendants \"responded appropriately to the February 12, 2018, incident[.]\" D.E. 22-1 at 1. This forecloses a verdict in his favor on his first claim concerning prison officials' response to the alleged assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   As a final matter, Johnson's fifth claim appears to have been overlooked to some extent. In his longer complaint in the 0:18-CV-38 case, Johnson names Deputy Jailer John Hale among the defendants. 0:18-CV-38-HRW, D.E. 5 at 1. Hale is subject of what Judge Wilhoit described as the fifth claim, that \"Johnson claimed a prison officer threatened him months ago.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10543181\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/853/418/#p429\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   D.E. 4 at 2. It appears that Hale's name was left out of Judge Wilhoit's order and no service packet was sent to him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Thus, Hale has not been listed as a Defendant in this case. The requests for admissions likewise make no reference to Hale or the alleged incident where he threatened Johnson. D.E. 22-2 at 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Nevertheless, Johnson has taken no steps to correct this omission. And his admissions are broad enough to foreclose relief against Deputy Jailer Hale, even if he had appeared in this matter. As previously discussed, Johnson admits that he has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and that he has no facts or law to support his claims. Accordingly, his fifth claim fails as well, and Defendants are entitled to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Based on the foregoing analysis, the undersigned\n   <strong>\n    RECOMMENDS\n   </strong>\n   that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   (1) Defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute (D.E. 21) be\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   (2) Defendants' motion to deem requests for admissions admitted (D.E. 22) be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   (3) Defendants' motion for summary judgment (D.E. 23) be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to each of Johnson's claims based on his admissions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Any objection to this recommendation must be asserted in response to this Report\n   &amp; Recommendation.
