In March 2017, H &amp; S Club Omaha, Inc., executed a three-year lease for the property at 7301 Farnam Street in Omaha and opened a private-member establishment called Club Omaha. Club Omaha offers live nude dancing as its primary form of entertainment, and although Club Omaha never sold or otherwise provided alcohol to its members, it permitted members to bring in their own alcohol for consumption prior to the enactment of the legislation described below. Club Omaha's membership includes persons under the age of twenty-one. Plaintiffs Midwest Girls Club and Meltech, Inc., separately owned and operated similar establishments in other Nebraska municipalities outside of Omaha, but those clubs are no longer in operation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Before H &amp; S Club Omaha, Inc., executed its lease in March 2017, Plaintiffs' counsel exchanged emails with the Omaha City Attorney's office regarding state and local laws applicable to \"sexually oriented business[es]\" and businesses which permit customers to bring in their own alcohol for consumption.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2, Page ID 279. Plaintiffs alleged that in these email communications, City Defendants Paul Kratz, the Omaha City Attorney, and William Acosta-Trejo, an Assistant City Attorney, \"gave Plaintiffs consent to open Club Omaha[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (alleging email communications occurred on October 25, 2016, October 31, 2016, and January 30, 2017, and alleging the content of the October 31, 2016, email).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 18, 2018, the Nebraska Legislature passed L.B. 1120, which amended the Nebraska Liquor Control Act (NLCA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Neb.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2053-101\">\n    Neb.

Sess. (2018). A bottle club is any \"operation ... keeping and maintaining premises where\n   persons who have made their own purchases of alcoholic liquor congregate for the express purpose of consuming alcoholic liquor upon the payment of a fee or other consideration.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Neb.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2053-103.47\">\n    Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 53-103.47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs filed a complaint in the District Court for Lancaster County, Nebraska, on July 3, 2018, and sought to enjoin enforcement of L.B. 1120, which took effect on July 19, 2018. Plaintiffs claimed L.B. 1120 violated several provisions of the U.S. and Nebraska Constitutions and that Club Omaha did not constitute a bottle club. The Lancaster County District Court\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (State Court) dismissed Plaintiffs' amended complaint on July 18, 2018, finding Plaintiffs' claims against the State of Nebraska were barred by Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity and that their claims for declaratory and injunctive relief failed to state claims for relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs appealed the State Court's judgment to the Nebraska Court of Appeals, and that appeal is currently pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 14, 2018, the Omaha City Council passed Ordinance # 41532 (the Bottle Club Ordinance), which amended several sections\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   of Chapter 15 of the Omaha Municipal Code-titled Liquors-to make those sections applicable to bottle clubs, specifically. Omaha, NE, Municipal Code \u00a7 15-1\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   As amended by the Bottle Club Ordinance, \u00a7 15-42 permits, but does not require, the city council to revoke a bottle club license if the licensee offers live nude dancing on the licensed premises. Previously, on May 16, 2017, the Omaha City Council also passed Ordinance # 41153 (the Nuisance Ordinance), which amended \u00a7\u00a7 18-90 and 18-91 of Chapter 18 of the Omaha Municipal Code-titled Nuisances-to make them applicable to businesses \"where alcoholic liquor is served or consumed while viewing either a live or video performance....\" Section 18-91 requires such businesses, as well as those engaged in the retail sale of alcoholic liquors, to comply with listed \"nuisance prevention standards.\" Omaha, NE, Municipal Code \u00a7 18-91(a). Accordingly, the effect of the Bottle Club Ordinance and the Nuisance Ordinance (collectively, the Ordinances) was to expand the application of certain, already-existing sections of Chapter 15 and Chapter 18 of the Omaha Municipal Code to bottle clubs and businesses where alcoholic liquor is served or consumed by patrons viewing either a live or video performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 21, 2018, Harrington and four women stood at the intersection of 72nd and Dodge Streets in Omaha holding signs that read \"Honk if you [heart] boobs.\" The women wore only flesh-colored g-strings and areola pasties, and Harrington wore only underwear. They engaged in this conduct to protest state and municipal laws regulating Club Omaha's business. Police officers with the Omaha Police Department (OPD) arrived at the scene and Defendant Fender, an OPD officer, explained to Harrington that \"our command is possibly looking at citing everyone that is involved in this for lewd conduct and indecent exposure ... If our Command says to do it we're going to do it.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 86, ECF No. 54, Page ID 289. Harrington and the other four protesters stopped protesting and walked back to Club Omaha. Fender and other unnamed OPD officers\n   followed Harrington and the women back to Club Omaha, \"walked up the entry stairs of [the] Club Omaha [building], opened the outer door, and occupied the curtilage of the building.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Neb.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2053-103.47\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Neb.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2053-103.47\">\n    \u00b6 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Page ID 291.

Kratz and Acosta-Trejo made no representations or promises to Plaintiffs or their counsel regarding future legislation, they only represented their present understanding of state and local law. To the extent Plaintiffs relied on those representations as a promise that they could operate Club Omaha in the manner they desired for the duration of their three-year lease notwithstanding any future legislation or regulations, no such promise was made and any reliance upon such a promise would be unreasonable.
