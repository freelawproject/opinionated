Both ballot initiatives proposed identical ordinances, which essentially decriminalized marijuana possession by reducing criminal fines to $0, removing all consequences related to drivers' licenses, and reducing court costs to $0. Plaintiffs acquired the necessary number of signatures and submitted the ballot initiatives to the Board. The Board's minutes state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Staff presented a list of ballot issues for the November 6, 2018 ballot. Denise Smith, Chief Assistant Prosecutor addressed questions about two initiative petitions regarding marijuana penalties filed for Garrettsville Village and Windham Village. Staff reported that both initiative petitions had a sufficient number of valid elector signatures. Both initiative petitions have identical language and seek to decriminalize marijuana by proving for no monetary fines, no license suspension and no court costs for misdemeanor marijuana offenses. Denise indicated that the Prosecutor's Office will not sign off on the ballot language and does not believe the initiative petitions are appropriate for the ballot because the initiatives are administrative in nature, rather than legislative. Administrative actions are not appropriate for initiative petitions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Denise indicated that the decision is ultimately up to the Board.

The $0 court costs is administrative in nature and is an impingement on the judicial function by a legislature.

In the ballot initiative process, however, the State of Ohio has not provided Plaintiffs an adequate review process. Instead, the gatekeeping function enables a board of elections-an executive body-to make legal determinations without providing denied petitioners a right to review. The only possibility of review requires an aggrieved petitioner to convince a court of appeals or the Supreme Court of Ohio to exercise its discretion under heightened standards.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs contend that the refusal of the Board to certify a vote on the legislation without a right to review by a judicial body violates Plaintiffs' constitutionally protected liberty interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   No doubt, Ohio has strong interests in ensuring its elections are run fairly and efficiently.\n   <em>\n    Buckley v.

Ohio also has a strong interest in placing on the ballot only such proposed legislation as would be lawful as municipal legislation under Ohio Const. Art. XVIII, Sec. 3. Allowing votes on matters unlawful or unenforceable on their face could erode public confidence in Ohio's entire initiative process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Recognizing those interests, the Court finds no legitimate state interests in withholding an adequate legal remedy for petitioners denied ballot access by a board of elections. \"Although a state has a wide scope in regulating the franchise, it is not permitted to adopt any standard it desires, but it is limited by the strictures of the federal and state constitutions....\" 25 Am. Jur. 2d Elections \u00a7 98. Given the availability of mandamus relief is extraordinary and only exercised when the law does not otherwise provide an adequate remedy, the high burden on petitioners to prove entitlement to an extraordinary remedy is no substitute for\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the denial of a constitutionally protected liberty interest. Therefore, the Court finds Plaintiffs prevail on their constitutional challenge to Ohio's ballot initiative process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In conclusion, the Court\n   <strong>\n    REINSTATES\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    CONVERTS\n   </strong>\n   to permanent injunction the preliminary injunctive relief granted in its Opinion and Order issued on September 19, 2018.
