Security Report [67-8] at 1-2. Smith's shift began at 2:00 p.m. that day and would have ended at 9:00 p.m. Smith Dep. [70-2] at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   According to Ingalls security officer Shaun Blaine (\"Blaine\"), around 9:00 p.m. that evening he was making rounds checking the \"red zone parking lot\" with a flashlight, when he observed \"two speed loaders for a revolver\" in plain view inside Smith's van. Security Report [67-8] at 1-2. Blaine notified his supervisor, Captain Alfred Lewis, who joined him at the scene and confirmed the presence of the speed loaders.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Captain Lewis radioed for backup and for a check of the vehicle's tag, which resulted in Smith being identified as the owner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Officers James Cosman (\"Cosman\") and Jonathan Daffron (\"Daffron\") were dispatched to retrieve Smith and escort him to his vehicle so that a thorough search could be conducted in Smith's presence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When Smith arrived, he unlocked his van and Cosman and Daffron searched for any contraband prohibited under Ingalls' policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In addition to the two speed loaders, which were filled with hollow point bullets, a revolver loaded with five rounds of hollow point bullets was also discovered.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Another item located during the search was identified by Ingalls as a \"Billy club/pipe,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , but Smith maintains it was simply a \"tire checker,\" Smith Depo. [70-2] at 3. The retrieved items were placed on the hood of Smith's van, photographed, and then returned to the rear of the van, out of Smith's reach. Security Report [67-8] at 1-2. Smith was instructed to leave the premises and not to return until directed to do so by Ingalls' Labor Relations Department.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On May 9, 2016, Smith was asked to return to Ingalls to meet with Lance Eubanks (\"Eubanks\"), a labor relations representative. Eubanks Decl. [67-12] at 1-2. Prior to attending the meeting with Eubanks, Smith met with his union representative, J.D. Mergenshroer, and gave him a copy of the Mississippi Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Swindol v. Aurora Flight Sciences Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794115\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/194/847/\">\n    194 So.3d 847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 2016). Mergenshroer Dep. [70-12] at 3. When Smith and Mergenshroer met with Eubanks, Mergenshroer provided a copy of\n   <em>\n    Swindol\n   </em>\n   to Eubanks and suggested that Smith should not be fired based upon the Mississippi Supreme Court's interpretation of Mississippi Code \u00a7 45-9-55. Eubanks Decl. [67-12] at 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Eubanks consulted with his manager, Mark Fredrick (\"Fredrick\"), and Fredrick's manager, Director of Labor Relations Tony Skelton, who instructed Eubanks to proceed with the termination of Smith because the \"legal department was aware of the ruling and had confirmed that\n   the company had the legal right to enforce its prohibition of firearms on company parking lots because public access to them was restricted.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794115\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/194/847/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Smith was terminated on May 9, 2016.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794115\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/194/847/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; Termination Memo.

Am. Compl. [20] at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Ingalls has filed a Motion for Summary Judgment [67] arguing that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Smith's claims for wrongful discharge and punitive damages. Mem. in Supp. [68] at 1. Ingalls contends that its policy prohibiting firearms in its parking lots is enforceable because Ingalls \"restricts public access with no-trespassing signs, security patrols, and closed circuit cameras monitored in a central security station,\" which complies with the mandate of Mississippi Code \u00a7 45-9-55(2), such that Ingalls could terminate Smith for having a firearm in his van in the parking lot.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794115\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/194/847/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Ingalls asserts that its policy prohibiting weapons is communicated to its employees during their orientation, through articles in the shipyard newspaper, and by way of signs posted at the entrances of all parking lots which state that weapons are prohibited and that vehicles are subject to search.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Ingalls further maintains that Smith was properly terminated for violating this policy because he had weapons including \"a handgun, ammunition[,] and a pipe\" in his van on shipyard property. Eubanks Decl. [67-12] at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Alternatively, Ingalls seeks summary judgment on its affirmative defense that Smith failed to mitigate his damages such that he should not receive back pay after November 2016, when Smith refused to return to work. Mem. in Supp. [68] at 24-25. Ingalls posits that Smith's punitive damages claim should be dismissed because, in terminating Smith for having a weapon in his van, Ingalls relied upon advice of its counsel that \"Ingalls is entitled to enforce its firearms prohibition because it restricts public access to its parking lots.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8, 23-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Smith responds that around March or April 2016 he learned that Mississippi law permitted him to have a firearm in his vehicle at work because the parking lot was not restricted. Mem. in Opp'n. [71] at 3. He then began keeping a handgun in his vehicle for his own safety.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Smith asserts that Ingalls' parking lots did not qualify as restricted under the statute because they did not have a physical barrier or a security gate at the entrances,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20, and argues that he was unlawfully terminated for having a firearm in his van, in violation of Mississippi Code \u00a7 45-9-55(2),\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-24. Smith further contends that he is entitled to an award of punitive damages given that Mergenshroer supplied Eubanks with a copy of the Mississippi Supreme Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Swindol v. Aurora Flight Sciences Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794115\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/194/847/\">\n    194 So.3d 847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 2016), prior to his termination.

Code \u00a7 45-9-55(2). Ingalls contends that its policy is enforceable because it \"restricts public access with no-trespassing signs, security patrols, and closed circuit cameras monitored in a central security station.\" Mem. in Supp. [68] at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Plaintiff counters that, at the time he was terminated, Ingalls' parking lot was not properly restricted within the meaning of the statute because anyone could drive into the parking lot from a public road, there were no gates, and the guard shack was never occupied. Mem. in Opp'n [71] at 19-20. Smith testified in his deposition that, at the time of his termination, the signs at the entrances were \"faded, black and white,\" Smith Depo. [70-2] at 10, that he never saw security patrolling the parking lot,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16, and that he never saw cameras in the parking lots,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. Mergenshroer testified that at the time of Smith's termination the signs at the entrances to the parking lot were rusty, \"falling down\" and faded, and that new signs were put up following Smith's termination. Mergenshroer Depo. [70-12] at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   After a thorough review of the record before it, the Court finds that Ingalls has not carried its burden of demonstrating that no genuine dispute of material fact exists regarding what specific security measures Ingalls actually had in place and whether they were effective to properly restrict the parking lot under Mississippi law, or to place Smith on notice that the parking lot was restricted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Because the Court is sitting in diversity, it begins with the Mississippi Supreme Court's admonition in\n   <em>\n    Swindol\n   </em>\n   that the employment at will doctrine \"must yield to express legislative action and/or prohibitions found in federal or state law.\"\n   <em>\n    Swindol\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794115\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/194/847/\">\n    194 So.3d at 855\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This includes the maxim that private employers may not establish policies that have the effect of prohibiting a person from transporting a firearm in a locked vehicle in any parking lot,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Mississippi Code \u00a7 45-9-55(1), subject to the exception to this general rule found at Mississippi Code \u00a7 45-9-55(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Ingalls does not contend that the parking lot is gated, or that it has manned, controlled access to its parking lots. In fact, the Declaration [67-3] of Rick Graham, Ingalls Director of Security, states that Ingalls has determined that erecting gates would not be a \"practical or effective means of restricting general public access to its parking lots\" and that erecting security stations at all of the parking lot entrances and \"staffing them around the clock would be cost prohibitive.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Graham Decl. [67-3] at 3-4. Rather, Ingalls contends that there were no trespassing signs located at each entrance to its parking lots and closed circuit cameras monitoring the parking lots. Ingalls also contends that it had roving security patrols and that a central security station monitored all closed circuit cameras.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Smith and Mergenshroer have testified, however, that the signs were rusted, falling down, and essentially not legible or sufficient to place an individual on notice of the parking lots' restrictions. Smith also testified that he never saw cameras or security guards patrolling the parking lots. At this summary judgment stage, the Court must resolve all factual disputes in Smith's favor and may not \"weigh the evidence\" or make \"credibility determinations.\"\n   <em>\n    Heinsohn v. Carabin &amp; Shaw\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4351759\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/832/224/#p245\">\n    832 F.3d 224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 245-46 (5th Cir. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In addition, Smith appears to argue in his brief that Ingalls' policy is not enforceable. In this regard, the Court is of the view that this case also presents issues of fact regarding whether Ingalls' parking lot policy, as applied by Ingalls, infringes on the rights of its employees under state law. As Ingalls indicates in its submissions, it employs thousands of individuals, many of whom presumably reside distances away from the shipyard, requiring them to commute long distances on public roads to and from work. Indeed, the record reflects that Smith resides in Mobile, Alabama, and commuted from there to Ingalls Shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi, to work. Ingalls' policy as applied arguably has the effect of precluding its employees from having firearms in their vehicles during these commutes, which in some cases may be quite long.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , MISS. CODE \u00a7 97-37-1(2) ;\n   <em>\n    Swindol\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794115\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/194/847/\">\n    194 So.3d at 853-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Court is mindful that an employer may prohibit firearms within the workplace itself, but one relevant fact question not made clear in the present record is whether or not employees parking in the lots must next pass through a screened or controlled access point to gain access to the workplace itself. If so, this would appear to obviate the need to restrict firearms in vehicles parked in the parking lots, which by Ingalls' own admission do not require vehicles to pass through any screening before parking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In addition, because it is undisputed that vehicles are not searched or screened as they enter the parking lots, Ingalls would have no way of knowing that a firearm was present unless the employee left it sitting in plain view in the vehicle, which is what occurred in this case. Thus, when balanced against the potential for a violation of state law, the effectiveness of Ingalls' parking lot policy in achieving its stated goal of improving security seems questionable. At a minimum there are material fact questions for resolution at trial regarding whether Ingalls' policy, as applied by Ingalls in this case, resulted in Smith's wrongful termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Here, the Court finds that this conflicting evidence is substantial and creates a material question of fact for trial. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Smith as the nonmovant, Smith has produced sufficient evidence to create a jury question regarding whether Ingalls' parking lot qualified for the exception set forth at Mississippi Code \u00a7 45-9-55(2) at the time Smith was discharged, and whether he was wrongfully terminated. Summary judgment should be denied on this issue, and Smith's wrongful termination claim will proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Smith's claim for punitive damages/gross negligence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Ingalls contends that Smith's claim for punitive damages should be dismissed because\n   Ingalls relied in good faith upon the advice of counsel when it terminated Smith because no court had previously interpreted \u00a7 45-9-55(2).
