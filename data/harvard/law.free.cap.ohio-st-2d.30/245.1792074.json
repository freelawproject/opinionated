J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0K\">Appellant, Howard Sober, Inc., is engaged in the business of transporting new automobiles from Lansing, Michigan, to dealers in various states, including Ohio. These automobiles are transported by means of a \u201crig\u201d which is composed of two units\u2014a power unit and a carrying unit. The power unit is a motor vehicle which is capable of movement independently of the carrying unit. The carrying unit is incapable of movement without the power unit, and when both units are \u201ccoupled\u201d part of the weight of the canying unit and part of the weight of its load are transferred to the power unit by means of a \u201cfifth wheel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">Appellant uses two types of rigs in Ohio. Its \u201csix car rig\u201d has four axles\u2014two on the power unit and two on the carrying unit. The other, a \u2018 \u2018 seven car rig, \u2019 \u2019 has five axles\u2014three on the power unit and two on the carrying-unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">In determining its highway use tax liability for each mile traveled on a public highway in Ohio, appellant reported each of its six car rigs taxable at the rate of one and one-half cents per mile (R. C. 5728.06(C))<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and each of its seven car rig's taxable at the rate of two cents per mile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>(R. C. 5728.06(D)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Tax Commissioner and the Board of Tax Appeals both found that appellant\u2019s rigs were taxable at the rate of two and one-half cents per mile (R. 0. 5728.06(E) )<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> because they were \u201coperated as part of a commercial tandem. \u2019 \u2019 It is this finding which is disputed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The board found that the \u201c \u2018six car rig\u2019 is capable of hauling six automobiles\u2014one automobile is carried on top of the \u2018power unit\u2019 and the other five automobiles are carried on the \u2018carrying unit.\u2019 \u201d Likewise, the board also found that the \u201c \u2018seven car rig\u2019 is capable of hauling seven automobiles\u2014one automobile is carried on top of the cab of the power unit and one automobile is carried on the power unit directly behind the cab and over the two rear axles of the power unit and the other five automobiles are carried on the \u2018carrying unit.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">While the board found that the power units are capable of carrying automobiles without the carrying unit being attached, it concluded \u201cthis is never done in actual operation.\u201d However, the board did find that <em>\u201cthe \u2018power unit\u2019 does, in and of itself, carry automobiles.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Appellant contends that such finding is erroneous for the reason that \u201call the evidence showed conclusively that no power unit was ever <em>used </em>to transport property wholly on its own structure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">That contention is without merit. The record amply supports the board\u2019s finding that \u201cthe \u2018power unit\u2019 does, in and of itself, carry automobiles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">Appellant\u2019s first witness, its comptroller, testified as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">\u201cQ. [Referring to the six car rig] How many cars does this transport?</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>\u201cA. Six cars in total.

One on top.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-13\"><em>C ( </em>^ $=</p>\n<p id=\"b320-14\"><em>\u201cA. </em>The other one is * * * in back of the cab.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-15\"><em>(( </em>* <em>\u25a0\u00bb </em>*</p>\n<p id=\"b320-16\">\u201cQ. * * * how many autos * * * does the carrying unit hold?</p>\n<p id=\"b320-17\"><em>\u201cA. </em>0 * * five units.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-18\">When the power units are originally purchased they have no \u201cprovision\u201d for carrying any automobiles. It is only after special \u201cracks\u201d are added that they are equipped to carry the additional automobiles.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-19\">Appellant\u2019s second witness, the president of the company which manufactures the carrying units and the \u201cracks\u201d which support the additional automobiles, testified as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b320-20\"><em>\u2018 \u2018 Q. </em>[Referring to the six car rig] And the power unit * * * carries how many cars?</p>\n<p id=\"b320-21\">\u201cA. One,.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-22\">\u201cQ. [Referring to the seven car rig] And the power unit * * * carries how many?</p>\n<p id=\"b321-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>\u201cA. Two.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-3\">\u201cQ. Now, in each case, does the power unit bear the entire weight of the cars it carries?</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">From that testimony, the board concluded that appellant\u2019s power units, in and of themselves, carry automobiles, and concluded further that those automobiles are carried wholly on the power unit\u2019s own structure. Based on those conclusions, the board found that appellant\u2019s power units were properly classified as \u201ccommercial cars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Appellant contends, however, that its power units should be classified as \u201ccommercial tractors\u201d as defined by R. C. 5728.01(C). In support of its contention, appellant argues that its power units have no provision for carrying loads independently of the carrying units because the power unit cannot be loaded or unloaded without the carrying unit being attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">R. C. 5728.01(B) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">\u201c \u2018Commercial ear\u2019 means any motor vehicle used for transporting property, wholly on its own structure on a public highway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">R. C. 5728.01(C) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">\u201c \u2018Commercial tractor\u2019 means any motor vehicle designed and used to propel or draw a trailer or semi-trailer or both * * * <em>without having any provision for carrying loads independently of such trailer or </em>semi-trailer.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b321-11\">Preliminary steps to actual transportation are not a determining factor under either R. C. 5728.01(B) or 5728.-01(C). Both sections contemplate actual use and transportation. Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the only method of loading or unloading the power units is by means of the carrying units, that does not dispel the fact that, once loaded, the power units are capable, in and of themselves, of transporting the automobiles without the carrying units attached.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6 The significant factor is that whether or not the earry<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>ing unit is attached, the power units do have a provision for carrying loads independently of the carrying unit, and such i&gt;ower units are used for transporting property wholly on their own structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Nor does R. C. 5728.01(B) require that all the property transpoi\u2019ted he transported wholly on the power unit\u2019s own structure. The only requisite determination is whether the power unit is \u201cused for transporting [any] property, wholly on its own structure.\u201d It is irrelevant to that determination that the power unit can only be loaded or unloaded by means of a carrying unit, or that the power unit is always used with the carrying unit attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">It is because of the unique use which appellant makes of its power units that their legal status is properly characterized as \u201ccommercial cars.\u201d When the power units are originally purchased they have no provision for carrying automobiles independently of the carrying unit. Such \u201cprovision\u201d is purchased and attached to the power units for the express purpose of carrying additional cars. Without it, appellant\u2019s rigs are capable of transporting only five automobiles\u2014all on the carrying unit alone. The six car rig becomes such only because of the <em>addition to the power unit </em>of a rack above the cab. The seven car rig becomes such only because of the <em>addition to the power unit </em>of a \"nek above the cab and a second rack behind the cab <em>hut resting on its frame. </em>Accordingly, this court agrees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>with the board that each of appellant\u2019s power units is a \u201ccommercial car\u201d as defined by R. C. 5728.01(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">Appellant contends also that the board erred in finding that its carrying units are \u201ctrailers,\u201d within the meaning of R. C. 5728.01(D), rather than \u201csemi-trailers\u201d as defined by R. C. 5728.01(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">R. C. 5728.01(D) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">\u201c \u2018Trailer\u2019 means everything on wheels which is not self-propelled * * * used for carrying property wholly on its own structure and for being drawn by a motor vehicle on a public highway # \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">R. C. 5728.01(E) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">\u201c \u2018Semi-trailer\u2019 means everything on wheels which is not self-propelled * * * designed and used for carrying property on a public highway when being propelled or drawn <em>by a commercial tractor </em>when part of its own weight or the weight of its load, or both, rest upon and is carried by a <em>commercial </em>tractor.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">Admittedly, the record reveals that part of the weight of the carrying unit and part of the weight of its load rest upon and are carried by appellant\u2019s power unit. Were that the only factor to be considered in R. C. 5728.01(E), then appellant\u2019s carrying units would be properly classified as semi-trailers. However, by the use of the words \u201ccommercial tractor\u201d it is clear that R. C. 5728.01(E) contemplates a carrying unit which is propelled or drawn by a power unit which has no provision for carrying loads independently of such carrying unit. Again, because of the unique method of transporting its cargo, appellant has changed what would have been the legal status of its power units as commercial tractors to commercial cars, and it has likewise changed what would have been the legal status of its carrying units as semi-trailers to trailers. Thus, this court agrees with the board that appellant\u2019s carrying units are trailers as defined by R. C. 5728.01(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">Finding that appellant\u2019s power units are commercial cars, and finding further that its carrying units are trailers, this court finds, as did the board, that each of appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>lant\u2019s rigs is a \u201ccommercial tandem\u201d as defined by R. C. 5728.01(F).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">A commercial tandem is a power unit which is used for transporting property wholly on its own structure and a carrying unit used for transporting property wholly on its own structure. It may also be a power unit which has no provision for carrying loads independently of the carrying unit, and a carrying unit used for carrying property when part of its own weight and/or part of the weight of its load is transferred to the power unit, plus a carrying unit used for carrying property wholly on its own structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">R. C. 5728.06(E) taxes at the maximum rate \u201ceach commercial car or commercial tractor operated as part of a commercial tandem with four or more axles.\u201d Simply stated, R. C. 5728.06(E) taxes at the maximum rate those rigs which carry two \u201cloads\u201d which may be distributed between one power unit and one carrying unit or between two carrying units.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Conversely, a \u201ccommercial tractor combination\u201d is a power unit which has no provision for carrying loads independently of the carrying unit and a carrying unit used for carrying property when part of its own weight and/or part of the weight of its load is transferred to the power unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">R. C. 5728.06(B), 5728.06(C) and 5728.06(D) tax, at varying rates, and depending on the number of axles, those rigs which carry only a \u201csingle load\u201d as opposed to a commercial tandem which carries \u201ctwo loads.\u201d Clearly then, appellant\u2019s rigs cannot be appropriately classified as commercial tractor combinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">Thus, because appellant\u2019s rigs carry two \u201cloads\u201d distributed between the power unit and one carrying unit, and because its rigs have four or more axles, the Tax Commissioner and the board properly assessed appellant under R. C. 5728.06(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Accordingly, the finding of the board that appellant\u2019s six and seven car rigs are commercial cars operated as part of a commercial tandem with four or more axles, and taxable at the rate of two and one-half cents per mile for each mile traveled on the public highways in Ohio, is neither unreasonable nor unlawful, and therefore the decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b325-5\">Schneider, Herbert, Corrigan, Stern, Leaoh and Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b318-12\">\u201cOne and one-lialf cents for each mile traveled * * * by a commercial tractor operated as a part of a commercial tractor combination With fopr pxlps,\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b319-11\">\u2018Two cents for each mile traveled * * * by a commercial tractor operated as a part of a commercial tractor combination with a total of five or more axles.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b319-12\">\u201cTwo and one-half cents for each mile traveled * * * by each commercial car or commercial tractor operated as part of a commercial tandem with four or more axles.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b320-23\">\"Q. * * * When you get a power unit, does it have one of these structures on the top so that you can carry an extra car?</p>\n<p id=\"b320-24\">\u201cA.
