C. 5713.08, providing that certain taxes \u201cmay be remitted by the auditor, with the consent of the board, \u2019 \u2019 permits only the remission of unpaid taxes; that the word \u201cremitted\u201d applies only to unpaid taxes and does not authorize a \u201crefund\u201d of taxes already paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>Appellant predicates much of its argument upon the assertion, independently of the provisions of R. C. 5713.-08, that such a refund would be authorized by R. C. 5703.-02(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">R. C. 5703.02 reads, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">\u201cThe Board of Tax Appeals shall exercise the following powers and perform the following duties of the .Department of Taxation;</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\"><em>i i </em># # #</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">\u201c(I) Exercise the authority provided by Section 5715.39 of the Revised Code relative to remitting taxes and penalties against real property found to have been illegally assessed or to have been assessed in consequence of the negligence or error of an officer required to perform a duty relating to the assessment of such property for taxation, or the levy or collection of such taxes * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">Essentially, it is the contention of appellant, as to the applicability of R. C. 5703.02, that the actions of the county auditor and the county treasurer constitute either acts of \u201cnegligence\u201d or of \u201cerror\u201d by \u201can officer required to perform a duty relating to the * * * collection of such taxes.\u201d Assuming such to be true, we nevertheless must conclude that R. C. 5703.02 is inapplicable to the situation here involved, in view of the fact that there has been no showing that the taxes in question were \u201cassessed in consequence of the negligence or error\u201d of such an officer. To the contrary, at the time of assessment the alleged negligence or error had not even taken place. Moreover, it is not and cannot be claimed that such taxes were \u201cillegally assessed,\u201d since, under the provisions of R. C. 5713.-08, property cannot be placed on the exempt list until approval by the Board of Tax Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">However, for the reasons hereinafter stated, we conclude that refund can be made herein under the authority of R. C. 5713.08.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-11\">So far as pertinent, this statute reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b76-12\">\u201c* # * The board shall not consider an application for exemption of property under such sections unless the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>plication has attached thereto a certificate or affidavit executed by the county treasurer certifying that taxes, assessments, and penalties levied and assessed against the property sought to be exempted have been paid in full to the date upon which the application for exemption is filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">\u201cTaxes and penalties, which have accrued after the property was first used for the exempt purpose, but in no case prior to the date of acquisition of title to said property by applicant, may be remitted by the auditor, with the consent of the board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">A careful examination of the literal language of the statute would indicate that the authority to remit taxes would extend back to the time when the property was first used for the exempt purpose, if the applicant had acquired title by such time. Payment, however, was required to be made \u201cin full to the date upon which the application for exemption is filed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Obviously the \u201cdate upon which the application for exemption is filed\u201d could never precede the date \u201cthe property was first used for the exempt purpose.\u201d Thus, a literal reading of the statute is indicative of a legislative intent that taxes so paid to the date of filing the application for exemption might be \u201cremitted\u201d back to the time the exempt use began, which wordd necessarily require a \u20181 refund. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">In <em>Ursuline Academy v. Board of Tax Appeals </em>(1943), 141 Ohio St. 563, this court, in effect, expanded the literal language of R. C. 5713.08 (then G. C. 5570-1), holding, in the first paragraph of the syllabus:</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">\u201cUnder the proviso in Section 5570-1, General Code, the Board of Tax Appeals has jurisdiction to consider an application for exemption from taxation where the application or evidence before the board discloses that the only unpaid taxes, penalties and interest due on the property sought to be exempted are such as may be remitted by the county auditor with the consent of the Board of Tax Appeals if the board consents to the exemption.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">This holding in <em>Ursuline Academy </em>was approved and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>followed in <em>Welfare Federation of Cleveland </em>v. <em>Glander </em>(1945), 146 Ohio St. 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The rationale of this holding appears to have been based upon the conclusion that it would be an unnecessary act to require the owner of property, otherwise subject to exemption and remission, to pay the taxes in full to the date upon which the application for exemption is filed, and then, under the authority to remit, have such taxes repaid or refunded.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The language of GL C. 5570-1 was essentially the same as that now contained in R. C. 5713.08. We quote from the opinion of Turner, J., in <em>Ursuline </em>Academy, at page 567:</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">\u201cThe record shows that the taxes have been paid up to and including the 1940 taxes but were delinquent for the 1941 taxes with a penalty on the first half of 1941.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">\u201cUnder the above quoted proviso of Section 5570-1, General Code, these taxes may be remitted by the county auditor with the consent of the Board of Tax Appeals if it be found that the premises in question were being used on tax lien day 1941 for an exempt purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">\u201cAs the county auditor had refused exemption in 1928 and in the application for exemption here under consideration had declined to make any recommendation for or against the exemption, the orderly procedure would necessarily be to have the right of exemption determined prior to the application to the county auditor for remission of the unpaid taxes. <em>If the Board of Tax Appeals consents to the exemption it would he unnecessary to require the unpaid taxes to he paid and then refunded. </em>The record discloses no unpaid assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">\u201cUnder the circumstances of this case, we hold that the Board of Tax Appeals had jurisdiction to consider the application for exemption.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">It will be noted that the <em>Ursuline Academy </em>case does not hold that taxes which would be subject to remission, if unpaid, cannot be refunded. To the contrary, it seems to assume that the <em>literal </em>language of the statute would require a payment, followed by a refund, and seems to as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>sume that such a refund would be authorized by the. language\u2014-\u201cmay be remitted by the county auditor, with the consent of the Board of Tax Appeals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The implied assumption by Judge Turner in <em>Ursuline Academy </em>that the power to remit would include the power to refund is fortified by the basic meaning of the word \u2018 \u2018 remit\u201d (re-back, + <em>mittere, </em>send). While this word, as is true with many words in the English language, has various shadings of meaning, its primary meaning is \u201cto send back.\u201d While it is often used as being synonymous with forgive or pardon, its meanings include \u201cput back into a previous position or condition\u201d and \u201cto transmit or send (money, etc.) to a person or place.\u201d <em>New Century Dictionary.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">We conclude that the provisions of E. C. 5713.08, providing that certain taxes and penalties \u201cmay be remitted by the auditor, with the consent of the board,\u201d include the power to refund taxes which accrued and were paid after the applicant acquired title and first used the property for the exempt purpose. This power, of course, is subject to the limitations contained in E. C. 5713.081 that on and after January 1, 1969, \u201cno application for real property exemption and tax remission shall be filed with, or considered by, the Board of Tax Appeals wherein, tax remission is requested for more than one tax year * *</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">For the reasons heretofore stated, the decision of .the Board of Tax Appeals is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the board for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">\n<em>Decision reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b79-9\">O\u2019Neill, C.
