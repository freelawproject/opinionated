C. 3773.22; and</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">(3) That if the statute be construed as prohibiting, without further legislative definition or judicial restriction, all disorderly conduct, the statute would be unconstitutionally vague and indefinite, and thus unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">So far as pertinent, R. C. 3773.22 reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">\u201cNo person shall be found in a state of intoxica ton or, being intoxicated, shall disturb the peace and good order, or shall conduct himself in a disorderly manner. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-12\">The trial court took the position that the provision, \u201cshall conduct himself in a disorderly manner,\u201d is a separate clause, under which a defendant might be convicted without proof of intoxication. We disagree. By reference to the legislative history<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the statute, and by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>applying the principle that where a criminal statute is ambiguous all doubts as to its interpretation must be resolved against the state and in favor of the accused,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we conclude that the language in question is not a separate and distinct clause of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">As construed by the trial court, the applicable language of the statute would read: \u201cNo person * * * shall conduct himself in a disorderly manner.\u201d We conclude that the proper reading of the applicable language of the statute is: \u201cNo person * * * being intoxicated * * * shall conduct himself in a disorderly manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">In reaching this conclusion, we are fully cognizant of the fact that such a legislative intent would have been clearer if the comma after the word \u201corder\u201d and the third \u201cshall\u201d of the sentence were removed. In such event, there 'would be no ambiguity and the pertinent language of the statute would read: \u201cNo person * * * being intoxicated, shall disturb the peace and s:ood order or conduct himself in a disorderly manner.\u201d We recognize that the presence of the comma<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the third \u201cshall\u201d tends toward <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>ambiguity, but by tbe application of tbe principle of strict statutory construction of criminal statutes, we conclude tbat the thrust of tbe particular statute, which defendant was charged with violating, is directed against tbe excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages, and tbat tbe <em>sine qua non </em>thereof is proof of intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Tracing tbe legislative history of tbe statute under consideration, we find tbat it was originally enacted in 1854 as section 5 of an Act \u201cto provide against tbe evils resulting from tbe sale of intoxicating liquors in the state of Ohio.\u201d 52 Ohio Laws 153. As such, and as amended in 1859 (56 Ohio Laws 173), it appeared in R. S. 6940, at wbicb time it read as follows: \u201cWhoever is found in a state of intoxication shall be fined five dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">It was later recodified as G-. 0. 13194, and, as amended in 1921 (109 Ohio Laws 232), read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">\u201cWhoever is found in a state of intoxication or whoever, being intoxicated, shall disturb tbe peace and good order, or shall conduct himself in a disorderly manner, shall be fined not less than five dollars nor more than one hundred dollars. A justice of tbe peace shall have final jurisdiction to bear and determine any prosecution arising under this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">Except for tbe change in tbe last sentence from \u201cjustice of tbe peace\u201d to \u201ccounty court,\u201d effective January 1, 1958 (127 Ohio Laws 1107), no change has been made in this statute since its 1921 amendment, except for reeodification as a part of tbe Revised Code, effective October 1, 1953.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">By tbe terms of R. C. 1.24, tbe General Assembly, in enacting the Act wbicb adopted tbe Revised Code, specifically declared its intent \u201cnot to change tbe law as heretofore expressed by tbe section or sections of tbe General Code in effect on the date of enactment of this Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">G. C. 13194 was a part of Chapter 17, entitled \u201cOffenses Relating to Intoxicating Liquors.\u201d By the terms of R. C. 1.24, tbe recodification of tbe statute under R. C. Chapter 3773, designated \u201cDisorderly conduct; Sunday <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>prohibitions,\u201d cannot be construed as changing the law as it existed prior to the 1953 recodification.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The pertinent language of Gr. C. 13194 was \u201cwhoever, being intoxicated, shall disturb the peace and good order, or shall conduct himself in a disorderly manner, shall be fined * # *. \u2019 \u2019 Although not an example of perfect English grammar, we think it clear that the words \u201cbeing intoxicated\u201d had reference to both the clause \u201cshall disturb the peace and good order\u201d and the clause \u201cshall conduct himself in a disorderly manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">In this connection, it might be observed that although the prosecution appears to concede that \u201cbeing intoxicated\u201d is a requirement for conviction of that portion of ft. C. 3773.22, which provides that a person shall not \u201cdisturb the peace and good order,\u201d apparently all parties concerned have overlooked the fact that such a charge was a part of the affidavit charging defendant with a violation of R. C. 3773.22. The charge was not merely that defendant did \u201cconduct himself in a disorderly manner,\u201d but, instead, was that he \u201cdid disturb the peace and good order of the community by conducting himself in a disorderly manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Concluding, as we have, that to constitute a violation of R. C. 3773.22, it is not sufficient merely to allege and prove that the defendant conducted himself in a disorderly manner, but that it must also be alleged and proved that defendant was intoxicated at such time, we do not reach the issues of whether, <em>if </em>the statute were construed as not requiring proof of intoxication, conviction could be had thereunder predicated upon the use of obscene language, or whether, in such event, the statute would be unconstitutionally vague and indefinite.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>For the reason, heretofore stated, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and the cause is remanded to the trial court with instructions to discharge the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b122-6\">O\u2019Neill, C.
