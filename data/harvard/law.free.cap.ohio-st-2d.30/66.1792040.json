The trial court itself conducted this part of the examination, stating to the veniremen :</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">\u201cLet me now, then, turn to this matter of your eligibility to serve as a jury in this case, which is the trial of a person charged with a capital offense. No one is eligible to serve on the jury who would not be able to render in a proper case a verdict which the facts and the law would require.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">\u201cThe indictment in this case charges the defendant with committing murder in the first degree, which under a statute provides that one found guilty of the offense charged is subject to the penalty of death unless mercy is recommended by the jury, and in that case the punishment would be imprisonment for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">\u201cI repeat, to be eligible to serve as a juror in this case one must be able to render and sign any proper verdict under the law which the facts of this case warrant. That is, one\u2019s opinions must not prevent him from rendering any proper verdict which under the alleged charge, if proved, would be a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree, which would mean punishment by death unless the jury by unanimous vote recommend mercy, which would reduce the punishment to imprisonment for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">\u201cThis is a kind of a test which you and only you can decide. In other words, your eligibility to serve under this test is a matter of your searching your own mind and conscience and judgment. If there is any reason of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>religion, predetermined conviction, or fixed opinion which would preclude you from rendering any appropriate verdict in this case, including finding that the defendant was guilty of the capital charge of murder in the first degree, Avhich would mean punishment with death if the facts warranted such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">\u201cAgain, I repeat, you are the only one who can decide if your opinions would preclude or prevent you from finding the accused guilty of an offense punishable Avith death, if you can render any proper verdict in this case after considering all of the evidence and applying the law thereto, that is as far as this test is concerned, your eligibility to become a juror in this case, and the other if your opinions would preclude or prevent you from rendering any proper verdict including one finding the defendant guilty of an offense punishable with death if the facts and the law make that verdict the correct one you would not be eligible to become a juror in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">\u201cI am now about to call the roll of those present in the order in which your name is listed on the roll and Avill ask that you answer clearly as I call your name if you consider yourself eligible under the test I have just explained to you.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">\u201cIf you can render any appropriate verdict which the facts and the law convince you to be a proper verdict in this case, you Avill answer, \u2018I can.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">\u201cIf, on the other hand, yon feel that your conscience, conviction, or opinion would preclude you from rendering any appropriate verdict, including a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree \\Adthout recommendation of mercy, if the facts would so Avarrant, you will answer, \u2018I cannot.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">This was the sole questioning permitted by the court regarding the prospective jurors\u2019 feelings about capital punishment, the granting or withholding of mercy in a proper case, whether the panel comprehended the reason for the examination and the full consequences of their answers, and whether the contents of the query were even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>understood by the members of the panel. One venireman answered, \u201cI really don\u2019t know. It\u2019s very improbable that 1 could recommend the death penalty.\u201d The trial judge responded, \u201cI will come back to your name, Mr. Kaiser, as I conclude the roll. I would like at that time to have from your conscience a definite statement of whether you can remain and be called as a juror or you cannot.\u201d Thereafter, 27 other prospective jurors\u2019 names were called by the court, four of whom answered only with, \u201cI cannot,\u201d 23 replying only with, \u201cI can.\u201d The court then recalled Mr. Kaiser\u2019s name and he stated only, \u201cI cannot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">At the trial court\u2019s suggestion, the prosecuting attorney then entered challenges for cause against Mr. Kaiser and the other four veniremen who answered, \u201cI cannot,\u201d and, over objection by the defense, these individuals were all excused for cause. The jury was then selected from the persons who remained.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">It is appellant\u2019s main contention that a jury so selected fails to conform with the due process standard set forth in <em>Witherspoon </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1968), 391 U. S. 510, and that, accordingly, the death sentence imposed upon bim cannot be carried out.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">This court has already extensively analyzed the <em>Witherspoon </em>decision. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson </em>(1971), 28 Ohio St. 2d 181; <em>State </em>v. <em>Pruett </em>(1971), 28 Ohio St. 2d 29; <em>State </em>v. <em>Wigglesworth </em>(1971), 28 Ohio St. 2d 28; <em>State </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1971), 28 Ohio St. 2d 15. We have sought to adhere to its mandate that \u2018 \u2018 a sentence of death cannot be carried out if the jury that imposed it was chosen by excluding veniremen for cause simply because they voiced general objections to the death penalty or expressed conscientious or religious scruples against its infliction.\u201d <em>Witherspoon </em>v. <em>Illinois, supra, </em>at page 522. Such decisions as we have made in this regard involved our careful interpretation of the words used by respective courts, litigants and veniremen in asking and answering the question: would you <em>automatically </em>vote against the imposition of the death penalty, no matter what the trial might reveal? See With<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number><em>erspoon </em>v. <em>Illinois, supra, </em>at page 516; see, also, <em>Boulden </em>v. <em>Holman </em>(1969), 394 U. S. 478; <em>Maxwell </em>v. <em>Bishop </em>(1970), 398 U. S. 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">It is clear to us from the instant record that these veniremen rightfully concluded from the circumstances that they were to give only one or the other of two permissible answers, and that questions relating to the court\u2019s query were undesired. The chilling effect which this method of selection had upon the imperative search for an informed and impartial jury to sit in judgment of life or death is obvious.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Furthermore, neither we, nor the trial court, nor counsel for the parties below can safely conclude from this record that each of the five challenged veniremen would have been <em>unwilling </em>\u201cto <em>consider </em>all of the penalties provided by state law,\u201d and that each was \u201cirrevocably committed, before the trial has begun, to vote against the penalty of death regardless of the facts and circumstances that might emerge in the course of the proceedings.\u201d <em>Witherspoon </em>v. <em>Illinois, supra, </em>at page 522, footnote 21.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Compliance with the requirements of <em>Witherspoon </em>necessarily includes sufficient latitude in the <em>voir dire </em>examination of prospective jurors in a capital case to establish that those who are dismissed for cause upon the basis of their scruples regarding capital punishment would automatically vote against the imposition of a sentence of death no matter what the trial might reveal. We cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>so find from the record in the case at bar. See <em>State </em>v. Watson, <em>supra </em>(28 Ohio St. 2d 15).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Additional grounds exist for our conclusions herein. The Ohio Constitution provides, insofar as here material :</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">\u201c* * * In any trial, in any court, the party accused shall be allowed * * * a speedy public trial by an impartial jury of the county in which the offense is alleged to have been committed. * * #\u201d Article I, Section 10, Constitution of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">As we said in <em>Lingafelter </em>v. <em>Moore </em>(1917), 95 Ohio St. 384, 387, 117 N. E. 16:</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">\u201cIt is beyond question that the right of trial by jury guaranteed by the Constitution carries with it by necessary implication the right to a trial by a jury composed of unbiased and unprejudiced jurors. This right being guaranteed, all courts are charged with the imperative duty of affording every litigant the opportunity of having his cause tried by an impartial jury.\u201d See, also, <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>State </em>(1865), 16 Ohio St. 328; <em>Petro </em>v. <em>Donner </em>(1940), 137 Ohio St. 168, 28 N. E. 2d 503; <em>Peart </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1953), 159 Ohio St. 137, 111 N. E. 2d 16; <em>State </em>v. <em>Duling </em>(1970), 21 Ohio St. 2d 13, 254 N. E. 2d 670.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">To safeguard this constitutional right, the General Assembly has provided for peremptory challenges and challenges for cause. R. C. 2945.21, 2945.22 and 2945.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">In <em>Dowd-Feder </em>v. <em>Truesdell </em>(1936), 130 Ohio St. 530, 533, 200 N. E. 762, we said:</p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">\u201cThe right to examine prospective jurors on their <em>voir dire </em>is granted to litigants in order to enable them to select a jury composed of men and women qualified and competent to judge and determine, without bias, prejudice or partiality, facts in issue. For the proper exercise of this right, the Legislature has deemed it wise to give to litigants the right of peremptory challenge and challenge for cause. This former right is to be exercised at their discretion and free from any limitation or restriction. Any rule of law which denies a litigant reasonable latitude in the examination of prospective jurors as to their qualifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>cations in order to enable him to exercise sneh peremptory-challenges judiciously and intelligently, deprives him of a substantial right.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">\u201cReasonable scope must be allowed and latitude given to counsel on the <em>voir dire </em>examination * *</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Later, in <em>Krupp </em>v. <em>Poor </em>(1970), 24 Ohio St. 2d 123, 125, 265 N. E. 2d 268, this court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">\u201c \u2018The purpose of the examination of a prospective juror upon his <em>voir dire </em>is to determine whether he has both the statutory qualification of a juror and is free from bias or prejudice for or against either litigant. \u2019 Paragraph one of the syllabus of <em>Pavilonis </em>v. <em>Valentine </em>(1929), 120 Ohio St. 154. See, also, paragraph one of the syllabus of <em>Vega </em>v. <em>Evans </em>(1934), 128 Ohio St. 535, and paragraph one of the syllabus of <em>Dowd-Feder </em>v. <em>Truesdell </em>(1936), 130 Ohio St. 530. Moreover, the <em>voir dire </em>examination serves as the foundation upon which an intelligent exercise of the litigants\u2019 right to peremptory challenge may be made. <em>Pavilonis </em>v. <em>Valentine, supra, </em>and <em>Dowd-Feder </em>v. <em>Truesdell, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">\u201cTo achieve that purpose, reasonable latitude must be given to counsel on the <em>voir dire </em>examination. *\u2022* *\u201d See, also, <em>Pearson </em>v. <em>Gardner Cartage Co. </em>(1947), 148 Ohio St. 425, 76 N. E. 2d 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">Whatever may be the practice in other jurisdictions, it is a rule of long standing in Ohio that counsel for the respective litigants be given a reasonable opportunity to personally examine prospective jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">The General Assembly has also addressed itself to this important area. R. C. 2945.27 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">\u201cThe judge of the trial court shall examine the prospective jurors under oath or upon affirmation as to their qualifications to serve as fair and impartial jurors, but he <em>shall permit reasonable examination of such jurors by </em>the prosecuting attorney and by <em>defendant or his counsel.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>The degree of examination that is \u201creasonable\u201d will vary from case to case dejjending upon many factors, including whether the trial to be held is criminal or civil, and, if criminal, for what crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">In the instant case, the defendant was charged with first degree murder under E. 0. 2901.01. The jury was entrusted with two distinct responsibilities: First, to determine defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence; and second, to determine whether defendant\u2019s sentence should be death or imprisonment for life. The jurors were bound by their oath to base their verdict of \u201cnot guilty,\u201d \u201cguilty of manslaughter,\u201d or \u201cguilty,\u201d solely upon the law and the evidence, without regal\u2019d to any personal feelings. However, as in all first degree murder cases in this state, it was left entirely to the jury to determine the extent of punishment in the event of conviction. See <em>McGautha </em>v. <em>California </em>(1971), 402 U. S. 183, 91 S. Ct. 1454. Under such circumstances, it was unreasonable within the meaning of E. C. 2945.27 for the trial court to prohibit the prosecuting attorney and the defendant or his counsel from asking the prospective jurors <em>any </em>questions concerning their scruples regarding capital punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">It has not been alleged, argued or shown that this jury was biased with respect to appellant\u2019s guilt. We have examined the appellant\u2019s other contentions and find no error prejudicial to his interests. Hence, the judgment of guilt will be affirmed. However, as required by the doctrine of <em>Witherspoon </em>v. <em>Illinois, supra, </em>the penalty of death must be reversed and the cause remanded to the trial court, with instructions to vacate the journal entry sentenc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>ing this defendant to death and then to sentence defendant to imprisonment for life as provided for in R. C. 2901.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b146-6\">O\u2019Neill, C.
