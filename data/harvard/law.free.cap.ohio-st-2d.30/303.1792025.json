Signer, is guilty as charged in counts 3, 5, 6 and 7, and thereby is guilty of misconduct as defined in Section (5) (a) of Rule XVIII of the Rules of Practice of this court, all in violation of Canons 6,11, 29 and 32 of the Canons of Professional Ethics.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">We affirm these findings of the board and overrule respondent\u2019s objections thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">We likewise agree with the recommendation of the board that respondent, Burton R. Signer, be permanently disbarred from the practice of law in Ohio, and such recommendation is confirmed. Objection of respondent to this recommendation is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">\n<em>Report confirmed and judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b378-12\">O\u2019Neill, C.
