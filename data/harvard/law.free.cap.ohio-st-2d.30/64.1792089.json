However, appellant contends that the rule is nonetheless applicable because appellee did not move to dismiss the appeal until July 6, 1971. \"We find it unnecessary to resolve that contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">Unlike the former procedure in civil matters, wherein all judgments and orders must be entered upon the journal (see R.

R. 32 [XLV Ohio Bar, No. 13, March 27, 1972, pages 443, 444]) contain language vitiating the conclusion that the pronouncement of a sentence in open court, upon conviction, is then and there an act of the court which needs no formalization by a journal entry before an appeal may be perfected therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals dismissing the appeal therein is reversed and the cause is remanded to that court for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b137-7\">O\u2019Neill, C.
