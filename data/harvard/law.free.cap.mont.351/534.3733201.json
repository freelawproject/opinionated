Brianna asserts that the District Court erred when it denied her motion for judgment as a matter of law, her motion for a proposed jury instruction, her post-verdict motion for a new trial, and her request for reasonable attorney fees and costs pursuant to \u00a7 37-61-421, MCA. We conclude the District Court did not err in denying these motions and affirm the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">\u00b62 On November 24, 1999, Brianna was brought to a medical clinic in Billings, Montana, by her mother Gina White (Gina) with complaints about a headache and overall flu symptoms. Brianna was seen by Dr. Johnson. At the time, Brianna was approximately 11 years, 8 months old and weighed 57 pounds. Gina later testified that during this visit she expressed to Dr. Johnson concerns that Brianna\u2019s growth was stagnant and that she was small for her age. Gina claims that Dr. Johnson told her that some children were late bloomers and did not explore the topic further. Dr. Johnson prescribed Imitrex for the headache and, according to Gina, told her to return in a couple of days if the symptoms persisted.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">\u00b63 Gina and Brianna did not return to see Dr. Johnson until February 12, 2001. At that time, Brianna was complaining of pain in her jaw and upper facial area, headaches, and flu-like symptoms. By this time, Brianna was approximately 12 years and 10 months old. Gina claims that she once again inquired of Dr. Johnson about Brianna\u2019s size and general lack of growth and development. Gina claims Dr. Johnson told her that if Brianna did not show signs of maturing by age 16, then her lack of development would be something to investigate. Dr. Johnson diagnosed Brianna with a sinus infection, and gave her a prescription for an antibiotic.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-12\">\u00b64 On November 27, 2002, Brianna visited the clinic for possible strep throat. By this time, Brianna was nearly 15 years old. At this visit, Brianna and Gina saw Dr. Paul Kelker (Dr. Kelker) because Dr. Johnson was on vacation. Dr. Kelker immediately expressed concerns <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>about Brianna\u2019s size. According to Gina, Dr. Kelker seemed \u201cdisgusted\u201d at the fact that Brianna\u2019s lack of development had not been previously addressed and told Gina that Brianna appeared to him to be about 10 years old. Dr. Kelker began testing and evaluation which ultimately led to the discovery of a craniopharyngioma that had engulfed Brianna\u2019s pituitary gland. Within 30 days, Brianna underwent surgery in Denver, Colorado, for removal of the craniopharyngioma. After the surgery, Brianna began daily hormone therapy in order to bring her development up to normal standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">\u00b65 In March 2007, Brianna filed a negligence action against Dr. Johnson. Brianna alleged that Dr. Johnson had breached the applicable standard of care in her treatment of her by failing to appreciate the signs and symptoms of her abnormally small stature, immature appearance, and general lack of growth and development and by failing to conduct the necessary follow-up and investigation of these symptoms. As a result, Brianna asserted that she suffered serious, severe and permanent injuries and damages. Dr. Johnson answered, denying she was negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">\u00b66 Prior to trial, the District Court issued rulings with respect to several pretrial motions and motions in limine filed by Brianna and Dr. Johnson, some of which are germane to the present appeal. First, the District Court ruled that Dr. Johnson could not argue or attempt to shift the fault or blame to Brianna or Gina for any alleged lack of diligence in pursuing a diagnosis; however, Dr. Johnson would be allowed to address and explain the standard of care. Second, the District Court prohibited Dr. Johnson from calling Dr. Kelker to testify about whether or not she violated the standard of care in her treatment of Brianna.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">\u00b67 A jury trial was held from June 24 to June 27, 2008. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Dr. Johnson, finding that she was not negligent in her treatment of Brianna. During trial, the jury heard testimony from Brianna, Gina, Dr. Johnson, and other witnesses for the defense and plaintiff, including the videotaped deposition testimony of Richard Oken, M.D. (Dr. Oken) of California which had been taken by Brianna\u2019s counsel prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">\u00b68 Brianna claims that throughout the trial, Dr. Johnson\u2019s defense counsel Herbert Pierce (Pierce) repeatedly violated the District Court\u2019s rulings noted directly above. With respect to the first ruling-the prohibition on shifting blame to Gina or Brianna-Brianna argues that Pierce first violated this ruling in his opening statement, when he pointed out to the jury that Gina had only taken Brianna to Dr. Johnson for \u201csick\u201d visits, but had not taken her for \u201cwell child\u201d visits. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>He told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-4\">Brianna White and her mother were one of [Dr. Johnson\u2019s] patients. And the first visit was in November of 1999. That visit and the second visit and last visit with Dr. Johnson was in February of2001. Both of those visits were sick child visits. Those appointments were made that day by Mrs. White to bring her daughter in for an urgent visit because of a specific medical problem. The first visit was for a headache, the second visit was for a sinus infection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\">Now, there are other types of visits as I alluded to a little earlier. There are visits for wellness checks and chronic problems. During well child checkups is when a doctor-Mr. Ragain [Brianna\u2019s counsel] put this chart on the overhead for you-fchat\u2019s when a doctor takes these values and other values and puts them on a chart and tracks a child\u2019s progress and development. No pediatrician does that during a sick child visit. In fact, their own expert, alluded to by Mr. Ragain, admitted that the standard of care doesn\u2019t require that a doctor during a sick child visit even to take a patient\u2019s heighth [sic]. Nobody does that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">So the two types of visits that were made and appointments that were made by Brianna\u2019s mother were for sick child visits. The first one focused on the headache and the second one focused on a sinus infection. They were not well child visits. They could have been, but they weren\u2019t. They were not for chronic problems, long-standing problems. They could have been, but they weren\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AoL\">\u00b69 Brianna argues that by raising this argument, Pierce was blaming Gina for the failure to diagnose her condition in direct violation of the District Court\u2019s order. Brianna further points to several places in Pierce\u2019s opening statement where he made references to Gina and her role in the visits-including the fact that Gina herself was small in size, thus making Brianna\u2019s small size by comparison seem less abnormal-and reiterated the fact that Gina had failed to schedule any medical appointments for the \u201cspecific purpose of investigating heighth [sic] or weight or growth issues at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">\u00b610 Although Brianna\u2019s counsel James Ragain (Ragain) did not object to these statements during Pierce\u2019s opening, he did bring them to the District Court\u2019s attention outside the presence of the jury immediately thereafter. Ragain asserted that Pierce was violating the District Court\u2019s pretrial ruling and shifting blame to Gina by referring to her failure to schedule follow-up appointments to check on Brianna\u2019s development. Pierce argued that he was not attempting to shift blame, but was simply challenging Gina\u2019s credibility regarding her concerns <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>about Brianna\u2019s development. Pierce asserted that Gina\u2019s failure to schedule well-child checkups was probative as to whether she was actually worried about Brianna\u2019s development at the time, and that such evidence was admissible as corroborative evidence that Gina was not overly concerned about Brianna\u2019s development. To bolster this argument, Pierce observed that in Dr. Kelker\u2019s notes of his examination with Brianna and Gina, he stated that Gina is \u2018just beginning to get concerned\u201d about Brianna\u2019s development. The District Court reiterated its ruling that counsel was \u201cnot going to cast blame upon the mother.\u201d However, the District Court also noted that Dr. Kelker\u2019s notes would be part of the case and their contents were probative of the issues to be determined at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">\u00b611 In spite of this ruling, Brianna\u2019s counsel asserts that Pierce went on to violate this prohibition later in trial. For instance, one aspect of Brianna\u2019s damages claim was that the delayed diagnosis of her condition had a negative impact on her social life and social development among her peers because she was not developing physically at the same rate as others of her age. When inquiring of the schedule for Brianna\u2019s post-diagnosis hormone injection regimen, Brianna asserts that Pierce implied to the jury that Brianna had to take the injections on a rigid schedule which impacted her ability to carry on a normal social life, in order to fit Gina\u2019s schedule. Furthermore, Pierce posed questions to Gina at other points in the trial about the circumstances of her concern over Brianna\u2019s development and whether she did, or did not, bring up these concerns in medical appointments or schedule any appointments to look into these concerns. Brianna also argues that questions elicited during Dr. Johnson\u2019s testimony about Brianna\u2019s history of well-child check ups was done in effort to imply to the jury that Gina had failed to bring Brianna in for well-child check ups.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">\u00b612 Another alleged instance of Pierce\u2019s violation of the District Court\u2019s rulings occurred in connection with Gina\u2019s testimony about her visit with Dr. Kelker. During direct examination, Gina testified that Dr. Kelker had seemed irritated or disgusted that nothing had previously been done in response to Brianna\u2019s small size. Pierce interpreted this as \u201copening the door\u201d to testimony as to whether Dr. Kelker had ever been critical of Dr. Johnson\u2019s treatment and evaluation of Brianna. Accordingly, during direct of examination of Dr. Johnson, Pierce asked her if in Dr. Kelker\u2019s deposition he had ever expressed any criticism of her, or expressed that she had violated the standard of care. Brianna immediately objected, and the District Court responded that \u201cas far as it goes to criticisms, you can ask the question, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>but no further.\u201d The following exchange then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-4\">Q. (By Mr. Pierce) And, doctor [Johnson], I hand you a copy of [Dr. Kelker\u2019s] deposition. Was that deposition taken by Mr. Ragain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aie\">A. Yes, it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\">Q. And when was it taken?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">A. September 17th, 2007.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-7\">Q. And did Dr. Kelker anywhere in the deposition say you violated the standard of care?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-8\">THE COURT: Rephrase your question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-9\">MR. RAGAIN: No, no, no, move to strike.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-10\">THE COURT: Motion to strike is granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-11\">MR. RAGAIN: Let\u2019s talk. It\u2019s a direct contravention of the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-12\">Court\u2019s order, Your Honor, direct and intentional.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-13\">THE COURT: You can ask about criticisms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-14\">MR. PIERCE: I\u2019m sorry, I apologize.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-15\">Q. (By Mr. Pierce) Did Dr. Kelker criticize you in his deposition?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AH1M\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-16\">\u00b613 At this point in the proceedings, the jury was allowed to take a break and the parties spoke with the District Court outside the presence of the jury. Ragain then moved for judgment as a matter of law with respect to liability as a sanction for Pierce\u2019s alleged violation of the District Court\u2019s rulings. The District Court heard arguments from both sides as to whether its previous rulings had been violated, but reserved ruling on the motion for judgment as a matter of law until a later time. The District Court ultimately denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-17\">\u00b614 During the settling of jury instructions, Brianna proposed the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-18\">You are hereby instructed that you are to consider the conduct of Dr. Johnson only in this case and if you determine that Brianna sustained damages, you may not consider whether the conduct of Gina White contributed to the damages. The Court has already considered this issue and will address the issue in accordance with Montana law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-19\">Brianna\u2019s counsel argued that the instruction should be given based on: (1) the District Court\u2019s rulings on the motion in limine; and (2) because Pierce violated the District Court\u2019s ruling on several occasions under the guise that argument or evidence concerning Gina\u2019s conduct could be presented to the jury for different reasons (i.e., challenging Gina\u2019s credibility). This instruction was refused by the District Court. \u00b615 After the jury returned a defense verdict, Brianna filed a motion for a new trial. The District Court held oral argument on the motion on August 28, 2008. At the hearing, Ragain asserted that Brianna did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>not get a fair trial due to Pierce\u2019s repeated violations of the pretrial rulings. Ragain argued that if Pierce believed he could introduce evidence concerning Dr. Kelker\u2019s opinion on whether Dr. Johnson breached the standard of care for \u201canother purpose,\u201d then Pierce should have brought this issue to the District Court\u2019s attention ahead of time. Additionally, Ragain argued that Pierce\u2019s comments in opening statements, and his repeated attempts to imply that Gina had failed to appropriately follow up on any concerns about Brianna\u2019s development, were done to shift blame to Gina in violation of the District Court\u2019s ruling. Moreover, Ragain asserted that these violations by Pierce were intentional. Ragain also argued that the District Court erred in failing to give the proposed instruction, and that if Pierce was attempting to admit evidence ostensibly prohibited under the District Court\u2019s rulings for another purpose under M. R. Evid. 105, a curative instruction to that effect should have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">\u00b616 For his part, Pierce argued that he had not violated any of the District Court\u2019s rulings, either intentionally or otherwise. Pierce reiterated his argument that inquiries about whether Gina had taken Brianna to well-child checkups was appropriate for impeachment purposes given her testimony that she had expressed concern on these issues at her visits with Dr. Johnson, even though these concerns were not reflected in the notes from Dr. Johnson\u2019s examinations. Furthermore, Pierce argued that notes from Dr. Kelker\u2019s examination indicated that Gina was just beginning to get concerned about Brianna\u2019s development at that time. In this connection, Pierce pointed to evidence from Dr. Oken\u2019s deposition, which had been placed into evidence by Brianna at trial, wherein he discussed the difference between well-child and sick visits in some length and their significance on the standard of care issue. With regard to his questioning of Dr. Johnson on whether Dr. Kelker had criticized her treatment of Brianna, Pierce asserted that the door had been opened to this inquiry when Gina testified that Dr. Kelker expressed \u201cdisgust\u201dat the previous failure to investigate the causes of Brianna\u2019s smaller than normal size.</p>\n<p id=\"AsT\">\u00b617 At the conclusion of the hearing, the District Court denied the motion from the bench. The District Court acknowledged that the issue of shifting blame to Gina had presented a difficult situation for both sides in light of the evidence and argument adduced at trial, but concluded that Pierce did not overtly blame Gina for Brianna\u2019s delayed diagnosis. On the issue of whether the District Court\u2019s order had been breached when Pierce inquired about whether Dr. Kelker had opined that Dr. Johnson breached the standard of care, the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>Now there was-the question, when we got down to asking it, was asked in terms of criticism and standard of care. There was an objection. It\u2019s set out in the brief, and I sustained the objection and we struck a question or something and the question was re-asked. And I think there was a subsequent objection, because it was still phrased in terms of standard of care. And that question was never answered, and it was objected to and it was stricken. And then the proper question was asked about whether Dr. Kelker was critical. And the answer was no. And we moved on. It\u2019s not exactly the way I would have planned all that to occur, but in context, it was a valid and permissible impeachment, not blame.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">\u00b618 Finally, the District Court held that the proposed instruction was properly denied because it did not actually address the issue of blame, but only that of damages. Moreover, the District Court held that the instruction was too restrictive and, further, that the Brianna had never specifically cited to M. R. Evid. 105 as a basis for the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"Am11\">\u00b619 Brianna now appeals from these rulings. Additionally, Brianna asserts that she is entitled to reasonable attorney fees and costs pursuant to \u00a7 37-61-421, MCA, based upon defense counsel\u2019s unreasonable multiplication of the proceedings in this case. Since we are affirming the District Court and the jury\u2019s verdict, we do not address Brianna\u2019s claims for attorney fees and costs. We state the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">\u00b620 Issue One: <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Brianna\u2019s motion to sanction Dr. Johnson with a finding of liability based on Pierce\u2019s alleged violations of the District Court\u2019s pretrial rulings?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">\u00b621 Issue Two: <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Brianna\u2019s proposed jury instruction?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">\u00b622 Issue Three: <em>Did the District Court manifestly abuse its discretion in denying Brianna\u2019s post-verdict motion for a new trial?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">\u00b623 We review a district court\u2019s decision to impose or deny sanctions for an abuse of discretion. <em>Seal v. Woodrows Pharmacy, </em>1999 MT 247, \u00b6 26, 296 Mont. 197, 988 P.2d 1230; <em>Big Spring v. Jore, </em>2005 MT 64, \u00b6 37, 326 Mont. 256, 109 P.3d 219. A district court\u2019s decision to refuse a proposed jury instruction is reviewed for an abuse of discretion as well. <em>Howard v. St. James Community Hosp., </em>2006 MT 23, \u00b6 16, 331 Mont. 60, 129 P.3d 126. An abuse of discretion occurs when the district court, in the exercise of its discretion, acts arbitrarily without the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>employment of conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason in view of all the circumstances. <em>Howard, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">\u00b624 We review a district court\u2019s decision denying a motion for a new trial to determine if the district court manifestly abused its discretion. <em>Bailey v. Beartooth Communications Co., </em>2004 MT 128, \u00b6 10, 321 Mont. 305, 92 P.3d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">\u00b625 Issue One: <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Brianna\u2019s motion to sanction Dr. Johnson with a finding of liability based on Pierce\u2019s alleged violations of the District Court\u2019s pretrial rulings?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">\u00b626 As noted above, Brianna\u2019s counsel moved the District Court to impose liability on Dr. Johnson as a sanction for defense counsel Pierce\u2019s alleged violations of the District Court\u2019s pretrial rulings throughout trial. Brianna argues the District Court erred in denying this motion. Brianna notes that before trial the District Court specifically prohibited inquiry of Dr. Kelker as to whether Dr. Johnson violated the standard of care and asserts that the violation of this ruling warrants the imposition of liability on the negligence count as a sanction. Furthermore, Brianna argues that Pierce shifted blame to Gina throughout trial. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 8-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">\u00b627 In response, Pierce argues that Brianna opened the door to such inquiry regarding Dr. Kelker\u2019s opinion, by having Gina testify that Dr. Kelker was disgusted that nothing had been done in previous visits with Dr. Johnson to address Brianna\u2019s small size, and that he was consequently entitled to inquire into this matter. Pierce also argues that he did not try to shift blame to Gina in violation of the District Court\u2019s order, and that evidence and inquiry regarding any well-child visits was a necessary part of presenting Dr. Johnson\u2019s defense as it bears on the standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">\u00b628 The decision whether to impose sanctions for an alleged violation of a district court order is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Seal, </em>\u00b6 26. In the first instance, we conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion in concluding Pierce did not violate the pretrial order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>prohibiting placing blame on Gina. Gina testified that she expressed concern over Brianna\u2019s development to Dr. Johnson during her visits. However, Dr. Johnson\u2019s notes from their visits did not reflect that Gina made such statements. Furthermore, Dr. Kelker\u2019s notes from his examination of Brianna stated that Gina was \u2018beginning to get concerned\u201d about Brianna\u2019s growth at the time. The deposition of Dr. Oken, which was introduced into evidence by Brianna, contained an extended discussion of the distinction between well-child and sick visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">\u00b629 Under M. R. Evid. 401, evidence bearing upon the credibility of a witness is considered relevant. While relevant evidence is generally admissible, it \u201cmay be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury ....\u201dM. R. Evid. 403. Under M. R. Evid. 607, the credibility of a witness may be challenged by either party. Once Gina testified that she had expressed concern to Dr. Johnson about Brianna\u2019s height and development, Brianna opened the door for Pierce to challenge the credibility of this assertion so long as he did not cast blame directly on Gina. As the District Court recognized, this presented a fine line for defense counsel to walk. While Pierce was not permitted to blame Gina for the delayed diagnosis and any resulting damages, Pierce was certainly allowed to present evidence concerning the frequency and scheduling of well-child visits in order to challenge the credibility of Gina\u2019s statements concerning the extent of her concern over Gina\u2019s development. Inquiry into these topics in an effort to present a defense was properly allowed by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">\u00b630 Additionally, we agree with Dr. Johnson that Pierce was properly allowed to inquire whether Dr. Kelker expressed criticisms concerning her treatment of Brianna. Clearly, Gina\u2019s testimony about Dr. Kelker\u2019s disgust over previous treatments by Dr. Johnson implied that he was critical of Dr. Johnson. Once this testimony was offered, rebuttal evidence on this point became relevant. <em>See e.g. Cline v. Durden, </em>246 Mont. 154, 161, 803 P.2d 1077, 1081 (1990). While Pierce\u2019s direct question to Dr. Johnson about whether Dr. Kelker stated that she violated the standard of care was an arguable violation of the pretrial ruling, the question was stricken before it was answered. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6 12. Moreover, Brianna did not ask the District Court to admonish the jury in any respect at that time. The jury was dismissed for a recess and Pierce then explained to the District Court why he thought he was permitted to inquire into any criticisms Dr. Kelker may or may not have had concerning Dr. Johnson\u2019s treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"AUY\">\u00b631 Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Court abused its discretion in denying Brianna\u2019s motion for imposition of liability as a sanction for defense counsel\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">\u00b632 Issue Two: <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Brianna\u2019s proposed jury instruction?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">\u00b633 Brianna also argues that the District Court erred in failing to give her proposed jury instruction, in light of Pierce\u2019s repeated attempts to cast blame upon Gina during trial. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6 14. Brianna further argues that since Pierce claimed that evidence about well-child visits and Gina\u2019s actions in respect to scheduling them was admissible for the purpose of challenging Gina\u2019s credibility, then the jury should have been instructed accordingly pursuant to M. R. Evid. 105. This rule of evidence reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\">When evidence which is admissible as to one party or for one purpose but not admissible as to another party or for another purpose is admitted, the court, upon request, shall restrict the evidence to its proper scope and instruct the jury accordingly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">M. R. Evid. 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">\u00b634 In denying Brianna\u2019s motion for a new trial, the District Court explained the rationale for denying this jury instruction as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj9\">Let\u2019s see, the curative instruction. Now, everybody\u2019s right, that no one told me about Rule 105. And I guess as many cases I\u2019ve tried, I should have that committed to memory anyway, but I didn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t mentioned. And the curative instruction, it, I suppose, according to Plaintiff, intended to address blame or liabilities, but doesn\u2019t. It addresses damages. And it is too restrictive. It says, You are to consider the conduct of Dr. Johnson only in this case. And that\u2019 s-that\u2019s too restrictive. That one was refused. No other one was ever offered. The Court was never cited to Rule 105. We\u2019ll leave that one to the Supreme Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">\u00b635 Brianna argues that the District Court\u2019s denial of the jury instruction is reversible error warranting a new trial under the authority of <em>Lorang v. Fortis Ins. </em>Co., 2008 MT 252, 345 Mont. 12, 192 P.3d 186. We disagree and conclude that the District Court\u2019s ruling in this regard was not unreasonable, and did not constitute an abuse of its discretion. As the District Court correctly noted, Brianna did not explicitly request a jury instruction based upon M. R. Evid. 105. <em>See Cissel v. Western Plumbing and Heating </em>Inc., 188 Mont. 149, 158, 612 P.2d 206, 211 (1980) (district court under no duty to give a limiting instruction under M. R. Evid. 105 absent a request to limit the scope of the consideration of testimony). The argument that such instruction fits within the M. R. Evid. 105 requirement was not raised until after trial. Additionally, as noted by Dr. Johnson, the jury instruction was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>actually proposed pretrial, thus undercutting the argument that it was introduced to cure perceived evidentiary deficiencies at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"Aac7\">\u00b636 Further, we agree with the District Court that the jury instruction as presented was too restrictive and was not in fact a limiting instruction pursuant to M. R. Evid. 105. Rather, the instruction as proposed sought to categorically exclude from the jury\u2019s consideration evidence and argument that legitimately challenged Gina\u2019s credibility. In this respect, the instruction was too broad. Moreover, in light of the District Court\u2019s legitimate exercise of its discretion as noted under Issue One, it is questionable whether there was any misconduct to cure. Finally, the instruction is focused upon what the jury should consider in the event it concluded that Brianna sustained damages. The jury did not reach this question. For the foregoing reasons, we conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Brianna\u2019s proposed jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">\u00b637 Issue Three: <em>Did the District Court manifestly abuse its discretion in denying Brianna\u2019s post-verdict motion for a new trial?</em></p>\n<p id=\"ABB\">\u00b638 Finally, Brianna argues that the District Court erred in denying her motion for a new trial. The arguments in support of overturning the District Court\u2019s decision are based on a combination of defense counsel Pierce\u2019s alleged \u201cgross misconduct\u201d during trial, the District Court\u2019s failure to sanction Dr. Johnson with a finding of liability, and its failure to give Brianna\u2019s proposed jury instruction. Brianna argues that Pierce\u2019s gross misconduct rises to the level of attorney misconduct described in <em>Lopez v. Josephson, </em>2001 MT 133, 305 Mont. 446, 30 P.3d 326, and <em>Durden v. Hydro Flame </em>Corp., 1998 MT 47, 288 Mont. 1, 955 P.2d 160, thus warranting a new trial. In <em>Lopez, </em>for instance, we stated that Tt]he repeated asking of questions clearly intended to keep the assumption of damaging facts which cannot be proven before the jury, in order to impress upon their minds the probability of the existence of the assumed facts upon which the questions are based, constitutes gross misconduct.\u201d <em>Lopez, </em>\u00b6 35. Brianna argues that Pierce\u2019s conduct had an analogous effect, and put before the jury improper arguments and comments -undermining her right to a fair trial. <em>See e.g. Harne v. Deadmond, </em>1998 MT 22, \u00b6 11, 287 Mont. 255, 954 P.2d 732 (holding that improper comments made by counsel, without proper admonishment or appropriate jury instruction, resulted in reversible error warranting a new trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">\u00b639 In denying Brianna\u2019s motion for a new trial, the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-7\">In essence, bottom line is this is a small parent with a small child on a sick child visit, no violation of the standard of care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>medically. Plaintiff got in all of its evidence and arguments. Plaintiff didn\u2019t violate the Court\u2019s rules, nor did the Defendant. The fact is the evidence shows there\u2019s no one to blame or at fault for the diagnosis not occurring earlier. No standard of care, medical or parental, was violated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-4\">In fact, I think, if on that third visit Dr. Johnson had been there and they had gone to see Dr. Johnson, she would have discovered the same things and made the same conclusions that Dr. Kelker did at that point in time. All in all, it was a proper trial. It was a fair trial. Neither party was prevented from having a fair trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">\u00b640 Pursuant to \u00a725-11-102(1), MCA, a verdict or decision may be vacated and a new trial granted when an Irregularity in the proceedings of the court, jury, or adverse party or any order of the court or abuse of discretion\u201d prevents a party from having a fair trial, thereby materially affecting that party\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See Willing v. Quebedeaux, </em>2009 MT 102, \u00b6 22, 350 Mont. 119, 204 P.3d 1248. \u2018The trial court has an overriding duty to prevent a miscarriage of justice by granting a new trial where the misconduct of counsel prevents the opposing litigant from having a fair trial on the merits.\u201d Lopez, \u00b6 35 (citing <em>Durden, </em>\u00b6 36).</p>\n<p id=\"A2t\">\u00b641 In light of the foregoing rulings, we conclude that Brianna\u2019s right to a fair trial was not materially affected by any claimed irregularities in these proceedings, and that the District Court did not manifestly abuse its discretion in denying the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"AOl\">\u00b642 The District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Brianna\u2019s motion for sanctions, or her proposed jury instruction. Furthermore, the District Court did not manifestly abuse its discretion in denying Brianna\u2019s motion for a new trial. Thus, we affirm the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<judges id=\"b570-9\">JUSTICES NELSON, WARNER, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b566-10\"> Before the District Court, Brianna moved for judgment as a matter of law on the issue of liability as a sanction for Pierce\u2019s alleged violation of the District Court\u2019s rulings. Judgment as a matter of law is appropriate only when there is a complete absence of any evidence which would justify submitting an issue to a jury. <em>Vader v. Fleetwood Enterprises, </em>Inc., 2009 MT 6, \u00b6 20, 348 Mont. 344, 201 P.3d 139. It is clear that Brianna\u2019s motion was in actuality not a motion for judgment as a matter of law, but was instead a motion for sanctions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
