We affirm in part, reverse in part and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-11\">\u00b62 We address the following issue on appeal: Whether the District Court erred in granting Ellis\u2019s Motion to Suppress Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b120-13\">\u00b63 Just before 1:00 p.m. on October 5, 2006, Officer Dan Murphy, a patrol officer with the Butte-Silver Bow Police Department, was dispatched to a Butte residence to respond to a report of sexual assault on a young woman. He was not informed at that time that the victim was a juvenile. Officer Murphy was dressed in his police uniform and he arrived in his patrol car which he parked in front of the residence. When he arrived at the residence, the victim, S.S., met him at the door. She was crying and her \u201ceyes were very red and puffy.\u201d Officer Murphy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>later testified that S.S. was obviously a teenager, but he could not tell whether she was over or under sixteen years of age. In fact, she was only thirteen years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">\u00b64 S.S. invited Officer Murphy into the living room of the residence and they sat down on the couch. Officer Murphy testified that although 5.5. initially was so upset she was unable to speak, she eventually told Officer Murphy that her father, Dr. William Ellis, had touched her inappropriately the previous evening. According to the Application for Leave to File Information, S.S. told Officer Murphy that she had been sick during the week leading up to the incident and that two nights before this, Ellis had given her some medication that made her feel \u201cgoofy.\u201d S.S. said that before she went to bed on the night of the alleged assault, Ellis had given her some different medication, which she described as blue and pink pills.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">\u00b65 S.S. told Officer Murphy that she was in her bedroom sleeping when Ellis came into her room. Although she was very sleepy, S.S. felt Ellis pull her v-neck night shirt down to expose her breasts, and pull her pajama shorts and underwear down to her thighs. While S.S. pretended to remain asleep, she opened her eyes slightly to confirm that it was Ellis. She saw that he was wearing a t-shirt, but he was nude from the waist down. S.S. stated that Ellis masturbated while he fondled her breasts and vagina. When Ellis was finished, he pulled her night shirt back into place, pulled up her underwear and pajama shorts, covered her back up, and left the room. S.S. was uncertain whether Ellis ejaculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">\u00b66 S.S. also told Officer Murphy that when Ellis woke S.S. up for school that morning, she told him that she was not feeling well and intended to stay home. After Ellis left the house, S.S. tried to call her grandmother and a family friend without success. She was initially reluctant to call the police, but eventually decided to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">\u00b67 Officer Murphy testified that when he realized he was dealing with a child sexual abuse crime, he, pursuant to protocol, asked that a detective be dispatched to the scene to follow through with the investigation. While waiting for the detective, Officer Murphy asked 5.5. to show him where the alleged assault had taken place. S.S. took Officer Murphy upstairs to her bedroom, which Officer Murphy later described as \u201ca typical girl\u2019s bedroom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">\u00b68 Officer Murphy asked S.S. what she had been wearing and S.S. retrieved her pajamas from the side of her bed. She said she was still wearing the same pair of underwear that she had been wearing during the alleged assault. S.S. tried to describe to Officer Murphy the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>medication that Ellis had given her. In doing so, she proceeded to a closet around the corner from her bedroom that contained various types of medication. S.S. looked through the medication, but was unable to identify exactly what she had been given. Officer Murphy testified that he did not look through the closet since he didn\u2019t know what type of pills to look for.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">\u00b69 Officer Murphy and S.S. returned downstairs when Detective George Holland arrived. Detective Holland later testified that he recognized that S.S. was a juvenile and guessed that she was about the same age as his own fourteen-year-old daughter. Officer Murphy briefed Detective Holland and took him upstairs to S.S.\u2019s bedroom while S.S. remained downstairs. Officer Murphy showed Detective Holland the bedroom, the bedding, and the pajamas that S.S. had shown him.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">\u00b610 The officers returned to the living room when they heard a male voice downstairs. They found Ellis sitting next to S.S. on the couch. 5.5. was visibly upset and crying. Detective Holland identified Ellis as 5.5.\u2019s father and asked that Ellis go outside with Officer Murphy. Ellis complied. Neither Detective Holland nor Officer Murphy asked Ellis for permission to search the home, and Ellis did not order the officers out of the home or voice any objections to the officers being present in the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">\u00b611 Once outside, Ellis asked Officer Murphy what was going on. Officer Murphy told Ellis that he was not at liberty to say, but that he would transport Ellis to the police station where Detective Holland would speak with him and fill him in. Officer Murphy could not remember whether or not he handcuffed Ellis before placing him in the patrol car, but he testified that it is the general practice to do so. Detective Holland testified at the suppression hearing that, after Ellis left, S.S. told Detective Holland that Ellis had asked her what was wrong and she told Ellis that she did not want to talk to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">\u00b612 Detective Holland took photographs of S.S.\u2019s bedroom and began collecting evidence. While he was doing so, his Captain, Doug Conway, arrived to see if Detective Holland needed any assistance. Detective Holland and Captain Conway took possession of the sheets, comforter and blanket on S.S.\u2019s bed, as well as her pajamas. They also had S.S. change clothes so that they could take possession of the underwear that she was wearing at the time of the alleged assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">\u00b613 Because the Child Evaluation Center at the hospital was being renovated, Detective Holland took S.S. to the police station to speak with a trained forensic interviewer. While at the station, Detective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Holland provided S.S with a receipt for the items he seized from the home. Detective Holland also filled out a Permission to Search Form and had S.S. sign it.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">\u00b614 After reviewing the forensic expert\u2019s interview with S.S., Detective Holland conducted a taped interview with Ellis. In the interview, Ellis admitted that around 10:00 p.m. the previous evening he had given S.S. a 12.5 milligram dose of Ambien CR to help her sleep. However, a drug screening performed about sixteen hours after Ellis gave S.S. the medication showed that S.S. may have ingested 50 to 60 milligrams, or four or five tablets of Ambien CR. Ellis also admitted to Detective Holland that he went into S.S.\u2019s bedroom to check on her, but he denied any type of sexual contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">\u00b615 Ellis told Detective Holland that S.S. had been disappearing after school and at night, and that he had caught her in numerous lies. He said that he grounded her for three-and-a-half weeks immediately before she called the police, and that her allegations against him fit her previous behavior. Some time later, after DNA evidence from the sheets taken off of S.S.\u2019s bed revealed multiple semen samples containing Ellis\u2019s DNA, Ellis explained that the sheets must have been taken from the dirty clothes hamper where they could have been mixed with his own sheets that contained his semen.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">\u00b616 On September 11, 2007, the State filed an Information charging Ellis with sexual assault, a felony, in violation of \u00a745-5-502(1) and (3), MCA (2005). Thereafter, Ellis filed a motion to suppress wherein he contended that since S.S. was less than sixteen years old, she lacked the capacity to consent to a search of Ellis\u2019s residence or her own bedroom.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, Ellis argued that the seizure of S.S.\u2019s bedding, pajamas and underwear violated both the United States and Montana Constitutions because it was done without his consent or a search warrant. In its brief opposing Ellis\u2019s motion to suppress, the State argued that in a case such as this where the child granting them entrance to the home may be the victim of a sexual assault, a warrant was not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">\u00b617 A hearing on Ellis\u2019s motion was held on February 14, 2008. The State called two witnesses, Officer Murphy and Detective Holland. Ellis did not call any witnesses. At the conclusion of the hearing, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>State conceded that no exigent circumstances existed in this case and that any evidence seized from searches outside S.S.\u2019s bedroom should be suppressed. The State maintained, however, that S.S. had a constitutional right to the sanctity of her own room, and that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Schwarz, </em>2006 MT 120, 332 Mont. 243, 136 P.3d 989, wherein we held that a minor lacks the capacity or the authority to consent to a search, did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">\u00b618 On March 7, 2008, the District Court granted Ellis\u2019s motion to suppress all of the evidence seized from the search of his home. In reaching this decision, the court determined that <em>Schwarz </em>controlled and that, since S.S. did not have actual authority to consent to a search, the officers were obligated to obtain valid consent from Ellis or a search warrant prior to seizing items from S.S.\u2019s bedroom. The court also noted that no evidence would have been lost or destroyed because of any delay involved in obtaining a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">\u00b619 The State appeals the District Court\u2019s Order granting Ellis\u2019s Motion to Suppress Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">\u00b620 We review a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a motion to suppress evidence to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether those findings were correctly applied as a matter of law. <em>State v. Lewis, </em>2007 MT 295, \u00b6 17, 340 Mont. 10, 171 P.3d 731 (citing <em>State v. DeWitt, </em>2004 MT 317, \u00b6 21, 324 Mont. 39, 101 P.3d 277). A trial court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous if they are not supported by substantial credible evidence, if the court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record leaves us with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>Lewis, </em>\u00b6 17 (citing <em>State v. Lanegan, </em>2004 MT 134, \u00b6 10, 321 Mont. 349, 91 P.3d 578).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">\u00b621 <em>Whether the District Court erred in granting Ellis\u2019s Motion to Suppress Evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">\u00b622 The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated ....\u2019\u2019While the Montana Constitution\u2019s provision regarding searches and seizures mirrors the Fourth Amendment, <em>see </em>Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a711, the Montana Constitution also affords its citizens additional privacy protections: \u2018The right of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>individual privacy is essential to the well-being of a free society and shall not be infringed without the showing of a compelling state interest,\u201d Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a710. Thus, Montanans enjoy a greater right to privacy exceeding even that provided by the federal constitution. <em>State v. Burns, </em>253 Mont. 37, 40, 830 P.2d 1318, 1320 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"A6v\">\u00b623 In determining whether a state action constitutes an unreasonable or unlawful search or seizure in violation of the Montana Constitution, we look to three factors: Tl) whether the person challenging the state\u2019s action has an actual subjective expectation of privacy; (2) whether society is willing to recognize that subjective expectation as objectively reasonable; and (3) the nature of the state\u2019s intrusion.\u201d <em>State v. Goetz, </em>2008 MT 296, \u00b6 27, 345 Mont. 421, 191 P.3d 489 (citing <em>State v. Hill, </em>2004 MT 184, \u00b6 24, 322 Mont. 165, 94 P.3d 752). We stated in <em>Goetz </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-5\">[t]he first two factors are considered in determining whether a search or seizure occurred, thus triggering the protections of Article II, Sections 10 and 11. The third factor relates to the reasonableness of the search or seizure under the circumstances. Under the third factor, we determine whether the state action complained of violated the Article II, Section 10 and 11 protections because it was not justified by a compelling state interest or was undertaken without procedural safeguards such as a properly issued search warrant or other special circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-6\"><em>Goetz, </em>\u00b6 27 (citing <em>State v. Tackitt, </em>2003 MT 81, \u00b6 23, 315 Mont. 59, 67 P.3d 295; <em>State v. Scheetz, </em>286 Mont. 41, 50, 950 P.2d 722, 727 (1997); <em>State v.

McLees, </em>2000 MT 6, \u00b6 10, 298 Mont. 15, 994 P.2d 683 (quoting <em>State v. Hubbel, </em>286 Mont. 200, 212, 951 P.2d 971, 978 (1997) (internal citations omitted)); <em>see also Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 357, 88 S. Ct. 507, 514 (1967). \u201c\u2018One such exception is when the search is conducted pursuant to a consent that is freely and voluntarily given.\u2019 \u201d <em>McLees, </em>\u00b6 10 (quoting <em>Hubbel, </em>286 Mont. at 212, 951 P.2d at 978); <em>see also Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 222, 93 S. Ct. 2041, 2045 (1973). Moreover,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AS4\">\u201cwhen the prosecution seeks to justify a warrantless search by proof of voluntary consent, it is not limited to proof that consent was given by the defendant, but may show that permission to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>search was obtained from a third party who possessed common authority over or other sufficient relationship to the premises or effects sought to be inspected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-4\"><em>Schwarz, </em>\u00b6 9 (emphasis omitted) (quoting <em>United States v. Matlock, </em>415 U.S. 164, 171, 94 S. Ct. 988, 993 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">\u00b625 On appeal, the State argues that this Court\u2019s decision in Sc/m;ar.z-holding that a youth under the age of sixteen lacks the capacity or the authority to consent to a search of her parents\u2019 home, <em>Schwarz, </em>\u00b6 144s not applicable here because S.S. was the victim of a crime, and as such, she had actual authority to allow law enforcement officers into the home and to take them to her bedroom to show them where the crime occurred. The State also argues that, even if we conclude that <em>Schwarz </em>is applicable, the evidence obtained in this case is still admissible under the inevitable discovery doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">\u00b626 In <em>Schwarz, </em>law enforcement officers were trying to locate and arrest Jonathan Lowe. After the officers learned that Lowe was staying at the home of his girlfriend, Kerry Ann Schwarz, three officers drove to Schwarz\u2019s residence to make an arrest. Schwarz was out bowling for the evening, but Schwarz\u2019s thirteen-year-old daughter was at the residence along with two friends. When Schwarz\u2019s daughter answered the door, the officers explained to her that they were looking for Lowe. WTiether the girl invited the officers to search the home, or whether the officers directly asked permission to enter is not clear, nevertheless, the officers entered the residence with her consent. None of the officers attempted to contact Schwarz, nor did they obtain a search warrant before entering the residence. <em>Schwarz, </em>\u00b6 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">\u00b627 During the search of the residence, the officers discovered a marijuana pipe and a small plastic container containing a white substance later determined to be methamphetamine. At some point during the search, Schwarz called home to check on her daughter and learned that the officers were there searching the residence. Schwarz immediately drove home. Upon her arrival, one of the officers told Schwarz that they had discovered drugs and drug paraphernalia. Schwarz admitted to owning the items and provided the officers with written consent for another search of her home. Schwarz was arrested and taken to the police station where she was charged with criminal possession of dangerous drugs, a felony. <em>Schwarz, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 1, 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">\u00b628 Schwarz filed a motion to suppress the evidence seized from her home arguing that the officers illegally searched her home in violation of Article II, Sections 10 and 11 of the Montana Constitution. After a hearing on the motion, the District Court determined that because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Schwarz\u2019s daughter and her friends were home alone on a Friday night, \u201call the parents had confidence in these girls to exercise good judgment.\u201d <em>Schwarz, </em>\u00b6 5. Consequently, because the officers had every reason to believe that Schwarz\u2019s daughter had authority to let the officers into the house to look for Lowe, the court determined that the motion to suppress should be denied. <em>Schwarz, </em>\u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">\u00b629 In reversing the District Court\u2019s decision in <em>Schwarz, </em>we reviewed our caselaw regarding third-party consent to search and we reiterated that \u2018for third-party consent to be valid as against the defendant, the consenting party must have actual authority to do so.\u201d <em>Schwarz, </em>\u00b6 10 (emphasis omitted) (quoting <em>McLees, </em>\u00b6 32 (rejecting the doctrine of apparent authority addressed in the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Illinois v. Rodriguez, </em>497 U.S. 177, 186, 110 S. Ct. 2793, 2800 (1990))).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">\u00b630 We determined in <em>Schwarz </em>that, in general, a youth does not have authority equal to that of a parent or guardian regarding their shared property.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-6\">\u201cA minor child who lives in the same home with his or her parents or guardians obviously shares use of the property with the parent or guardians to some extent. However, it should also be obvious that a child generally does not share mutual use of the property with a parent to the same extent that such use might be shared between spouses or between cohabiting adults.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-7\"><em>Schwarz, </em>\u00b6 13 (quoting <em>State v. Tomlinson, </em>648 N.W.2d 367, 376 (Wis. 2002)). We also stated in <em>Schwarz </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\">even if a parent chooses to grant her minor children joint access and mutual use of the home, \u201cparents normally retain control of the home, as well as the power to rescind the authority they have given.\u201d... [A] parent has not surrendered the privacy of his home to the discretion of a child, but rather, the child has privacy at the discretion of the parent. In other words, \u201ca <em>child cannot waive the privacy rights of her parents.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-9\"><em>Schwarz, </em>\u00b6 13 <em>(quoting People v. Jacobs, </em>729 P.2d 757, 763 (Cal. 1987)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">\u00b631 On that basis, we concluded in <em>Schwarz </em>that in light of Montana\u2019s enhanced right to privacy under Article II, Section 10 of the Montana Constitution, \u201cconsent, as an exception to the warrant requirement, must be narrowly construed.\u201d <em>Schwarz, </em>\u00b6 14. Therefore, we adopted \u201ca <em>per se </em>rule that a youth under the age of sixteen lacks the capacity or the authority to consent to a search of her parents\u2019 home.\u201d <em>Schwarz, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>\u00b632 We found further persuasive authority for our holding in <em>Schwarz </em>in \u00a741-5-331(2), MCA, which provides that a youth under the age of sixteen can only waive her right against self-incrimination with parental permission or with the advice of counsel. We observed in <em>Schwarz </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-4\">[although \u00a7 41-5-331, MCA, only addresses a youth\u2019s constitutional right against self-incrimination, it nonetheless supports the principle that a minor who cannot waive her own rights without parental permission or legal counsel, cannot waive her parent\u2019s privacy rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-5\"><em>Schwarz, </em>\u00b6 14 (citing <em>State v. Allen, </em>188 Mont. 135, 612 P.2d 199 (1980) (holding that pursuant to \u00a741-5-303, MCA (the predecessor to \u00a741-5-331, MCA), a sixteen-year-old youth could not, without the agreement of her parents or advice of counsel, consent to a search of her own apartment)).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">\u00b633 The State argues that <em>Schwarz </em>is factually distinguishable from the instant case and, therefore, inapplicable, because the officers were lawfully at Ellis\u2019s home because of the alleged sexual assault upon S.S. The State maintains that <em>Schwarz </em>was not designed to protect a parent who commits a crime against a child in the child\u2019s own bedroom by prohibiting the child from assisting in the investigation of the crime. To that end, the State argues that a teenager should have at least common authority, in conjunction with her parent, over her bedroom and the personal contents therein and, therefore, actual authority to take police to her bedroom and turn over items personal to her to assist the police in investigating the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">\u00b634 The State ignores the fact that the underlying principle of <em>Schwarz </em>establishes that while a parent may grant a minor child joint access or use of the family home, the parent retains control of the home and the right to rescind the authority given to the child. Furthermore, a parent does not surrender the privacy of his home to the discretion of the child, but rather, \u201cthe child has privacy at the discretion of the parent.\u201d <em>Schwarz, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">\u00b635 That said, we also emphasize that under Article II, Section 15 of the Montana Constitution, persons under eighteen years of age enjoy the same fundamental rights-including the right of privacy-that are guaranteed to adults. In this case and in <em>Schwarz-type </em>cases, however, the focus is on the violation of the privacy rights of the parent in the control of his or her home. The focus is not on the general privacy rights of the child-except where, as with the underwear that S.S. was wearing during the alleged assault-society would recognize as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>reasonable a person\u2019s privacy interest in the intimate apparel that she or he was wearing at the time. Consequently, in this case, S.S. was not asserting her own constitutional rights; rather, she was attempting to waive her father\u2019s constitutional right to privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">\u00b636 Thus, in creating a <em>per se </em>rule that children under sixteen lack the authority to consent to warrantless searches, our decision in <em>Schwarz </em>did not carve out an exception for child victims. As the District Court aptly pointed out in its Memorandum and Order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-5\">Officers had authority to respond to the residence and meet with the victim in order to check on her welfare. The officers\u2019 presence in the residence for that purpose may have allowed for a warrantless seizure of evidence in \u201cplain view\u201d of the officers in the main entry or living area of the residence. That is not the situation complained of in this case. The 13-year-old victim lacked the capacity or authority to consent to a search of [Ellis\u2019s] residence, particularly to a search of second floor areas of the house that cannot be seen from the main living area.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">\u00b637 Contrary to the State\u2019s assertions, the rule announced in <em>Schwarz </em>does not prevent law enforcement officers from responding to the calls of potential child victims. As Ellis points out in his brief on appeal, Officer Murphy certainly had a duty to respond to the dispatch to Ellis\u2019s residence to meet with S.S. However, that duty only applied to making sure that S.S. was safe and that any potential evidence would not be destroyed. Indeed, in <em>Georgia v. Randolph, </em>547 U.S. 103, 118-19, 126 S. Ct. 1515, 1525-26 (2006), the United States Supreme Court acknowledged that requiring a warrant when consent to search is disputed does not prevent law enforcement officers from protecting victims of domestic violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">\u00b638 When Officer Murphy realized that he was dealing with a potential child sexual abuse crime, he asked that a detective be dispatched to the scene to follow through with the investigation. Officer Murphy could easily have requested that officers obtain a search warrant and meet him at the residence. The State conceded that there were no exigent circumstances in this case. Although visibly upset, S.S. was not in any imminent danger, and Ellis was immediately taken into custody and transported to the police station where he was held for several hours. The officers could have secured the home to prevent the destruction of any evidence until a search warrant arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">\u00b639 In addition, it was the middle of a weekday afternoon and there should have been any number of neutral and detached magistrates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>available to review an application for a search warrant. We indicated in <em>McLees </em>the rationale behind the warrant requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-4\">The presence of a search warrant serves a high function. Absent some grave emergency, the Fourth Amendment [and Article II, Section 11 of the Montana Constitution] [have] interposed a magistrate between the citizen and the police. This was done not to shield criminals nor to make the home a safe haven for illegal activities. It was done so that an objective mind might weigh the need to invade that privacy in order to enforce the law. The right of privacy was deemed too precious to entrust to the discretion of those whose job is the detection of crime and the arrest of criminals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-5\"><em>McLees, </em>\u00b6 26 (quoting <em>State v. Sorenson, </em>180 Mont. 269, 274-75, 590 P.2d 136, 140 (1979), <em>overruled in part by State v. Loh, </em>275 Mont. 460, 914 P.2d 592 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">\u00b640 Here, the State ignores the multidimensional analysis in <em>Schwarz </em>and assumes that we did not consider in that case the possibility of a child calling the police to report a crime. On the contrary, one of the first cases we cited in <em>Schwarz </em>considered the possibility that a child may consent to a search of the home after reporting that they were the victim of or a witness to a crime. <em>Schwarz, </em>\u00b6 11 (citing <em>Abdella v. O\u2019Toole, </em>343 F.Supp.2d 129, 135 (D.Conn. 2004)). In <em>Abdella, </em>the federal district court cited in turn to two cases from lower courts that found that children had authority to consent to home searches after alleging that they were the subject of sexual abuse crimes. <em>Abdella, </em>343 F.Supp.2d at 135 n. 1 (citing <em>Murphy v. State, </em>355 So. 2d 1153 (Ala. Crim. App. 1978) (twelve-year-old sexual abuse victim consented to search of residence); <em>State v. Folkens, </em>281 N.W.2d 1 (Iowa 1979) (fourteen-year-old sexual abuse victim consented to search of residence)).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">\u00b641 We also discussed in <em>Schwarz </em>a case wherein a child was the witness to a crime. In <em>Davis v. State, </em>422 S.E.2d 546 (Ga. 1992), the ten-year-old stepson of the defendant called the police to report the presence of illegal drugs in the home. When the officers arrived, the child met them outside and then showed them into the home to the locations where the child knew his mother and stepfather kept their illegal drugs. The court in <em>Davis </em>recognized that while it was appropriate for the child to call police for assistance and for the police to respond, once the officers realized that no present danger existed, they should not have entered the home based solely on the consent of the child. <em>Davis, </em>422 S.E.2d at 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>\u00b642 In the case <em>subjudice, </em>the State argued that the officers had every right to seize items in plain view. However, the items seized in this case were not in plain view. They were located in an upstairs bedroom out of Officer Murphy\u2019s view while he was speaking with S.S. in the living room of the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">\u00b643 The plain view doctrine \u201c \u2018allows peace officers, under certain circumstances, to seize evidence in plain view without a warrant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lewis, </em>\u00b6 22, (quoting <em>Loh, </em>275 Mont. at 468, 914 P.2d at 597). We stated in <em>Lewis, </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-5\">[i]f, while a law enforcement officer is lawfully present on an individual\u2019s property, and in the course of his or her lawful presence, the officer discovers evidence in plain view, and if its incriminating nature is \u2018immediately apparent,\u201d then that evidence may be seized and used against the defendant at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANu\"><em>Lewis, </em>\u00b6 22 (citing <em>DeWitt, </em>\u00b6 25; <em>State v. Bassett, </em>1999 MT 109, \u00b6 52, 294 Mont. 327, 982 P.2d 410; <em>State </em>v. <em>Weaselboy, </em>1999 MT 274, \u00b6 23, 296 Mont. 503, 989 P.2d 836; <em>Loh, </em>275 Mont. at 473, 914 P.2d at 600). However, we explained in <em>Lewis </em>that \u201c\u2018plain view\u2019 does not permit the officer to proceed or intrude without a warrant to the location of the evidence in question. To the contrary, the doctrine\u2019s applicability <em>depends </em>on the officer\u2019s lawful presence and right of access to the evidence.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>\u00b6 24 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">\u00b644 In this case, the evidence seized-the bedding and clothing-was taken from S.S.\u2019s bedroom. Setting aside for the moment the issue of whether the officers were lawfully present in the living room of the residence while they spoke with S.S., the bedding and clothing were not within the officer\u2019s plain view from that vantage point. Instead, the officers had to walk through the house and up the stairs to get to S.S.\u2019s bedroom. Consequently, the plain view doctrine is not applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">\u00b645 Additionally, after returning to the stationhouse, Detective Holland filled out a Permission to Search Form and had S.S. sign it. However, even if S.S. had the capacity and authority to consent to a search of the residence, which we have already determined she did not, this after-the-fact written consent was ineffective. We determined in <em>Hubbel, </em>that \u201cto be valid and qualify as an exception to the warrant requirement, a consent must <em>precede </em>a search.\u201d <em>Hubbel, </em>286 Mont. at 216, 951 P.2d at 980 (emphasis added). Along those same lines, the United States Supreme Court concluded that \u2018to be lawful, a search and seizure must be justified <em>from the beginning\u201d Hubbel, </em>286 Mont. at 216, 951 P.2d at 981 (emphasis added) (citing <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>U.S. 1, 88 S. Ct. 1868 (1968)). The reasoning behind this is that \u2018la] search validated by a \u2018retroactive consent\u2019 is not really a search conducted pursuant to a consent at all. Rather, at the moment of inception, the search is unlawful and unjustified.\u201d <em>Hubbel, </em>286 Mont. at 216, 951 P.2d at 980. Moreover, \u201c[allowing an after-the-fact \u2018consent\u2019 to justify an otherwise lawless search and seizure would erode the suppression rule\u2019s deterrent <em>foree.\u201d Hubbel, </em>286 Mont. at 217, 951 P.2d at 981.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">\u00b646 In its brief on appeal, the State raised the issue of inevitable discovery arguing that because the officers clearly had probable cause to seek a search warrant, the evidence would have been discovered eventually. Ellis argues, on the other hand, that inevitable discovery is not only factually insupportable in this case, it is procedurally inappropriate because the State did not raise this issue in the court below. The State only mentioned the inevitable discovery doctrine in a heading to one section of its brief in opposition to Ellis\u2019s motion to suppress. The State did not thereafter discuss the issue or analyze how it applied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">\u00b647 We have repeatedly held that we will not address issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>State v. Ferguson, 2005 </em>MT 343, \u00b6 38, 330 Mont. 103, 126 P.3d 463 (citing <em>State v. Adgerson, </em>2003 MT 284, \u00b6 12, 318 Mont. 22, 78 P.3d 850; <em>State v. Peterson, </em>2002 MT 65, \u00b6 24, 309 Mont. 199, 44 P.3d 499). However, we concluded in <em>State v. Dickinson, </em>2008 MT 159, \u00b6 24, 343 Mont. 301, 184 P.3d 305, that the question of whether evidence would have been inevitably discovered is one we can answer <em>sua sponte, </em>provided there is a sufficient record before us to make that determination. Consequently, we will address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"ALr\">\u00b648 The inevitable discovery doctrine is an exception to the exclusionary rule. <em>Dickinson, </em>\u00b6 19. \u2018The exclusionary rule bars evidence obtained as a result of an unconstitutional search or seizure, also known as \u2018fruit of the poisonous tree,\u2019 and is the primary vehicle which helps to ensure protection from an -unreasonable governmental search or seizure.\u201d Dickinson, \u00b6 19 (citing <em>State v. Ottwell, </em>239 Mont. 150, 154, 779 P.2d 500, 502 (1989)). \u2018The purpose of the exclusionary rule is to \u2018deter illegal police conduct and preserve judicial integrity.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Malkuch, </em>2007 MT 60, \u00b6 13, 336 Mont. 219, 154 P.3d 558 (quoting <em>State v. Long, </em>216 Mont. 65, 71, 700 P.2d 153, 157 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"AJM\">\u00b649 The three general exceptions to the exclusionary rule are: (1) if the evidence is attenuated from the constitutional violation so as to remove its primary taint; (2) if the evidence is obtained from an independent source; and (3) if it is inevitable that the evidence would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>have been discovered apart from the constitutional violation. <em>Dickinson, </em>\u00b6 19 (citing <em>State v. Allies, </em>186 Mont. 99, 117, 606 P.2d 1043, 1052-53 (1979)). Thus, \u201c[t]he inevitable discovery exception allows the introduction of illegally obtained evidence where the government proves by a preponderance of the evidence \u2018that the tainted evidence would inevitably have been discovered through lawful means.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Mejia, </em>69 F.3d 309, 319 (9th Cir. 1995) (citing <em>United States v. Ramirez-Sandoval, </em>872 F.2d 1392, 1396 (9th Cir. 1989); <em>United States v. Echegoyen, </em>799 F.2d 1271, 1280 n. 7 (9th Cir. 1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">\u00b650 The United States Supreme Court adopted the inevitable discovery doctrine in <em>Nix v. Williams, </em>467 U.S. 431, 104 S. Ct. 2501 (1984). In that case, a ten-year-old girl was abducted from a YMCA in Des Moines, Iowa. Shortly after she disappeared, Williams was seen leaving the YMCA carrying a large bundle wrapped in a blanket. Sometime later, several items of clothing belonging to the girl and some of Williams\u2019 clothing were found at a rest stop between Des Moines and Davenport, Iowa. The Iowa Bureau of Criminal Investigation initiated a large-scale search for the girl with two hundred volunteers searching the area near the rest stop. <em>Nix, </em>467 U.S. at 434-35, 104 S. Ct. 2504.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">\u00b651 Williams surrendered to the police in Davenport after a warrant was issued for his arrest. Williams contacted an attorney in Des Moines who arranged for an attorney in Davenport to meet Williams at the Davenport police station. The Des Moines police informed counsel that they would pick up Williams in Davenport and return him to Des Moines without questioning him. Two detectives from Des Moines drove to Davenport, took Williams into custody and proceeded to drive him back to Des Moines. During the trip, contrary to orders, one of the detectives began a conversation with Williams wherein the detective appealed to Williams\u2019 \u201cdecent human instincts.\u201d <em>Nix, </em>467 U.S. at 435-36, 447, 104 S. Ct. at 2504-05, 2510. The detective told Williams that since they would be driving past the area where it was suspected Williams had disposed of the girl\u2019s body, they could stop and Williams could show them the exact location of her body so that her parents could give her a Christian burial. Eventually, Williams agreed and he guided the officers to the body which was about two miles from the interstate highway and essentially within the area that was being searched. <em>Nix, </em>467 U.S. at 435-36, 104 S. Ct. 2504-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">\u00b652 Thereafter, Williams was indicted for first-degree murder. His counsel moved to suppress evidence of the body and all related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>evidence on the grounds that it was the fruit or product of Williams\u2019 statements made without the benefit of counsel during the trip from Davenport to Des Moines. The motion to suppress was denied and Williams was convicted. <em>Nix, </em>467 U.S. at 436-37, 104 S. Ct. at 2505. Williams\u2019 conviction was subsequently reversed by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa on the basis that the officers had obtained incriminating statements from Williams by what was viewed as interrogation in violation of his right to counsel. The United States Supreme Court affirmed in <em>Brewer v. Williams, </em>430 U.S. 387, 97 S. Ct. 1232 (1977), noting that although Williams\u2019 incriminating statements could not be introduced into evidence at a second trial, evidence of the body s location and condition \u201cmight well be admissible on the theory that the body would have been discovered in any event, even had incriminating statements not been elicited from Williams.\u201d <em>Brewer, </em>430 U.S. at 407 n. 12, 97 S. Ct. at 1243 n. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">\u00b653 At Williams\u2019 second trial, the prosecution did not offer Williams\u2019 statements into evidence, nor did it seek to show that Williams had directed the police to the girl\u2019s body. However, evidence of the condition of her body as it was found, articles and photographs of her clothing, and the results of post-mortem medical and chemical tests on the body were admitted. Williams was again found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. On appeal, the Iowa Supreme Court affirmed holding that even if Williams had not guided police to the girl\u2019s body, it would have been found by the search party. <em>Nix, </em>467 U.S. at 439, 104 S. Ct. at 2506.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">\u00b654 The United States Supreme Court agreed with the Iowa Supreme Court and adopted in <em>Nix </em>the inevitable discovery exception to the exclusionary rule. <em>Nix, </em>467 U.S. at 448, 104 S. Ct. at 2511. Regarding the exclusionary rule itself, the Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-6\">The core rationale consistently advanced by this Court for extending the exclusionary rule to evidence that is the fruit of unlawful police conduct has been that this admittedly drastic and socially costly course is needed to deter police from violations of constitutional and statutory protections. This Court has accepted the argument that the way to ensure such protections is to exclude evidence seized as a result of such violations notwithstanding the high social cost of letting persons obviously guilty go unpunished for their crimes. On this rationale, the prosecution is not to be put in a better position than it would have been in if no illegality had transpired.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-7\"><em>Nix, </em>467 U.S. at 442-443, 104 S. Ct. at 2508. And, as to the inevitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>discovery exception to the exclusionary rule, the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-4\">It is clear that the cases implementing the exclusionary rule begin with the premise that the challenged evidence is in some sense the product of illegal governmental activity. Of course, this does not end the inquiry. If the prosecution can establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the information ultimately or inevitably would have been discovered by lawful means-here the volunteers\u2019 search-then the deterrence rationale has so little basis that the evidence should be received.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-5\"><em>Nix, </em>467 U.S. at 444, 104 S. Ct. at 2509 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">\u00b655 In general, inevitable discovery most often applies when the investigatory procedures were already in progress prior to the illegal search. <em>See Nix, </em>467 U.S. at 435, 104 S. Ct. at 2504-05 (two hundred volunteers were already searching the area where the child\u2019s body had been abandoned before the defendant gave an illegally obtained statement about the exact location of the body); <em>see also State v. Notti, </em>2003 MT 170, 316 Mont. 345, 71 P.3d 1233 (multiple DNA databases matching the defendant to another crime were already established before the search); <em>Dickinson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 3-7 (upon speaking with the occupants of a hotel room on another matter, officers observed through the open door the presence of weapons; the officers first secured the room and the weapons before applying for a search warrant); <em>State v. Lacey, </em>2009 MT 62, 349 Mont. 371, 204 P.3d 1192 (defendant\u2019s computer containing images of defendant sexually abusing his girlfriend\u2019s minor daughter was not searched based on girlfriend\u2019s consent, but pursuant to a federal search warrant); <em>State v. Adkins, </em>2009 MT 71, 349 Mont. 444, 204 P.3d 1 (imminent probation search of residence inevitably would have led to discovery of drugs).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">\u00b656 The point is that the evidence seized from S.S.\u2019s bedroom was not the inevitable product of a legal search already in progress as in <em>Nix, Notti, Dickinson, Lacey </em>and Adkins. The police who responded to Ellis\u2019 s residence had no authority to search any part of his home, much less seize evidence of a crime which he allegedly committed; the officers were not involved in a legal search already in progress when they seized evidence from S.S.\u2019s bedroom and person.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">\u00b657 In addition, Ellis notes in his brief on appeal that the State\u2019s proposal to apply the inevitable discovery doctrine in this case would sabotage the deterrence rationale of the exclusionary rule. Allowing the introduction of evidence under the inevitable discovery doctrine in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>this case would \u201camount to the unacceptable assertion that police would have done it right had they not done it wrong.\u201d <em>State v. Davolt, </em>84 P.3d 456, 469 (Ariz. 2004); <em>see also State v. Topanotes, </em>76 P.3d 1159, 1164 (Utah 2003) (\u2018the argument that \u2018if we hadn\u2019t done it wrong, we would have done it right\u2019 is far from compelling\u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>955 F.2d 207, 210 (4th Cir. 1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">\u00b658 In the instant case, not only was there no attempt to apply for a search warrant, there was no intent to do so. Detective Holland testified at the suppression hearing that, at the time, he did not feel that he needed a warrant because S.S. admitted the officers into the home. Detective Holland further stated at the hearing that he still believed he did not need a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">\u00b659 In <em>Mejia, </em>the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the contention that the inevitable discovery doctrine applied where law enforcement officers had probable cause to conduct a search, but simply failed to obtain a warrant. <em>Mejia, </em>69 F.3d at 319. In so holding, the Court of Appeals explained that it has never applied the inevitable discovery exception</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-6\">so as to excuse the failure to obtain a search warrant where the police had probable cause but simply did not attempt to obtain a warrant. As we stated in <em>Echegoyen, </em>to \u201cexcuse the failure to obtain a warrant merely because the officers had probable cause and could have obtained a warrant would completely obviate the warrant requirement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-7\"><em>Mejia, </em>69 F.3d at 320 (citing <em>Echegoyen, </em>799 F.2d at 1280 n. 7; <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>22 F.3d 674, 683 (6th Cir. 1994)). The Court of Appeals further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-8\">If evidence were admitted notwithstanding the officers\u2019 unexcused failure to obtain a warrant, simply because probable cause existed, then there would never be <em>any </em>reason for officers to seek a warrant. To apply the inevitable discovery doctrine whenever the police could have obtained a warrant but chose not to would in effect eliminate the warrant requirement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-9\">We are neither free nor willing to read the warrant requirement out of the Constitution. Accordingly, even if we assume that the detectives were in possession of competent evidence showing probable cause at the time of the search, the inevitable discovery doctrine would not justify introduction of the evidence seized without a warrant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-10\"><em>Mejia, </em>69 F.3d at 320 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"A2J\">\u00b660 Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the evidence seized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>from Ellis\u2019 s residence, with the exception of S.S.\u2019s underwear, must be suppressed because they were the product of an illegal search and seizure. Although the State indicated at oral argument before this Court that S.S. had turned over her underwear to the officers at the stationhouse, in fact, all of the evidence seized, including her underwear, were taken from the residence by the officers. At the suppression hearing, Detective Holland testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-4\">Q. [by Deputy County Attorney] ...Now, you indicate that after taking the photographs you recovered the items from the victim\u2019s bedroom. What specifically did you recover?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-5\">A. We recovered a pajama top, a pajama bottom, upper sheet, fitted sheet, a multicolored comforter, knitted, and a green fluffy comforter, and the victim\u2019s underwear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\">Q. Okay. And all these were located from this one bedroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-7\">A. All were located in the one bedroom. The victim actually had the underwear on at the time. And while Captain Conway and I were there, we had her-she changed clothes and we took the underwear. But everything else was in the room, yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2n\">\u00b661 Nevertheless, we conclude that Ellis did not have an actual subjective expectation of privacy that society would find objectively reasonable in the underwear that S.S. was wearing at the time the alleged assault occurred. <em>Goetz, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"AeS\">\u00b662 Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in granting Ellis\u2019s motion to suppress all of the evidence, with the exception of S.S.\u2019s underwear.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">\u00b663 That said, the dissents have raised several contentions that require a response. First, Justice Leaphart argues that no search occurred in this case. Dissent, \u00b6 80. On the contrary, this Court has repeatedly stated that a search is \u201c\u2018the use of some means of gathering evidence which infringes upon a person\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Goetz, </em>\u00b6 25 (quoting <em>Hardaway, </em>\u00b6 16); <em>see also State v. Elison, </em>2000 MT 288, \u00b6 48, 302 Mont. 228, 14 P.3d 456. Here, Officer Murphy testified at the suppression hearing that <em>he asked </em>S.S. to show him where the alleged assault took place. Moreover, law enforcement officers entered the second floor of the home not once, but three times, to gather evidence. In doing so, they photographed the bedroom and its contents before taking the bedding and clothing. Clearly, a search occurred in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">\u00b664 Furthermore, there were no exigent circumstances her emo threat of violence or destruction of evidence existed. The District Court noted in its order suppressing the evidence that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>[djefendant already had been detained before investigators seized the victim\u2019s bedding and clothing from her bedroom. There was no danger of loss or destruction of the evidence if investigators had waited to apply for and obtain a search warrant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">In fact, the officers had a four-hour window-irom the time they arrived on the scene until the time they released Ellis after interrogating him-in which the officers could have obtained a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">\u00b665 Second, Justice Leaphart argues that this was merely a \u201cdelivery\u201d and he cites to several cases wherein evidence was simply turned over to law enforcement officers. Dissent, \u00b6 80. However, unlike the instant case, only one of the cases cited by Justice Leaphart involved gathering evidence from <em>inside </em>the defendant\u2019s home, and in two of the cases, it was the defendant that \u201cdelivered\u201d the evidence to the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">\u00b666 In State v. <em>Arthun, </em>274 Mont. 82, 906 P.2d 216 (1995), officers were tracking a UPS parcel that they knew contained illegal drugs. They obtained a warrant to search defendant\u2019s residence, but, failing to find the parcel in the house, they asked defendant where it was. Defendant led the officers to a storage shed where they retrieved the parcel. <em>Arthun, </em>274 Mont. at 84-86, 906 P.2d at 217-18. Similarly, in <em>State v. Graves, </em>191 Mont. 81, 622 P.2d 203 (1981), <em>overruled in part by State v. Archambault, </em>2007 MT 26, 336 Mont. 6, 152 P.3d 698, the defendant had been involved in a fight wherein one person was stabbed. Sometime later, an officer approached the defendant as he was walking down the street and asked him if he was the one that had been involved in the fight and if a knife was used. The defendant responded affirmatively and handed the knife to the officer. <em>Graves, </em>191 Mont. at 83-85, 622 P.2d at 205-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">\u00b667 Conversely, in <em>State v. Carlson, </em>198 Mont. 113, 644 P.2d 498 (1982), two officers appeared at the defendant\u2019s door with what later turned out to be an invalid arrest warrant. In making the arrest, the officers entered the defendant\u2019s front room where they observed drug paraphernalia. The officers did not seize or touch anything at that time. They later returned to the house with a search warrant. That search produced drugs and a stolen pistol. This Court held that the original entry into defendant\u2019s home was unlawful and that the officers\u2019 visual observations of drug paraphernalia inside the home constituted an unconstitutional search. <em>Carlson, </em>198 Mont. at 115-117, 125, 644 P.2d at 499-500, 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">\u00b668 In this case, S.S. did not \u201cdeliver\u201d the items to the officers, with the exception of her underwear. The officers walked through the house to an upstairs bedroom where they collected the evidence after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>photographing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">\u00b669 Third, Justice Leaphart also relies on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Georgia v. Randolph, </em>547 U.S. 103, 126 S. Ct. 1515 (2006), pointing out that the police have the authority to enter a dwelling to protect a resident from domestic violence, and in doing so, they may seize any evidence in plain view. Dissent, \u00b6 79. Contrary to Justice Leaphart\u2019s implication, there was no one else at the residence at the time Officer Murphy arrived, thus there was nothing and no one that Officer Murphy needed to protect S.S. from. In fact, if Officer Murphy and Detective Holland believed that S.S. needed protecting, they would not have left her alone downstairs in the living room while they searched her bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">\u00b670 Furthermore, the evidence obtained from the bedroom was not in \u201cplain view\u201d as this Court has defined that term. The \u201cplain view\u201d doctrine requires that not only must the officers be lawfully located in a place from which the object can be plainly seen, but they must also have a lawful right of access to the object itself. <em>Loh, </em>275 Mont. at 473, 914 P.2d at 598 <em>(citing Horton v. California, </em>496 U.S. 128, 136-37, 110 S. Ct. 2301, 2308 (1990)). While Officer Murphy may have \u201clegitimately\u201d been in the living room as Justice Leaphart contends, that did not give Officer Murphy free access to the remainder of the house. In addition, Officer Murphy testified at the suppression hearing that he did not see any evidence of a crime from where he was in the living room.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">\u00b671 Fourth, in his dissent, Judge Simonton argues that <em>Schwarz </em>was wrongly decided and that it should be overruled. Dissent, \u00b6 88. While counsel for the State requested at oral argument that this Court overrule <em>Schwarz, </em>the State argued in the lower court and in its brief on appeal to this Court, that <em>Schwarz </em>need not be overruled. Instead, the State asked that we create an exception for child victims. We are not inclined to relitigate <em>Schwarz </em>in this case as <em>Schwarz </em>was founded on solid legal grounds. Furthermore, contrary to the arguments in both dissents, the fact that a child may be a victim of a crime does not prevent law enforcement officers from investigating that crime and in searching a residence after obtaining the proper warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">\u00b672 Fifth, Judge Simonton also contends that in <em>Schwarz </em>and in the instant case, we failed to observe the rights of minors as set forth in Article II, Section 15 of the Montana Constitution. Dissent, \u00b6\u00b6 88,100. While the drafters of the Constitution certainly intended to provide those Montana citizens under eighteen years of age with all of the fundamental rights afforded to adults in Montana, they did not intend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>to eliminate the right of parents to govern their children. As Delegate Dahood pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-4\">There is a constitutional controversy throughout this land as to whether or not the basic protections of the Bill of Rights shall be applied to those persons who are not adults, with respect to arrest, detention and trial. We are not, in this situation, affecting in any way the relationship of parent and child or of guardian and ward with respect to someone under the age of majority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AzV\">Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 8, 1972, p. 1751.</p>\n<p id=\"ASV\">\u00b673 In closing, it, again, bears emphasizing that in Montana \u201cwarrantless searches conducted inside a home are <em>per se </em>unreasonable, subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.\u201d <em>McLees, </em>\u00b6 10. Both the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 11 of the Montana Constitution protect citizens against unreasonable searches and seizures, and require warrants issued upon probable cause prior to a search by law enforcement officials. Warrantless searches are considered <em>per se </em>unreasonable unless an exception to the warrant requirement applies. <em>State v. Ruggirello, </em>2008 MT 8, \u00b6 17, 341 Mont. 88, 176 P.3d 252 (citing <em>State v. Case, </em>2007 MT 161, \u00b6 19, 338 Mont. 87, 162 P.3d 849). Indeed, the fundamental purpose-the <em>raison </em>d\u2019etre-for the constitutional guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures is to protect the privacy and security of individuals and to safeguard the sanctity of the home against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials. <em>Dorwart v. Caraway, </em>1998 MT 191, \u00b6 21, 290 Mont. 196, 966 P.2d 1121, <em>overruled on other grounds by Trustees of Indiana University v. Buxbaum, </em>2003 MT 97, 315 Mont. 210, 69 P.3d 663 (citing <em>Camara v. Municipal Court, </em>387 U.S. 523, 528, 87 S. Ct. 1727, 1730 (1967); <em>State v. Gray, </em>152 Mont. 145, 149, 447 P.2d 475, 477 (1968)). \u2018The home is the most sanctified of all \u2018particular places\u2019 referred to in the Fourth Amendment,\u201d <em>State v. Graham, </em>2004 MT 385, \u00b6 22, 325 Mont. 110, 103 P.3d 1073, and it is for that reason that the exceptions to the warrant requirement are, concomitantly, jealously guarded and carefully drawn. These exceptions include: consent, freely and voluntarily given, <em>State v. Bieber, </em>2007 MT 262, \u00b6 29, 339 Mont 309, 170 P.3d 444; a search incident to a lawful arrest, <em>Hardaway, </em>\u00b6 36 (citing \u00a7 46-5-102, MCA); and exigent circumstances coupled with probable cause, <em>State v. Stone, </em>2004 MT 151, \u00b6 18, 321 Mont. 489, 92 P.3d 1178.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">\u00b674 Within the context of this case, none of these exceptions apply. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>Here, the police had every opportunity to obtain a warrant to seize evidence within Ellis\u2019s home; they simply chose not to. Rather, they chose the expedient route over the constitutional one. Justice Brand\u00e9is observed in <em>Olmstead v. United States, </em>277 U.S. 438, 485, 48 S. Ct. 564, 575 (1928) (Brandeis, J., dissenting):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-4\">Decency, security, and liberty alike demand that government officials shall be subjected to the same rules of conduct that are commands to the citizen. In a government of laws, existence of the government will be imperiled if it fails to observe the law scrupulously. Our Government is the potent, the omnipresent teacher. For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example. Crime is contagious. If the Government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for law; it invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy. To declare that in the administration of the criminal law the end justifies the means ... would bring terrible retribution. Against that pernicious doctrine this Court should resolutely set its face.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">\u00b675 Importantly, if this Court refuses to scrupulously uphold and enforce the guarantees of the Fourth Amendment and Article II, Sections 10 and 11, then, we can be assured that no other branch of government will. By parsing the protections of the Fourth Amendment and Article II, Sections 10 and 11; by creating fact-oriented exceptions to the warrant requirement to justify a palatable result in the hard case; and by refusing to hold the police to the clearly defined rule that, especially in the home, warrantless searches and seizures are <em>per se </em>unreasonable, we enable-indeed, we encourage-precisely the contempt for the law against which Justice Brand\u00e9is warned. And, if this structure of enablement remains unchallenged and unchanged, then the criminal justice system will always end up re-creating fundamentally the same mistakes, the same evils, the same dysfunction, and the same violations of our citizens\u2019 constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">\u00b676 Affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b141-7\">JUSTICES COTTER and WARNER and DISTRICT JUDGE SANDEFUR, sitting for CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b123-8\"> Ellis also moved to suppress any statements he made while in custody contending that they were not made knowingly and voluntarily.

As to the victim\u2019s panties, the court reverses, concluding that: \u2018The focus is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>not on the general privacy rights of the child-except where, as with the underwear that S.S. was wearing during the alleged assault-society would recognize as reasonable a person\u2019s privacy interest in the intimate apparel that she or he was wearing at the time.\u201d <em>Opinion, </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">\u00b678 I agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that society would recognize as reasonable a person\u2019s privacy interest in the intimate apparel that she or he was wearing at the time of the assault and that, \u2018Ellis did not have an actual subjective expectation of privacy that society would find objectively reasonable in the underwear that S.S. was wearing at the time the alleged assault occurred.\u201d <em>Opinion, </em>\u00b6 61. Having recognized 5.5.\u2019s expectation of privacy in her underwear, and Ellis\u2019s lack of such expectation, the Court fails to follow through on its own logic. First, the Court has recognized that, although the defendant may have a right of privacy in the house, that does not necessarily mean he has a privacy interest in all the contents (e.g. his daughter\u2019s underwear). Secondly, if S.S. had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the \u2018intimate apparel that she was wearing\u201d at the time of the assault, why does she not have that same expectation of privacy in the pajamas that she was wearing at the time or the bedding that she was sleeping in at the time of the assault? Are they somehow less \u2018intimate\u201d in a constitutional sense? If so, the distinction escapes me.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">\u00b679 As to the question of whether the officer engaged in a search upon entering the living room to talk with S.S., I do not think that it was unreasonable for Officer Murphy, who, in responding to a call about a sexual assault, approached the house not knowing that the victim was a minor and not knowing that the alleged assailant was her father or who else, if anyone, was in the house. It cannot seriously be argued that it was unreasonable for the officer to enter the living room at 5.5.\u2019s request to talk with her. Officer Murphy was legitimately in the house. As the United States Supreme Court recognized in <em>Georgia v. Randolph, </em>547 U.S. 103, 118, 126 S. Ct. 1515, 1525 (2006):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-8\">No question has been raised, or reasonably could be, about the authority of the police to enter a dwelling to protect a resident from domestic violence; so long as they have good reason to believe such a threat exists, it would be silly to suggest that the police would commit a tort by entering, say, to give a complaining tenant the opportunity to collect belongings and get out safely, or to determine whether violence (or threat of violence) has just occurred or is about to (or soon will) occur, however much a spouse or other co-tenant objected. (And since the police would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>then be lawfully in the premises, there is no question that they could seize any evidence in plain view or take further action supported by any consequent probable cause, <em>see Texas v. Brown, </em>460 U.S. 730, 737-39, 103 S. Ct. 1535 (1983) (plurality opinion).)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">(Emphasis added.) The question before the Court is whether items seized were fruits of a search or were items in which S.S. had a reasonable expectation of privacy and which she voluntary turned over to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">\u00b680 The items in question (bedding, pajamas, and underwear) were not discovered by virtue of a search. Evidence received by way of delivery is not a search; Ta] \u2018search\u2019 is a prying into hidden places for that which is concealed ....\u201d <em>State v. Arthun, </em>274 Mont. 82, 906 P.2d 216, 220 (1995) (citing <em>State v. Carlson, </em>198 Mont. 113, 118-19, 644 P.2d 498, 501 (1982)). In <em>Arthun, </em>we held that the officers had not conducted an independent inspection of the farm shed. Rather, they entered the shed at the defendant\u2019s invitation and \u201cretrieved the box which Bruce located for them.\u201d We concluded that \u201cthere was no prying or investigation, and thus no \u2018search\u2019 so as to implicate either the Fourth Amendment or the Montana Constitution.\u201d In <em>State v. Graves, </em>191 Mont. 81, 622 P.2d 203 (1981) (overruled on other grounds), the defendant had been involved in a knife fight. An officer approached him and asked if he had been involved in the fight. Graves said yes, he had. The officer asked if a knife had been involved. Graves said yes and turned the knife over to the police in response to the officer\u2019s inquiry. The Court held there was no search.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">\u00b681 The officers in the present case did not have to conduct a search for the items at issue. They opened no cupboards, closets, or drawers in order to find them. Rather, S.S. showed the officer her bedroom, retrieved her pajamas, bedding and underwear, and relinquished them to the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">\u00b682 The Court relies heavily on our decision in <em>State v. Schwarz, </em>2006 MT 120, 332 Mont. 243, 136 P.3d 989. The question in <em>Schwarz </em>was whether a minor child had the capacity to waive the parent\u2019s right of privacy. Unlike this case there was no issue as to whether the child had a superior expectation of privacy in any of the items seized. We did say in <em>Schwarz </em>that \u201cthe child has privacy at the discretion of the parent.\u201d <em>Schwarz, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">\u00b683 We have previously recognized that once a person voluntarily relinquishes or abandons his property, his expectation of privacy in that property is abandoned as well. <em>See State v. 1993 Chevrolet Pickup, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>2005 MT 180, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 328 Mont. 10, 116 P.3d 800. The owner\u2019s intent with respect to the property, as determined by his actions or statements, establishes whether the owner has abandoned his property. The same reasoning applies in the present case. Assuming for sake of argument that Ellis bought the bedding, pajamas, and underwear in question and thus, had a proprietary interest in them, he voluntarily relinquished any expectation of privacy in those items when he gave them to S.S. to wear and sleep in. From that point on, society would undoubtedly recognize that S.S. had a reasonable expectation of privacy-not just in the underwear, but also in the bedding and the pajamas she was wearing. Conversely, once Ellis relinquished the items to S.S., he gave up his control of the items and could no longer claim a reasonable expectation of privacy in his daughter\u2019s panties, bedding, or pajamas. As the owner of the home, Ellis could seek to suppress any foundational testimony from the officers about what they saw while in the bedroom or any pictures they took in the home. However, because Ellis did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the items themselves, he has no standing to challenge the seizure of those items.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">\u00b684 The Court draws the bold conclusion that \u2018S.S. was not asserting her own constitutional rights, rather, she was attempting to waive her father\u2019s constitutional right to privacy.\u201d <em>Opinion, </em>\u00b6 35. This is a puzzling conclusion indeed. One would normally conclude that a young girl in S.S.\u2019s situation was concentrating on her own welfare rather than the rights of her alleged assailant. S.S. is a minor who enjoys all the fundamental constitutional rights of an adult. <em>See </em>Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a715. In summoning the police and showing them the evidence that she had been assaulted, she was not seeking to waive her father\u2019s right to privacy. Rather, she was waiving her own rights of privacy and exercising her fundamental right to \u201cdefend her life and liberty,\u201d \u201cto seek her safety, health and happiness\u201d under Article II, Section 3 of the Montana Constitution, and her right to individual dignity under Article II, Section 15 of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">\u00b685 As indicated above, I believe that <em>Schwarz </em>is distinguishable in that the evidence here was not the fruit of a \u201csearch\u201d of the home, and, secondly, Ellis had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>evidence. However, to the extent that <em>Schwarz </em>is interpreted as dictating the result reached by the Court, I would endorse a victim\u2019s exception to the per se rule that a minor cannot consent to the search of her parents\u2019 home. The exception would be limited to crimes against the person, Title 45, chapter 5, MCA, that were alleged to have been committed against the minor which occurred in the home in question. There should be a distinction between situations in which a minor consents to a search, essentially acting as a third party as between the parent and law enforcement and situations in which the minor, as a first party victim, consents to a search in the interest of asserting her own rights of safety, well-being, and privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">\u00b686 In an apparent effort to foreclose a \u2018Victim exception\u201d to the per se rule, the Court suggests that in <em>Schwarz </em>\u201cwe considered the possibility of a child calling the police to report a crime\u201d when we cited to the case of <em>Abdella v. </em>O\u2019Toole, 343 F. Supp. 2d 129 (D. Conn. 2004). <em>Opinion, </em>\u00b6 40. The <em>Abdella </em>case, however, was cited for the very narrow proposition that the majority of courts hold that \u201cthere is no <em>per se </em>rule that all minors lack the authority to consent to a search.\u201d <em>Schwarz, </em>\u00b6 11. Notably, the <em>Schwarz </em>Court rejected that majority position. Secondly, <em>Schwarz </em>does not discuss the particular facts or holding in <em>Abdella. </em>Finally, in <em>Abdella, </em>law enforcement officers, looking for Jim Abdella on suspicion of theft, knocked on the door of the Abdella home. Jim\u2019s 11-year-old sister Regina answered and arguably consented to their searching the house for her brother. Regina was neither a victim of nor a witness to a crime, nor had she reported a crime. To suggest that by citing to <em>Abdella </em>in <em>Schwarz </em>this Court has considered and rejected a victim\u2019s exception to the per se rule, strains the holding in <em>Schwarz </em>beyond recognition.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">\u00b687 I conclude that Ellis had no reasonable expectation of privacy in his daughter\u2019s pajamas, bedding, or underwear. In the alternative, to the extent he does have such an expectation, I would adopt a victim exception to the <em>Schwarz </em>per se rule. I would reverse the order of suppression.</p>\n<judges id=\"b145-6\">JUSTICE MORRIS joins in the dissenting Opinion of JUSTICE LEAPHART.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b144-6\"> Assume A is an overnight guest in B\u2019s house.

Schwarz, </em>2006 MT 120, 332 Mont. 243, 136 P.3d 989, for two reasons. First, it is inconsistent with Montana law and our analysis of consent-to-search cases. Rather than perpetuating bad law, the Court should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>use this opportunity to return to the totality of the circumstances approach. Secondly, holding that a child of thirteen may not invite officers into her home and may not give them evidence that supports her allegation that her father sexually abused her violates her constitutional rights. The Montana Constitution demands that all individuals be provided equal protection under the law and secures to them all fundamental rights whether they be thirteen or sixteen years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">\u00b689 With the exception of <em>Schwarz, </em>this Court has consistently applied a totality of the circumstances test to discern whether the person providing consent had common authority and if that consent was provided voluntarily. <em>State v. Clark, </em>2008 MT 419, \u00b6 27, 198 P.3d 809, 347 Mont. 354 (citing <em>State v. McLees, 2000 </em>MT 6, \u00b6 17, 298 Mont. 15, 994 P.2d 683). For example, in <em>State v. Lacey, </em>2009 MT 62, \u00b6 41, 349 Mont. 371, 204 P.3d 1192, we considered whether the area searched and items seized were marked, labeled, locked, or otherwise set apart. We also questioned whether members of the household had limited access to the area searched or if it was a communal space. <em>Lacey, </em>\u00b6 41. Further, in <em>State v. DeWitt, </em>2004 MT 317, \u00b6 30, 324 Mont. 39, 101 P.3d 277, we reflected upon whether all of the occupants of the residence used or had general access to the area searched.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">\u00b690 The goal of this multi-factor approach is to determine whether there is a sufficient relationship between the person providing consent and the area to be searched. <em>McLees, </em>\u00b6 17; <em>State v. Sorenson, </em>180 Mont. 269, 275-76, 590 P.2d 136, 140 (1979). As we stated in <em>McLees, </em>the authority which justifies consent rests upon:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\">mutual use of the property by persons generally having joint access or control for most purposes, so that it is reasonable to recognize that any of the co-inhabitants has the right to permit the inspection in his own right and that the others have assumed the risk that one of their number might permit the common area to be searched.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-7\"><em>McLees, </em>\u00b6 13 (quoting <em>U.S. v. Matlock, </em>415 U.S. 164, 171, 94 S. Ct. 988, 993 (1974)). In short, when a person allows a third party significant latitude in using or accessing his property, we have held it is reasonable to conclude the owner assumed the risk that the third party would assert control over the premises. <em>See McLees, </em>\u00b6 17; <em>Lacey, </em>\u00b6 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">\u00b691 <em>Schwarz </em>marked the first time this Court did not look at all of the key facts of the case to discern whether the consentingparty possessed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>the requisite authority to provide consent. Rather than following this well-established process for analyzing consent, the Court in <em>Schwarz </em>zeroed in on one fact-the age of the consenting party. It did so even after acknowledging that the majority of courts in other jurisdictions, which addressed whether a youth could provide consent to search, concluded there was no per se rule that age prevents consent, and these courts declined to create one. The Court refused to follow the majority, concluding that several of those courts relied upon the doctrine of apparent authority, a doctrine we rejected in <em>McLees. </em>However, the majority of those courts did not rely upon the doctrine of apparent authority, and found actual authority for a minor child to consent. <em>See In re Anthony F., </em>442 A.2d 975 (Md. 1982); <em>Iowa v. Folkens, </em>281 N.W.2d 1 (Iowa 1979); <em>Ill. v. Swansey, </em>379 N.E.2d 1279 (Ill. App. 1978); <em>Kan. v. Kriegh, </em>937 P.2d 453 (Kan. App. <em>1997); Reynolds v. Tex., </em>781 S.W.2d 351 (Tex. App. <em>1989); Doyle v. Alaska, </em>633 P.2d 306 (Alaska App. 1981); <em>Hembree v. Tenn., </em>546 S.W.2d 235 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1976); <em>Rajappa v. Ga., </em>408 S.E.2d 163 (Ga. App. 1991); <em>Minn. v. Lottan, </em>527 N.W.2d 840 (Minn. App. 1995). Oregon, like Montana, rejected the doctrine of apparent authority and includes age as only one factor to determine whether a third party has actual authority to provide consent to search. <em>Or. v. Will, </em>885 P.2d 715 (1994). More importantly, we did not abandon the totality of the circumstances approach in <em>McLees. </em>The decisions of these other jurisdictions support the continued use of Montana\u2019s approach that youth is only one of many factors to be considered in determining whether the State obtained lawful consent. <em>Schwarz, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">\u00b692 <em>Schwarz </em>is premised, in part, on the Court\u2019s observation of disparity between a parent\u2019s authority and a child\u2019s authority over shared property. <em>Schwarz, </em>\u00b6 13. The Court accepted California\u2019s conclusion that parents retain control of the family home and have the power to rescind any authority they give away. <em>Schwarz, </em>\u00b6 13. Otherwise stated, if parents can give away certain authorities, those authorities should remain with the child until the extension of authority is rescinded. Yet by its adoption of a per se rule, the Court eliminated the possibility that a parent could grant their child certain authority and decide not to rescind it. Since the Court accepted California\u2019s construction of transitory authority, the Court should have looked at the facts of the case to determine whether Schwarz relinquished a sufficient amount of authority to her child, and if she ever rescinded that delegation. That is not what happened. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Court never assessed the degree of authority Schwarz may have extended to her daughter or whether it had been revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">\u00b693 In addition, we have never required a third party to have <em>equal authority </em>over the property to be searched, but reviewed the facts to determine whether the third party enjoyed some <em>common authority. </em>We specifically rejected the argument that payment of living expenses, such as rent and utilities, indicated actual authority, and directed our attention to facts that indicated whether the third party maintained free access to the area as a cohabitant. <em>McLees, </em>\u00b6 17; <em>see also Lacey, </em>\u00b6 40. While all children depend upon a parent or guardian to provide them with necessities, the age at which children gain independence and acquire substantial responsibility for their own care and that of other members of the household changes according to each family\u2019s unique situation. The Court fails to recognize that.</p>\n<p id=\"Aai\">\u00b694 Today the Court repeats the mistake it made in <em>Schwarz </em>by ignoring the law established in Montana, reiterated only days earlier in <em>Lacey, </em>that consent is a waiver of the consenter\u2019s rights, not of any other person. The Court declares, \u2018In this case and in Schwarz-type cases, however, the focus is on the violation of the privacy rights of the parents.\u201d <em>Opinion, </em>\u00b6 36. Apparently Schwarz-type cases are cases where the Court ignores its own precedent, for recently we reiterated in <em>Lacey </em>that third-party consent rests on the assumption that the party provided consent \u201cin his own right,\u201d not on the rights of others who were not present and may or may not have elected to withhold consent. <em>Lacey, </em>\u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">\u00b695 Apart from my disagreement with the Court\u2019s approach to analyzing consent-to-search cases involving a minor, I am confused at the Court\u2019s decision that a person cannot assert his or her own right to privacy until he or she reaches the age of sixteen. We are left to wonder why the Court chose sixteen, for the decision does not explain why at sixteen a child acquires sufficient capacity or is able to use the house to such a degree that he or she can then provide lawful consent.</p>\n<p id=\"Axl\">\u00b696 Obviously, looking for a basis to justify its age limitation, the Court cited \u00a741-5-331, MCA, which prohibits law enforcement from interrogating a youth under the age of sixteen unless a parent has permitted it or an attorney has advised it. It then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">Although Section 41-5-331, MCA, only addresses a youth\u2019s constitutional right against self-incrimination, it nonetheless supports the principle that a minor who cannot waive her own rights without parental permission or legal counsel, cannot waive her parent\u2019s privacy rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number><em>Schwarz, </em>\u00b6 14. The Court could just as well have referred to the various statutes concerning sex offenses and the inability of a child under sixteen to consent to sex. Section 45-5-501, MCA. Notably both \u00a741-5-331 and 45-5-501, MCA, are meant to protect the youth, not the parent. These statutes are meant to enhance a youth\u2019s rights; not dilute them in favor of another person\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">\u00b697 The legislature has often placed children between the ages of twelve and sixteen on the same footing as adults. For example, the consent of a child twelve years of age or older is required for an adoption, and once a child reaches the age of fourteen years, he or she has the right to request an amendment of a parenting plan. Sections 42-2-301 and 40-4-219, MCA A child of twelve can be sentenced as an adult for certain crimes. Section 41-5-206, MCA. The legislature obviously feels that, in certain cases, a twelve year old has the capacity to commit a crime and be prosecuted as an adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">\u00b698 To forbid a child under the age of sixteen, who is sexually abused by her father, to provide physical evidence corroborating her report, does not help the child; it strips the child of her own rights and enhances her abuser\u2019s rights. Such a hard and fast rule is inconsistent with the concept of capacity and inconsistent with the legislature\u2019s purposes in protecting children.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">\u00b699 One of the consequences of a per se rule that fails to consider the possibility of exceptions, such as <em>Schwarz, </em>is that it can render unfair consequences. Here, the Defendant\u2019s thirteen-year-old daughter, who resides with him, called the police and told them her father may have assaulted her. Police responded by going to the house and were invited in by the alleged victim. This simple and reasonable entry into the house is illegal according to the Court. Once through the front door, law enforcement questioned the girl about her call. The girl advised the officer that her father had sexually assaulted her and she then showed him her bedroom where the crime was committed, her bedding upon which she was violated, and the pajamas she wore during the assault. She allowed the officers to take the bedding, pajamas, and underwear to be analyzed in order to corroborate her story. Her father had no expectation of privacy in those items, but the Court declares that this was an unreasonable seizure of the pajamas and bedding because there was no search warrant, and suggests the girl could have taken those items to the police as they were standing outside the house, or she could have taken them to the police station. That the girl could have apparently invited her friends into the house and her bedroom, or a pizza delivery person into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>home appears insignificant to the Court. That the girl had the authority to preclude her friends and others, besides her father, from her bedroom seems to carry no weight because she was under the age of sixteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">\u00b6100 It is ironic that the Court touts Montana\u2019s elevated right to privacy as justification for the per se rule, in light of the Constitution\u2019s explicit focus on the child\u2019s own rights and the protection thereof. Article II, \u00a7 15 of the Montana Constitution provides that persons under eighteen years have all of the fundamental rights of Article II, including the \u00a7 11 right to be free \u2018from unreasonable searches and seizures\u201d, unless specifically precluded \u2018by laws which enhance the protection of such persons.\u201d Montana Constitution, Article II, \u00a73 includes the right to enjoy and defend one\u2019s life and liberty and the right to seek one\u2019s safety. Article II, \u00a74 of the Montana Constitution includes the right to dignity stating that it is \u201cinviolable\u201d and precluding the denial of equal protection under the law. The Court ignores those rights and their application to a thirteen-year-old girl by insisting that the father\u2019s rights are more important than finding evidence to determine whether a sexual assault has been committed against the girl by her father in her own home.</p>\n<p id=\"Azf\">\u00b6101 The Court has failed to consider that the legislative adoption of a particular age is to protect children. Furthermore, today\u2019s decision poses grave consequences to a child\u2019s own right to seek protection under the law, even when her own parents defy it. The Montana Constitution was never meant to provide a safe haven for defendants charged with committing crimes against children.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">\u00b6102 The special facts of this case would have been considered in determining whether the police acted reasonably, had the Court not abandoned the totality of circumstances test. The Court should return to it.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
