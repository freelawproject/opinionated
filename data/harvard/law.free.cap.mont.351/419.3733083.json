We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">\u00b62 We consider the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err by concluding the Municipal Court properly excluded evidence offered by Bonamarte to prove the victim\u2019s motive and to impeach the victim?</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err by concluding the Municipal Court did not abuse its discretion by admitting expert testimony regarding \u201cbattered woman\u201d syndrome?</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">\u00b65 On April 30,2004, a jury seated in the Bozeman Municipal Court convicted Bonamarte of misdemeanor Partner or Family Member Assault. The Municipal Court, Hon. Patricia Carlson presiding, sentenced Bonamarte to one year in jail with all but thirty days suspended, and ordered him to pay fines and restitution. The Municipal Court instructed the State to arrange a hearing to determine the amount of restitution within sixty days. Prior to the expiration of sixty days, Bonamarte appealed to the District Court, challenging the Municipal Court\u2019s evidentiary rulings and its order requiring payment of restitution. The District Court affirmed the rulings and remanded the case to the Municipal Court for entry of a final order regarding the amount of restitution. Bonamarte appealed to this Court, and we dismissed the case without prejudice, concluding the appeal was premature. <em>State v. Bonamarte, </em>2006 MT 291, 334 Mont. 376, 147 P.3d 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">\u00b66 On March 1, 2007, the Municipal Court issued its final order on the amount of restitution. Bonamarte again appealed his conviction to the Eighteenth Judicial District Court. Both parties resubmitted their prior briefs to the District Court, which again affirmed the Municipal Court\u2019s evidentiary rulings. Bonamarte appeals the District Court\u2019s final order affirming his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-12\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b444-13\">\u00b67 On January 15, 2003, Bozeman police officers responded to a report of domestic violence. At the scene, Lynette Felix told the officers that Bonamarte had struck her several times, and though he had left the apartment, she feared for her and her children\u2019s safety. Bonamarte was subsequently arrested and charged with misdemeanor Partner or Family Member Assault in violation of \u00a745-5-206, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>\u00b68 Felix and Bonamarte had been romantically involved for three years prior to this incident. Each of them also shared in the operation of a car-wash business, which Felix ultimately purchased from Bonamarte. Felix testified that their relationship had been characterized by violence and threats by Bonamarte and by his efforts to control her and her family. She testified that he had beat her about 100 times over a period of a year and a half, that she had been reluctant to tell anyone, and during that time she had undertaken efforts to cover up her injuries with make-up and clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">\u00b69 Prior to trial, the State orally moved the Municipal Court to prohibit Michael Richards, of Mountain West Bank, from testifying at trial. Through Richards\u2019 testimony, Bonamarte intended to introduce a loan application Felix submitted to the bank. On the application, Felix falsely represented to the bank that she anticipated receiving a large amount of money through an inheritance. Bonamarte sought to use this evidence to demonstrate that Felix was not credible. The Municipal Court granted the State\u2019s motion, expressing concern that this evidence was potentially misleading and could confuse the issues to be put before the jury, noting that this case was not about bank fraud but assault. However, the court permitted Bonamarte to cross-examine Felix regarding the falsity of the bank application. The court added that if Felix were to perjure herself about the application, it would re-consider the use of extrinsic documentary evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">\u00b610 When asked, Felix admitted she provided false information to the bank on her application. She explained that she had done so because she was required to do so by Bonamarte. Bonamarte further examined her regarding their business ventures. Bonamarte then attempted to introduce several documents, other than the loan application, which he contended contradicted Felix\u2019s testimony about the poor financial health of their business. The court denied admission of these documents, citing possible confusion of the jury. Bonamarte testified to the effect that the business was in sound financial condition and about other issues he believed established a motive for Felix to lie. His theory was that Felix was motivated to falsely claim she had been assaulted in order to remove Bonamarte from the business by a restraining order, allowing her to take additional sums from the business to service her significant debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">\u00b611 Immediately prior to the State\u2019s calling of Kathy Coles to testify as an expert witness, Bonamarte moved the court to exclude her testimony as irrelevant and prejudicial. The court responded that Bonamarte could have raised this objection much earlier. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>declined to preemptively exclude Coles\u2019 testimony, stating it would consider any objections Bonamarte might make to her testimony after she was qualified as an expert. When Coles began to testify about police recognition of victim and abuser profiles observed in domestic disturbances, Bonamarte objected on relevance grounds and improper vouching of Felix. The Court sustained Bonamarte\u2019s objection and cautioned the prosecutor to elicit only testimony that would help the jury understand the evidence presented at trial. Bonamarte again objected when the prosecutor questioned Coles about the role of power and control in domestic violence, arguing that \u201csyndrome testimony\u201d was inadmissible. The court overruled this objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">\u00b612 On appeal, the District Court concluded that the Municipal Court did not abuse its discretion by its evidentiary rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">\u00b613 A district court\u2019s review of a municipal court\u2019s orders and judgment is limited to review of the record and questions of law. <em>State v. Ditton, </em>2006 MT 235, \u00b6 18, 333 Mont. 483, 144 P.3d 783. This Court reviews a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Ditton, </em>\u00b6 18. We review evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>Ditton, </em>\u00b6 18; <em>State v. Nelson, </em>2002 MT 122, \u00b6 9, 310 Mont. 71, 48 P.3d 739. A court abuses its discretion if it acts arbitrarily or unreasonably, and a substantial injustice results. <em>State v. Sanchez, </em>2008 MT 27, \u00b6 15, 341 Mont. 240, 177 P.3d 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">\u00b614 1. Did the District Court err by concluding the Municipal Court properly excluded evidence offered by Bonamarte to prove the victim\u2019s motive and to impeach the victim?</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">\u00b615 Bonamarte argues the Municipal Court\u2019s decision to exclude Richards\u2019 proffered testimony about Felix\u2019s untruthful loan application and its refusal to admit certain financial documents, denied him his Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him and prevented him from mounting a successful defense. The State responds that Bonamarte did not raise a constitutional argument in the Municipal Court, and that the court properly exercised its discretion under Montana Rules of Evidence 403 and 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">\u00b616 As the District Court noted, we held in <em>Nelson, </em>\u201cthe trial court\u2019s discretion in exercising control and excluding evidence of a witness\u2019s bias or motive to testify falsely becomes operative only after the constitutionally required threshold level of inquiry has been afforded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>the Defendant.\u201d <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 13 (citation omitted). Nonetheless, \u201ca trial court has broad discretion to limit the scope of cross-examination to those issues it determines are relevant to the trial\u201d and \u2018limiting the scope of cross-examination does not necessarily violate a defendant\u2019s right to confront an adverse witness.\u201d <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 15 (citations omitted). While the trial court\u2019s rulings regarding admission of evidence and cross-examination were necessarily related to Bonamarte\u2019s right of confrontation, he made no separate constitutional argument in the Municipal Court, challenging only the court\u2019s application of the rules of evidence. Therefore, our review is confined to whether the court\u2019s rulings were erroneous under those rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">\u00b617 Rule 608(b), M. R. Evid. prohibits the use of extrinsic evidence to prove specific instances of conduct for the purpose of attacking a witness\u2019s credibility. Rule 608(a) permits opinion testimony concerning a witness\u2019 s credibility under certain conditions, but Bonamarte did not offer such opinion evidence here. Rule 608(b) permits the use of extrinsic evidence regarding specific instances of conduct probative of the witness\u2019s character for truthfulness or untruthfulness during cross-examination, subject to the proper exercise of discretion by the trial court. <em>See State v. Gommenginger, </em>242 Mont. 265, 271-75, 790 P.2d 455, 459-61 (1990). Under Rule 403, a court may exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the' danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, misleading the jury, or considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">\u00b618 Bonamarte\u2019s arguments are similar to those made by the defendant in <em>State v. McClean, </em>179 Mont. 178, 587 P.2d 20 (1978). McClean argued the trial court had erred by not permitting him to present witnesses who were able to testify that the State\u2019s primary witness, an undercover officer, was also a drug user and dealer and thus had a financial motive to testify falsely to continue his employment and access to drugs. <em>McClean, </em>179 Mont. at 183, 587 P.2d at 23. Applying Rule 608(b) to those facts, we offered that \u201creference to specific instances of a witness\u2019 conduct for the purpose of proving his character for truthfulness or untruthfulness is <em>never </em>permitted on direct examination.\u201d <em>McClean, </em>179 Mont. at 185, 587 P.2d at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">\u00b619 In <em>Nelson, </em>the defendant sought to introduce evidence of a plea agreement a witness had made in a prior case to prove the witness tended to testify against his co-defendants. <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 12. The trial court permitted Nelson to cross-examine the witness about the plea negotiations related to the immediate case, but did not allow evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>of plea agreements made in other cases. <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12, 18. We stated that, while a defendant holds the right to present evidence of a witness\u2019s bias, the scope of the evidence is subject to limitation by the trial court. <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 15. We held that the trial court exercised appropriate discretion in imposing this evidentiary limitation, because it afforded the defendant an opportunity to interrogate the witness regarding the plea agreement made in connection with his testimony against Nelson. <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">\u00b620 Here, the trial court allowed Bonamarte to ask Felix about the false representations she made in her loan application. Felix admitted to lying on the loan documents. Bonamarte was permitted to examine Felix about a motive she may have had to lie. However, permitting Bonamarte to call Richards to testify on direct examination regarding this specific instance of Felix\u2019s conduct for the purpose of proving Felix\u2019s character for untruthfulness would have been contrary to Rule 608. <em>See McClean, </em>179 Mont. at 185, 587 P.2d at 24-25. Additionally, following Felix\u2019s testimony that she had lied on the loan application, introduction of the documents themselves would have been cumulative.</p>\n<p id=\"Adg\">\u00b621 We likewise conclude that the District Court did not err by concluding that the Municipal Court did not abuse its discretion by limiting evidence relating to the general health of the parties\u2019 business. Bonamarte was able to cross-examine Felix regarding the car-wash business, and was also permitted to present evidence on this point through his own testimony. The court acted within its discretion to exclude evidence which might create undue prejudice, confuse the issues, mislead the jury, or which was cumulative under Rule 403.</p>\n<p id=\"ASEA\">\u00b622 2. Did the District Court err by concluding the Municipal Court did not abuse its discretion by admitting expert testimony regarding \u2018battered woman\u201d syndrome?</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">\u00b623 The District Court determined that the Municipal Court properly followed our holding in <em>State v. Stringer, </em>271 Mont. 367, 897 P.2d 1063 (1995), by restricting Coles\u2019 expert testimony to the general nature and behavior of battered women, and by not permitting her to testify as to Felix\u2019s credibility. Bonamarte argues that our holding in <em>Stringer </em>involved \u201ca limited situation in which an expert may be necessary to help a jury understand why an allegedly battered woman would recant a statement that the accused beat her. No such fact situation is presented in this case.\u201d Because there was no recantation in this case, Bonamarte argues that Coles\u2019 testimony served only to bolster Felix\u2019s credibility. The State answers that Coles\u2019 testimony was necessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>help the jurors understand the general nature and behavior of battered women. Without her testimony, the State argues, the jury may have been unable to assess the evidence correctly.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">\u00b624 <em>Stringer </em>did involve a recantation, and we explained that the expert testimony could help the jury to understand the inconsistencies in the victim\u2019s testimony. <em>Stringer, </em>271 Mont. at 377, 897 P.2d at 1069. We also noted that the testimony \u201cprovided the jury with information to aid the jury in evaluating the evidence. This type of limited testimony does not invade the jury\u2019s role in determining the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>Stringer, </em>271 Mont. at 377, 897 P.2d at 1069.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">\u00b625 Felix testified that Bonamarte had beaten her about 100 times over a period of a year and a half. She testified that he had threatened to harm members of her family, including having her children raped, tortured and murdered, if she told anyone what had happened. She testified about Bonamarte\u2019s control over her, including that she had lied on the loan application because Bonamarte had required her to do so. In response, Bonamarte attempted to cast doubt upon Felix\u2019s testimony by asking why, during all of this alleged abuse, Felix had previously failed to seek help. During closing argument, Bonamarte\u2019s counsel questioned why Felix would not at least tell a best friend that \u2018Mark\u2019s beating me up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A4Q\">\u00b626 Coles testified generally about the dynamics of an abusive relationship, including the common characteristics of women who have been abused over an extended period of time by a dominant male figure, and why an abused person might not immediately come forward for help. Coles did not testify about Felix directly or opine about whether Felix was a battered spouse. Coles\u2019 testimony provided general information about the unique behavior of battered spouses that may not be known commonly by a lay juror. While Coles\u2019 testimony was explanatory of victim behavior and thus indirectly supportive of Felix\u2019s position in the matter, Coles did not testify about Felix\u2019s personal situation or about her believability. Whether Felix was credible and whether she was actually a victim of abuse was left to the jury\u2019s determination. We conclude that the District Court did not err by concluding the Municipal Court did not abuse its discretion by the evidentiary rulings entered on this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">\u00b627 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b449-8\">JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART, NELSON and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
