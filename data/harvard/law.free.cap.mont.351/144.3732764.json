Did the District Court err in denying Morrisey\u2019s motion to suppress statements he made to law enforcement officers and the evidence recovered as a result of those statements?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">2. Did the District Court err in denying Morrisey\u2019s motion to dismiss for violation of his constitutional right to a speedy trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">3. Did the District Court err in denying Morrisey\u2019s motion for disclosure and allowing Dr. Symes, a forensic anthropologist called by the State as a rebuttal witness, to testify?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-8\">4. Was there sufficient evidence upon which a jury could find Morrisey guilty of deliberate homicide beyond a reasonable doubt?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">\u00b63 Nine-year-old Dolana Clark, who lived with her parents in Great Falls, Montana, disappeared the evening of August 2, 1988. Friends and family last saw Dolana riding her sister\u2019s bicycle down 25th Street South at around 5:30 p.m. The police conducted an extensive search but were unable to locate her. A year later, a hunter found Dolana\u2019s remains in the Little Belt Mountains southeast of Great Falls. Her skull had an entrance wound in back and an exit wound in front caused by a small-caliber bullet.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">\u00b64 Morrissey lived a couple of blocks from the Clark residence and had a close relationship with the family during the years preceding Dolana\u2019s disappearance. He ran errands for them, joined them on picnics, and came to holiday dinners. The Clarks used Morrisey\u2019s telephone since they did not have one of their own. Dolana spent substantial time at Morrisey\u2019s house, and she and her older half-sister, Lisa, occasionally spent the night there. At one point, Morrisey thought about marrying Lisa. He also talked to Dolana about moving in with him once she got older. When Dolana disappeared, Morrisey joined several members of the family in searching for her. About two weeks after her disappearance, however, Morrisey ceased all interactions with the Clark family.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-12\">\u00b65 Morrisey became a suspect in Dolana\u2019s disappearance based on his relationship with Dolana, certain inconsistencies in his statements to investigators, and information the police had learned through interviews with other witnesses. Detectives searched Morrisey\u2019s house and two vehicles but found no evidence indicating where Dolana might be. They also found no weapons in the house, and Morrisey told them that he did not own any weapons. He repeatedly denied any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>involvement in what happened to Dolana. Morrisey left Great Falls a few months later and eventually settled in Colorado.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">\u00b66 In 2002, the Great Falls police renewed the investigation into Dolana\u2019s death. Detectives reviewed the case file, including statements Morrisey had given back in 1988, and ultimately developed the following theory: Dolana went to Morrisey\u2019s house the evening of August 2, 1988, after her father had refused to give her money to purchase a Siamese cat on layaway at a local pet store; Morrisey killed Dolana at some point during the evening and placed her body and bicycle in the trunk of his 1963 Chevy Impala; he then joined family members in searching for Dolana but refused to use either of his vehicles in the search; afterward, he drove her body up to the mountains where it was found a year later; and he then returned to town by roughly 6:30 the morning of August 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">\u00b67 The Cascade County Attorney\u2019s Office obtained warrants to search Morrisey\u2019s residence (which was in a remote location in Weston, Colorado), his Impala, and his 1985 Chevy Camaro. Sergeant John Cameron and Detectives John Schaffer and William Bellusci of the Great Falls Police Department then traveled to Colorado and met with officers from the Las Animas County Sheriffs Office and the Colorado Bureau of Investigation. With these officers\u2019 assistance, Cameron, Schaffer, and Bellusci executed the search warrants on September 3, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">\u00b68 While en route to Morrisey\u2019s residence that morning, Sergeant Martinez of the Las Animas County Sheriffs Office noticed Morrisey driving by in the opposite direction in a 1982 Chevy pickup. Martinez initiated a traffic stop, and Cameron advised Morrisey of the search warrants. Cameron asked Morrisey to return with the officers to his residence and provide them access to the house and vehicles. Morrisey complied.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">\u00b69 Once at Morrisey\u2019s house, Cameron served him with the search warrants, read him his rights under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602 (1966), and proceeded with the search, leaving Morrisey with Detectives Schaffer and Bellusci. During the ensuing conversation with the detectives, Morrisey gave a number of incriminating statements. Among other things, he told them that he owned a .22-caliber rifle, which he had broken into several pieces, and that he had thrown parts of the rifle away but had buried the barrel in the mountains behind his house. He also stated that he had done all of this just a couple of weeks earlier after finding out that the police had renewed their investigation into Dolana\u2019s death. He explained that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>he got rid of the gun \u201cbecause I knew I was going to get pinned with something I didn\u2019t do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">\u00b610 Morrisey directed the detectives to the location where he had buried the rifle barrel. After recovering the barrel, they transported him to the local police station to give a videotaped statement. During the interview, Morrisey admitted that he had lied to detectives in 1988 when he told them that he did not have any weapons. He claimed, however, that he had loaned his rifle to Dolana\u2019s father one week before she disappeared and that the rifle was not returned until a week after her disappearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">\u00b611 The State charged Morrisey on September 4,2002, with deliberate homicide, a felony, in violation of\u00a745-5-102(l)(a), MCA (1987). In May 2004, following a number of continuances and the filing of an amended information, Morrisey filed a motion to suppress his statements to the detectives and any evidence recovered as a result of those statements. The District Court held a hearing, at which Cameron, Schaffer, Bellusci, and Morrisey testified, and thereafter denied the motion. In September 2005, following more continuances, Morrisey filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that his right to a speedy trial had been violated. The District Court held a hearing and thereafter denied that motion as well. The case then proceeded to a four-day jury trial in November 2005. The jury found Morrisey guilty, and the District Court sentenced him to the Montana State Prison for life with no eligibility for parole. Morrisey now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">\u00b612 Additional facts and procedural background are set forth below as they relate to each issue under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">\u00b613 <em>ISSUE 1. Did the District Court err in denying Morrisey\u2019s motion to suppress statements he made to law enforcement officers and the evidence recovered as a result of those statements?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">\u00b614 In reviewing a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress evidence or statements, we determine whether the court\u2019s underlying factual findings are clearly erroneous and whether the court\u2019s interpretation and application of the law are correct. <em>State v. Munson, </em>2007 MT 222, \u00b6 18, 339 Mont. 68, 169 P.3d 364. The court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous if they are not supported by substantial evidence, if the court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>or if this Court\u2019s review of the record leaves us with a definite or firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>Munson, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">II. Facts and Arguments Related to Morrisey\u2019s Motion to Suppress</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">\u00b615 As noted, while en route to Morrisey\u2019s Colorado residence to execute the search warrants, Sergeant Martinez noticed Morrisey driving by in a pickup in the opposite direction. Martinez, who was driving a marked squad car, turned around and initiated a traffic stop using his overhead lights. Sergeant Cameron and Detective Schaffer were in the squad car with Martinez at the time. Morrisey pulled over, and Martinez (who was in full uniform) instructed Morrisey to exit the vehicle. Cameron and Schaffer (who were in plain clothes but displaying their badges and guns) then approached Morrisey, identified themselves as law enforcement officers from Great Falls, and advised him of the search warrants. Cameron asked Morrisey if he had any weapons, and Morrisey replied that he had a loaded .38-caliber revolver in the pickup. Cameron stated that he would need to secure the weapon and that he would also be taking control of the pickup. Cameron took Morrisey\u2019s keys and asked him to return with them to his residence. Morrisey agreed to do so, and the officers then placed him in the caged back seat of Martinez\u2019s squad car for transport. Cameron followed in Morrisey\u2019s pickup. At no point during his time with the detectives that day was Morrisey advised that he was free to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">\u00b616 Approximately eight to ten law enforcement officers were present at Morrisey\u2019s residence to conduct the search of his house and cars. After arriving, Cameron activated a microcassette recorder, served Morrisey with the search warrants, and told him that Tt]his is probably going to take us at least two days.\u201d Cameron then read Morrisey his <em>Miranda </em>rights. When Cameron first stated, \u2018You have the right to remain silent,\u201d Morrisey interjected, \u2018Yeah, I will.\u201d Likewise, when Cameron stated, \u201cAnything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law,\u201d Morrisey replied, <em>\u201cl </em>ain\u2019t saying nothing.\u201d Cameron next informed Morrisey: \u2018You have the right to an attorney. One will be appointed to [sic] you prior to any questioning if you desire. If you wish to answer questions now without an attorney, you have the right to stop answering at any time. Do you understand that, Mr. Morrisey?\u201d Morrisey responded, \u2018Yes, got it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">\u00b617 Following this, the detectives conversed with and questioned Morrisey for the next three to four hours. Morrisey contends that in so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>doing, the detectives infringed his right to remain silent. In addition, he argues that through \u201ccontinued prodding\u201d and \u2018improper use of their influence,\u201d the detectives \u2018lured\u201d him into speaking with them and that his statements, therefore, were not made voluntarily. Given these arguments, it is necessary to detail relevant portions of the dialogue between Morrisey and the detectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">\u00b618 After giving <em>the Miranda </em>warnings, Cameron informed Morrisey that his house was in the officers\u2019 control. Cameron asked Morrisey where the Impala and Camaro were, requested that Morrisey provide the keys to the house and cars, and asked which key opened which door. Cameron then proceeded with the search and left Morrisey with Detectives Schaffer and Bellusci, at which point the following discussion ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-5\">Detective<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>: Okay -we sure appreciate your cooperation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASd\">Morrisey: Well, I\u2019ve got nothing to hide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-6\">Detective: Well that\u2019s excellent -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5d\">Morrisey: I do have nothing to hide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-7\">Detective: Good. You know why we\u2019re here -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALU\">Morrisey: I got a feeling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-8\">Detective: Okay -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay0\">Morrisey: I got a feeling -yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-9\">Detective: It\u2019s in reference to the Dolana Clark investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIt\">Morrisey: I have a feeling. I have nothing to hide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-10\">Detective: And this is one of those -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-11\">Morrisey: Lower and raise it -it acts up a little bit, okay? All right. There\u2019s the cars in there, all right -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-12\">Detective: My job, Bill, is two-fold, okay? I\u2019m assigned to this case and what I want to do is -there\u2019s a million that were talked to back in 1988 -about this and you were one of the people that were talked to about that, too -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfN\">Morrisey: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-13\">Detective: And we want to get it cleared up -we want to get this case done. Part of my job - is to - try to hold the person responsible who did this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-14\">Morrisey: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-15\">Detective: The other part of my job is to clear those that are not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac3\">Morrisey: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-16\">Detective: And that\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019re here is to -is to -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Morrisey: Arrest -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-4\">Detective: Get this taken care of -hopefully sit down, visit with you and see where we can -see if we can get this resolved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-6\">Morrisey: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\">Detective: Fair enough?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-8\">Morrisey: That is fair. I got no complaints.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">\u00b6 19 At this point, the conversation turned to other topics. In summary, Morrisey stated he wanted to be present in the house during the search, but the detectives would not allow that. When he expressed concern that an officer might \u201csteal\u201d something, the detectives explained that the officers would be taking photographs first and that any evidence seized would be documented. Morrisey inquired whether they had \u201cdone this\u201d to Dolana\u2019s father also, and the detectives told him they were \u201ctalking to everybody.\u201d They asked Morrisey whether he had any other loaded weapons, and he responded that he did, noting that there were bears and mountain lions in the area. He told them about an incident in which a bear had caused damage to his house. He also informed them that he had a pet cat, which he insisted was not Siamese, noting that he had \u201ca witness to where I got it when I was in Illinois.\u201d He asked them not to let the cat outside. An officer asked to use the phone, and Morrisey told him there was one in the laundry room. The detectives and Morrisey also discussed the weather, when he moved to the area, why he had decided to settle in that part of Colorado, whether he was active in church, where he does his banking, how far his property line extended, and why he did not have a computer or Internet access.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">\u00b620 Schaffer and Bellusci then reiterated that they wanted \u2018to sit down and just visit with you and get a formal statement.\u201d They put Morrisey in an unmarked police car and proposed driving to the local sheriffs office, but Morrisey indicated that he would not feel comfortable talking there, so they drove to a local caf\u00e9 instead. On the way there, Morrisey remarked on where he buys his gas and groceries, why he was -unmarried, and the experiences he had with the police during the 1988 investigation. Notably, one of the detectives commented that \u2018it looks to me like you were a bit traumatized by the police before.\u201d He told Morrisey, \u201cI want you to relax.\u201d They discussed several other topics (an old coal mine they passed on the highway, Morrisey\u2019s encounters with bears on his property, the price of gas), and then one of the detectives noted that he had read Morrisey\u2019s 1988 statement to the police and felt that Morrisey had been \u201creally protective of folks around you.\u201d He asked Morrisey to be \u201cneutral\u201d this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>time. He also mentioned that the investigators were not going to leave any stone unturned, to which Morrisey replied, T have nothing to hide.\u201d The conversation then returned to other topics.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">\u00b621 Morrisey, Schaffer, and Bellusci arrived at the caf\u00e9, but the conditions there were not conducive to discussing Dolana\u2019s homicide. So, they walked to a nearby picnic table, but it began to rain. Thus, they returned to the police car. At the outset of the formal interview, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">Detective: Let\u2019s get rolling -you know Dolana Clark.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-6\">Morrisey: Yes I did know her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-7\">Detective: Okay and you know that we\u2019re up here investigating - the homicide of Dolana Clark.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-9\">Morrisey: I do know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-10\">Detective: You know that you have been a suspect listed in that case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-12\">Morrisey: Evidently I have been.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-13\">Detective: You\u2019ve been advised of your rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-14\">Morrisey: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-15\">Detective: Okay and you\u2019re willing to talk to us about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-16\">Morrisey: I will talk.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-17\">\u00b622 During the interrogation, Morrisey stated initially that he did not own a .22-caliber rifle; however, he later admitted that he did own a .22 when he was living in Great Falls, but he claimed that he had \u201csold it a long time ago\u201d at a flea market in Illinois. Then, after further questioning, he stated that he did not sell the gun, but rather threw it off a bridge into the Mississippi River. Ultimately, however, Morrisey acknowledged that he had the gun until a couple of weeks earlier when he learned through a friend that the police had renewed their investigation into Dolana\u2019s death and were asking about small-caliber guns. He explained that he then cleaned and dismantled the rifle, threw parts of it in a trash dumpster, and buried the barrel under some rocks in the mountains behind his house. Morrisey directed the detectives to the location of the barrel. When they further inquired about the other pieces of the rifle, Morrisey stated that \u2018you\u2019ll never find them\u201d because he had thrown them \u201call along the highway.\u201d Throughout the interview, Morrisey repeatedly insisted that he did not kill Dolana. He also expressed his belief that Dolana\u2019s father had done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-18\">\u00b623 In his motion to suppress, Morrisey argued that \u201cthe failure of the police to immediately terminate the interview\u201d after he told Cameron \u201cI ain\u2019t saying nothing\u201d violated his right to remain silent under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number><em>Miranda, </em>as interpreted in <em>Michigan v. Mosley, </em>423 U.S. 96, 96 S. Ct. 321 (1975) (requiring the exclusion of statements obtained during a custodial interrogation if the police did not \u201cscrupulously honor\u201d the suspect\u2019s right to cut off questioning). He also argued that the detectives questioned him \u201crelentlessly\u201d and \u2018intimidated\u201d him until they \u201covercame his resistance\u201d and he \u201creluctantly\u201d agreed to speak with them. On appeal, Morrisey again contends that under <em>Mosley, </em>\u201cthe officers should have ceased their interrogation once Cameron first advised Morrisey of his right to remain silent and Morrisey stated that he was not saying anything.\u201d He also claims his statements were not made voluntarily, but were the product of \u201ccontinued prodding\u201d and \u2018improper use\u201d of the detectives\u2019 influence and interrogation \u201ctechniques.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">\u00b624 In response to Morrisey\u2019s motion, the State argued that he was not in custody when he made his statements and that, in any event, the detectives were free to continue questioning him because he did not invoke his right to counsel. The State also argued that Morrisey was not subjected to police coercion or intimidation and that it could be \u201cinferred\u201d from his words and actions that he waived his right to be silent and voluntarily answered questions. The State reiterates this argument on appeal. In addition, the State contends that Morrisey did not validly invoke his right to remain silent in the first place, and even if he did, this does not mean that questioning could never be resumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">III. Applicable Law</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">\u00b625 Morrisey and the State conflate into one analysis (1) the alleged involuntariness of his statements and (2) the detectives\u2019 alleged failure to \u201cscrupulously honor\u201d his right to remain silent. This appears to be due in part to the procedural history of this case. The District Court denied Morrisey\u2019s motion to suppress on the ground that he \u201cwas not subjected to a custodial interrogation and thus <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not required and whether he invoked his <em>Miranda </em>rights is moot.\u201d But Morrisey then filed a petition for a writ of supervisory control, and in denying that petition we stated that \u201cthe real issue is not whether Morrisey was in custody, but whether his post Miranda statements were voluntary.\u201d However, with the benefit of a complete record, and in light of the doctrinal distinctions discussed below, it is now clear that Morrisey challenges the admissibility of his statements on two distinct grounds, and it is necessary to analyze those accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">\u00b626 Prior to <em>Miranda, </em>the Supreme Court evaluated the admissibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>of a suspect\u2019s confession under a voluntariness test that was grounded in the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Self-Incrimination Clause (\u2018No person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u201d) and the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. <em>See Dickerson v. United States, </em>530 U.S. 428, 432-33, 120 S. Ct. 2326, 2330 (2000); <em>Withrow v. Williams, </em>507 U.S. 680, 688, 113 S. Ct. 1745, 1751 (1993); <em>Missouri v. Seibert, </em>542 U.S. 600, 607-08, 124 S. Ct. 2601, 2607 (2004) (plurality opinion). This voluntariness test is based on notions of due process, and the essential inquiry is whether the suspect\u2019s will was overborne by the circumstances surrounding the giving of the confession. <em>Dickerson, </em>530 U.S. at 433-34, 120 S. Ct. at 2330-31. A court must examine the totality of all the surrounding circumstances-both the characteristics of the individual and the details of the interrogation-to determine whether the confession was given freely, voluntarily, and without compulsion or inducement of any sort. <em>See Dickerson, </em>530 U.S. at 434, 120 S. Ct. at 2331; <em>Withrow, </em>507 U.S. at 688-89, 693, 113 S. Ct. at 1751, 1754. The Supreme Court has never abandoned this due process/totality-of-the-circumstances test and continues to exclude confessions that were obtained involuntarily. <em>See Dickerson, </em>530 U.S. at 434, 120 S. Ct. at 2331; <em>Withrow, </em>507 U.S. at 689, 113 S. Ct. at 1751; <em>Miller v. Fenton, </em>474 U.S. 104, 109-10, 106 S. Ct. 445, 449 (1985); <em>see also e.g. Arizona v. Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 286-88, 111 S. Ct. 1246, 1252-53 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">\u00b627 The Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Malloy v. Hogan, </em>378 U.S. 1, 84 S. Ct. 1489 (1964), however, changed the focus of much of the inquiry in determining the admissibility of a suspect\u2019s incriminating statements. <em>Dickerson, </em>530 U.S. at 434, 120 S. Ct. at 2331. First, in <em>Malloy, </em>the Court held that the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Self-Incrimination Clause is incorporated in the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause and, thus, applies to the States. <em>Malloy, </em>378 U.S. at 6-11, 84 S. Ct. at 1492-95. Then, two years later in <em>Miranda, </em>the Court held that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination is available outside of criminal court proceedings and serves to protect persons \u2018in all settings in which their freedom of action is curtailed in any significant way from being compelled to incriminate themselves.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 467, 86 S. Ct. at 1624. Furthermore, the <em>Miranda </em>Court recognized that the modern practice of in-custody interrogation \u201ccontains inherently compelling pressures which work to undermine the individual\u2019s will to resist and to compel him to speak where he would not otherwise do so freely.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 467, 86 S. Ct. at 1624. The Court noted that because \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>coercion inherent in custodial interrogation blurs the line between voluntary and involuntary statements,\u201d <em>Dickerson, </em>530 U.S. at 435, 120 S. Ct. at 2331, the traditional due process/totality-of-the-circumstances test thus posed an \u201cunacceptably great\u201d risk that involuntary custodial confessions would escape detection, <em>Dickerson, </em>530 U.S. at 442, 120 S. Ct. at 2335; <em>Seibert, </em>542 U.S. at 608, 124 S. Ct. at 2608.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">\u00b628 Accordingly, the Supreme Court concluded that \u201cadequate protective devices\u201d are necessary to dispel the compulsion inherent in custodial surroundings and to permit a full opportunity to exercise the privilege against self-incrimination. <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 458, 467, 86 S. Ct. at 1619, 1624. To that end, the Court laid down the now-familiar \u201cconcrete constitutional guidelines\u201d for law enforcement agencies and courts to follow. <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 442, 86 S. Ct. at 1611; <em>see also Dickerson, </em>530 U.S. at 437-44, 120 S. Ct. at 2332-36 (holding that <em>Miranda </em>announced a constitutional rule which cannot be superseded legislatively). When a person \u2018is taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom by the authorities in any significant way and is subjected to questioning,\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 478, 86 S. Ct. at 1630, he \u201cmust be adequately and effectively apprised of his rights and the exercise of those rights must be fully honored,\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 467, 86 S. Ct. at 1624. Specifically, he \u201cmust be warned prior to any questioning that he has the right to remain silent, that anything he says can be used against him in a court of law, that he has the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desires.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 479, 86 S. Ct. at 1630. Moreover, \u201cMpportunity to exercise these rights must be afforded to him throughout the interrogation.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 479, 86 S. Ct. at 1630. Failure to give the warnings and obtain a waiver of rights prior to custodial questioning generally requires exclusion of any statements obtained.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 476, 479, 86 S. Ct. at 1629, 1630. Conversely, giving the warnings and getting a waiver generally produces \u201ca virtual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>ticket of admissibility.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Seibert, </em>542 U.S. at 608-09, 124 S. Ct. at 2608.</p>\n<p id=\"AJB\">\u00b629 In sum, no person may be \u201ccompelled\u201d in any criminal case to be a witness against himself or herself. U.S. Const, amend. V. The due process/totality-of-the-circumstances test and the <em>Miranda </em>doctrine both serve to protect this privilege. The former asks whether the suspect\u2019s will was overborne by the circumstances surrounding the giving of his or her statements. A statement that was actually coerced must be excluded from trial for all purposes. <em>See Kansas v. </em>Ventris, _ U.S. _, 129 S. Ct. 1841, 1845 (2009) (citing <em>New Jersey v. Portash, </em>440 U.S. 450, 458-59, 99 S. Ct. 1292, 1296-97 (1979)). Separate and apart from this due process test, the <em>Miranda </em>doctrine applies specifically to custodial interrogation and requires that certain procedural safeguards be used in this context. Failure to give the prescribed warnings prior to questioning does not constitute actual coercion; rather, it creates \u201ca bright-line, legal presumption of coercion\u201d which is Irrebuttable for purposes of the prosecution\u2019s case in chief.\u201d <em>Oregon v. Elstad, </em>470 U.S. 298, 306-07 &amp; n. 1, 105 S. Ct. 1285, 1292 &amp; n. 1 (1985); <em>accord United States v. Patane, </em>542 U.S. 630, 639, 124 S. Ct. 2620, 2627 (2004) (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">\u00b630 Thus, a custodial statement which may be \u201cvoluntary\u201d under traditional due process standards is nevertheless presumed coerced under <em>Miranda </em>and is generally inadmissible at trial if law enforcement failed to provide the warnings and obtain a valid waiver of the <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>See Dickerson, </em>530 U.S. at 444, 120 S. Ct. at 2336; <em>Withrow, </em>507 U.S. at 690, 113 S. Ct. at 1752; <em>Elstad, </em>470 U.S. at 304, 105 S. Ct. at 1290; <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 457, 479, 86 S. Ct. at 1618-19, 1630. In that case, a due process analysis would be unnecessary. Conversely, where there has been no <em>Miranda </em>violation or the <em>Miranda </em>rule simply does not apply, the defendant may still challenge the admissibility of his statement on due process grounds. <em>See Dickerson, </em>530 U.S. at 444, 120 S. Ct. at 2336; <em>Elstad, </em>470 U.S. at 307-08, 105 S. Ct. at 1292; <em>Berkemer v. McCarty, </em>468 U.S. 420, 433 n. 20, 104 S. Ct. 3138, 3147 n. 20 (1984); New <em>York v. Quarles, </em>467 U.S. 649, 655 n. 5, 104 S. Ct. 2626, 2631 n. 5 (1984). Importantly, both the due process/totality-of-the circumstances test and the <em>Miranda </em>test apply where the defendant challenges statements made during a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>custodial interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">\u00b631 With these distinctions in mind, we first address Morrisey\u2019s Miranda-based claim, after which we address his due process voluntariness claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">IV. Analysis of Morrisey\u2019s <em>Miranda-Mosley </em>Claim<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AQg\">A. <em>Mosley\u2019s </em>\u2018Scrupulously Honor\u201d Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">\u00b632 Morrisey does not contend that the detectives failed to give him the <em>Miranda </em>warnings prior to questioning. Rather, he contends that they failed to honor his assertion of his right to remain silent, thus requiring the suppression of his statements. This claim derives from the following passage in <em>Miranda:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">Once warnings have been given, the subsequent procedure is clear. If the individual indicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease. At this point he has shown that he intends to exercise his Fifth Amendment privilege; any statement taken after the person invokes his privilege cannot be other than the product of compulsion, subtle or otherwise. Without the right to cut off questioning, the setting of in-custody interrogation operates on the individual to overcome free choice in producing a statement after the privilege has been once invoked.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-8\"><em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 473-74, 86 S. Ct. at 1627-28 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"A8m\">\u00b633 The Supreme Court interpreted this passage in <em>Michigan v. Mosley, </em>423 U.S. 96, 96 S. Ct. 321 (1975). The Court first rejected the notion that the passage requires only the immediate cessation of questioning and permits a resumption of interrogation after a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>momentary respite. The Court reasoned that \u201c[t]o permit the continuation of custodial interrogation after a momentary cessation would clearly frustrate the purposes of <em>Miranda </em>by allowing repeated rounds of questioning to undermine the will of the person being questioned.\u201d <em>Mosley, </em>423 U.S. at 102, 96 S. Ct. at 326. Likewise, the Court rejected the opposite extreme under which a person who has invoked his right to silence can never again be subjected to custodial interrogation by any police officer at any time or place on any subject. The Court reasoned that \u201ca blanket prohibition against the taking of voluntary statements or a permanent immunity from further interrogation, regardless of the circumstances, would transform the <em>Miranda </em>safeguards into wholly irrational obstacles to legitimate police investigative activity, and deprive suspects of an opportunity to make informed and intelligent assessments of their interests.\u201d <em>Mosley, </em>423 U.S. at 102, 96 S. Ct. at 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">\u00b634 The Court instead settled on a middle ground. The critical safeguard identified in the passage at issue, the Court noted, is a person\u2019s \u201cright to cut off questioning.\u201d Through the exercise of that right, the person can \u201ccontrol the time at which questioning occurs, the subjects discussed, and the duration of the interrogation.\u201d <em>Mosley, </em>423 U.S. at 103-04, 96 S. Ct. at 326. In turn, the requirement that law enforcement respect a person\u2019s exercise of the right to cut off questioning \u201ccounteracts the coercive pressures of the custodial setting.\u201d <em>Mosley, </em>423 U.S. at 104, 96 S. Ct. at 326. Thus, the Court adopted the following standard: \u2018the admissibility of statements obtained after the person in custody has decided to remain silent depends under <em>Miranda </em>on whether his \u2018right to cut off questioning\u2019 was \u2018scrupulously honored.\u2019 <em>,</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> Mosley, </em>423 U.S. at 104, 96 S. Ct. at 326.</p>\n<p id=\"Apd\">\u00b635 Before we consider whether the officers satisfied this standard in the present case, we must address two preliminary matters: whether Morrisey was subjected to custodial interrogation and whether Morrisey invoked his right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>B. Custodial Interrogation</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">\u00b636 Because the rules articulated in <em>Miranda </em>and its progeny protect persons who are subjected to interrogation while in custody, Morrisey cannot invoke <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>exclusionary rule unless his statements stemmed from a custodial interrogation. <em>See Slwooko v. State, </em>139 P.3d 593, 602-04 (Alaska App. 2006), and cases cited therein. The State disposes of this question as follows: \u2018For the sake of complying with the word limit of the Appellate Rules, the State will not address the issue whether Morrisey was subject to \u2018custodial interrogation,\u2019 although it agrees with the district court\u2019s analysis that Morrisey was not \u2018in custody.\u2019\u2019<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Based on our independent review of the record, however, we agree with Morrisey that the statements at issue here were the product of custodial interrogation. As the District Court noted, there is no dispute that Morrisey was interrogated about Dolana\u2019s homicide. Thus, we focus on the question of custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">\u00b637 A person is \u2018in custody\u201d for <em>Miranda </em>purposes if he has been deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way or his freedom of action has been curtailed to a degree associated with a formal arrest. <em>State v. Munson, </em>2007 MT 222, \u00b6 21, 339 Mont. 68, 169 P.3d 364. This determination focuses on whether, given the circumstances surrounding the interrogation, \u201ca reasonable person [would] have felt he or she was not at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave.\u201d <em>Thompson v. Keohane, </em>516 U.S. 99, 112, 116 S. Ct. 457, 465 (1995); <em>see also Munson, </em>\u00b6 23 (listing circumstances pertinent to this inquiry). Here, Morrisey was stopped by armed police officers pursuant to a traffic stop in a remote area. The officers took control of his pickup and placed him in the caged back seat of their squad car for transport back <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>to his house. They then took control of his house and his other two vehicles. He was given the <em>Miranda </em>warnings which, although not dispositive <em>(see Munson, </em>\u00b6 23 n. 1), certainly contributes to a reasonable person\u2019s understanding that he or she is being held as a criminal suspect. <em>See People v. Aguilera, </em>59 Cal. Rptr. 2d 587, 593 n. 6 (Cal. App. 6th Dist. 1996); <em>People v. Brown, </em>554 N.E.2d 216, 221-22 (Ill. 1990); <em>see also e.g. State v. Lacey, </em>2009 MT 62, \u00b6 63, 349 Mont. 371, 204 P.3d 1192. Eight to ten law enforcement officers were present at his residence. He was accompanied by at least two officers at all times (while in the front yard, on the trip to the caf\u00e9, and during the interview). They told him that they \u201ccame a long ways to talk to you about [Dolana\u2019s homicide]\u201d and wanted to \u201cget a formal statement\u201d then and there because they were \u2018hot coming back here.\u201d The detectives put Morrisey in another police car and transported him elsewhere for an interview. They became increasingly forceful in their questioning, directing him several times to stay on point and repeatedly challenging the veracity of his answers. It is true that when he objected to doing the interview at the local sheriff s office, they allowed him to choose another location. It is also true that they did not physically restrain him with handcuffs or byuse of force. Nevertheless, they controlled his actions while at his house, they took him from his house in a police car for purposes of an interrogation, and they told him that they needed to get a formal statement that day. Morrisey was never advised that he was free to leave; to the contrary, through their statements and conduct, the detectives communicated that he was under their control and would not be let out of their presence until he gave a statement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In sum, a reasonable person in Morrisey s shoes would not have felt free to terminate the interrogation, get out of the police car, and leave. The totality of the circumstances establishes that he was in custody, having been \u201cdeprived of his freedom of action in [a] significant way.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 444, 86 S. Ct. at 1612.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">C. Invocation of the Right to Remain Silent</p>\n<p id=\"b185-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>\u00b638 The State asserted in the District Court that Morrisey \u201cdid not invoke his right to counsel; therefore the police were free to continue questioning him.\u201d The issue, however, is whether he invoked his right to remain silent, and the fact that he \u201cdid not request an attorney is certainly irrelevant to the question of whether he invoked his right to remain silent.\u201d <em>United States v. Rambo, </em>365 F.3d 906, 910 (10th Cir. 2004). Moreover, it does not follow that the police were free to continue questioning Morrisey simply because he did not invoke his right to counsel. If he invoked his right to remain silent, the police were required to cease any interrogation and to \u201cscrupulously honor\u201d his right to cut off questioning. <em>Mosley, </em>423 U.S. at 100, 104, 96 S. Ct. at 325, 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">\u00b639 Alternatively, the State argues that Morrisey\u2019s invocation of his right to remain silent was invalid because it was ambiguous or equivocal. This standard, which derives from <em>Davis v. United States, </em>512 U.S. 452, 459, 114 S. Ct. 2350, 2355 (1994), applies to a post-waiver invocation of the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel (i.e., an invocation after having initially waived that right), and the Supreme Court has not yet directly addressed whether it applies to the right to remain silent, let alone a pre-waiver invocation of that right. <em>See DeWeaver v. Runnels, </em>556 F.3d 995, 1000-01 &amp; n. 1 (9th Cir. 2009) (noting that an ambiguous pre-waiver assertion might require a different analysis); <em>State v. Leyva, </em>951 P.2d 738, 743 (Utah 1997) (refusing to extend <em>Davis </em>to pre-waiver scenarios). But even assuming, arguendo, that a person in custody must articulate his pre-waiver desire not to answer questions \u201csufficiently clearly that a reasonable police officer in the circumstances would understand the statement to be\u201d an assertion of the right to remain silent, <em>Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 459, 114 S. Ct. at 2355, we conclude that Morrisey did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\u00b640 TA] suspect need not \u2018speak with the discrimination of an Oxford don.\u2019 <em>\u201d Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 459, 114 S. Ct. at 2355. Nor need he \u201crely on talismanic phrases or any special combination of words to invoke his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.\u201d <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>79 F.3d 298, 304 (2d Cir. 1996); <em>accord McGraw v. Holland, </em>257 F.3d 513, 518 (6th Cir. 2001). Laypeople are not learned in constitutional principle or legal nicety, and to require that precise words be uttered would elevate form over substance. <em>State v. Spang, </em>2002 MT 120, \u00b6 23, 310 Mont. 52, 48 P.3d 727, <em>overruled in part on other grounds, State v. Buck, </em>2006 MT 81, \u00b6 48, 331 Mont. 517, 134 P.3d 53. Whether the suspect invoked his <em>Miranda </em>rights is an objective inquiry. <em>See Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 458-59, 114 S. Ct. at 2355. Here, when Cameron told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Morrisey, \u2018You have the right to remain silent,\u201d Morrisey responded, \u2018Yeah, I will.\u201d And when Cameron stated, \u201cAnything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law,\u2019\u2019Morrisey asserted, \u201cI ain\u2019t saying nothing.\u201d Taken together, we find nothing ambiguous or equivocal about these responses. <em>Cf. State v. Szpyrka, </em>202 P.3d 524, \u00b6 5 (Ariz. App. 2d Div. 2008) (finding no meaningful difference between the defendant\u2019s statement \u20181 got nothin\u2019 to say\u201d and the locution \u201cI wish to remain silent\u201d); <em>People v. Carey, </em>227 Cal. Rptr. 813, 814-15 (Cal. App. 2d Dist. 1986) (\u201cI ain\u2019t got nothin\u2019 to say\u201d was sufficient to invoke the right to remain silent); <em>Cuervo v. State, </em>967 So.2d 155, 163 (Fla. 2007) (\u2018No quiero declarar nada,\u201d or T don\u2019t want to declare anything,\u201d constituted a clear invocation of the right to remain silent); <em>State v. Crump, </em>834 S.W.2d 265, 269-70 (Tenn. 1992) (T don\u2019t have anything to say\u201d was sufficient to invoke the right to remain silent).</p>\n<p id=\"AGh\">\u00b641 The State notes Morrisey\u2019s subsequent statements to the detectives and contends that his remarks could not have been interpreted to mean that he was unwilling to talk. But a suspect\u2019s post-request responses to further questioning \u201cmay not be used to cast retrospective doubt on the clarity of the initial request itself.\u201d <em>Smith v. Illinois, </em>469 U.S. 91, 100, 105 S. Ct. 490, 495 (1984) (per curiam). We conclude that a reasonable police officer in the circumstances would have understood Morrisey\u2019s initial statements to be an assertion of his right to remain silent.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">D. Application of the \u2018Scrupulously Honor\u201d Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">\u00b642 Having concluded that Morrisey was subjected to custodial interrogation and invoked his right to remain silent, we now address whether that right was infringed thus requiring the suppression of his statements. The central question is whether his right to cut off questioning was \u201cscrupulously honored.\u201d <em>Mosley, </em>423 U.S. at 104, 96 S. Ct. at 326. The <em>Mosley </em>Court did not announce a bright-line rule for determining whether the police satisfied this standard, but the Court did indicate that \u201crefusing to discontinue the interrogation upon request\u201d or \u201cpersisting in repeated efforts to wear down [the person\u2019s] resistance and make him change his mind\u201d would violate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>\u201cscrupulously honor\u201d requirement. <em>See Mosley, </em>423 U.S. at 105-06, 96 S. Ct. at 327. Short of such conduct, the determination depends on surrounding circumstances, such as the amount of time that elapsed between the assertion of the right to remain silent and the resumption of questioning, whether the person was given a fresh set of <em>Miranda </em>warnings and a full and fair opportunity to exercise his rights, whether the second interrogation concerned the same crime that the person previously declined to discuss, and the intensity with which the police pursued questioning after the suspect asserted the right to silence. <em>See Mosley, </em>423 U.S. at 104-06, 96 S. Ct. at 326-27; <em>United States v. Barone, </em>968 F.2d 1378, 1383-84 (1st Cir. 1992). Unlike the traditional voluntariness test, where the suspect\u2019s state of mind is central <em>(see </em>\u00b6 26, <em>supra), </em>the <em>Mosley </em>test focuses on \u201cwhat the police did, and when,\u201d after the suspect exercised the right to remain silent. <em>Barone, </em>968 F.2d at 1384.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">\u00b643 The present case does not involve a refusal by the police to discontinue an interrogation upon request. First, when Morrisey first asserted his right to remain silent, there was no interrogation in progress. Then, at the outset of the formal interview, he told the detectives that he was willing to talk to them about Dolana\u2019s homicide; and at no point thereafter did he ask that questioning be terminated. Morrisey points out that in the interim between his assertion of the right to remain silent and the start of the formal interview, the detectives conversed with him about a variety of topics <em>(see </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18-20, <em>supra), </em>which in Morrisey\u2019s view violatedMosiey. However, none of the detectives\u2019 questions and comments constituted interrogation. \u201cInterrogation,\u201das conceptualized in <em>Miranda, </em>\u2018(must reflect a measure of compulsion above and beyond that inherent in custody <em>itself Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 300, 100 S. Ct. 1682, 1689 (1980). A definition that included any question posed by a police officer would be broader than that required to implement the policy of <em>Miranda </em>itself. <em>United States v. Foster, </em>227 F.3d 1096, 1102-03 (9th Cir. 2000). Thus, the Supreme Court has stated that \u201cinterrogation\u201d under <em>Miranda </em>extends only to \u201cwords or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\u201d <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 301-02, 100 S. Ct. at 1689-90 (footnote omitted). Here, Cameron asked Morrisey a few questions related to the search and then left Morrisey with Schaffer and Bellusci, who in turn informed Morrisey why they were there and told him that they wanted to sit down with him and discuss Dolana\u2019s homicide. Morrisey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>responded, \u2018That is fair. I got no complaints.\u201d He also stated several times, \u20181 have nothing to hide.\u201d From that point forward until the formal interview began, the three of them conversed about numerous topics which had nothing to do with the investigation. Although the conversation did touch on the investigation a few times, we cannot agree that the detectives should have known that their questions and comments were reasonably likely to elicit incriminating responses. Indeed, no incriminating response was elicited during this period.</p>\n<p id=\"A2u\">\u00b644 This also is not a case in which the police persisted in repeated efforts to wear down the suspect\u2019s resistance and make him change his mind about remaining silent. To the contrary, the transcript of the conversation preceding the formal interview shows that Morrisey changed his mind of his own volition. With little or no prompting at all, he freely conversed with the detectives about the weather, the surrounding landscape, his pet cat, his guns, the price of gas, his relationship with his mother, his experiences with bears in the area, where he does his banking, where he buys his gas and groceries, why he decided to settle in that part of Colorado, why he was unmarried, and why he did not have a computer or Internet access. Morrisey was hardly opposed to speaking; if anything, he was loquacious. Furthermore, at the outset of the formal interview, the detectives reminded him that he had been advised of his rights, they asked him whether he was willing to talk to them about the homicide, and Morrisey stated, \u201cI will talk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">\u00b645 Morrisey points out that not long after he asserted his right to remain silent, the detectives told him that \u201cwe want to get it cleared up-we want to get this case done\u201d and \u2018hopefully sit down, visit with you and see where we can-see if we can get this resolved.\u201d In isolation, these statements could be viewed as an attempt to undermine Morrisey\u2019s resolve to remain silent. But by that point, he had already stated several times that he had nothing to hide; and when read in context, the detectives\u2019 remarks were not part of an effort to induce Morrisey to talk when he otherwise would not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"A5k\">\u00b646 In sum, the critical safeguard at issue is Morrisey\u2019s right to cut off questioning and thus control the time at which questioning occurs, the subjects discussed, and the duration of the interrogation, thereby counteracting the coercive pressures of the custodial setting. Mosley, 423 U.S. at 103-04, 96 S. Ct. at 326. The record before us does not support the conclusion that this right was infringed. We hold, therefore, that Morrisey was not entitled to suppression of his statements under his <em>Miranda-Mosley </em>theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>V. Analysis of Morrisey\u2019s Due Process /Totality-of-the-Circumstances Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">\u00b647 As noted, the essential inquiry under the due process voluntariness test is whether the suspect\u2019s will was overborne by the circumstances surrounding the giving of the confession. <em>Dickerson, </em>530 U.S. at 433-34, 120 S. Ct. at 2330-31. A court must examine the totality of all the surrounding circumstances, including the characteristics of the individual and the details of the interrogation, to determine whether the confession was given freely, voluntarily, and without compulsion or inducement of any sort. <em>See Dickerson, </em>530 U.S. at 434, 120 S. Ct. at 2331; <em>Withrow, </em>507 U.S. at 688-89, 113 S. Ct. at 1751. Various factors may be relevant to this inquiry, including: the defendant\u2019s age, maturity, education, physical condition, and mental health; the defendant\u2019s demeanor, coherence, articulateness, and capacity to make full use of his or her faculties; the defendant\u2019s background and experience, including any prior experience with the criminal justice system and police interrogation; the length, mood, location, and continuity of the questioning; the use of threats, violence, or physical punishment (such as the deprivation of food or sleep); the exertion of improper influence, psychological coercion, deception, or implied or express promises; and whether the police advised the defendant of his or her rights to remain silent and to have counsel present during custodial interrogation. <em>See Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 226, 93 S. Ct. 2041, 2047 (1973); <em>Withrow, </em>507 U.S. at 693-94, 113 S. Ct. at 1754; <em>State v.

Bieber, </em>2007 MT 262, \u00b6 31, 339 Mont. 309, 170 P.3d 444.</p>\n<p id=\"ACPR\">\u00b648 Morrisey insists that his statements were not made voluntarily. He points out that at the time he was interrogated, he was over 60 years old and had no prior experience with the criminal justice system or police interrogation. He contends that the detectives disregarded his invocation of his right to remain silent, and through \u201ccontinued prodding\u201d they \u2018lured\u201d and \u201cguilted\u201d him into talking. We are not persuaded. Although Morrisey initially asserted his right to remain silent, the detectives did not attempt to wear down his resistance and make him change his mind. He decided of his own volition to speak with them. Indeed, when he was first asked whether he was willing to talk about Dolana\u2019s homicide, he stated, \u2018That is fair. I got no complaints.\u201d And when he was asked the same question later, he stated, without hesitation, T will talk.\u201d The length and continuity of the interrogation (roughly three hours during the afternoon, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>followed closely by two or three hours in the evening) weigh in Morrisey s favor, as does the fact that the detectives became increasingly forceful in their questioning. However, the detectives did not use threats, violence, or physical punishment. Nor did they use trickery or \u201cgood cop/bad cop\u201d tactics. Morrisey was not deprived of sleep, refreshment, bathroom breaks, or physical comfort. In fact, the detectives tried to accommodate him when he said he would not feel comfortable talking at the local sheriffs office. In sum, the record does not support the conclusion that Morrisey\u2019s will was overborne by the circumstances. If anything, the totality of the circumstances demonstrates that Morrisey willingly engaged in a running conversation with the detectives. In short, the record reflects that his statements were not \u201ccompelled,\u201d but rather were given freely and voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">VI. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">\u00b649 For the foregoing reasons, the District Court correctly denied Morrisey\u2019s motion to suppress, albeit for the wrong reasons. Nevertheless, we will affirm a district court\u2019s decision when it reaches the correct result for the wrong reasons. <em>State v.

Analytical Framework and Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">\u00b651 We analyze a speedy trial claim pursuant to the four-factor balancing test set out in <em>State v. Ariegwe, </em>2007 MT 204,338 Mont. 442, 167 P.3d 815. We examine the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the accused\u2019s responses to the delay, and any prejudice to the accused and then balance these four factors with any other relevant circumstances to determine whether the right to a speedy trial has been violated. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 106-112; <em>State v.

Analysis<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">A. Factor One: The Length of the Delay</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">\u00b653 The State charged Morrisey on September 4,2002, with deliberate homicide and tampering with evidence (the latter charge was dismissed on the last day of trial); however, he was arrested in relation to those charges on September 3, 2002. His trial commenced on November 14, 2005. This constitutes a quite significant delay of 1,168 days between accusation and trial. This delay is considerably greater than the 278-day delay in <em>Billman, </em>the 408-day delay in <em>Ariegwe, </em>and the 507-day delay in <em>State v. Rose, </em>2009 MT 4, 348 Mont. 291, 202 P.3d 749. Thus, the State has a heavy burden to justify the delay and to show that Morrisey was not prejudiced. <em>See Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 62, 123; <em>Billman, </em>\u00b6 18; <em>Rose, </em>\u00b6 46. Still, while the length of the delay here is substantial, it is but one factor in the analysis. Indeed, whereas the 278-day delay in <em>Billman </em>amounted to a speedy trial violation, the 408-day delay in <em>Ariegwe </em>and the 507-day delay in <em>Rose </em>did not. <em>See Billman, </em>\u00b6 52; <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 155; <em>Rose, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 88-92. This is because the speedy trial right is \u201cnecessarily relative\u201d and \u201cdependent] upon circumstances.\u201d <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 522, 92 S. Ct. 2182, 2188 (1972) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">B. Factor Two: The Reasons for the Delay</p>\n<p id=\"Ans\">\u00b654 Under Factor Two, we identify each period of delay, attribute the delay to the appropriate party, and assign weight to each period based on the specific cause and motive for the delay. <em>Billman, </em>\u00b6 20; <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 63-67. Delay is charged to the State unless the accused caused the delay or affirmatively waived the speedy trial right for that period. <em>Billman, </em>\u00b6 20; <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">\u00b655 <em>First Trial Setting: </em>February 18, 2003, which constitutes a 168-day delay from the date of accusation (i.e., from Morrisey\u2019s arrest). The District Court selected this trial date at Morrisey\u2019s December 12,2002 arraignment, which we note was the court\u2019s earliest feasible opportunity for doing so. However, the arraignment was originally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>scheduled for November 21, 2002, and was continued on motion of defense counsel who was scheduled to be out of town on personal matters. According to the motion, Morrisey waived his speedy trial right with respect to this continuance. Thus, of the 168 days, we attribute the period of November 21 to December 12 (21 days) to Morrisey,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and we attribute the balance (147 days) to the State as institutional delay. <em>See Billman, </em>\u00b6 <em>22; Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">\u00b656 <em>Second Trial Setting: </em>May 12, 2003 (an additional 83 days of delay). Morrisey requested a continuance, explaining that by virtue of the \u201ccomplexity\u201d of this case, the February 18 trial date was unrealistic. He noted that the incident giving rise to the homicide charge had occurred over 14 years earlier and that he needed additional time to investigate, locate potential witnesses, and complete discovery. He stated that he was waiving his speedy trial right with respect to this continuance. We thus attribute the 83 days to Morrisey as legitimate delay related to preparing his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">\u00b657 <em>Third Trial Setting: </em>July 28, 2003 (77 days). This postponement was also at Morrisey\u2019s request because additional time was needed to prepare his defense. The delay is likewise attributable to Morrisey. \u00b658 <em>Fourth Trial Setting: </em>September 8, 2003 (42 days). Again, Morrisey filed a motion to continue because he needed additional time to locate and interview potential witnesses, because he was still waiting on certain discovery from the prosecution, and because he was waiting for the reports on evidence that the State had sent to the State Crime Lab for analysis. Given these reasons, responsibility for the 42-day delay is shared equally by Morrisey and the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">\u00b659 <em>Fifth Trial Setting: </em>December 1, 2003 (84 days). Morrisey filed a motion to continue, citing the same reasons articulated in his previous motion. The State filed a response, stating that it did not oppose a continuance and noting that it was waiting for DNA results from the State Crime Lab. The State also asserted that it had provided Morrisey with all discovery currently in its possession. Responsibility for the 84-day delay is thus shared equally by Morrisey and the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">\u00b660 <em>Sixth Trial Setting: </em>May 17, 2004 (168 days). Morrisey requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>a continuance, again citing \u201cthe complexity of this case, the quantity and nature of the evidence and the significant number of witnesses.\u201d He also noted that he was still waiting on reports from the State Crime Lab. The State filed a response, stating that it did not object to a continuance and requesting that the court not set trial during January 2004 due to other homicide trials the County Attorney\u2019s Office would be prosecuting that month. This delay is therefore attributable to both Morrisey and the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">\u00b661 <em>Seventh Trial Setting: </em>August 23, 2004 (98 days). Morrisey requested a 90- to 120-day continuance because he was still trying to locate and interview potential defense witnesses and because the State had endorsed over 100 witnesses, many of whom still needed to be interviewed. Defense counsel stated in the motion that he had proceeded with due diligence in preparing the case but that additional time and funds were needed to complete his investigation. He also noted that the State had recently filed an amended information adding an alternative charge of deliberate homicide by accountability. The State filed a response, stating that it did not object to a continuance and requesting that trial be set for August 2004. Morrisey waived his speedy trial right with respect to this continuance; thus, we attribute these 98 days to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">\u00b662 <em>Eighth Trial Setting: </em>November 1, 2004 (70 days). Morrisey and the State filed a joint stipulation on August 17, 2004. They noted that the trial needed to be continued because the District Court was presently in the midst of a lengthy civil trial <em>(Sunburst School Dist. No. 2 v. Texaco, Inc.). </em>They stipulated to reset trial for November 1, 2004. This delay is attributable to the State as institutional delay related to the court\u2019s docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">\u00b663 <em>Ninth Trial Setting: </em>April 4,2005 (154 days). Morrisey requested a continuance, noting that the State had recently exhumed Dolana\u2019s remains to have them scientifically tested. Morrisey stated that he would be obtaining independent testing and that he needed time to consult with his experts and interview the State\u2019s experts. In addition, he noted that his petition for a writ of supervisory control (related to the denial of his motion to suppress) was pending before this Court. Morrisey stated that he was waiving his speedy trial right with respect to this continuance. We thus attribute the delay to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">\u00b664 <em>Tenth Trial Setting: </em>October 17, 2005 (196 days). On March 18, 2005, Morrisey and the State filed a joint Stipulation to Continue Trial. The forensic anthropologist retained by Morrisey had just recently completed his examination of Dolana\u2019s remains, and the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>intended to have his opinions and conclusions reviewed by its own expert. The parties stated that they would \u201cprovide the Court with a joint recommendation as to a proposed resetting of the trial.\u2019\u2019Thus, the District Court vacated the April 4 trial date. Yet, by August the court had not heard anything from the parties and was understandably concerned about the mounting delay without a pending trial date. <em>See Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 72 (\u201c[T]he primary burden to assure that cases are brought to trial is on the courts and the prosecutors.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). The court accordingly ordered the parties to appear for a status hearing. At the hearing, the State explained that it was waiting on a report from its expert. The court, however, noted that Morrisey had been incarcerated since September 2002; and while recognizing that forensic examinations had been ongoing, the court said that it was \u2018hot willing to let this case drag on indefinitely.\u201d The court thus inquired about the parties\u2019 availability and then set trial. Given these circumstances, the 196-day delay is attributable to both Morrisey and the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">\u00b665 <em>Eleventh (and Final) Trial Setting: </em>November 14,2005 (28 days). The State filed a motion to continue, attaching a joint stipulation by Morrisey and the State. Morrisey had to undergo cataract surgery and was not expected to recover in time for trial on October 17. The State asked that the continuance be charged to Morrisey, and the District Court did so. We agree and, thus, attribute the 28 days to Morrisey. \u00b666 <em>Summary: </em>Unquestionably, the delay of 1,168 days in bringing Morrisey to trial was substantial; however, the parties share equal responsibility for 490 days (42%), and Morrisey waived another 356 days (30%). That leaves 322 days (28%), which were attributable to Morrisey\u2019s requests for additional time to prepare his defense, to his cataract surgery, and to institutional circumstances beyond his and the State\u2019s control (e.g., the District Court\u2019s docket and the time needed to process evidence at the State Crime Lab). Significantly, there is no evidence of any dilatory tactics, purposeful foot-dragging, negligence, or bad-faith delay on the part of the prosecution. To the contrary, the delay here was due largely to the \u201ccomplexity\u201d of the case and the parties\u2019 need for additional time to investigate and prepare for a trial that was based on events which had occurred over 14 years earlier. We conclude, therefore, that Factor Two weighs heavily against finding a violation of Morrisey\u2019s right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">C. Factor Three: The Accused\u2019s Responses to the Delay</p>\n<p id=\"Ak_\">\u00b667 Under the third speedy trial factor, we evaluate the accused\u2019s responses to the delay, i.e., his or her acquiescence in and objections to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>pretrial delays. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 110. The totality of the accused\u2019s responses to the pretrial delays is indicative of whether he or she actually wanted a speedy trial. <em>Billman, </em>\u00b6 31; <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 79. Here, the record reflects that Morrisey wanted to proceed to trial as expeditiously as possible and that he only requested continuances in order to conduct the necessary investigations, to prepare his defense, and to address a medical emergency (prior to the cataract surgery, Morrisey was almost blind). We also note that Morrisey filed a timely motion asserting his right to a speedy trial. Accordingly, Factor Three weighs in Morrisey\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">D. Factor Four: Prejudice to the Accused</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">\u00b668 Lastly, under Factor Four, we consider whether the pretrial delay prejudiced the accused in light of the interests that the speedy trial right protects: (i) preventing oppressive pretrial incarceration, (ii) minimizing anxiety and concern caused by the presence of unresolved criminal charges, and (iii) limiting the possibility that the accused\u2019s ability to present an effective defense will be impaired. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 111. We have long recognized these three interests as relevant to the analysis of prejudice. <em>See e.g. City of Billings v. Bruce, </em>1998 MT 186, \u00b6 68, 290 Mont. 148, 965 P.2d 866; <em>State v. Keller, </em>170 Mont. 372, 380-81, 553 P.2d 1013, 1018-19 (1976). As noted (see \u00b6 53, <em>supra), </em>the State has a heavy burden to show that Morrisey was not prejudiced, given the substantial delay of 1,168 days in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">\u00b669 The District Court determined that Morrisey had been subjected to oppressive pretrial incarceration, having been incarcerated on unproven charges for over three years. <em>Cf Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 90 (TT]he longer the pretrial incarceration, the more likely it has been oppressive and the more likely the accused has been prejudiced by the delay.\u201d). Next, the court determined that the delay in bringing Morrisey to trial had not aggravated the anxiety and concern inherent in being accused of a crime. The court noted that Morrisey had never moved the court for a reduction of his bail. Lastly, the court determined that Morrisey\u2019s ability to present an effective defense had not been impaired. In this regard, Morrisey\u2019s position was that he suffered prejudice because certain witnesses either had died or could not be located. He also claimed that some of his witnesses had difficulty recalling the events in question after so many years. But the District Court observed that Morrisey had not subpoenaed a single witness for any of the previous trial dates and that he had offered nothing more than speculation as to what testimony the unlocated or deceased witnesses would have provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>\u00b670 On appeal, the parties focus on the impairment issue and present no arguments related to the first two speedy trial interests (oppressive pretrial incarceration, and anxiety and concern). Morrisey again claims that the pretrial delay impaired his ability to present an effective defense. He contends that one of the other suspects in Dolana\u2019s death committed suicide in July 2004 \u201cbefore Morrisey could interview him.\u201d As the State points out, however, Morrisey had \u201cample time\u201d to interview this witness prior to his death. Morrisey also contends that he was unable to locate a witness named Soloria who (according to Morrisey) told the police that she saw Dolana hiding and jumping out of a truck on the day she disappeared. Morrisey asserts that Soloria\u2019s testimony \u201cwould have established... that Morrisey was not involved in her disappearance since he did not own a truck.\u201d But, as the State points out, Morrisey does not explain how Soloria\u2019s unavailability was due to the pretrial delay in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">\u00b671 We agree with Morrisey that time may erode the accuracy of witness testimony and exculpatory evidence, thereby impairing the defendant\u2019s ability to present an effective defense. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 98. We also agree that impairment of one\u2019s defense is the most difficult form of speedy trial prejudice to prove, since time\u2019s erosion of exculpatory evidence and testimony can rarely be shown. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 99. But the period at issue here is the time between accusation and trial, not the time between Dolana\u2019s disappearance and trial (see footnote 9, <em>supra), </em>and Morrisey fails to explain how the delay between his arrest in September 2002 and his trial in November 2005 impaired his ability to present an effective defense. As discussed under Factor Two, a substantial portion of the delay was requested by Morrisey for the express purpose of conducting investigations, having evidence tested, locating and interviewing potential witnesses, and preparing his defense to the charges. If anything, therefore, the record suggests that Morrisey\u2019s ability to prepare his defense was benefited, not prejudiced, by the continuances in his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">\u00b672 We conclude that, notwithstanding the presumption of prejudice in this case <em>(see </em>\u00b6 53, <em>supra', Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 49), Factor Four does not weigh significantly in Morrisey\u2019s favor. Although the pretrial incarceration was oppressive in terms of duration, Morrisey has not demonstrated aggravated anxiety and concern or an impaired ability to present an effective defense as a consequence of the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">E. Balancing</p>\n<p id=\"AqQ\">\u00b673 We last determine whether Morrisey was deprived of his right to a speedy trial in light of the facts of the case and the weight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>assigned to each of the four factors discussed above. <em>Rose, </em>\u00b6 87. 'None of the factors is dispositive by itself; rather, the factors are related and must be considered together with such other circumstances as may be relevant.\u201d <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 153. Moreover, each factor\u2019s significance depends on the unique facts and circumstances of the case. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 105; <em>Billman, </em>\u00b6 11. Here, on one hand, the pretrial delay was substantial and Morrisey wanted to proceed to trial as expeditiously as possible. But, on the other hand, he requested or waived much of the delay so that he could properly prepare his defense, and there is no evidence of negligence or bad-faith delaying tactics on the part of the prosecution. Given these latter considerations and the lack of significant prejudice caused by the delay, we conclude that Morrisey was not denied his right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">\u00b674 <em>ISSUE 3.

Morrisey also sought disclosure of Dr. Symes\u2019 \u201cconclusion(s) or opinion(s) herein; the basis and/or reasoning and/or methodology of or for said conclusions or opinions; the results of any tests conducted; [and] a copy or any report of his opinion(s), conclusion(s).\u201d In response, the State asserted that such disclosure was not required because (1) the State did not intend to call Dr. Symes in its case-in-chief, but rather would call him only \u201cas a rebuttal witness to rebut the testimony of\u2019 Dr. Gill-King, a forensic anthropologist retained by Morrisey, and (2) the State would call Dr. Symes only \u201cto impeach the credibility\u201d of Dr. Gill-King. Morrissey, however, pointed out that the State had never indicated before then that Dr. Symes would be called only for rebuttal purposes. He noted that six months earlier, the parties had filed a joint Stipulation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>Continue Trial in which the State explained that Dr. Symes would be reviewing Dr. Gill-King\u2019s opinions and conclusions and, \u201cdependent upon [Dr. Symes\u2019] opinion, the results may result in a resolution of this matter.\u201d Morrisey also pointed out that a central issue at trial was going to be whether his .22-caliber rifle was the murder weapon and that Dr. Symes\u2019 opinion specifically addressed that issue. Morrisey opined that Dr. Symes\u2019 opinion would play \u201ca major part\u201din the State\u2019s case. Nevertheless, the District Court denied his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">\u00b677 After the State rested its case-in-chief, Morrisey renewed his argument that he was entitled to disclosure of Dr. Symes\u2019 conclusions. He noted that if the State were truly going to call Dr. Symes just to impeach Dr. Gill-King\u2019s credibility, then disclosure of Dr. Symes\u2019 conclusions was probably not required. However, he contended that if Dr. Symes were going to offer a forensic opinion that differed from Dr. Gill-King\u2019s forensic opinion, then disclosure was required. In this regard, Morrisey argued that in substance, what Dr. Symes would be providing was a forensic opinion, not testimony about Dr. Gill-King\u2019s credibility. The District Court again denied his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">\u00b678 Dr. Gill-King testified that he examined Dolana\u2019s skull to determine what caliber weapon had been used. His ultimate conclusion was that Dolana had been killed by a high-velocity round, traveling much faster than a standard .22 long rifle round, but with a diameter similar to a .22. He stated that in his opinion, it was \u2018Very improbable\u201d that the entry and exit wounds had been caused by a .22 long rifle round. Thereafter, the State called Dr. Symes, who testified that he was present at trial to discuss his examination of Dolana\u2019s skull, and Dr. Gill-King\u2019s examination of the skull as well. In Dr. Symes\u2019 view, Dolana was killed by a low-velocity round fired from a small-caliber weapon, and he concluded that a .22-caliber rifle firing typical ammunition could have been used. Dr. Symes also commented on Dr. Gill-King\u2019s report and discussed points on which he disagreed with Dr. Gill-King. On cross-examination, however, Dr. Symes agreed that Dr. Gill-King was \u201ccompetent and qualified.\u201dDr. Symes also acknowledged that he could not say a .22 rifle had in fact been used.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">III. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">\u00b679 \u2018If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.\u201d M. R. Evid. 702. Section 46-15-322(l)(c), MCA, in turn, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>states that upon request, the prosecutor shall make available to the defendant for examination and reproduction certain material and information within the prosecutor\u2019s possession or control, including \u201call written reports or statements of experts who have personally examined the defendant or any evidence in the particular case, together with the results of physical examinations, scientific tests, experiments, or comparisons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">\u00b680 Morrisey argues that the State was \u201cstatutorily obligated to disclose Dr. Symes\u2019 conclusions, given that Dr. Symes was an expert witness-not a rebuttal witness-and he gave pure expert testimony.\u201d As it did under Issue 1 (see \u00b6 36, <em>supra), </em>the State responds as follows: \u2018For the sake of complying with the word limits and without conceding that Dr. Symes\u2019 conclusions should have been disclosed to Morrisey prior to trial, the State will forego an analysis of whether an expert who testifies as a rebuttal witness is subject to the disclosure requirements of [\u00a746-15-322(l)(c), MCA].\u201dIn the State\u2019s view, Tejven if nondisclosure of Dr. Symes\u2019 report was error, it was harmless.\u201d While we agree with Morrisey that the State should have provided the requested disclosure, we agree with the State that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">\u00b681 As noted, the State argued that disclosure of Dr. Symes\u2019 opinions and conclusions was not required for two reasons: (1) because the State did not intend to call Dr. Symes in its case-in-chief, but would call him only \u201cas a rebuttal witness to rebut the testimony of\u2019 Dr. G ill-King, and (2) because the State would call Dr. Symes only \u2018to impeach the credibility\u201d of Dr. Gill-King. As for the State\u2019s first theory, nothing in the statute stands for the proposition that disclosure is not required for experts called by the prosecution \u201cin rebuttal.\u201d In this connection, the State pointed out that \u00a746-15-322(l)(a), MCA, requires the prosecutor to disclose \u201cthe names, addresses, and statements of all persons whom the prosecutor may call as witnesses in <em>the case in chief </em>(emphasis added). But Morrisey did not rely on subsection (l)(a). He relied on subsection (l)(c), which requires the prosecutor to disclose \u201call written reports or statements of experts who have personally examined the defendant or any evidence in the particular case, together with the results of physical examinations, scientific tests, experiments, or comparisons.\u201d This requirement is not limited like subsection (l)(a) to \u201cthe case in chief,\u201d and we reject the State\u2019s attempt to insert such language into subsection (l)(c). <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-2-101, MCA. The State also cited <em>State v. Weitzel, </em>2000 MT 86, \u00b6\u00b6 31-32, 299 Mont. 192, 998 P.2d 1154, and <em>State v. Hildreth, </em>267 Mont. 423, 430, 884 P.2d 771, 775-76 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>(1994), for the proposition that the prosecution is not required by \u00a746-15-322(6), MCA, to provide notice of a witness called to impeach the credibility of a defense witness. Yet, neither <em>Weitzel </em>nor <em>Hildreth </em>involved a witness providing expert testimony, and the present case does not involve subsection (6) of \u00a746-15-322, MCA. But more to the point, the State cannot escape the disclosure requirements of subsection (l)(c) through the mere expedient of cloaking expert-opinion testimony as \u201ccredibility-impeachment\u201d testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">\u00b682 As for the State\u2019s second theory, however, we agree that under the language of \u00a746-15-322(l)(c), MCA, the prosecution is not required to disclose the reports of a witness whom the State will not be calling to provide expert testimony. In other words, if the person is being called strictly as a fact witness, the statute\u2019s disclosure requirements are not applicable. Thus, as Morrisey acknowledged in the District Court, if Dr. Symes were being called solely to impeach Dr. Gill-King\u2019s credibility by some means other than by providing a contrary expert forensic opinion, then disclosure was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">\u00b683 Accordingly, by refusing Morrisey5 s pretrial request for disclosure of Dr. Symes\u2019 opinions and conclusions, the State effectively bound itself not to call Dr. Symes as an expert to provide his opinions about Dolana\u2019s skull and the murder weapon (whether in the State\u2019s case-in-chief or in rebuttal). Section 46-15-322(l)(c), MCA, is quite clear on this point. And for this reason, while the District Court did not provide an explanation for its decision to deny Morrisey\u2019s motion for disclosure, the court\u2019s ruling was not necessarily incorrect. The State had vowed several times that it would call Dr. Symes only to impeach Dr. Gill-King\u2019s credibility, and the District Court evidently took this to mean that the State would <em>not </em>call Dr. Symes to provide expert testimony. The real issue arose when the State did call Dr. Symes to give his expert opinion regarding the gun used to kill Dolana. That testimony clearly fell within the strictures of \u00a746-15-322(l)(c), MCA, and outside the bounds of what the State had told the court and Morrisey Dr. Symes\u2019 testimony would be. Hence, the testimony was objectionable, and a timely objection would have been properly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqd\">\u00b684 Although Morrisey did not contemporaneously object to Dr. Symes\u2019 testimony due to the fact that he had already twice argued that the testimony was improper, we conclude that any error caused by the State\u2019s failure to comply with \u00a746-15-322(l)(c), MCA, was harmless. \u201cA cause may not be reversed by reason of any error committed by the trial court against the convicted person unless the record shows that the error was prejudicial.\u201d Section 46-20-701(1), MCA. Here, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Morrisey claims that he \u201ccould not adequately prepare a defense or cross-examination\u201d because he did not know in advance what Dr. Symes\u2019 opinions and conclusions were, the record reflects that Morrisey in fact cross-examined Dr. Symes at length. Morrisey surmises that he could have prepared a more vigorous cross-examination; yet, he fails to provide any concrete factual analysis to support this claim. Finally, Morrisey asserts that the State\u2019s nondisclosure was \u2018inherently prejudicial\u201d; but on the record before us, we are not persuaded that such prejudice exists here. In short, Morrisey has not adequately demonstrated that he was prejudiced by the State\u2019s violation of \u00a746-15-322(l)(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">\u00b685 <em>ISSUE 4. </em>Was <em>there sufficient evidence upon which a jury could find Morrisey guilty of deliberate homicide beyond a reasonable doubt?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\u00b686 We review the sufficiency of evidence to support a conviction to determine whether, after reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Shields, </em>2005 MT 249, \u00b6 14, 328 Mont. 509, 122 P.3d 421; <em>State v. Debus, </em>2002 MT 307, \u00b6 15, 313 Mont. 57, 59 P.3d 1154.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">\u00b687 The jury found Morrisey guilty of deliberate homicide. A person commits this offense if he or she \u201cpurposely or knowingly causes the death of another human being.\u201d Section 45-5-102(l)(a), MCA (1987). Morrisey argues that the evidence presented at trial was not sufficient for a rational trier of fact to find that he purposely or knowingly caused Dolana\u2019s death. He observes that the police found no direct evidence connecting him to Dolana\u2019s disappearance or death, and he argues that the State\u2019s physical evidence was inconclusive. In Morrisey\u2019s view, the State\u2019s case rested on \u201cwitnesses\u2019 concerns\u201dabout the amount of time he and Dolana spent together and the detectives\u2019 \u2018impression\u201dthat he was responsible for her death. Morrisey points out that he was a \u201cclose friend\u201d of the Clark family, that he helped search for Dolana on the night she disappeared, and that he even put up a reward for information regarding her disappearance and contacted the National Center for Missing Children. Morrisey thus contends that his conviction must be reversed due to insufficient evidence of his guilt. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>\u00b688 This Court reviews a jury\u2019s verdict to determine whether sufficient evidence exists to support the verdict, not whether the evidence could have supported a different result. <em>State v. Field, </em>2005 MT 181, \u00b6 15, 328 Mont. 26, 116 P.3d 813. Here, the evidence against Morrisey was indisputably circumstantial. Shortly after Dolana disappeared in 1988, the investigating officers thoroughly searched Morrisey\u2019s residence; and although they gathered evidence of fibers and stains, none of this evidence indicated that Morrisey was involved in Dolana\u2019s disappearance. Similarly, after spending several days in 2002 searching his Colorado residence and vehicles, the officers again found no physical evidence conclusively connecting Morrisey to Dolana\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">\u00b689 As a result, the prosecution relied on circumstantial evidence of Morrisey\u2019s guilt. \u2018Circumstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cthat which tends to establish a fact by proving another and which, though true, does not of itself conclusively establish that fact but affords an inference or presumption of its existence.\u201d Section 26-1-102(1), MCA. Circumstantial evidence is sufficient by itself to sustain a conviction if it is of such a quality and quantity as to legally justify a jury in determining guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, when all of the facts and circumstances are considered collectively. <em>See State v. Rosling, </em>2008 MT 62, \u00b6 36, 342 Mont. 1, 180 P.3d 1102; <em>State v. Hill, </em>2008 MT 260, \u00b6 35, 345 Mont. 95, 189 P.3d 1201. Where, as here, circumstantial evidence is susceptible to two reasonable interpretations, one which supports guilt and the other which supports innocence, the trier of fact determines which interpretation is most reasonable. <em>Rosling, </em>\u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"A3h\">\u00b690 According to the evidence presented at trial, Morrisey told the police in 1988 that on the day of her disappearance, Dolana stopped by his house at 10:00 a.m. for a short visit and was supposed to return at 12:30 p.m. so that he could drive her to the pet store to see the cat she wanted to purchase. Yet, Lisa (Dolana\u2019s half-sister) testified that she, Dolana, and their mother were together at the Clark home all of that morning until about 1:00 p.m. Morrisey also claimed in 1988 that he did not see Dolana again after their alleged 10:00 a.m. visit. Yet, during his interview with the detectives in 2002, he stated that he saw Dolana between 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. on the day she disappeared.</p>\n<p id=\"AlrR\">\u00b691 On the night of Dolana\u2019s disappearance, Morrisey, Lisa, and Rick (a brother-in-law of Dolana and Lisa) agreed to search for Dolana. Rick testified that he suggested they split up to cover more ground, but Morrisey rejected that idea. Rick also testified that Morrisey did not want to use either of his own vehicles in the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>\u00b692 The Clarks did not have a telephone in their home and often used Morrisey\u2019s phone. Yet, after Dolana disappeared, Morrisey stayed at the Clark home for several days, even though he had told people that Dolana, if she could, would try to call him at his house or would simply show up there. In addition, Vicki (another of Dolana\u2019s half-sisters) testified that about a week after Dolana disappeared, Morrisey suggested, without explanation, that Vicki call the police and report that she had spotted Dolana\u2019s bike in a river, even though this information was untrue.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">\u00b693 About two weeks after Dolana\u2019s disappearance, Morrisey discontinued all contact with the Clarks, despite having had a close relationship with the family for years. Two or three months later, he left Great Falls and never spoke to any of the Clarks again. Notably, during his interview with the detectives in 2002, he stated a number of times that he wished he had never met \u2018them people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\u00b694 Dr. Jack Henneford testified at Morrisey\u2019s trial as an expert in forensic pathology. He had examined Dolana\u2019s skull in 1989 and located an entrance wound at the base of the skull and an exit wound in the forehead. Based on the measurement of these wounds, he concluded that they had been caused by a small-caliber bullet, such as a .22, though he acknowledged that a range of weapons could have produced the wounds. Likewise, neither Dr. Symes nor Dr. Gill-King could say for certain what caliber weapon was used; however, Dr. Symes thought that it could have been a .22-caliber rifle firing typical ammunition.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\u00b695 In 2002, Morrisey learned through his friend Melvin that the police had renewed their investigation into Dolana\u2019s death and were asking about Morrisey\u2019s cars and small-caliber guns. According to Melvin, Morrisey seemed nervous at the mention of his cars and stated that because Dolana had been in the Impala a lot, the police would find her DNA there. Morrisey thereafter destroyed his .22 rifle-a rifle his mother had given him when he was 12 years old. Moreover, when the detectives arrived in Colorado to execute the search warrants, they found his house to be \u201calmost sterile\u201dand his Camaro to be \u201cspotless.\u201d Likewise, the Impala was \u201cimmaculate\u201d and the trunk had been sprayed with a heavy-duty black paint or bedliner. The detectives found the following items inside the Impala: a .45-caliber \u2018Tommy gun,\u201d a fully loaded 10-shot clip, an 11-shot clip, and 400 rounds of .45 ammunition; water bottles; cat food; and a drawer containing personal possessions such as family photographs, birth and death certificates, baby books, a Social Security card, school records, and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>memorabilia. The tank was full of gas, and the keys were in the ignition. Morrisey told the detectives that he kept the ammunition in his vehicle in case of fire, because keeping it in the house would pose a danger to the responders; yet, they found a box of .38-special ammunition in the kitchen.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">\u00b696 Morrisey\u2019s statements to the police, which were introduced into evidence, were riddled with inconsistencies and contradicted by the other testimony and evidence. For instance, at the time of Dolana\u2019s disappearance, Morrisey told investigators that he did not own any guns; however, he admitted to the detectives during the 2002 interview that he owned a.22-caliber rifle when he was living in Great Falls. Morrisey claimed that his gun was in a closet when the officers searched his house in 1988; yet, the investigating officers did not find any guns in Morrisey\u2019s closets. When asked where the .22 was now, Morrisey stated that he had sold it several years earlier at a flea market in Illinois, but after further questioning he changed his story and stated that he had thrown it off a bridge into the Mississippi River. Still later, Morrisey admitted that he had recently disposed of the gun after learning about the renewed investigation. He explained that he had done so because he was afraid that the gun would be used to \u201cpin\u201d Dolana\u2019s death on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">\u00b697 Morrisey agreed with the detectives that either he or Dolana\u2019s father (Boyce) had killed Dolana and that there was no \u2018bogeyman\u201d out there, i.e., fit\u2019s just down to [Morrisey] did it or [Boyce] did it.\u201d But Morrisey claimed that he had loaned his gun to Boyce about a week before Dolana disappeared and that Boyce had returned the gun about a week after her disappearance. Morrisey asserted that Boyce then admitted to killing Dolana with the .22. However, Morrisey acknowledged that he did not report this admission to the police at any point during the preceding 14 years, notwithstanding the fact that Morrisey had been a suspect back in 1988 and notwithstanding the fact that he purported to love Dolana. Morrisey explained that he kept Boyce\u2019s admission to himself because he and Boyce were friends and he was only revealing it now because he was fin a big jam.\u201d Yet, Morrisey later characterized Boyce as a \u201cson of a bitch\u201d and stated that he wanted nothing to do with Boyce.</p>\n<p id=\"AX\">\u00b698 In conclusion, although the evidence presented at Morrisey s trial was susceptible to multiple reasonable interpretations, some pointing to his guilt and others pointing to alternative explanations for his actions, this does not mean that the evidence was insufficient to support a verdict of guilty. It was the province of the jury to decide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>which interpretation of the evidence was most reasonable. <em>Rosling, </em>\u00b6 43. It was also the province of the jury to decide the credibility of each witness and the weight to be given their testimony and, in the event of conflicting evidence, to determine which will prevail. <em>See State v. </em>Merrick, 2000 MT 124, \u00b6 13, 299 Mont. 472, 2 P.3d 242; <em>State v.

Having reviewed the record, we hold that when all of the facts and circumstances are considered collectively and in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the circumstantial evidence in this case was of sufficient quality and quantity that a rational trier of fact could find beyond a reasonable doubt that Morrisey purposely or knowingly caused Dolana\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"AdY\">\u00b699 The District Court correctly denied Morrisey\u2019s motion to suppress and his motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial. Although the State did not properly comply with \u00a7 46-15-322(l)(c), MCA, Morrisey has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by this error. Lastly, we hold that there was sufficient evidence presented at trial to support the jury\u2019s guilty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">\u00b6100 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b205-7\">JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b174-17\"> The transcript does not identify which of the two detectives is speaking.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b179-5\"> The Supreme Court has since recognized exceptions to <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>exclusionary rule. <em>See New York v.

Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 484-85, 101 S. Ct. 1880, 1885 (1981); <em>Montejo v. </em>Louisiana, _ U.S. _, _ S. Ct. _, 173 L. Ed. 2d 955, 968 (2009); <em>see also Arizona v.

Buck, </em>2006 MT 81, \u00b6 39, 331 Mont. 517, 134 P.3d 53 (noting the distinction between the Fifth Amendment and Sixth Amendment rights to counsel).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b183-6\"> The Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure do not allow for \u201cshortcut tactics\u201d such as this. <em>State v. Ferguson, </em>2005 MT 343, \u00b6 40, 330 Mont. 103, 126 P.3d 463. The argument section of an appellee\u2019s brief must contain legal analysis and citations to relevant authority with respect to the issues presented. <em>See </em>M. R. App. P. 23(b) (2005), <em>superseded, </em>M. R. App. P. 12(2) (2007); <em>see also </em>M. R. App. P. 23(g)(i) (2005), <em>superseded, </em>M. R. App. P. 12(10) (2007) (providing for over-length briefs). As we have previously stated, \u201c[t]he requirement that appellate briefs \u2018contain\u2019 a party\u2019s contentions unquestionably precludes parties from incorporating trial briefs or any other kind of argument into appellate briefs by mere reference. Simply put, appellate arguments must be contained within the appellate brief, not within some other document.\u201d <em>Ferguson, </em>\u00b6 41. The State\u2019s approach, moreover, is totally incongruous in light of its position in <em>State v. Cybulski, </em>2009 MT 70, 349 Mont. 429, 204 P.3d 7, where the State argued that \u201callowing [the appellant] to incorporate trial arguments into appellate briefs by reference seriously undermines the word and page limitations in M. R. App. P. 11(4)\u201d (formerly M. R. App. P. 27(d) (2005)). <em>Cybulski, </em>\u00b6 14. Likewise here, incorporating the District Court\u2019s analysis into its appellate brief by reference undermines the very word and page limitations with which the State purports to be complying.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b184-5\"> At the suppression hearing, Cameron testified that Morrisey \u201ccould have left at any time.\u201d Schaffer and Bellusci testified to the same effect. However, the detectives acknowledged that not one of them communicated this fact to Morrisey, and it is well-settled that \u201can officer\u2019s undisclosed view that the individual may (or may not) terminate the interview and leave has no bearing on the question whether the individual was in custody at the time.\u201d <em>Munson, </em>\u00b6 21; <em>accord Evans v. District Court, </em>2000 MT 38, \u00b6 21, 298 Mont. 279, 995 P.2d 455. \u201cCustody\u201d depends on objective circumstances, not on the subjective and undisclosed views harbored by the officers. <em>Stansbury v. California, </em>511 U.S. 318, 323-24, 114 S. Ct. 1526, 1529-30 (1994) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b186-6\"> To the extent the detectives found Morrisey\u2019s statements to be ambiguous or equivocal, it is \u201cgood police practice\u201d in such situations for the interviewing officers to clarify whether or not the suspect is actually invoking his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>See Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 461, 114 S. Ct. at 2356; <em>Simmons v. Bowersox, </em>235 F.3d 1124, 1132 n. 3 (8th Cir. 2001); <em>see also e.g. State v. Maestas, </em>2006 MT 101, \u00b6 18, 332 Mont. 140, 136 P.3d 514. Clarifying questions help protect the rights of the suspect and will minimize the chance of a confession being suppressed due to subsequent judicial second-guessing as to the meaning of the suspect\u2019s statement. <em>Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 461, 114 S. Ct. at 2356.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b191-8\"> Morrisey s motion to dismiss was based on the pre- and post-accusation delay in bringing him to trial. The right to a speedy trial applies to one who has been \u201caccused\u201d of a criminal offense and thus does not protect against pre-accusation delay. <em>See </em>Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a7 24; U.S. Const. amend. VI; <em>United States v. Marion, </em>404 U.S. 307, 313-15, 92 S. Ct. 455, 459-60 (1971). Father, pre-accusation delay is addressed by the Due Process Clause or an applicable statute of limitations. <em>See United States v. Lovasco, </em>431 U.S. 783, 788-89, 97 S. Ct. 2044, 2048 (1977); <em>State v. Krinitt, </em>251 Mont. 28, 32-36, 823 P.2d 848, 851-53 (1991). While Morrisey asserted a due process claim related to the pre-accusation delay in this case, which the District Court denied, he does not argue that claim on appeal. We accordingly will consider only his speedy trial claim, and we note that the record before us is sufficient for analyzing that claim. <em>Cf. Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 120.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b192-8\"> Delay caused by defense counsel is charged against the defendant. <em>Vermont v. </em>Brillon, _ U.S. _, 129 S.

Likewise, a defendant can preserve his speedy trial right if he expressly asserts that right and his actions contradict those of his counsel. <em>See McNeely v.
