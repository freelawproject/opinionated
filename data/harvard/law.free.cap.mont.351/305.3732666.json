Tinker cross-appeals from the portions of the WCC\u2019s decision denying his occupational disease claim for his left hip, and his claims for an award of attorney fees and a statutory penalty based on State Fund\u2019s denial of his claims. We deny State Fund\u2019s appeal and Tinker\u2019s cross-appeal, and affirm the decision of the WCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">\u00b62 Tinker began working for Harman Construction in Great Falls, Montana, in approximately 1989. During the time Tinker worked there, the company did primarily concrete work and Tinker\u2019s job duties included being a foreman, laborer and form-setter. A significant amount of Tinker\u2019s work involved heavy-duty labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">\u00b63 Sometime in June 2005, Tinker suffered an injury at work. He was setting a foundation, when he slipped on an oiled surface, did a split, and then fell on his left hip. Tinker rested briefly after the fall, finished his work shift, and reported it to his boss. At the time, Tinker did experience some pain from the fall, but did not give the injury much thought. From the day of the injury forward, Tinker had some pain in his left hip which would come and go. Tinker did not seek medical treatment for his injury, as he did not tend to be a \u201ccomplainer,\u201d could not afford to take time off work, and assumed that the injury would eventually heal of its own accord.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-12\">\u00b64 In spite of his hip pain, Tinker continued in the same job position with the same job duties. By the beginning of 2007, however, the pain had increased to the point where Tinker had difficulty getting in and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>out of a vehicle and performing his job. Tinker was also experiencing sharp pains in his hip and knee which prevented him from sleeping at night and limited his ability to walk around work sites. On July <em>24, 2007, </em>Tinker saw Dr. Loy L. Anderson (Dr. Anderson) for an evaluation of his hip and knee pain. Dr. Anderson took x-rays of Tinker\u2019s hip and determined he had a severe degenerative condition which might require surgery. Tinker indicated to Dr. Anderson that the pain in his hip began with the slip and fall injury roughly two years prior.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">\u00b65 Tinker saw Dr. Anderson for a follow-up appointment on August 23, 2007. Dr. Anderson noted that the x-rays taken at the previous visit did not indicate any problems with Tinker\u2019s knee but did show severe degenerative changes in his left hip. At that time, Dr. Anderson opined that Tinker\u2019s degenerative condition was likely caused by his industrial accident. Dr. Anderson informed Tinker that he needed a hip replacement.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">\u00b66 After his second visit with Dr. Anderson, Tinker continued working at Harman Construction. Tinker subsequently decided to file a workers\u2019 compensation claim with State Fund, and Tinker contacted State Fund and explained to an adjuster that he wished to file a claim. Although Tinker could not remember the precise date of his industrial accident, he and the claims adjuster agreed to fix the date of his injury as June 15, 2005. Tinker signed a report of his injury on August 10, 2007, and submitted his claim to State Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">\u00b67 Within a week after filing his claim, State Fund informed Tinker that it would be denied on the grounds it had not been filed within 12 months of the injury as required under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (Act). On August 28,2007, Tinker filed another claim with State Fund, this time indicating that he suffered an occupational disease of his hips, with an injury date of July 24, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">\u00b68 Dr. Ronald M. Peterson conducted an independent medical examination (IME) of Tinker on February 20, 2008. Dr. Peterson opined that Tinker\u2019s left hip condition started with the June 2005 accident, and that it was unlikely to have been caused by any inflammatory diseases. Dr. Peterson classified the condition as traumatic osteoarthritis secondary to a fall and stated that Tinker would not have had this condition but for the June 2005 fall. He further opined that Tinker\u2019s condition progressed as rapidly as it did because of the heavy-duty nature of his job. In conclusion, Dr. Peterson recommended that Tinker receive a total hip replacement, and that the need for this surgery was due to the natural progression of the June 2005 industrial injury. State Fund ultimately denied Tinker\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>occupational disease claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">\u00b69 On December 24,2007, Tinker filed a petition for a trial before the WCC, challenging State Fund\u2019s denial of his claims and seeking attorney fees, costs, and a statutory penalty based on State Fund\u2019s denial. A trial was held on May 29, 2008, in Great Falls. On July 7, 2008, the WCC issued its written ruling, holding that Tinker was entitled to acceptance of his workers\u2019 compensation injury claim for his left hip condition, as well as costs incurred in this matter. The WCC denied Tinker\u2019s claim for an occupational disease for his left hip condition, as well as his claims for attorney fees and a statutory penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">\u00b610 In its order, the WCC stated that there was no factual controversy concerning Tinker\u2019s injury or the results of the medical evaluations. Instead, the controversy concerned whether Tinker\u2019s hip condition was compensable as either an industrial injury or an occupational disease. The WCC noted that State Fund denied Tinker\u2019s injury claim because he did not file it within 12 months of its occurrence as required under \u00a739-71-601, MCA (2005). Tinker argued to the WCC that his claim should either be compensable as an occupational disease, or that the WCC should find the 12-month filing period for his injury claim was waived pursuant to \u00a739-71-601(2), MCA (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">\u00b611 In its analysis, the WCC began by denying Tinker\u2019s claim for an occupational disease for his left hip condition. The WCC then considered whether Tinker\u2019s claim for an industrial injury should be accepted. Tinker asserted that he was not time-barred from pursuing this claim because he did not seek medical attention and actually learn that he might have a compensable injury until July 24,2007. The WCC noted that \u00a739-71-601(2), MCA (2005), allows an insurer to waive the normal 12-month time requirement for filing a complaint upon a showing by the claimant of lack of knowledge of disability, latent injury, or equitable estoppel. Although the WCC noted that this statute appeared to vest the insurer with discretion to grant the waiver, the WCC reasoned that the waiver requirement is not discretionary if the claimant otherwise qualifies for it under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">\u00b612 The WCC then went on to note that the statutory provision providing for a waiver of the normal time requirement has been a part of the Act since 1973, with the latent injury and equitable estoppel criteria codified in 1989. In its application of this statute the WCC first observed that Tinker had not set forth evidence for the application of equitable estoppel. The WCC also concluded that Tinker did not meet the latent injury exception under the authority of <em>McGuin v. State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number><em>Compen. Ins. Fund, </em>1999 MTWCC 82, because he knew at the time of his industrial accident that he suffered an injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">\u00b613 The WCC then considered whether the 12-month requirement for filing Tinker\u2019s claim could be waived under the \u2018lack of knowledge of disability\u201d exception. The WCC noted that the applicability of this exception had been discussed by this Court in two previous cases, <em>Pinion v. H.C. Smith Const. Co., </em>190 Mont. 103, 619 P.2d 167 (1980), and <em>Conn v. Quality Inn, </em>242 Mont. 190, 789 P.2d 1213 (1990). In <em>Pinion, </em>claimant Lester Pinion (Pinion) suffered an on-the-job injury on May 31, 1978. <em>Pinion, </em>190 Mont. at 104, 619 P.2d at 167. Although Pinion reported the injury, he did not seek medical treatment until August 1979, at which point a surgeon recommended knee surgery. After the surgery, Pinion was unable to earn wages and filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim on September 17, 1979. <em>Pinion, </em>190 Mont. at 104, 619 P.2d at 167. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Division waived the one-year filing period, allowed the claim, and the insurer appealed. Without any significant analysis, this Court upheld the decision stating that Pinion had made a reasonable showing that he lacked knowledge of his disability, and that there was substantial credible evidence in the record to support the decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">\u00b614 In <em>Conn, </em>claimant Anita Conn (Conn) suffered injuries to her back and hip while working as a maid at the Quality Inn in Missoula, Montana. <em>Conn, </em>242 Mont. at 191, 789 P.2d at 1213. Sometime between January and March of 1986 she tripped over a vacuum cleaner cord, injuring her back and hip. In June 1987, she tripped over a bedspread injuring the same area. Although the injuries did not cause her to miss work, she suffered sporadic pain which increased after the second injury. Shortly after the second injury, Conn sought medical help. While her condition initially responded to treatment, in the summer of 1988 her workload increased significantly and the pain returned with greater severity. <em>Conn, </em>242 Mont. at 191, 789 P.2d at 1214. In November 1988, Conn quit her job upon her doctor\u2019s advice.</p>\n<p id=\"Ae6Y\">\u00b615 On November 4, 1988, Conn filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim for the second accident, and on December 21,1988, filed a claim for the first accident. Both claims were filed after the 12-month period and were denied by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Division. Conn appealed to the WCC, which reversed the Division\u2019s decision and held that the existence of a \u201cdisability\u201d is determined in relation to a loss of earnings occasioned by the injury. <em>Conn, </em>242 Mont. at 192, 789 P.2d at 1214. State Fund appealed the WCC\u2019s decision to this Court, and we affirmed. In affirming the WCC, we conducted a review of the 1985 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>version of the Act, analyzing the plain meaning of the term \u201cdisability\u201d as used therein. <em>Conn, </em>242 Mont. at 192-93, 789 P.2d at 1214-15. Our review of the term \u201cdisability\u201d as used in the Act, left us \u2018ho doubt\u201d that the Legislature intended that \u201ca disability occurs only when the claimant suffers a loss in the ability to engage in gainful employment. The definitive indicator of a loss in ability is a loss in wages, present or future.\u201d <em>Conn, </em>242 Mont. at 193, 789 P.2d at 1215.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">\u00b616 With these cases in mind, the WCC turned to a consideration of the meaning of the term \u201cdisability\u201d in the 2005 version of the Act. State Fund had argued to the WCC that <em>Pinion </em>and <em>Conn </em>were inapplicable because they were decided under earlier versions of the Act, which at the time required courts to liberally construe the Act in the claimant\u2019s favor. The WCC noted that the \u2018liberal construction\u201d statute had been removed by the time of Tinker\u2019s claims, but concluded that while the Court relied upon this doctrine in <em>Pinion, </em>it played no role in the decision in <em>Conn. </em>The WCC then went on to note that in 1995 the Legislature moved the definition of the term \u201cdisability\u201d from \u00a739-71-116(9), MCA, where it defined the term for the entire chapter, to \u00a7 39-71-116(29)(b), MCA,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> where it defined the term solely in relation to \u201csecondary medical services.\u2019\u2019Under the 2005 version of the Act, therefore, there is no stand-alone definition of \u201cdisability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">\u00b617 The term \u201cdisability\u201d itself is defined in relation to secondary medical services as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">a condition in which a worker\u2019s ability to engage in gainful employment is diminished as a result of physical restrictions resulting from an injury. The restrictions may be combined with factors, such as the worker\u2019s age, education, work history, and other factors that affect the worker\u2019s ability to engage in gainful employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Section 39-71-116(30)(b)(i), MCA (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">\u00b618 Additionally, the Legislature revised the statutory definition of \u201cdisabled worker\u201d to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-9\">\u2018Disabled worker\u201d means a worker who has a permanent impairment, established by objective medical findings, resulting from a work-related injury that precludes the worker from returning to the job the worker held at the time of the injury or to a job with similar physical requirements and who has an actual wage loss as a result of the injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">Section 39-71-1011(2), MCA (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>\u00b619 With these provisions mind, the WCC concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-4\">It is unclear from the legislative history exactly why the general definition of disability was moved from a stand-alone definition to a definition applying only to \u201csecondary medical services.\u201d What is clear, however, is that the legislature made a concerted effort to revise <em>all </em>the statutes which reference some sort of \u201cdisability\u201d so that they require a wage loss or inability to perform one\u2019s time-of-injury job as an element of each definition. Although the precise language of the statutes has changed since <em>Pinion </em>and <em>Conn </em>were decided, the statutes which reference \u201cdisability\u201d all still indicate that loss of wages or loss of earning ability is necessary for a worker to be considered to have a \u201cdisability\u201d under the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">\u00b620 Applying this legal conclusion to the facts before it, the WCC concluded that Tinker lacked knowledge of his disability until July 24, 2007, when he sought medical treatment because his injury was preventing him from performing his job duties. Accordingly, the WCC concluded that Tinker\u2019s claim qualified for the waiver of the time limitation pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-601(2)(a), MCA, and was therefore compensable under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">\u00b621 Finally, although the WCC concluded that Tinker, as the prevailing party, was entitled to his costs, it denied Tinker\u2019s claims for attorney fees and a statutory penalty, finding that State Fund\u2019s actions in denying Tinker\u2019s claims were not unreasonable because its liability in this case was not clear cut.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">\u00b622 State Fund now appeals from this decision. As noted above, Tinker cross-appeals the denial of his claim for an occupational disease, as well as his claims for attorney fees and a statutory penalty. Because we are affirming the WCC\u2019s decision that Tinker has a compensable injury, we will not address Tinker\u2019s challenge to the denial of his occupational disease claim. Thus, we state the issues presented on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">\u00b623 Issue One: <em>Did the WCC err in concluding that Tinker\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim was not time-barred?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">\u00b624 Issue Two: <em>Did the WCC err in concluding that State Fund\u2019s denial of Tinker\u2019s claim was not unreasonable?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">\u00b625 We review the WCC\u2019s findings of fact to determine if they are supported by substantial credible evidence. <em>Fleming v. Intl. Paper Co., </em>2008 MT 327, \u00b6 17, 346 Mont. 141, 194 P.3d 77. We review the WCC\u2019s conclusions of law de novo to determine if they are correct. <em>Narum v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number><em>Liberty Northwest Ins. </em>Corp., 2009 MT 127, \u00b6 25, 350 Mont. 252, 206 P.3d 964.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">\u00b626 Issue One: <em>Did the WCC err in concluding that Tinker\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim was not time-barred?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">\u00b627 State Fund argues that under the 2005 version of the Act, a claimant\u2019s knowledge of his disability does not require that the claimant is unable to work or that he suffers a wage loss on account of his condition. State Fund argues that the definition of disability under the 2005 Act contemplates that a worker can be suffering from a disability even if he is continuing in employment and earning wages equal to what he earned at the time he was injured-regardless of whether he suffered restrictions, limitations, or medical impairments. In other words, State Fund argues that the determination of the existence of a \u201cdisability\u201d under the Act is not contingent upon a loss of wages. State Fund asserts that the Act\u2019s provisions relating to compensation for temporary total disability (TTD) benefits, permanent total disability (PTD) benefits, and temporary partial disability (TPD) benefits, demonstrate that under the 2005 Act a person can be considered \u201cdisabled,\u201dyet have suffered no wage loss. Thus, so long as Tinker was aware of his condition, even if he continued to work and suffered no wage loss, he was aware of his disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">\u00b628 State Fund argues that the 2005 Act takes a more general view of the term \u201cdisability\u201d and that the majority view of dictionaries defining this term support the position that disability is measured in terms of an individual\u2019s capacities, not with respect to an individual\u2019s experience of a wage loss. State Fund also asserts that the impairment rating guides that are utilized under the 2005 Act do not define disability with respect to a diminution of wages or inability to work. Additionally, State Fund argues that both <em>Pinion </em>and <em>Conn </em>are inapplicable, and that the WCC erred in relying upon them. Accordingly, State Fund asserts that the WCC erred in holding that Tinker\u2019s claim was not time-barred. State Fund asserts that if Tinker had knowledge of a physical or mental impairment that interfered with or prevented a normal achievement in a particular area, then he had knowledge of his disability, irrespective of any wage loss. Since the record demonstrates that he had such knowledge, State Fund argues the WCC\u2019s decision should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">\u00b629 Tinker argues that the WCC\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cdisability\u201d was correct and its decision should be affirmed. Tinker argues that the term disability as used in the 2005 Act requires that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>a claimant be aware that his impairment or condition occasions some form of wage loss before the claimant can be said to have knowledge of a disability. In this case, even though Tinker was affected by his injuries, he continued to work, did not experience a decrease in wages, and thus did not become aware of his \u201cdisability\u201d until July 24, 2007, when he finally sought medical treatment. Tinker asserts that the definition of \u201cdisability\u201d relied upon by the WCC is consistent with other jurisdictions and the use of the term in other benefit programs, such as Social Security, that provide compensation to those with disabilities. Tinker argues that the concept of a wage loss is at the essence of the term \u201cdisability\u201d as used in those portions of the 2005 Act regarding the various types of benefits available to injured workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">\u00b630 When interpreting statutes, we look first to their plain language in order to give effect to the intent of the Legislature in enacting them. <em>West v. Club at Spanish Peaks, L.L.C., </em>2008 MT 183, \u00b6 89, 343 Mont. 434, 186 P.3d 1228. \u2018Moreover, when interpreting statutes we view them as part of a whole statutory scheme, and construe them so as to forward the purpose of that scheme.\u201d <em>Vader v. Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc., </em>2009 MT 6, \u00b6 30, 348 Mont. 344, 201 P.3d 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">\u00b631 We affirm the WCC\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cdisability\u201d as used in the 2005 Act. The 2005 version of the Act does not contain a stand-alone definition of disability, but based on the Act\u2019s plain language, it is apparent that a \u201cdisability\u201d is defined with reference to a worker\u2019s diminished capacity to work and earn wages. State Fund\u2019s proposed construction of the term \u201cdisability\u201d in an abstract sense divorced from the wage-earning context, simply does not find support in the plain language of the Act itself. For instance, the 2005 Act defines PPD and PTD as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">(24) \u2018Permanent partial disability\u2019means a physical condition in which a worker, after reaching maximum medical healing:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">(a) has a permanent impairment established by objective medical findings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-8\">(b) is able to return to work in some capacity but the permanent impairment impairs the worker\u2019s ability to work; <em>and</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-9\">\n<em>(c) has an actual wage loss as a result of the injury.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-10\">(25) \u2018Permanent total disability\u201d means a physical condition resulting from injury as defined in this chapter, after a worker reaches maximum medical healing, in which a <em>worker does not have a reasonable prospect of physically performing regular employment. Regular employment means work on a recurring basis performed for remuneration in a trade, business, profession, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number><em>or other occupation in this state. </em>Lack of immediate job openings is not a factor to be considered in determining if a worker is permanently totally disabled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Section 39-71-116(25), (26), MCA (2005) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"Arz\">\u00b632 Along the same lines, a claimant is entitled to compensation for TTD benefits \u201cwhen the worker suffers a total loss of wages as a result of an injury and until the worker reaches maximum healing; or ... until the worker has been released to return to the employment in which the worker was engaged at the time of the injury or to employment with similar physical requirements.\u2019\u2019Section 39-71-701(1), MCA (2005). Furthermore, compensation for PPD benefits is available only when a worker shows an \u201cactual wage loss as a result of the injury ....\u2019\u2019Section 39-7.1-703(l)(a), MCA(2005). Finally, as noted by the WCC, the definition of a \u201cdisabled worker\u201d is also inherently connected to an actual wage loss as the result of an impairment or condition. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6 18. The plain language of the Act clearly demonstrates that the term \u201cdisability\u201d is tied to a wage loss or impairment in the ability to earn wages through employment. Thus, until a claimant knows that he or she is suffering some form of wage loss as a result of an injury, condition, or impairment, then he or she lacks knowledge of their \u201cdisability\u2019 within the meaning of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">\u00b633 Whether or not <em>Pinion </em>and <em>Conn </em>are still applicable is beside the point given the plain language of the 2005 Act. Furthermore, as noted by Tinker, treatises dealing with workers\u2019 compensation law, as well as the Social Security Act itself, both include wage loss as an inherent component of a disability determination. <em>See e.g., </em>82 Am. Jur. 2d, <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation </em>\u00a7 377, 348-49 (2003) (footnotes omitted) (\u2018Disability,\u2019\u2019ordinarily means loss or impairment of earning power, or incapacity to earn, as distinguished from a physical infirmity.\u201d); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7423(d)(l)(A) (defining disability in part as \u2018inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months ....\u201d). In this connection, it is difficult to overlook the fact that the \u201cobjective of the Montana workers\u2019 compensation system is to provide, without regard to fault, wage-loss and medical benefits to a worker suffering from a work-related injury or disease.\u201d Section 39-71-105(1), MCA (2005). Thus, it should come as no surprise that a determination of whether a worker is \u201cdisabled\u201d would of necessity be measured by reference to whether or not he or she suffered a loss of wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">\u00b634 Finally, we note that Tinker has also challenged the WCC\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>conclusion that he did not suffer a latent injury and was therefore not entitled to a waiver of the 12-month filing period on this basis under \u00a7 39-71-60l(2)(b), MCA (2005). Since we are affirming the WCC\u2019s determination that Tinker\u2019s injury claim does qualify for the waiver under \u00a7 39-71-601(2)(a), MCA (2005), his challenge to the WCC\u2019s conclusion on this point appears to be moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">\u00b635 Issue Two: <em>Did the WCC err in concluding that State Fund\u2019s denial of Tinker\u2019s claim was not unreasonable?</em></p>\n<p id=\"AnN\">\u00b636 In order to qualify for an award of attorney fees or a statutory penalty under the Act, Tinker must show that State Fund\u2019s actions in denying his claim were unreasonable. The WCC found that State Fund\u2019s actions were not unreasonable. The WCC\u2019s finding with respect to the reasonableness of State Fund\u2019s actions in denying Tinker\u2019s claim is an issue of fact, subject to the substantial evidence standard of review. <em>Narum, </em>\u00b6 34. \u2018Substantial credible evidence is such evidence which a reasonable mind could accept as adequate to support a conclusion. Evidence is considered substantial even if it is contradicted by other evidence, somewhat less than a preponderance, or inherently weak <em>.\u2019\u2019Narum, </em>\u00b6 25. Tinker has failed to demonstrate that the WCC\u2019s findings on the issue of State Fund\u2019s actions in denying his claim were not supported by substantial credible evidence. Therefore, we affirm the WCC\u2019s denial of Tinker\u2019s claims for attorney fees and a statutory penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"AJF\">\u00b637 The WCC did not err in concluding that Tinker was entitled to compensation for his claim based on his injury of his left hip, since he lacked knowledge of this disability until July 24,2007, when he first sought medical treatment because his injury was preventing him from performing his job duties. We further conclude that the WCC did not err in denying Tinker\u2019s occupational disease claim as well as his claim for an award of attorney fees and a statutory penalty.
