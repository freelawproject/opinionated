LeFeber (LeFeber) appeals the judgment and order of the Twenty-first Judicial District Court, Ravalli County. The District Court applied equitable principles to settle the unmarried couple\u2019s interests in real property. Margaret Rose Johnson (Johnson) cross-appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">\u00b62 We review the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b100-11\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court properly apply equitable doctrines to the division of property held by LeFeber and Johnson?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b100-12\">\u00b64 <em>Did the District Court correctly determine that LeFeber and Johnson owned the St. Joseph property as tenants in common?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b100-13\">\u00b65 <em>Did the District Court correctly partition the St. Joseph property by granting LeFeber and Johnson each an undivided one-half interest in the property ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b100-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b100-15\">\u00b66 LeFeber and Johnson dispute the ownership of property located at 297 St. Joseph Lane (St. Joseph property) in Stevensville, Montana. LeFeber and Johnson began living together in October of 1984 in Sandpoint, Idaho. LeFeber and Johnson maintained an intimate and exclusive relationship for over twenty years until their relationship ended in 2005. Neither party asserts common-law marriage. LeFeber <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>and Johnson moved to Richland, Washington, in 1987, and to Walla Walla, Washington, in 1991. They jointly rented houses in each location, but did not purchase a house.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">\u00b67 LeFeber and Johnson initialed a Full Durable Power of Attorney (POA) on December 1, 1991. LeFeber drafted the POA using a form that he had received from a friend. The POA provided that Johnson, as attorney-in-fact for LeFeber in his stead, could do any and all acts that he could do if personally present. The POA enumerated several of Johnson\u2019s powers, including the right to act as a personal nominee, to manage real estate, and to manage hydrocarbon interests. The POA provided that the enumeration of powers did not limit or reduce Johnson\u2019s powers as attorney-in-fact. The POA did not specifically address future acquired, assigned, or conveyed property. The POA provided that LeFeber could revoke the POA by a writing to Johnson. The POA also provided that by signing the document J ohnson accepted the attorney-in-fact appointment and agreed to return any and all possessions to LeFeber\u2019s name if he revoked Johnson\u2019s powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">\u00b68 LeFeber conveyed and assigned to Johnson interests in several of his hydrocarbon/oil and gas properties four days after he signed the POA. Johnson understood that she took title of the properties pursuant to the POA. The oil and gas companies then issued production checks to Johnson in her name. Johnson deposited the checks in a joint bank account accessible to both parties. Interest from the account provided Johnson with her spending money. Johnson later would transfer to LeFeber the principal amounts that the companies paid to her. Johnson also would issue, under the advice of LeFeber\u2019s accountant, a federal tax form 1099 to LeFeber at the end of the year for the miscellaneous income paid by the oil and gas companies. The parties followed this procedure until they separated in September of 2005. Johnson then reconveyed and reassigned the hydrocarbon properties to LeFeber as she understood the POA required her to do because LeFeber owned the properties outright before the 1991 assignment to Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">\u00b69 LeFeber had the POA witnessed in Montana in the fall of 1994 after the IRS questioned pass-throughs of oil and gas interests from Johnson to LeFeber. LeFeber\u2019s accountant believed that the IRS more likely would accept as legitimate a witnessed POA. LeFeber never filed the POA in the public record. LeFeber testified that he prepared the POA primarily to boost Johnson\u2019s self-esteem by providing her with her own source of income.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">\u00b610 LeFeber and Johnson began to search for a house to buy in 1992. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>They looked in Washington, Idaho, and Montana. LeFeber did not particularly want to move to Montana, but he told Johnson that she could pick out the house that she wanted and he would \u2018buy her a home.\u201d LeFeber testified that he meant that he would provide the funds for the purchase. Johnson understood LeFeber to mean that he would gift and convey to her a house and real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">\u00b611 Johnson found the house that she wanted in the summer of 1994 in Stevensville, Montana. LeFeber and Johnson both signed the Final Agreement to Buy and Purchase the St. Joseph property for a purchase price of $111,750. The agreement contemplated that the \u2018TITLE HOLDER MAY BE FINALIZED IN TRUST, CORPORATION, TRUSTEE OR NOMINEE, CLOSING AGENT WILL BE NOTIFIED PRIOR TO CLOSING.\u201d The District Court determined that \u2018bo other intention is or was expressed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">\u00b612 The title company issued its title insurance policy upon the St. Joseph property in the name of\u2018MAGGIE JOHNSON, a single woman as nominee.\u201dThe Warranty Deed also granted the St. Joseph property to \u2018Maggie R. Johnson, a single woman as nominee.\u201d LeFeber had inserted the \u201csingle woman as nominee\u201d language before the closing. Johnson testified that LeFeber had inserted the \u201cas nominee\u201dlanguage without her knowledge. Johnson testified that she asked LeFeber several times after the closing about the meaning of the language. LeFeber refused to explain his interpretation of the words \u201cas nominee.\u201d LeFeber also would not agree to change the deed to eliminate the words \u201cas nominee.\u201d LeFeber testified that he interpreted the terms \u201cnominee\u201d and \u201cagent\u201d as \u201cessentially one and the same.\u201dThe District Court found that Johnson never had agreed to act as LeFeber\u2019s nominee related to the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">\u00b613 LeFeber paid for the purchase and all the costs of purchase of the St. Joseph property by a lump sum with a cashier\u2019s check. The check identified Johnson as the purchaser of the property. Neither LeFeber nor Johnson ever filed a Gift Tax Return with the IRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">\u00b614 LeFeber and Johnson moved into the newly constructed house on the St. Joseph property. The house had an unfinished basement and very little landscaping. Johnson helped with many of the improvements to the house, including finishing the basement, building a deck and a roof on the deck, installing tile flooring, constructing a greenhouse, installing a stove pipe outside and on the roof, and fencing the yard. Johnson also purchased and laid railroad ties, installed a fountain and a pond, and installed and maintained almost all of the landscaping on the property. Johnson planted approximately 50 trees, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>200 shrubs, and over 1,000 perennial bulbs and plants. The District Court determined that Johnson\u2019s efforts had increased the value of the St. Joseph property. A September 2005 Competitive Market Analysis estimated the sale price of the St. Joseph property as between $214,900 and $219,900.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">\u00b615 LeFeber paid all of the property taxes on the St. Joseph property from 1994 to 2006. LeFeber insisted that Johnson apply for property tax assistance from 1998 to 2005 pursuant to \u00a7 15-6-134, MCA. LeFeber obtained the applications from Ravalli County. LeFeber then prepared the applications and had Johnson sign them. LeFeber signed Johnson\u2019s name on the application on at least one occasion. Each signed application represented that Johnson was the sole legal owner of the St. Joseph property. Johnson\u2019s acceptance for property tax assistance lowered the property taxes considerably. LeFeber claimed real estate deductions of $1,487 and $1,396 in 2004 and 2005, despite the fact that the property tax bills for those years were $698 and $694 respectively. LeFeber signed a letter to Johnson on December 28,1999, stating that \u201c[Johnson] has rights to stay at 297 St. Joseph Lane.\u201dThe letter followed one of the couple\u2019s separations.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\u00b616 LeFeber revoked the POA in 2005 after the relationship ended. Johnson refused LeFeber\u2019s request that she sign a quitclaim deed for the St. Joseph property because she believed that LeFeber had gifted her the property. LeFeber filed a petition for a constructive trust pursuant to \u00a7 72-33- 219, MCA. LeFeber requested that the court declare a constructive trust in favor of LeFeber and order Johnson to convey the St. Joseph property to LeFeber. Johnson filed a verified response alleging, among other defenses, failure of constructive trust and completed gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">\u00b617 The District Court denied LeFeber\u2019s claims for a constructive trust and resulting trust. The court also denied Johnson\u2019s claim that LeFeber had gifted her the entire St. Joseph property. The court determined that LeFeber and Johnson each had an equitable right as tenants in common to the St. Joseph property and ordered the deed to the property amended accordingly. The court ordered the St. Joseph property partitioned by sale and granted each party an undivided one-half interest as tenants in common. LeFeber appeals and Johnson cross-appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">\u00b618 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact in an equitable action to determine whether the findings are clearly erroneous. <em>In re Estate </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number><em>of McDermott, </em>2002 MT 164, \u00b6 22, 310 Mont. 435, 51 P.3d 486 (citing \u00a73-2-204(5), MCA); <em>see also </em>M. R. Civ. P. 52(a). A finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial credible evidence, if the trial court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record convinces us that a mistake has been committed. <em>In re McDermott, </em>\u00b6 22. Substantial credible evidence is that which a reasonable mind could accept as adequate to support a conclusion. We may consider evidence to be substantial even if it is \u2018inherently weak and conflicting.\u201d <em>Baltrusch v. Baltrusch, </em>2003 MT 357, \u00b6 32, 319 Mont. 23, 83 P.3d 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">\u00b619 We do not consider whether evidence would support findings different from those made by the District Court. <em>In re Estate of Bradshaw, </em>2001 MT 92, \u00b6 11, 305 Mont. 178, 24 P.3d 211. We confine our review to the determination of whether substantial credible evidence supports the findings actually made by the District Court. <em>In re Bradshaw, </em>\u00b6 11. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether those conclusions are correct. <em>In re McDermott, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">\u00b620 <em>Did the District Court properly apply equitable doctrines to the division of property held by LeFeber and Johnson?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">\u00b621 The District Court concluded that equity should govern the division of the St. Joseph property as the unique facts of the case were not unlike a marital estate. We recently approved a district court\u2019s application of equitable doctrines in dividing the property of unmarried cohabitants in <em>Anderson v. Woodward, </em>2009 MT 144, 350 Mont. 343, 207 P.3d 329. We determined that the district court correctly had applied equitable principles to distribute two real estate properties that the parties had accumulated during their eight-year relationship. <em>Anderson, </em>\u00b6 16. The district court had the power to make compensatory adjustments between the respective parties \u201caccording to the ordinary principles of equity.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">\u00b622 An unmarried couple likewise disputed the distribution of property that they had acquired during their relationship in <em>Flood v. Kalinyaprak, </em>2004 MT 15, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 10, 15, 319 Mont. 280, 84 P.3d 27. Flood instituted a partition action after the relationship had ended and brought additional claims, including unjust enrichment and constructive trust. <em>Flood, </em>\u00b6 11. The district court correctly applied equitable doctrines in dividing the assets of the unmarried couple. <em>Flood, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17, 21. We described the approach used to divide the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>property as being \u201csimilar to that used to divide a marital estate in a dissolution action.\u201d <em>Flood, </em>\u00b6 20. We also noted that the court \u2018has great flexibility in fashioning appropriate relief for the parties.\u201d <em>Flood, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"AUo\">\u00b623 LeFeber and Johnson acquired the St. Joseph property during their lengthy relationship as unmarried cohabitants. The District Court properly used equitable doctrines to divide the St. Joseph property. <em>Anderson, </em>\u00b6 16; <em>Flood, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17, 21. The District Court had \u201cgreat flexibility\u201d in fashioning appropriate relief for LeFeber and Johnson using the ordinary principles of equity. Anderson, \u00b6 <em>16; Flood, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">\u00b624 <em>Did the District Court correctly determine that LeFeber and Johnson owned the St. Joseph property as tenants in common?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\u00b625 LeFeber argues that the District Court should have awarded him sole ownership of the St. Joseph property. LeFeber contends that either a constructive or a resulting trust arose as a matter of law from the 1994 deeded conveyance to Johnson \u201ca single woman as nominee.\u201d LeFeber claims that allowing Johnson to retain an ownership interest in the property will cause Johnson to be unjustly enriched. Johnson responds that the District Court should have awarded her sole ownership of the St. Joseph property. Johnson argues that LeFeber had gifted her the St. Joseph property in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"A6l\">\u00b626 A constructive trust arises when an equitable duty requires a person holding title to property to convey it to another on the ground that the person holding title would be unjustly enriched if the person were permitted to retain it. <em>Monroe v. Marsden, </em>2009 MT 137, \u00b6 28, 350 Mont. 327, 207 P.3d 320 (citing \u00a772-33-219, MCA). Establishment of a constructive trust depends only upon a showing that the title holder would be unjustly enriched if permitted to retain title. <em>Monroe, </em>\u00b6 28 (citing <em>In re Marriage of Moss, </em>1999 MT 62, \u00b6 29, 299 Mont. 500, 977 P.2d 322). The doctrine of unjust enrichment represents an equitable means of preventing one party from benefitting from his or her wrongful acts and requires a showing of misconduct or fault to recover. <em>Albinger v. Harris, </em>2002 MT 118, \u00b6 21, 310 Mont. 27, 48 P.3d 711.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">\u00b627 The party alleging the existence of any trust must establish the trust\u2019s validity \u2018by evidence that is clear, convincing and practically free from doubt <em>.\u2019\u2019 Hilliard v. Hilliard, </em>255 Mont. 487, 492, 844 P.2d 54, 57 (1992). The District Court determined that LeFeber had failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the 1994 deed created a trust in his favor. The District Court pointed to \u201cthe contradictory ownership intentions\u201d manifested by LeFeber. LeFeber vaguely had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>stated to Johnson before the 1994 purchase that Til buy you a home.\u201d LeFeber also repeatedly provided vague and misleading explanations to Johnson regarding his use of the words \u201cas nominee\u201d in the 1994 deed. The District Court determined that although the 1991 power of attorney authorized Johnson to act as LeFeber\u2019s nominee, neither party had discussed or agreed that Johnson was acting as LeFeber\u2019s nominee related to the purchase of the St. Joseph property in 1994. \u00b628 The District Court determined that after 1994, LeFeber \u201covertly engaged in act[s] wholly inconsistent with [Johnson\u2019s] role as an agent or nominee holding bare legal title to the St. Joseph property.\u201dLeFeber had represented to the Montana Department of Revenue Tor seven years running\u201d that Johnson was the sole legal owner of the property. LeFeber had assured Johnson in his 1999 letter that she had \u201crights\u201d to the property. LeFeber had testified that he was a certified public accountant, currently considered himself a financier, and formerly had served as chief accountant of the Elgin National Watch Company. The court concluded that LeFeber had been \u201cwell aware of the difference between a right and a privilege.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">\u00b629 The District Court further concluded that LeFeber had failed to prove unjust enrichment by showing any misconduct or fault on Johnson\u2019s part. The District Court noted that the only allegedly wrongful act on Johnson\u2019s part was her failure to sign the Quitclaim deed to the St. Joseph property entirely to LeFeber. Johnson had committed no wrongful act in refusing to quitclaim deed the property entirely over to LeFeber, however, due to LeFeber\u2019s failure to prove that a trust existed solely in his favor. The District Court emphasized Johnson\u2019s extensive labor over the course of eleven years to improve the property as additional evidence that J ohnson would not be unjustly enriched by receiving a share of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">\u00b630 Conversely, the District Court determined that Johnson had failed to present sufficient evidence to establish that LeFeber gifted the entirety of the property to her in 1994. LeFeber had inserted the words \u201cas nominee\u201d into the deed rather than placing the deed solely into Johnson\u2019s name. LeFeber had refused to answer Johnson\u2019s questions about the \u201cas nominee\u201d language. Johnson should have been aware that through the \u201cas nominee\u201d language LeFeber had placed some limitation on her ownership interest. This limitation represented less than a full donative intent on LeFeber\u2019s part regarding Johnson\u2019s sole ownership of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">\u00b631 The District Court concluded that clear and convincing evidence did establish, however, that LeFeber had gifted to Johnson an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>undivided interest in the property. The District Court pointed to LeFeber\u2019s statement that he would buy Johnson a home, the fact that he had refused to clarify any limitations he placed on the words \u201cas nominee,\u201d and his statement to Johnson that she had \u201crights\u201d to the property. The court also emphasized the fact that LeFeber effectively had \u201crepresented to the rest of the world that [Johnson] was the sole legal and equitable owner\u201d of the St. Joseph property. The District Court concluded that LeFeber\u2019s actions were most consistent with an objective view that he had placed the words Maggie R. Johnson, a single woman\u201d on the deed to assure Johnson that she had rights in the property, and that he had included the words \u201cas nominee\u201d in the deed to reserve some rights to himself.</p>\n<p id=\"Agb\">\u00b632 The District Court entered detailed and specific findings regarding LeFeber\u2019s and Johnson\u2019s actions as they related to the St. Joseph property. The court correctly applied equitable principles based on those findings. <em>Anderson, </em>\u00b6 16; <em>Flood, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17, 21. Substantial credible evidence supports the District Court\u2019s determination that neither LeFeber nor Johnson owned the St. Joseph property in its entirety. <em>In re McDermott, </em>\u00b6 22. The District Court correctly determined that LeFeber and Johnson each had an equitable right as tenants in common to the St. Joseph property.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">\u00b633 <em>Did the District Court correctly partition the St. Joseph property by granting LeFeber and Johnson each an undivided one-half interest in the property ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">\u00b634 LeFeber argues that the law of partition and the relevant evidence entitle Johnson to \u201cat best, a minimal interest in the property.\u201d LeFeber contends that a clear preponderance of the evidence establishes that he \u201ccontributed vastly more to the value of the property, arguably over 90 percent.\u201d LeFeber points to his payment of the entire purchase price of the St. Joseph property, his payment of the monetary costs of improving the property, and his payment of all the property taxes associated with the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">\u00b635 The district court possesses \u201cgreat flexibility\u201d in fashioning appropriate relief for the parties in a partition action. <em>Anderson, </em>\u00b6 16; <em>Flood, </em>\u00b6 17. The district court has the power to make compensatory adjustments between the respective parties according to the ordinary principles of equity. <em>Anderson, </em>\u00b6 <em>16] Flood, </em>\u00b6 21 (citing \u00a770-29-209(2), MCA). Partition actions should be fashioned to cause the least degree of harm to the cotenants and to confer no unfair advantage on any one cotenant. <em>Anderson, </em>\u00b6 16; <em>Flood, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">\u00b636 A rebuttable presumption exists that joint tenants own equal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>shares of the property. <em>Anderson, </em>\u00b6 17; <em>Flood, </em>\u00b6 28; <em>Rausch v. Hogan, </em>2001 MT 123, \u00b6 24, 305 Mont. 382, 28 P.3d 460 (citing <em>Matter of Estate of Dern Family Trust, </em>279 Mont. 138, 151-52, 928 P.2d 123, 131 (1996). The District Court considered extensive evidence and testimony from LeFeber and Johnson regarding the parties\u2019 relationship, their conduct over the years, their labor toward improving the property, payment of taxes, correspondence between the parties, and LeFeber\u2019s representations to governmental agencies and other third parties. <em>See Anderson, </em>\u00b6 25; <em>Flood, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 23-28. The District Court rejected LeFeber\u2019s contribution argument as LeFeber had \u201cdelivered a portion of his contribution to [Johnson] as a gift.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ACx\">\u00b637 The District Court concluded that the evidence clearly established that LeFeber and Johnson owned the St. Joseph property equally. The District Court properly considered \u201call relevant evidence\u201d in considering whether LeFeber had gifted a portion of the property to Johnson. <em>Flood, </em>\u00b6 23. Our review of the record convinces us that substantial credible evidence supports the District Court\u2019s partition of the property. We do not believe that the District Court misapprehended the effect of the evidence. <em>In re McDermott, </em>\u00b6 22. The District Court fashioned its partition of the St. Joseph property \u201cto cause the least degree of harm to the cotenants and to confer no unfair advantage on any one cotenant.\u201d <em>Flood, </em>\u00b6 21. The District Court properly exercised its power to make compensatory adjustments and fashion appropriate relief for LeFeber and Johnson according to the ordinary principles of equity. <em>Anderson, </em>\u00b6 <em>16; Flood, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17, 21; \u00a770-29-209(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">\u00b638 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b108-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
