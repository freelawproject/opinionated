The Fourth Judicial District Court, Missoula County, then sentenced him to the Montana State Prison for 20 years, with 10 years suspended. In addition, the court imposed 56 terms and conditions on the suspended portion of the sentence. Thereafter, Brinson filed two motions to withdraw his guilty plea, which the District Court summarily denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">\u00b62 Brinson now appeals, contending that the District Court erred in denying his motions to withdraw his guilty plea. Brinson also challenges three of the terms and conditions of his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">ISSUE 1: Brinson\u2019s motions to withdraw his guilty plea</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">\u00b63 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea de novo. <em>State v. Warclub, </em>2005 MT 149, \u00b6 17, 327 Mont. 352, 114 P.3d 254. The question of whether a plea was entered voluntarily is a mixed question of law and fact, which we review de novo. <em>State v. McFarlane, </em>2008 MT 18, \u00b6 8, 341 Mont. 166, 176 P.3d 1057.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">\u00b64 In the Plea Bargain Agreement, the parties agreed to the following sentence as the appropriate disposition of the case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-10\">Count 1: A maximum of 20 years all suspended on the condition that the Defendant complete a sex offender evaluation with an MSOTA [Montana Sexual Offender Treatment Association] qualified evaluator and that the evaluator concludes that the Defendant is a low risk to reoffend and can be treated in the community. In the event the evaluator concludes the defendant is not a low risk to re-offend and/or cannot be treated in the community, the State and Defendant will be free to argue for an appropriate sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">\u00b65 The District Court accepted Brinson\u2019s guilty plea on September 14, 2006, and ordered a presentence investigation report (PSI). Meanwhile, Brinson obtained two psychosexual evaluations. The first evaluation (the Clodfelter Evaluation), dated October 23, 2006, was prepared by an MSOTA-qualified evaluator (Lindsay Clodfelter) who concluded that Brinson should be designated a level 2 offender, i.e., a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>\u201cmoderate risk\u201d of a repeat sexual offense. The second evaluation (the Zook Evaluation), dated December 20, 2006, was prepared by a nonMSOTA-qualified evaluator (Donna Zook) who concluded that Brinson should be designated a level 1 offender, i.e., a \u2018low risk\u201d of a repeat sexual offense. <em>See </em>\u00a746-23-509(2), MCA. The probation/parole officer who prepared the PSI reviewed both evaluations and recommended that Brinson be designated a level 2 offender and that he be sentenced to the Montana State Prison for 20 years with 10 years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">\u00b66 At the sentencing hearing, the District Court interpreted the plea agreement as follows: If an MSOTA evaluator concludes that Brinson is a level 1 offender (low risk to reoffend), then the agreement is binding, but if an MSOTA evaluator gives a designation higher than level 1, then each side may argue for the appropriate sentence. Thus, the court reasoned that since the only MSOTA evaluation provided to the court stated that Brinson was a level 2 offender (moderate risk to reoffend), the 20-year, all-suspended sentence contained in the plea agreement was not binding. Notably, defense counsel stated that he \u201cregret[ted]\u201d having included the MSOTA language in the plea agreement, but he acknowledged that the prosecutor could argue any sentence that she felt was appropriate. The District Court ultimately adopted the sentencing recommendations in the PSI and sentenced Brinson to 20 years at the Montana State Prison with 10 years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">\u00b67 Brinson argues on appeal that his plea was not voluntary and that involuntariness constitutes \u201cgood cause\u201d for withdrawing a plea. Furthermore, citing <em>State v. Deserly, </em>2008 MT 242, \u00b6 15, 344 Mont. 468, 188 P.3d 1057, and <em>State v. Lone Elk, </em>2005 MT 56, \u00b6 21, 326 Mont. 214, 108 P.3d 500, he argues that a defendant\u2019s plea is not voluntary if it was induced, \u201chowever slightly,\u201d by misrepresentation, including unfulfilled or unfulfillable promises. Brinson claims that such circumstances occurred here and, therefore, that he should have been allowed to withdraw his guilty plea. Specifically, he explains that he pleaded guilty with the understanding that the Zook Evaluation, in which he was found to be a level 1 offender, would \u201ccarry the same weight\u201d at sentencing as the Clodfelter Evaluation, in which he was found to be a level 2 offender. Yet, according to Brinson, the Zook Evaluation turned out to be \u201cuseless\u201d because Zook was not MSOTA qualified. Brinson thus contends that his belief that the sentencing judge would accept the Zook Evaluation and impose the sentence contained in the plea agreement was \u201can unfulfillable promise.\u201d Brinson further argues that, \u2018by some degree, \u2018however slight,\u2019 \u201d his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>attorney misled him (albeit \u201cunintentionally\u201d) into thinking that the Zook Evaluation would satisfy the terms of the plea agreement. Thus, Brinson concludes that he was induced by a misrepresentation and an unfulfillable promise to change his plea to guilty and that his plea, therefore, was not voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">\u00b68 Brinson is correct that involuntariness constitutes \u201cgood cause\u201dfor withdrawal of a guilty plea under \u00a746-16-105(2), MCA. <em>See Lone Elk, </em>\u00b6 19. Brinson is also correct that a defendant\u2019s plea of guilty is not voluntary if the court, the prosecutor, defense counsel, or some other party induced the plea by threats (or promises to discontinue improper harassment), misrepresentation (including unfulfilled or unfulfillable promises), or promises that are by their nature improper as having no proper relationship to the prosecutor\u2019s business (e.g., bribes). <em>See Deserly, </em>\u00b6 12; <em>Lone Elk, </em>\u00b6 21; <em>Brady v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 755, 90 S. Ct. 1463, 1472 (1970). But the \u2018however slightly\u201d standard that Brinson accurately quotes from <em>Deserly, </em>\u00b6 15, and <em>Lone Elk, </em>\u00b6 21, is not correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">\u00b69 In <em>Warclub, </em>we explained that the Court in <em>Lone Elk </em>had inadvertently adopted the \u2018however slightly\u201d language from a portion of the <em>Brady </em>opinion in which the Supreme Court discussed <em>Bram v. United States, </em>168 U.S. 532, 18 S. Ct. 183 (1897), and the voluntariness of <em>confessions, </em>not guilty pleas. <em>See Warclub, </em>\u00b6 18 and n. 1; <em>see also e.g. State v. Reavley, </em>2003 MT 298, \u00b6 16, 318 Mont. 150, 79 P.3d 270. We stated that our intention in <em>Lone Elk </em>had been to adopt <em>Brady\u2019s </em>standard for the voluntariness of guilty pleas, but without incorporating Bram\u2019s \u2018however slight\u201d standard for the voluntariness of confessions. <em>See Warclub, </em>\u00b6 18; <em>accord State v. Leitheiser, </em>2006 MT 70, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19, 331 Mont. 464, 133 P.3d 185. Nevertheless, we recently quoted the \u2018however slightly\u201d language from <em>Lone Elk </em>in <em>Deserly, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15, 19.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although this language was not critical to our decision in <em>Deserly, </em>it was, in any event, incorrect. Accordingly, so as to eliminate any further confusion and inconsistency in this area of law, we again disapprove the \u2018however slightly\u201d language contained in <em>Deserly, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15, 19, and <em>Lone Elk, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 21, 22, and we overrule these two cases on this specific point.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">\u00b610 Our reaffirmation that the \u2018however slightly\u201d standard does not apply to the analysis of a plea\u2019s voluntariness does not change our decision in this case. As the State correctly points out, Brinson\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>decision to plead guilty could not have been influenced <em>in any way </em>by the Zook Evaluation or any expectation arising out of that evaluation for the simple reason that he signed the plea agreement and entered his plea of guilty before any psychosexual evaluation had been completed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Indeed, Brinson acknowledges that he did not even <em>request </em>an evaluation by Zook until after he had received the Clodfelter Evaluation in October 2006 (a month after he had entered his guilty plea).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">\u00b611 Brinson asserts that when he entered into the plea agreement, he was \u201carmed with the good faith belief\u2019 that he would be designated a low risk to reoffend. Brinson further asserts that after receiving the Zook Evaluation, his \"reasonable expectation of the potential of a suspended sentence was bolstered.\u201d As we explained in <em>Deserly, </em>however, the issue is whether, <em>at the time the defendant entered his guilty plea, </em>he was induced to do so by any of the circumstances contemplated by <em>Brady </em>or <em>Lone Elk. Deserly, </em>\u00b6 18. Any sentencing expectations that arise <em>subsequent </em>to his change of plea do not determine whether the plea was voluntary at the time it was entered. Thus, the fact that Brinson\u2019s expectations were \u2018bolstered\u201d three months after he entered his guilty plea is totally irrelevant to whether his plea was voluntary <em>at the time it was entered.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">\u00b612 Furthermore, we explained in <em>State v. Humphrey, </em>2008 MT 328, 346 Mont. 150, 194 P.3d 643, that \u201cwhile a defendant\u2019s subjective perceptions shed light on his state of mind, which in turn bears on the voluntariness of his plea, allegations of having had certain mental impressions at the time of the plea must be supported by objective proof in the record.\u201d <em>Humphrey, </em>\u00b6 23. Here, the plea agreement clearly states that a sentence of 20 years, all suspended, is the appropriate sentence <em>\u201con the condition </em>that the Defendant complete a sex offender evaluation with an MSOTA qualified evaluator and that the evaluator concludes that the Defendant is a low risk to reoffend and can be treated in the community\u201d (emphasis added). While Brinson may have had a \u201cgood faith belief\u2019that he ultimately would be designated a low risk to reoffend, he has presented no objective proof that he was assured of receiving this designation. The plea agreement contains no such guarantee. To the contrary, it explicitly contemplates that a \u2018low <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>risk\u201d designation may <em>not </em>be forthcoming: \u2018In the event the evaluator concludes the defendant is not a low risk to re-offend and/or cannot be treated in the community, the State and Defendant will be free to argue for an appropriate sentence.\u201d And as for Brinson\u2019s purported belief, at the time he pleaded guilty, that an evaluation prepared by a non-MSOTA-qualified evaluator would satisfy the condition contained in the plea agreement (which required an MSOTA-qualified evaluator), Brinson has not shown with objective proof that this belief was reasonably justified. <em>Humphrey, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayl\">\u00b613 Brinson has not persuaded us that his plea was involuntary because it was induced by a misrepresentation or an unfulfillable promise. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">ISSUE 2: Brinson\u2019s Sentencing Challenges</p>\n<p id=\"A0q\">\u00b614 When this Court reviews a condition on a deferred or suspended sentence, the threshold question is whether the condition is legal. <em>State v. Nelson, </em>2008 MT 359, \u00b6\u00b6 19, 27, 346 Mont. 366, 195 P.3d 826 (citing <em>State v. Ashby, </em>2008 MT 83, \u00b6 9, 342 Mont. 187, 179 P.3d 1164). If the condition is legal, we then determine whether the district court abused its discretion in imposing the condition. <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 20 (citing <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 9).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">\u00b615 Brinson challenges three of the terms and conditions of his sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">Unnumbered Condition: \u2018TA]ny contact the Defendant has with his daughter shall be supervised until such time as a counselor makes a different recommendation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-8\">Condition 46: \u2018The Defendant will not view television shows or motion pictures, which are geared toward his/her sex offending cycle, or as a stimulus to arouse deviant thoughts or fantasies, (i.e., shows based on sexualization of underage girls or boys, etc.).\u201d Condition 48: \u2018The Defendant will not have a cell phone, or such other technology/device, with photo, video, or Internet capabilities allowed. If a cell phone is used, all bills and records will be made available to the supervising officer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">\u00b616 Under <em>\u00a7 </em>46-18-201(4)(n) and -202(1X0, MCA (2003), <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a sentencing court may impose on a deferred or suspended sentence any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>reasonable restrictions or conditions that are necessary and reasonably related to the obj ectives of rehabilitation or the protection of the victim and society. We have upheld two types of sentencing conditions under these provisions: those which limit a defendant\u2019s conduct and those requiring payment of restitution to a victim of the offense. <em>See State v. VanWinkle, </em>2008 MT 208, \u00b6 13, 344 Mont. 175, 186 P.3d 1258; <em>State v. Stiles, </em>2008 MT 390, \u00b6 14, 347 Mont. 95, 197 P.3d 966. The three conditions Brinson challenges here limit his conduct as contemplated by \u00a7\u00a746-18-201(4)(n) and -202(l)(f), MCA. Accordingly, they are legal conditions of sentence. <em>Stiles, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">\u00b617 We apply a nexus test to determine whether a district court abused its discretion in imposing the challenged sentencing condition. <em>Stiles, </em>\u00b6 13. Specifically, we will strike a condition if it lacks a nexus either to the offense for which the offender is being sentenced or to the offender himself or herself. <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 15. Moreover, with respect to offender-related conditions, sentencing courts may impose such conditions only where the history or pattern of conduct to be restricted (e.g., alcohol or drug abuse) is \u201crecent, and significant or chronic.\u201d <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">\u00b618 Here, with respect to the condition stating that any contact Brinson has with his underage daughter (born in September 1997) must be supervised until such time as a counselor makes a different recommendation, we note that Brinson initially objected to this condition but ultimately agreed that it \u201cmakes sense.\u201d Specifically, he stated (through counsel): \u201cI would agree supervised visitation on an interim basis until-until a professional was satisfied that unsupervised visitation was appropriate makes sense.\u201d Whether Brinson withdrew his objection is somewhat unclear. But, in any event, while he contends that he \u201chas not been found to have any sexual inclinations toward his daughter\u201d and that his daughter \u201cwas in no way involved in the underlying matter,\u201d we agree with the State that this condition bears a nexus to his offense of sexual intercourse without consent. That offense involved a 14-year-old girl (Brinson was 34 at the time), and Brinson has been designated a level 2 offender, which means there is a \u201cmoderate\u201d risk of a repeat sexual offense. Section 46-23-509(2)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">\u00b619 As for Condition 46, which prohibits Brinson from watching certain types of television shows or motion pictures, and Condition 48, which limits his use of cell phones and other such devices with photo, video, or Internet capabilities, Brinson makes a brief and largely conclusory argument that these conditions are \u201coverbroad\u201d and have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>no nexus to him or to his underlying offense. As the State points out, however, these conditions were discussed during the sentencing hearing. The court explained that Brinson would violate Condition 46 \u2018If there\u2019s some similarity between what he\u2019s watching and what happened in this case.\u201d The court further clarified with regard to Condition 48 that Brinson was not prohibited from using a cell phone for employment purposes and that the probation officer could have access to his phone records simply to verify that the phone was not being used for improper purposes. We agree with the State that such restrictions have a nexus to Brinson\u2019s sexual offense and that these limitations on his ability to access and view pornographic material are reasonably related to the objectives of his rehabilitation. Indeed, Brinson stated (through counsel) at the sentencing hearing: T would agree that [Brinson] needs to avoid pornography and-and shows like that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AoW\">\u00b620 We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the three conditions challenged by Brinson.</p>\n<p id=\"AHx\">\u00b621 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b167-5\">JUSTICES WARNER, MORRIS, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b163-7\"> The State brought this to our attention in its response brief in <em>State v.
