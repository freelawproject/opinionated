We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">\u00b62 Rowe presents the following issues for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">\u00b63 Whether the District Court properly imposed a sentencing condition that required Rowe to have no contact with any person under the age of 15, unless accompanied by an approved adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">\u00b64 Whether the District Court properly required Rowe to register as a violent offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">\u00b65 Cassandra Levengood (Cassandra) left her 2 year old son, A.S., in the care of her sister-in-law, Latasha Levengood (Latasha), on the afternoon of December 28,2007. Cassandra worked evenings. Latasha provided primary child care to A.S. Latasha had cared for A.S. since he was three months old.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">\u00b66 Cassandra knew of Latasha\u2019s friendship with Tara Weller (Weller). She also knew of Weller\u2019s methamphetamine use. Cassandra told Latasha that Weller could not be at Latasha\u2019s house when Latasha cared for A.S. Latasha had agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">\u00b67 Weller arrived at Latasha\u2019s trailer at approximately 5:30 p.m. on the evening of December 28,2007. Weller asked Latasha if she wanted to go to dinner at Applebee\u2019s restaurant. Latasha decided that she would go with Weller. Weller and Latasha took A.S. and Latasha\u2019s two daughters to Weller\u2019s trailer. They informed Weller\u2019s boyfriend, Rowe, that they needed a \u201cgirl\u2019s night out\u201d and that he needed to watch the children. Unbeknownst to Cassandra, Latasha had allowed Rowe to care for A.S. approximately five times before this particular evening.</p>\n<p id=\"AOr\">\u00b68 Rowe quickly became frustrated with A.S. A.S. was getting into everything. Rowe apparently attempted to call Weller and Latasha, but they would not answer their cell phones. Rowe lost his temper with A.S. Rowe threw A.S. against the wall and fractured the back of A.S.\u2019s skull. Rowe picked up A.S. and shook him. Rowe also grabbed A.S. by the clothing and yanked him to his feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-13\">\u00b69 Rowe took the children to Latasha\u2019s trailer in the hope that Latasha\u2019s roommates would be there to watch them. Rowe pushed A.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>out the door as they walked out of Weller\u2019s trailer. A.S. struck his forehead on the top step and rolled down the rest of the steps. Rowe picked up A.S. and shook him. Rowe left the children with Latasha\u2019s roommates. Rowe noticed A.S. \u201cspacing out\u201d in a chair and throwing up as he left to return to Weller\u2019s trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">\u00b6 10 Weller received a call from Rowe while she and Latasha waited for their food. Rowe informed Weller that A.S. had fallen down the stairs and that Rowe needed them to come home. Weller and Latasha left Applebee\u2019s a few minutes before 7:00 p.m. They returned to Latasha\u2019s trailer and treated the contusion on A.S.\u2019s forehead with an ice pack.</p>\n<p id=\"AOx\">\u00b611 Latasha falsely informed Cassandra that A.S. had attempted to climb over a baby gate and started to fall. Latasha explained that she had slipped and fallen on A.S. when she reached to catch him. Latasha claimed that A.S. had hit his head on the floor and had a \u201cgoose egg\u201d on his forehead.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">\u00b612 Cassandra called her boyfriend, James Meixner (Meixner), who picked up A.S. at Latasha\u2019s trailer at approximately 9:30 p.m. Meixner observed the bump on A.S.\u2019s head. Meixner did not suspect a concussion or serious injury due to Latasha\u2019s explanation of how A.S. had been injured. Meixner took A.S. home and placed him in bed. Cassandra returned home and also observed the bump on A.S.\u2019s head. A.S. did not sleep well that night. A.S. awoke every half-hour complaining that his head hurt.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">\u00b613 Cassandra and Meixner noted the following morning that A.S. had severe bruising to his face and torso. Cassandra contacted her pediatrician, Karen E. Cody, M.D. (Dr. Cody). Dr. Cody examined A.S. Dr. Cody directed Cassandra to take A.S. to St. Peter\u2019s emergency room. Dr. Cody observed that the numerous injuries that A.S. had sustained were inconsistent with the explanation for how he had been injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">\u00b614 The hospital staff discovered A.S.\u2019s fractured skull. They discussed the possibility of air lifting him to Great Falls. The staff did not know whether A.S.\u2019s brain was bleeding or swelling. The hospital staff reported A.S.\u2019s injuries to law enforcement. Officer\u2019s learned in their investigation that A.S. had been in Latasha\u2019s care at the time that he had received his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">\u00b615 Officers contacted Latasha and discovered that she had lied to Cassandra about how A.S. had sustained his injuries. Officers contacted Rowe. Rowe admitted to the officers that he had lied to Latasha about how A.S. had sustained his injuries. Rowe admitted to not providing medical care to A.S. after seeing the injuries and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>knowing he had caused A.S. pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">\u00b616 The State charged Rowe on January 11, 2008, with aggravated assault, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-202(1), MCA, and criminal endangerment, a felony, in violation of \u00a745-5-207, MCA. The State asserted that Rowe had satisfied the knowingly element of \u00a745-5-207, MCA, by being dishonest with the child\u2019s caretaker about the nature and the extent of the injuries to A.S. and for causing a delay in A.S. receiving medical attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">\u00b617 Rowe eventually entered an agreement with the State whereby he entered \u201cguilty\u201d pleas to criminal endangerment, a felony, and negligent endangerment, a misdemeanor. The court accepted Rowe\u2019s pleas. The court ordered a pre-sentence investigation report (PSI) and scheduled sentencing. The State requested that Rowe\u2019s bond contain the condition that \u2018be not be around children under age 15 without adult supervision.\u201d The State further requested that Weller, now Rowe\u2019s wife, could not provide the requisite adult supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">\u00b618 The court held Rowe\u2019s sentencing hearing on June 13, 2008. The court received the PSI, the mental health/psychosexual evaluation, and various letters submitted by the parties. The court also heard witness testimony. Dr. Cody submitted a letter to the court explaining that A.S.\u2019s head injury had resulted in long term impairment. Dr. Cody asserted that A.S.\u2019s future physical activities would have to exclude football, soccer, and any activity that could involve the possibility of additional head trauma. The court also heard testimony about how A.S. had suffered serious emotional and behavioral problems from this incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">\u00b619 Melissa Lesmeister (Lesmeister) testified about the PSI that she and another probation officer had submitted to the court. She knew of Rowe\u2019s history from her previous work in mental health. Lesmeister testified that Rowe had a difficult childhood that included mental and physical abuse. She further testified that Rowe has had an ongoing anger problem. Lesmeister noted that anger had been mentioned in most of Rowe\u2019s diagnoses. Lesmeister also reviewed information from the Center for Mental Health in Helena regarding Rowe\u2019s therapy since his release from jail. Lesmeister testified that it appeared that Rowe was not willing to take responsibility for his actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">\u00b620 Lesmeister knew of Rowe\u2019s recent marriage to Weller and his new baby at home. Lesmeister expressed concern about the infant\u2019s safety around Rowe. She opined that the frustration level that a new infant can bring into a home could manifest itself in another violent outburst by Rowe. Lesmeister determined that a \u2018building of frustration\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>triggered Rowe\u2019s assault on A.S. Lesmeister recommended placement in a pre-release center that would allow Rowe parenting, anger management, supported living, the ability to gain part time employment, and the ability to start making consistent restitution payments. Lesmeister further recommended that a pre-release center would allow Rowe to be removed from a home where there would be an infant until he could gain more appropriate skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">\u00b621 Cathleen Zanto (Zanto), Rowe\u2019s previous case manager, testified that pre-release would remove Rowe from his support system. She believed that the incident occurred due to Rowe voluntarily having stopped his medications approximately 2-3 weeks before the incident. Rowe convinced Zanto that he underestimated his need to continue with his medications. She also testified to Rowe\u2019s commitment to improving his mental health and addressing his anger issues. Zanto had no concerns about Rowe being around his child. She believed that his support system, including herself and Weller\u2019s parents, would prevent Rowe from hurting his child. Zanto could not guarantee, however, that Rowe would not hurt his child.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">\u00b622 Dean Gregg, Ph.D. (Dr. Gregg), performed a psychological evaluation on Rowe. He testified that Rowe had an average risk to re-offend. He further testified that Rowe\u2019s prognosis is \u2018fair to good if he sticks with his treatment, classes that type of thing.\u201d He also testified, however, that Rowe did not understand the seriousness of his crimes. He initially informed the court that he would defer to the Department of Child and Family Services regarding whether Rowe should be able to parent his child. He later cautioned the court about allowing Rowe around small children.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">\u00b623 The court committed Rowe for felony criminal endangerment to the Department of Corrections (DOC) for ten years, with five years suspended. The court sentenced Rowe for misdemeanor negligent endangerment to the Lewis and Clark County jail for one year, with all time suspended, and to run concurrently with the sentence imposed for the criminal endangerment conviction. The court authorized the DOC to place Rowe into an appropriate community-based program, facility, or State correctional institution. The court recommended that he complete a pre-release center program.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">\u00b624 The court imposed a number of conditions. The two conditions pertinent to this appeal are: 1) \u2018the defendant shall have no contact with any individual under the age of fifteen (15) unless accompanied by an approved adult who is aware of the defendant\u2019s conviction and who is approved by his supervising officer and therapist,\u201d and 2) \u2018the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>defendant shall register as a violent offender, pursuant to Section 46-23-504, and shall advise law enforcement of his current address.\u201dRowe appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">\u00b625 We review de novo the legality of a sentencing condition. <em>State v. Corbin, </em>2008 MT 146, \u00b6 4, 343 Mont. 211, 184 P.3d 287. We review the reasonableness of the challenged condition to determine whether the sentencing court abused its discretion. <em>Corbin, </em>\u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">\u00b626 <em>Whether the District Court properly imposed a sentencing condition that required Rowe to have no contact with any person under the age of 15, unless accompanied by an approved adult.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">\u00b627 Weller had been pregnant with Rowe\u2019s child at the time that he attacked A.S. Rowe and Weller married on March 6,2008. Weller gave birth to their child the week of the sentencing hearing. Much of the sentencing hearing pertained to Rowe\u2019s contact with his newborn baby.</p>\n<p id=\"ANCD\">\u00b628 Rowe argues that this sentencing condition effectively deprives him of his fundamental right to parent his own child. Rowe cites to <em>Matter of A.S.A., </em>258 Mont. 194, 197, 852 P.2d 127, 129(1993), to argue that a natural parent\u2019s right to the care and custody of his or her child is a \u2018fundamental liberty interest.\u201d Rowe argues that the record fails to support a compelling state interest that outweighs his fundamental right to parent his own child. Rowe contends that he completed parenting classes before the time of sentencing and that he had been enrolled in anger management classes, coping skills classes, and a CP&amp;R class. Rowe points out that his child was not the victim in this case. Rowe argues that the circumstances surrounding his own child differ vastly from those of the victim, thus diminishing any reasonable necessity to infringe upon his constitutional right to parent his child. Rowe points to Zanto\u2019s testimony that she had counseled him for four years and that she had no concerns about him being near his own child.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">\u00b629 The child abuse and neglect statutes reflect the \u201ctension between the need to \u2018protect, whenever possible, family unity\u2019 and yet still \u2018provide for the protection of children whose health and welfare are or <em>may be </em>adversely affected and <em>further threatened </em>by the conduct of those responsible for their care and protection.\u2019 <em>\u201d In re A.M., </em>2001 MT 60, \u00b6 37, 304 Mont. 379, 22 P.3d 185. Section 41-3-102(2), MCA, provides that a <em>parent </em>is \u201ca person responsible for a child\u2019s welfare.\u201d A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>\u201csubstantial risk of physical or psychological harm to a child by the acts or omissions of a person responsible for the child\u2019s welfare\u201d constitutes child abuse and neglect. Section 41-3-102(7)(a)(ii) and (b)(i)(A), MCA; <em>see In re J.A.B., </em>1999 MT 173, \u00b6 10, 295 Mont. 227, 983 P.2d 387. Threatened harm to a child\u2019s health or welfare means substantial risk of harm to the child\u2019s health or welfare. <em>J.A.B., </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"A3p\">\u00b630 Rowe participated in anger management for several years before the commission of these crimes. Rowe voluntarily stopped taking his medications 2-3 weeks before this incident. Zanto opines that the incident occurred <em>because </em>Rowe had been off his medications. Rowe has committed other incidents of violence, however, in addition to his attack on A.S. It is undisputed that Rowe has an anger problem. Rowe poses a substantial risk of harm to his child. <em>J.A.B., </em>\u00b6 10. The District Court did not abuse its discretion when it imposed this sentencing condition. <em>Corbin, </em>\u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">\u00b631 <em>Whether the District Court properly required Rowe to register as a violent offender.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">\u00b632 Rowe pled guilty to felony criminal endangerment and misdemeanor negligent endangerment. The court imposed the sentencing condition that Rowe register as a violent offender pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-504, MCA. The State concedes, however, that this sentencing condition exceeded the court\u2019s statutory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"ADk\">\u00b633 Section 46-23-502(10), MCA, provides that a violent offender is a person who has been convicted of a violent offense. A violent offender status is determined purely by statute. <em>State v. Miller, </em>1998 MT 177, \u00b6 41, 290 Mont. 97, 966 P.2d 721. Section 46-23-502(13)(a), MCA, lists the \u201cviolent offenses\u201d that require registration. Rowe\u2019s offenses are not included. The District Court lacked any statutory authority to require Rowe to register as a violent offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">\u00b634 We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for entry of an amended sentence consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b364-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES LEAPHART, WARNER and COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
