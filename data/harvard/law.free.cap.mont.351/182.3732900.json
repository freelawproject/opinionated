We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">\u00b62 Dewitz raised several issues and sub-issues on appeal which we have restated for clarity as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Dewitz\u2019s motion to excuse a prospective juror for cause?</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">\u00b64 2.

Evid. 404(b) claim by his failure to make a timely objection?</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">\u00b67 5. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it refused to instruct the jury that Ashley was an accomplice as a matter of law? \u00b68 6. Did the District Court err in denying Dewitz\u2019s motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence?<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">\u00b69 7. Did the prosecutor commit misconduct in her closing argument to the jury?</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b208-13\">\u00b610 Dewitz and Tanisha Ashley had an 8-year-long relationship that began when Ashley was 16 years old. They had a daughter, Jasmyne, when Ashley was 17. Although their relationship ended, Dewitz and Ashley maintained contact so that Dewitz could continue to see Jasmyne.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-14\">\u00b611 In June 2004, Ashley decided to move from Virginia to Oregon where she grew up and where she still had family. Dewitz agreed to help her move. In August 2004, Dewitz, Ashley and Mia, Ashley\u2019s infant daughter from a different relationship, left for Oregon by car. They drove a white, four-door, older car, possibly a Subaru. Jasmyne remained in Iowa with Dewitz\u2019s family until Ashley was settled in Oregon.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-15\">\u00b612 Dewitz and Ashley arrived in Missoula on the evening of August 17, 2004. They decided to stay overnight in Missoula, hence Ashley rented two rooms at the Microtel Motel. Ashley later testified that she rented the rooms because Dewitz did not have any identification. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>rooms were side by side. Ashley and her baby stayed in room 332 and Dewitz stayed in room 330. Ashley testified that the only time she was in room 330 was when they arrived and she carried Dewitz\u2019s cat to that room before going to her own room with Mia.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">\u00b613 Ashley further testified that sometime after she went to sleep, she was awakened by Dewitz screaming her name and banging on her door. When Ashley opened the door, Dewitz rushed past her, grabbed his briefcase and told her to get the baby because they had to go. Ashley noticed that Dewitz had burn blisters on his arms and chest. Ashley grabbed Mia and whatever else she could and ran out to the car where Dewitz was waiting. She noticed a lot of smoke coming out of the motel windows. Ashley asked Dewitz about his cat and Dewitz told her it was dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">\u00b614 Dewitz drove toward the interstate. On their way out of town, Ashley asked Dewitz what happened and he told her \u201ca fire.\u201d Ashley told Dewitz that he had to take her back because the rooms were in her name. Dewitz turned the vehicle around and dropped Ashley and Mia off at a gas station. Dewitz told Ashley he could not stay because there was a warrant out for his arrest. Ashley returned to the motel with Mia and told the desk clerk what had happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">\u00b615 The Missoula Fire Department responded to the fire and evacuated the motel. When the firefighters initially entered the burning room, the sprinkler system was spraying water, but a pot on the floor was still burning. The firefighters used a chemical fire extinguisher to put out the fire in the pot and also rescued Dewitz\u2019s cat from the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">\u00b616 Fire Inspector Jason Diehl conducted the investigation of the fire in room 330. He determined that the fire started when wind from the open window blew the curtains into a hot plate that was sitting on a counter below the window causing the curtains to ignite. The fire from the curtains then ignited the flammable vapors emitting from a pot in the room. Diehl believed that the flaming pot of chemicals ended up on the floor when the occupant of the room moved it away from the curtains in an attempt to extinguish the blaze. Diehl testified that from the objects he observed in the room and from the way the fire started, it appeared to him that someone had set up a meth lab in the room endangering not only the motel occupants, but also the firefighters who responded to the fire. The fire caused over $270,000 in damages to the motel.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">\u00b617 As part of his investigation, Diehl interviewed Ashley. In that interview, Ashley told Diehl that she and her daughter were staying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>in room 332 and Dewitz was staying in room 330. Ashley later testified that at some point during the evening, Dewitz told her he was heading to WalMart. Ashley said that she remained in her room all night scratching lottery tickets until she fell asleep. She did not wake up until she heard Dewitz banging on the door and screaming her name.</p>\n<p id=\"A_F\">\u00b618 Ashley gave law enforcement officers permission to search both rooms. In room 332, the officers found baby bottles, formula, diapers, feminine items, and a bottle of medication. Detective Scott Brodie with the Missoula Police Department testified that all of these items indicated that Ashley was staying in room 332. In the bathroom of room 332, the officers also found a snort tube and a piece of burnt tin foil. Residue from these items later tested positive for meth.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">\u00b619 When officers searched room 330, they found a number of items associated with the making of meth including Epsom salts, Isopropyl alcohol, STP gas treatment, tubing, a funnel, rubber gloves, lithium batteries, a digital scale, duct tape, a gas mask, various bottles of liquid, and a pot of a tri-layered amber liquid. Tests by the crime lab revealed that the upper layer of this liquid was meth. Officers also found in the room a wallet containing $5,000 wrapped in black electrical tape; two spiral notebooks containing laundry lists of things to buy and do; a man\u2019s toiletry bag containing a toothbrush and shaving gear; and a bag of catnip. Detective Brodie testified that these items indicated that Dewitz was staying in that room.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">\u00b620 Ashley was arrested and charged with Criminal Endangerment for exposing two-month old Mia to meth, Criminal Possession of Dangerous Drugs, Criminal Possession of Drug Paraphernalia, and Operation of an Unlawful Clandestine Lab. Mia was placed in the care of Child &amp; Family Services. An examination showed that Mia had methamphetamine and amphetamine in her system.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">\u00b621 On June 6, 2005, the State and Ashley entered into a plea agreement wherein the State agreed that the charges of Criminal Endangerment and Operation of an Unlawful Clandestine Lab would be dismissed at sentencing. Ashley agreed to plead guilty to Criminal Possession of Dangerous Drugs and Criminal Possession of Drug Paraphernalia, and to testify truthfully in any proceeding stemming from the incident at the motel. The State also agreed to recommend a five-year commitment to the Department of Corrections with all but one year suspended and a $4,000 fine for the Offense of Criminal Possession of Dangerous Drugs, along with a six-month sentence to the Missoula County Detention Center for the offense of Criminal Possession of Drug Paraphernalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>\u00b622 Dewitz was arrested in Oregon on September 21, 2004, and returned to Montana for trial. The State charged Dewitz with Operation of an Unlawful Clandestine Lab, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-9-132, MCA, and Criminal Endangerment, a felony, in violation of \u00a745-5-207, MCA. A jury found Dewitz guilty of both offenses on June 29,2005. For the offense of Operation of an Unlawful Clandestine Lab, Dewitz was sentenced to prison for forty years with twenty years suspended. He was sentenced to an additional ten years for the offense of Criminal Endangerment, to run concurrently to the first sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"AqX\">\u00b623 Dewitz appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">Issue 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">\u00b624 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied Dewitz\u2019s motion to excuse a prospective juror for cause ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">\u00b625 The District Court denied defense counsel\u2019s request to strike prospective juror Chari Lipski for cause. Lipski is employed as a 911 dispatcher and her significant other is a city police officer. During voir dire, Lipski stated that she may have been working at the time of the incident and that she remembered the fire \u2018being discussed\u201d among her coworkers. Defense counsel requested that she be removed for cause because she was a potential witness and because she may have outside knowledge of the incident that could come into play during deliberations. The State objected to Lipski\u2019s dismissal and the District Court denied defense counsel\u2019s request to strike this juror for cause. Consequently, counsel used one of his preemptory challenges to remove her from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">\u00b626 Dewitz argues on appeal that the District Court\u2019s failure to dismiss Lipski denied him his right to a fair trial. He contends that because Lipski is employed \u2018by the entity on whose behalf the prosecution was initiated,\u201d Lipski should have been dismissed for cause. Dewitz also contends that because Lipski is a 911 dispatcher and is in a relationship with a law enforcement officer, she is \u201cprone to favor\u201d the State\u2019s side of this case. And, finally, Dewitz contends that because Lipski heard some of her co-workers discussing this incident at the time it occurred, Lipski was a potential witness, thus she could not serve as a juror in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">\u00b627 The State argues that the mere fact that Lipski has connections to law enforcement does not, without more, necessitate a finding of bias. The State also argues that Dewitz\u2019s claim that Lipski should have been excused because she could be a potential witness in this case is unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>\u00b628 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a challenge for cause to determine if the court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Golie, </em>2006 MT 91, \u00b6 6, 332 Mont. 69, 134 P.3d 95 (citing <em>State v. Marble, </em>2005 MT 208, \u00b6 10, 328 Mont. 223, 119 P.3d 88). An abuse of discretion occurs if a trial court fails to excuse a prospective juror when actual bias is discovered during voir dire. <em>State v. Richeson, </em>2004 MT 113, \u00b6 16, 321 Mont. 126, 89 P.3d 958 (citing <em>State v. Freshment, </em>2002 MT 61, \u00b6 12, 309 Mont. 154, 43 P.3d 968). \u2018(Because of the right to a trial by an impartial jury [Mont. Const., art II, \u00a724], and the great expense and inconvenience that results from retrial, dismissal for cause is favored when a serious question arises about a juror\u2019s ability to be impartial.\u201d <em>Richeson, </em>\u00b6 14 (citing <em>Freshment, </em>\u00b6 11).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">\u00b629 Section 46-16-115(2), MCA, sets forth the bases for challenging potential jurors for cause in criminal cases. Dewitz contends on appeal that \u00a746-16-115(2)(b), MCA, in particular applies to this case. Section 46-16-115(2)(b), MCA, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-5\">(2) A challenge for cause may be taken for all or any of the following reasons or for any other reason that the court determines:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\">(b) standing in the relation of guardian and ward, attorney and client, master and servant, landlord and tenant, or debtor and creditor with or being a member of the family <em>or in the employment of </em>the defendant or the person who is alleged to be injured by the offense charged or <em>on whose complaint the prosecution was </em>instituted;... [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Thus, Dewitz argues that under this statute, Lipski should have been dismissed for cause because she was employed as a 911 dispatcher. However, Dewitz did not argue this theory in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">\u00b630 It is a well-established rule that this Court will not address an issue raised for the first time on appeal or a party\u2019s change in legal theory because it is unfair to fault the trial court on an issue it never had the opportunity to consider. <em>State v. Peterson, </em>2002 MT 65, \u00b6 24, 309 Mont. 199, 44 P.3d 499 (citing <em>State v. Weaselboy, </em>1999 MT 274, \u00b6 16, 296 Mont. 503, 989 P.2d 836). Because Dewitz did not raise a challenge to Lipski under this statute during voir dire, we will not address this issue under this new legal theory on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">\u00b631 Dewitz also contends that because Lipski is a 911 dispatcher and is in a relationship with a law enforcement officer, she is \u2018jprone to favor\u201d the State\u2019s side of this case. However, the following discussion occurred during the voir dire examination of Lipski:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>The Court: So are those witnesses so close to either you or you know they\u2019re close to your significant other that you don\u2019t feel you can process the evidence fairly and impartially in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-4\">JUROR LIPSKI: I don\u2019t think that it would-would affect the way that I looked at this but I am a 911 dispatcher and I also do call in city police tests so-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-5\">THE COURT: Right. Is that going to-again are you able to set your job aside and be a juror and just listen to this testimony here and follow the law and then you find the facts and get to a verdict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-6\">JUROR LIPSKI: I believe so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-7\">MS. CLARK [for the State]: Ms. Lipski, you don\u2019t specifically recall if you were working that morning or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-8\">JUROR LIPSKI: I don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-9\">MS. CLARK: Any of the things that you heard about this offense, either from co-workers or from working, have you formed an opinion about the case as of now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-10\">JUROR LIPSKI: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-11\">MS. CLARK: Would you be able to listen objectively to both sides and make a determination at the end of Mr. Dewitz\u2019s guilt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-12\">JUROR LIPSKI: I believe so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-13\">MS. CLARK: And does the fact that you are a dispatcher in a relationship with an officer and work at the city police department have a bearing on how you would weigh the evidence in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-14\">JUROR LIPSKI: I don\u2019t believe so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-15\">MS. CLARK: I object to her dismissal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-16\">THE COURT: Any additional questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-17\">MR. LAFONTAINE [counsel for Dewitz]: Yes, Judge. Ms. Lipski, as you stated to one of Ms. Clark\u2019s questions, you don\u2019t-you don\u2019t remember-you don\u2019t recall exactly whether you worked that night or not, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-18\">JUROR LIPSKI: Right. I would have to check my shift schedule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-19\">MR. LAFONTAINE: Okay. And you did state to the judge that you could sit here and listen to all the evidence and be a fair and impartial juror; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-20\">JUROR LIPSKI: I do believe so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-21\">MR. LAFONTAINE: Okay. And do you believe-if you heard all of the state\u2019s witnesses, you heard all of the-you heard certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>police officers, fire marshals, and possibly an evidence examiner get up here and testify, if you heard whatever evidence the defense has to put on and if you feel that the state didn\u2019t prove their case, could you enter a not guilty verdict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-4\">JUROR LIPSKI: I believe I could and do what was proper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-5\">MR. LAFONTAINE: And-and the fact that someone\u2019s sitting next to a defense attorney at a criminal trial you don\u2019t automatically believe that that person\u2019s guilty, do you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">JUROR LIPSKI: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-7\">MR. LAFONTAINE: Judge, she did answer the questions that-fchat I asked, I believe, truthfully, Judge. However, as stated earlier, the main reason for this is that this-this potential juror could-eould have been called as a-as a-as a witness by the state if the state so chose because she has prior knowledge of this offense and-and that may-that-J believe, Judge, that may-that may come into bearing during deliberation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-8\">THE COURT: Very well. Your motion is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">\u00b632 Thus, contrary to Dewitz\u2019s contention, the preceding colloquy shows that Lipski was not biased in this case. Lipski consistently responded that she would listen to the evidence objectively, that she could remain impartial, and that her job in law enforcement and her personal relationship with a law enforcement officer would not have a bearing on how she weighed the evidence. There exists nothing in Lipski\u2019s testimony demonstrating that she had formed an opinion on Dewitz\u2019s guilt or innocence, or that her employment and personal relationship would cause Lipski to harbor any actual bias one way or the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">\u00b633 In addition, the mere fact that Lipski is connected to law enforcement through her job and her personal relationship does not, without more, necessitate a finding that she would not be an impartial juror. State <em>v. Deschon, </em>2004 MT 32, \u00b6 41, 320 Mont. 1, 85 P.3d 756 (citing <em>State v. Thomson, </em>169 Mont. 158, 163, 545 P.2d 1070, 1072-73 (1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-11\">\u00b634 Dewitz also contends that because Lipski heard some of her coworkers discussing this incident at the time it occurred, Lipski was a potential witness and, pursuant to M. R. Evid. 606(a), jurors are prohibited from acting as witnesses at trial. However, Lipski was not listed as a witness by the State or the defense prior to trial, and Lipski never testified at trial. Thus, Dewitz\u2019s claim that Lipski should have been excused because she could be a potential witness is unfounded. In addition, Dewitz\u2019s claim that Lipski could have tainted the jury with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>information or facts that may not have been submitted at trial was pure speculation. Discussing the case with her co-workers and remembering a \u2018brief generalization\u201d of what occurred does not prove that Lipski was exposed to information that was inadmissible at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"A2C\">\u00b635 Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Dewitz\u2019s motion to excuse Lipski for cause, and we affirm on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">Issue 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">\u00b636 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion in allowing an officer to testify regarding handwriting samples?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">\u00b637 Detective Brodie testified that in the course of his investigation, he found two spiral notebooks inside a red bag in room 330 containing, among other things, \u2018to do\u201d lists. Detective Brodie testified that some of the items found in the room were on the lists. Detective Brodie further testified that he compared the handwriting in the notebooks to the handwriting in several letters that had been seized from Ashley while she was incarcerated in the Missoula County Detention Center. While acknowledging that he was not an expert, Detective Brodie opined that the handwriting in the notebooks was the same as the handwriting in the letters. Detective Brodie informed the jury that he believed the letters were from Dewitz because the return address indicated they were from a \u201cJill Delle,\u201dbut at least one of them was signed, \u2018Your man, J.D.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">\u00b638 Dewitz argued in the trial court and now on appeal that the State did not lay the proper foundation to have Detective Brodie qualified as an expert in handwriting analysis. Dewitz also argues that the District Court abused its discretion when it allowed Detective Brodie to give opinion testimony that the handwriting on the letters was the same as the handwriting in the notebooks.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">\u00b639 The State argues, on the other hand, that Detective Brodie was not testifying as an expert witness because his testimony was not scientific or technical, and it did not require specialized knowledge or training. Instead, the State maintains that Brodie was testifying as a lay witness and \u201csimply offering his personal observation that [the] handwriting in the letters and notebooks was the same, an observation that any lay witness could have made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">\u00b640 We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Frasure, </em>2004 MT 305, \u00b6 15, 323 Mont. 479, 100 P.3d 1013. In addition, we have repeatedly held that law enforcement officers may testify to matters about which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>\u201cthey have extensive experience and are properly qualified through training and experience.\u201d <em>Frasure, </em>\u00b6 17 (citing <em>Onstad v. Payless Shoesource, </em>2000 MT 230, \u00b6 40, 301 Mont. 259, 9 P.3d 38, <em>overruled in part by Johnson v. Costco Wholesale, </em>2007 MT 43, 336 Mont. 105, 152 P.3d 727). However, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>we agree with Dewitz that Detective Brodie was giving expert testimony on handwriting comparisons even though he was not a handwriting expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">\u00b641 We have found only one case wherein this Court has allowed testimony comparing handwriting from someone other than a handwriting expert, and the reason we allowed such testimony in that case was because the person testifying had established a familiarity with the defendant\u2019s handwriting long before defendant\u2019s alleged misconduct occurred. In <em>State v. Fleming, </em>225 Mont. 48, 730 P.2d 1178 (1987), a case involving the issuing of bad checks, the managing officer and executive vice president of a bank handling the checks at issue was allowed to render his opinion as to the author of those checks. We pointed out in <em>Fleming </em>that the bank official\u2019s familiarity with the defendant\u2019s signature was gained through having known the defendant since birth, his personal contact with the defendant at the bank, and his review of the defendant\u2019s signature card on file at the bank. <em>Fleming, 225 </em>Mont. at 52, 730 P.2d at 1180-81. In addition, the bank official stated that comparing signature cards with the signatures on checks was part of his job at the bank. <em>Fleming, </em>225 Mont. at 52, 730 P.2d at 1180-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">\u00b642 We relied in <em>Fleming </em>on M. R. Evid. 901, which provides that a nonexpert may give an opinion on the genuineness of handwriting only if the nonexpert is already familiar with that handwriting. <em>Fleming, </em>225 Mont. at 51-52, 730 P.2d at 1180-81.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-6\">Requirement of authentication or identification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-7\">(a) General provision. The requirement of authentication or identification as a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-8\">(b) Illustrations. By way of illustration only, and not by way of limitation, the following are examples of authentication or identification conforming with the requirements of this rule:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-9\">(2) Nonexpert opinion on handwriting.

The first step in the analysis is to categorize the claimed error as \u201cstructural\u201derror or \u201ctrial\u201derror. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 37. \u201c\u2018Structural\u2019 error is that type of error that \u2018[ajffects the framework within which the trial proceeds, rather than simply an error in the trial process itself,\u2019 \u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 38, whereas \u201ctrial\u201d error \u2018is that type of error that typically occurs during the presentation of a case to the jury,\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 40. We further defined \u201cstructural\u201d error as error that is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqbY\">typically of constitutional dimensions, precedes the trial, and undermines the fairness of the entire trial proceeding. Because of its nature, it cannot be qualitatively or quantitatively weighed against the admissible evidence introduced at trial. Structural error is presumptively prejudicial and is not subject to harmless error review jurisprudentially or under our harmless error statute found at \u00a746-20-701, MCA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Structural error is automatically reversible and requires no additional analysis or review.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\"><em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 38-39 (citing <em>State v.

In the case <em>sub judiee, </em>the error is clearly \u2018trial\u201derror as it occurred during the presentation of the case to the jury, <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 40, but it did not undermine the fairness of the entire trial proceeding, <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>\u00b645 Because we have determined that the error in this case was \u201ctrial\u201d error, the next step in the analysis is to determine whether the error was harmless under the circumstances. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 41. Consequently, we must look \u2018to whether the fact-finder was presented with admissible evidence that proved the same facts as the tainted evidence proved.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 43 (emphasis omitted). In other words, in the instant case, the State must have presented other evidence to show that Dewitz was occupying the room containing the meth lab that caught on fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">\u00b646 To that end, the State presented Ashley\u2019s testimony that Dewitz occupied that room; a booking photo of Dewitz from Oregon indicating that he had been burned in the fire in that room; a photograph of Dewitz\u2019s and Ashley\u2019s daughter found in that room; and Julia Menendez\u2019s testimony that on the night of the fire, Dewitz called her and told her he had been burned in a fire at the motel. This evidence was sufficient to prove the same facts as the tainted evidence was intended to proveJ.e., that Dewitz occupied the room containing the meth lab.</p>\n<p id=\"AFI\">\u00b647 Therefore, on the basis of this other admissible evidence, we conclude that the introduction of Detective Brodie\u2019s opinions regarding the handwriting in the notebooks was harmless, and Dewitz\u2019s right to a fair trial was not prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Issue 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">\u00b648 <em>Did the District Court err in allowing an officer to testify regarding statements made by witnesses at the scene?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">\u00b649 While we review a district court\u2019s evidentiary decisions to determine if the court abused its discretion, we review a court\u2019s conclusions of law and interpretations of the United States Constitution de novo. <em>State v.

Dewitz argues on appeal that this statement is inadmissible under M. R.

Over defense counsel\u2019s objection, the court allowed Officer Brueckner to read from the affidavit and motion that had been previously introduced by defense counsel. In addition, the State argued in closing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-4\">How do we know that it was [Dewitz] that did this?

She also testified that the time period she was referring to when they both used meth was at least eight months prior to this incident. Dewitz did not object to this testimony from Ashley, and, instead, waited until after Ashley had finished testifying to move for a mistrial. The motion was based in part on the grounds that Ashley\u2019s testimony regarding their meth use was inadmissible because it referred to prior bad acts when the State had not given proper notice that it intended to introduce such information. The District Court denied Dewitz\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">\u00b659 We review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion for a mistrial to determine whether the court abused it discretion. <em>Smith, </em>\u00b6 6 (citing <em>State v.

He contends that the evidence had no probative value and was too remote in time to be considered relevant to this incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">\u00b661 The State argues on the other hand that Dewitz waived appellate review of this issue because he never made a contemporaneous 404(b) objection during Ashley\u2019s testimony even though the grounds for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>objection were apparent at the time. The State maintains that raising a 404(b) argument in a motion for a mistrial is too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">\u00b662 To preserve an issue for appeal, a defendant must make an objection when the evidence is offered. \u2018\u201c[0]ne must object to improper testimony when it is offered or abide the result; failure to object at the proper times waives the error.\u2019 <em>\u201d State v.

Instead, Dewitz waited until after both the prosecution and the defense had completed their examinations of Ashley before he raised his 404(b) claim, and then he did so by way of a motion for a mistrial. This is not a permitted tactic. Waiting to raise an objection to allegedly improper testimony until a motion for mistrial waives the objection as untimely when the objection could have been raised at the time the testimony was offered. <em>See State v.

Courville, </em>2002 MT 330, \u00b6 15, 313 Mont. 218, 61 P.3d 749). And, recognizing that a trial court has broad discretion when it instructs a jury, we review the court\u2019s decisions regarding jury instructions to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>Cybulski, </em>\u00b6 34 (citing <em>State v.

Swann, </em>2007 MT 126, \u00b6 32, 337 Mont. 326, 160 P.3d 511). To determine whether the court abused its discretion in instructing the jury, we look at whether the court acted arbitrarily or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>Cybulski, </em>\u00b6 34 <em>(citing Bieber, </em>\u00b6 22; <em>State v. English, </em>2006 MT 177, \u00b6 50, 333 Mont. 23, 140 P.3d 454). To constitute reversible error, any mistake in rendering the instructions must prejudicially affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Cybulski, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">\u00b667 In this case, the District Court instructed the jury on the issue of accountability as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-5\">Witness Legally Accountable</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-6\">1. A person is legally accountable for the conduct of another when either before or during the commission of an offense with the purpose to promote or facilitate such commission, he solicits, aids, abets, agrees, or attempts to aid such other person in the planning or commission of the offense. <em>The trier of fact must determine if Tanisha Ashley is legally accountable in this case.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\"><em>2. </em>The testimony of one legally accountable ought to be viewed with distrust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-8\">3. A conviction cannot be had on the testimony of one legally accountable unless it is corroborated by other evidence which in itself, and without the aide of the testimony of the person legally accountable, tends to connect the Defendant with the commission of the offense, and the corroboration is not sufficient if it merely shows the commission of the offense or the circumstances thereof. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">\u00b668 Dewitz contends that the District Court abused its discretion when it failed to instruct the jury that Ashley was an accomplice as a matter of law, and instead, left the question of Ashley\u2019s accountability for the jury to decide. Because the State initially charged Ashley with the same criminal activity with which it had charged Dewitz, Dewitz maintains that the State based its case on accomplice testimony and that a defendant is entitled to special protections when an accomplice testifies at trial, such as requiring other corroborating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">\u00b669 The State argues that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in instructing the jury because the parties disagreed over whether Ashley was an accomplice. On that basis, the State maintains that the court correctly left the issue for the jury to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">\u00b670 Dewitz points to our holding in <em>State v. Johnson, </em>276 Mont. 447, 452, 918 P.2d 293, 296 (1996), for the proposition that \u201c[o]ne who is chargeable with the same crime as a defendant is an accomplice.\u201d In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number><em>Johnson, </em>the State charged the defendant Jesse Johnson with criminal mischief and criminal endangerment stemming from the destruction of another\u2019s vehicle. The State also charged two other individuals, Eddie Johnson and Sunshine Perez, with criminal mischief for taking part in destroying the vehicle. Eddie pled guilty and agreed to testify against Jesse at his trial. Sunshine entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the State wherein the State agreed to dismiss the criminal mischief charge if she also testified against Jesse. <em>Johnson, </em>276 Mont. at 448-49, 918 P.2d at 293-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">\u00b671 Prior to trial, the State dismissed the criminal endangerment charge against Jesse. At Jesse\u2019s trial on the criminal mischief charge, the State conceded that the only evidence connecting Jesse to the crime was the testimony of Eddie and Sunshine. The State also conceded that Eddie was an accomplice, but argued that Sunshine was not. The State maintained that Sunshine had not committed any crimes even though it continued to threaten her with prosecution for criminal mischief if she did not testify against Jesse. Jesse moved to dismiss on the grounds that the State failed to prove its case because the only evidence that connected him to the crime came from accomplices. The court denied his motion and Jesse was convicted of criminal mischief. <em>Johnson, </em>276 Mont. at 449-50, 918 P.2d at 294.</p>\n<p id=\"A6_\">\u00b672 In reversing the district court, we expressed our disapproval of the State\u2019s tactic of threatening to prosecute Sunshine for criminal mischief while maintaining that she was not an accomplice for purposes of trying Jesse for the same crime. \u2018To procure her testimony by such a threat and then argue to the ... jury that there is no basis for finding that she was accountable for the crime was the kind of duplicitous conduct by an officer of the court that cannot be sanctioned by the law.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>276 Mont. at 452, 918 P.2d at 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">\u00b673 Contrary to Dewitz\u2019s assertions, the facts in Johnson are distinguishable from the facts in the instant case, and the duplicitous conduct that this Court found offensive in <em>Johnson </em>is not present here. Unlike <em>Johnson, </em>in the case <em>sub judice </em>the State dismissed the charge of accountability against Ashley <em>prior </em>to trying Dewitz. The State did not continue to threaten to prosecute Ashley by way of a deferred prosecution agreement, as the State did to the witness in <em>Johnson, </em>while it tried Dewitz. Here, the prosecutor explained that the State initially charged Ashley because she had rented the rooms at the motel, and she was there when the police arrived on the scene. The State dismissed the charge, however, after further investigation revealed that Ashley was not involved in setting up the meth lab.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>\u00b674 We stated in <em>Johnson </em>that Tt]he issue of whether a witness for the State is an accomplice is-unless such fact is undisputed-for the jury, based on proper instruction from the court.\u201d <em>Johnson, 276 </em>Mont. at 451, 918 P.2d at 295; <em>see also State v.

Dewitz maintains that when the evidence admitted through Ashley is removed from the analysis, there is not sufficient independent corroborative evidence to support a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"A46\">\u00b679 The State argues that Ashley was not an accomplice, thus her testimony did not need to be corroborated. The State contends however, that even if Ashley were considered an accomplice, there was sufficient evidence admitted at trial to corroborate her testimony. In fact, the State maintains that the testimony of Julia Menendez, Ashley\u2019s mother, regarding telephone conversations she had with both Dewitz and Ashley on the night of the fire was sufficient in itself to corroborate Ashley\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">\u00b680 We have expressly stated that it is not the defendant\u2019s burden to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>prove that he had no connection with the crime. The burden is on the prosecution to produce corroborating evidence which, of itself and without aid or direction from the accomplices\u2019 testimony, connects the defendant with the crime charged. <em>State v.

On the contrary, we conclude that the State did present sufficient evidence to corroborate Ashley\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">\u00b682 Menendez testified at trial that Dewitz accompanied Ashley on the trip to Oregon and that, before arriving in Missoula, Ashley phoned Menendez because Ashley and Dewitz were arguing about whether to stop in Missoula or continue on to Oregon. Menendez stated that Ashley did not want to stop in Missoula and that they discussed Ashley and Mia making the trip the rest of the way by bus. Menendez also testified that Ashley called her again later that evening to report that there was a fire in the room next to hers and that Dewitz had left Ashley and her baby in Missoula. Menendez further testified that she received a call from Dewitz at some point that same evening in which he was crying and hysterical. Dewitz told her that he had been burned \u201creal bad\u201d in a fire and that he left Ashley and the baby at the motel in Missoula and that he did not know what to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">\u00b683 In addition, the State introduced booking photos from Dewitz\u2019s arrest in Oregon shortly after the fire in Missoula. These photos showed Dewitz with burn marks on his face and arms. The State also presented Officer Brueckner\u2019s report of the investigation from that evening wherein she stated that witnesses at the motel on the night of the fire told her that shortly after the fire alarm sounded, they saw a black woman and a white man get into a Subaru and leave. One witness identified Ashley as the woman who left. All of this information corroborated Ashley\u2019s testimony that Dewitz was burned in the fire in room 330 and that she left the motel after the fire started with Dewitz.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">\u00b684 In addition, Detective Brodie testified that one of the reports from the fire department stated that a cat had been rescued from room 330. This information corroborated Ashley\u2019s testimony that prior to going to her own room at the motel, she carried Dewitz\u2019s cat inside the motel and placed it in Dewitz\u2019s room.</p>\n<p id=\"AIN\">\u00b685 Determinations of the credibility of witnesses and the weight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>of their testimony are within the exclusive province of the jury, and conflicting testimony does not render the evidence insufficient to support a guilty verdict. <em>State v. Borsberry, </em>2006 MT 126, \u00b6 20, 332 Mont. 271, 136 P.3d 993 (citing <em>State v. Shields, </em>2005 MT 249, \u00b6 19, 328 Mont. 509, 122 P.3d 421).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">\u00b686 In <em>State v. Black, </em>2003 MT 376, \u00b6 24, 319 Mont. 154, 82 P.3d 926, we set forth the following test for reviewing the sufficiency of corroborating evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">To be sufficient, corroborating evidence must show more than that a crime was in fact committed or the circumstances of its commission. It must raise more than a suspicion of the defendant\u2019s involvement in, or opportunity to commit, the crime charged. But corroborative evidence need not be sufficient, by itself, to support a defendant\u2019s conviction or even to make out a prima facie case against him. Corroborating evidence may be circumstantial and can come from the defendant or his witnesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Apr\">Moreover, \u201cCorroborating evidence is not insufficient just because it is circumstantial, disputed or even possibly consistent with innocent conduct; it is up to the jury to resolve factual questions.\u201d <em>Black, </em>\u00b6 24 (citing <em>State v. Kaczmarek, </em>243 Mont. 456, 460, 795 P.2d 439, 442 (1990)). Furthermore, Corroborating evidence need not extend to every fact to which the accomplice testifies.\u201d <em>Black, </em>\u00b6 24 (citing <em>State v. Ungaretti, </em>239 Mont. 314, 318, 779 P.2d 923, 925 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">\u00b687 Viewing the evidence in this case in the light most favorable to the prosecution, as we are constrained to do, <em>Cybulski, </em>\u00b6 42, a rational trier of fact could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Dewitz not only accompanied Ashley to Missoula, but that he was the individual that occupied the motel room containing the meth lab.</p>\n<p id=\"ARA\">\u00b688 Accordingly, we hold that the District Court correctly concluded that Ashley\u2019s testimony was corroborated by sufficient independent evidence to be submitted to the jury, and that the court did not err in denying Dewitz\u2019s motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">Issue 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">\u00b689 <em>Did the prosecutor commit misconduct in her closing argument to the jury?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">\u00b690 During the State\u2019s rebuttal closing arguments, the prosecutor made the following comments to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-11\">MS. MORGAN [for the State]:... We really had nothing to tie [Ashley] to that room with the exception of the fact that she said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>she entered it when they first arrived at the hotel. If we had had something to tie [Ashley] to that room, we probably would have charged her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-4\">[MS. MORGAN:] Furthermore, the defense makes issue over the presence of the plea agreement signed by [Ashley], and you guys will have a chance to review that. I would like to emphasize to you that plea agreements are not binding. They\u2019re simply something that we give to the court and say, \u201cHey, I\u2019m the prosecutor. I think that this is how this should be handled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">\u00b691 Dewitz argues that these statements were improper and prejudiced his right to a fair and impartial trial. The State argues on the other hand that Dewitz failed to show that the prosecutor\u2019s statements were improper, let alone prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">\u00b692 A defendant must demonstrate that the alleged prosecutorial misconduct violated his substantial rights in order for the Court to reverse a conviction. <em>State v. Soraich, </em>1999 MT 87, \u00b6 20, 294 Mont. 175, 979 P.2d 206 (citing <em>State v. Arlington, </em>265 Mont. 127, 150, 875 P.2d 307, 325 (1994)). We will not presume prejudice from claims of prosecutorial misconduct. <em>Soraich, </em>\u00b6 20 (citing <em>State v. Hildreth, </em>267 Mont. 423, 433, 884 P.2d 771, 778 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">\u00b693 In the instant case, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s comments were not so egregious as to deprive Dewitz of his right to a fair trial. In his closing argument, Dewitz\u2019s counsel directed the jury to the charges set forth in the Information filed against Ashley and the plea agreement she entered into with the State, suggesting that Ashley was not credible because of the plea agreement. Thus, counsel opened the door for the prosecutor\u2019s comments regarding the plea agreement, and, in rebuttal, the prosecutor appropriately explained why it did not consider Ashley to be an accomplice. <em>See State v. Maier, </em>1999 MT 51, \u00b6 93, 293 Mont. 403, 977 P.2d 298; <em>State v. Whitlow, </em>285 Mont. 430, 445, 949 P.2d 239, 249 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">\u00b694 Furthermore, as we stated previously in this Opinion, \u201c[w]e will not put a district court in error for an action in which the appealing party acquiesced or actively participated.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 32-33.</p>\n<p id=\"A5n\">\u00b695 Accordingly, we hold that the prosecutor did not commit misconduct in her rebuttal argument to the jury, and we affirm on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">\u00b696 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b227-11\">JUSTICES MORRIS, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b208-16\"> Dewitz filed what he termed a \u201cmotion for a directed verdict\u201d; however, there is no statutory authority for such a motion. The correct motion is a motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence, <em>see </em>\u00a746-16-403, MCA, and we will refer to Dewitz\u2019s motion in this case as such.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
