(collectively \u201cthe J.\u2019s\u201d) appeal the order of the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County, granting summary judgment in favor of Keith Shultz, M.D., Gary Mermel, M.D., and Anesthesia Partners of Montana (collectively \u201cthe AP defendants\u201d) on the J.\u2019s medical negligence claim. The J.\u2019s also appeal the District Court\u2019s decision to allow the AP defendants to proceed with a non-party defense under \u00a727-1-703, MCA. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">\u00b62 In June, 2005, the J.\u2019s entered Saint Vincent Hospital to deliver twins. At approximately 3:36, J.J. (the mother) requested a spinal epidural.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Dr. Shultz was paged, and administered the epidural. Before leaving J.J.\u2019s birthing suite, Dr. Shultz and Dr. Dahl (the J.\u2019s Obstetrician) agreed that Dahl would notify Shultz when J.J. entered Stage II of labor and moved to the operating room for delivery. (Because of the increased potential of complications requiring an emergency cesarean section (c-section) during twin deliveries, hospital protocol required that all twin deliveries take place in an operating room.) The accepted standard of care and AP policy required that an anesthesiologist be \u201cphysically present\u201d or \u201cavailable immediately in the presence of the mother\u201d at Stage II of labor for all twin births. Therefore, it is standard procedure that an anesthesiologist is paged when the laboring mother is moved to the operating room, whether or not the need for their services has arisen. Due to an internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>communication error between Dr. Dahl and the unit clerk, Dr. Shultz was not paged when J.J. was moved to the operating room at approximately 4:48.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">\u00b63 Dr. Shultz was the \u201cfirst call\u201d anesthesiologist on the day J.J. was in labor. As first call anesthesiologist, Shultz was responsible for directing the other on-call anesthesiologists to the various places they were needed. The hospital staff, including the labor and delivery ward, was provided the name of the first and second call anesthesiologist each day. It was standard protocol that hospital staff would page the first call anesthesiologist when an anesthesiologist was needed, and he would determine which anesthesiologist reported for that procedure. However, the second call anesthesiologist\u2019s pager number was provided to the labor and delivery staff in the event the first call anesthesiologist did not respond to the page. On the day in question, Dr. Reitz was the second call anesthesiologist, and Dr. Mermel was the fourth call anesthesiologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">\u00b64 When J.J. was moved to the operating room for delivery, Dr. Shultz was not attending a procedure. It was AP\u2019s policy that the fourth call doctor, here Dr. Mermel, had the option of having the first call doctor relieve him in whatever procedure he was attending. The fourth call doctor would then cover the labor and delivery ward. It was AP\u2019s policy that the anesthesiologist covering labor and delivery could leave the hospital, so long as he could return to the hospital within a half hour of being paged. Dr. Mermel therefore chose to have Dr. Shultz relieve him in a complex back surgery. Dr. Shultz relieved Dr. Mermel at approximately 5:10, and gave him the status of the patients in labor and delivery, including J.J. Several laboring mothers had epidurals administered, including J.J. Dr. Mermel left the hospital at approximately 5:25, without personally checking the status of the laboring mothers with epidurals administered. The second call doctor, Reitz, came out of surgery at approximately 5:06, and was in the doctors\u2019 lounge thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">\u00b65 J.J. uneventfully delivered the first twin at approximately 5:06. A few minutes later, the second twin\u2019s cord prolapsed. A prolapsed cord can become an obstetric emergency requiring a c-section. At approximately 5:18 (5:21), the labor and delivery staff placed a page to Dr. Shultz, to which he did not respond. Shultz maintains he did not receive the page. Although the labor and delivery staff was provided with the second call doctor\u2019s pager number in the event the first call doctor did not promptly respond to a page, they did not call Dr. Reitz when Dr. Shultz failed to respond to the page. Rather, the staff waited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>approximately seven minutes, and paged Dr. Shultz again, at 5:25 (5:28). Shultz did receive this page. There is varying testimony regarding whether the labor and delivery staff conveyed a sense of urgency to Shultz at that time-Shultz maintains he assumed the 5:28 page was simply to inform him that J.J. had moved into the operating room for delivery. Shultz contacted Mermel at approximately 5:26 (5:29), and they agreed Mermel would return to the hospital. At 5:30 (5:33), Dr. Dahl began an emergency c-section, without anesthesia present. At 5:31 (5:34), the labor and delivery staff paged Dr. Reitz, who had been in the doctors\u2019 lounge since he came out of a surgery at 5:06. He administered anesthesia to J.J. approximately two minutes after receiving the page. The second twin was born with severe brain damage, including cerebral palsy, related to prolonged hypoxia resulting from the prolapsed cord.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">\u00b66 The J.\u2019s filed suit against the hospital, Dr. Dahl and her practice group, and Dr.\u2019s Shultz and Mermel and their practice group, AP, alleging medical negligence. The AP defendants raised two relevant affirmative defenses: 1) that the J.\u2019s injury was due to acts or events unrelated to the care and treatment provided by AP; and 2) that AP has \u201crights and remedies under \u00a727-1-703, MCA, regarding persons who have settled with Plaintiffs.\u201d Approximately 10 months before trial, Dr. Dahl and her practice group offered to settle with the J.\u2019s for full insurance policy limits. The J.\u2019s accepted the offer on the eve of trial, and therefore withdrew their expert obstetrician. The District Court allowed AP to proceed with a non-party claim under \u00a727-1-703, MCA, over the J.\u2019s objection, ruling that it would allow the jury to consider Dr. Dahl\u2019s conduct when allocating fault among the parties. The court vacated the trial date, and re-opened discovery in order to allow AP to conduct additional discovery and designate experts to support their settled party defense. The J.\u2019s sought a writ of supervisory control from this Court, seeking reversal of the District Court\u2019s decision allowing AP to pursue a non-party defense. We declined to exercise supervisory control.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">\u00b67 Just prior to trial, upon AP\u2019s motion for reconsideration, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of AP, concluding the J.\u2019s expert anesthesiologist (Dr. Sheren) failed to establish that the anesthesiologists deviated from any applicable standard of medical care. The District Court also concluded Dr. Sheren\u2019s deposition testimony did not create issues of material fact sufficient to preclude summary judgment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">\u00b68 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>\u00b69 Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to the AP defendants?</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">\u00b610 Did the District Court err in its application of \u00a727-1-703, MCA, or in the alternative, is the statute unconstitutional as applied?</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">\u00b611 We review a district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling de novo. <em>Town and Country Foods, Inc., v. City of Bozeman, </em>2009 MT 72, \u00b6 12, 349 Mont. 453, 203 P.3d 1283. We review a district court\u2019s rulings on discovery motions and trial scheduling for abuse of discretion. <em>In re S.C., </em>2005 MT 241, \u00b6 16, 328 Mont. 476, 121 P.3d 552. To the extent the court\u2019s rulings are based on statutory interpretation, our review is de novo. <em>In re C.D.H., </em>2009 MT 8, \u00b6 21, 349 Mont. 1, 201 P.3d 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">\u00b612 Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to the AP defendants?</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">\u00b613 In order to survive a motion for summary judgment in a negligence action, the plaintiff must raise genuine issues of material fact with regard to a legal duty on the part of the defendant, breach of that duty, causation, and damages. <em>Butler v. Domin, </em>2000 MT 312, \u00b6 21, 302 Mont. 452, 15 P.3d 1189. In a cause of action alleging medical malpractice, the plaintiff must produce expert medical testimony establishing the applicable standard of care and departure from that standard. <em>Butler, </em>\u00b6 21. The J.\u2019s presented Dr. Sheren\u2019s expert medical opinion for the purpose of establishing that the AP defendants\u2019 deviation from seven different standards of care contributed to the J.\u2019s injuries. The District Court found that Dr. Sheren\u2019s deposition testimony failed to establish that the AP defendants breached a national standard of care, thus summary judgment was appropriate as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"AB8\">\u00b614 Assuming arguendo that Sheren\u2019s deposition testimony suffices to establish the various national standards of care, importantly, Dr. Sheren\u2019s opinion that the AP defendants deviated from the applicable standards was premised on the assumption that there was not an anesthesiologist \u2018immediately available\u201d to the J.\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>after J.J.\u2019s epidural was administered.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We therefore agree with the District Court that the undisputed facts show there was no breach of any standard of care for failure to have an anesthesiologist immediately available at all relevant times.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">\u00b615 Dr. Shultz was available from approximately 3:50, when he left J.J.\u2019s room after administering an epidural, until approximately 5:10, when he relieved Dr. Mermel in a complex back surgery. Dr. Mermel was available from 5:10 until 5:25, when he left the hospital. Dr. Reitz was in the doctors\u2019 lounge from approximately 5:06 until he responded to the emergency page from labor and delivery at approximately 5:31 (5:34). Therefore, it is undisputed that there was at least one anesthesiologist available from the time J.J. was administered an epidural through the birth of the second twin.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">\u00b616 The J.\u2019s argue that after Dr. Mermel left the hospital at 5:25, there was not an anesthesiologist \u2018immediately available.\u201d While the J.\u2019s acknowledge that Dr. Reitz was physically available, they contend that because he was not assigned to cover labor and delivery, his availability was fortuitous, and thus legally insignificant. However, the record contradicts the J.\u2019s characterization of Dr. Reitz\u2019s availability.</p>\n<p id=\"Aic\">\u00b617 The following critical facts regarding Reitz\u2019s availability remain undisputed. While anesthesia should have been paged at 4:48, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Mrs. J. entered Stage II of labor and was moved to the operating room, Dr. Shultz was not paged until 5:18 (5:21). He did not respond to this page. Standard practice dictated that because Dr. Shultz did not promptly respond to the page, the staff should have paged the second call anesthesiologist, Dr. Reitz. Had the hospital staff done so, Dr. Reitz would presumably have responded to that page within two minutes (as he did when he was finally paged). Therefore, he would have arrived at the operating room well before Dr. Dahl began the c-section on Mrs. J.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">\u00b618 Ultimately, between 4:48, when Mrs. J. was moved into the operating room, up until and through the delivery of the second twin, there were at least one, if not two anesthesiologists on hospital grounds and immediately available. Dr. Shultz was at the hospital and available until 5:10, and Dr. Mermel was at the hospital and available from 5:10 until 5:25. Given that Dr. Reitz was the designated second call anesthesiologist, and that it is undisputed that he was available as of 5:06, as a matter of law, the AP defendants provided \u201cimmediately available\u201d anesthesiology services to the J.\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">\u00b619 The J.\u2019s aptly argue that notwithstanding Reitz\u2019s availability, there remain disputed issues of fact regarding whether Shultz received the initial 5:18 (5:21) page; whether the hospital staff conveyed the urgency of the situation in the subsequent page; whether Shultz\u2019s response was appropriate given the urgency; and whether Dr. Mermel had appropriately updated information on the patients in labor and delivery; among others. However, those factual disputes are not material given that an anesthesiologist was immediately available at all relevant times.</p>\n<p id=\"APN3\">\u00b620 We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s determination that the J.\u2019s failed to produce expert testimony establishing the AP defendants\u2019 breach of any applicable standard of medical care. Because we affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, the J.\u2019s action against the AP defendants is no longer viable. Thus, we need not determine whether the District Court properly applied \u00a727-1-703, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">\u00b621 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b466-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WARNER, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b461-11\"> For the sake of clarity, all times referenced in this opinion correspond to the timing on the hospital clock, which is approximately three minutes slower than the pager log.

In twin birth cases, once an epidural has been administered, the standard of care requires immediate availability of an anesthesiologist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-8\">2.
