Prior to pleading guilty, Kenfield moved to suppress evidence, including statements obtained by officers subsequent to the warrantless entry of his residence. The District Court denied Kenfield\u2019s motion to suppress on the basis of the community caretaker doctrine. Kenfield appeals. We affirm the denial of the motion to suppress, but on different grounds than those articulated by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">\u00b62 We restate the issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err when it denied Kenfield\u2019s motion to suppress evidence obtained subsequent to the warrantless entry of his residence?</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">\u00b64 On November 23, 2005, a Liberty County dispatcher in Chester, Montana, received an anonymous tip from a caller who said that Kenfield was on his way to Inverness to purchase alcohol for three young people who were allegedly with Kenfield in a pickup truck. The caller identified Kenfield by his first and last name. The three young people were identified as a female by the name of \u201cK,\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a male by the name of Michael Morelli (Morelli), and another unknown male whose name the caller did not know. The dispatcher, through a caller identification system, determined that the call had been placed from Morelli\u2019s grandmother\u2019s residence. The dispatcher relayed the information to Deputy Steve Cameron who was on duty that evening. Deputy Cameron had lived in Liberty County for approximately 38 years and had been a deputy with the Liberty County Sheriffs Department for nine years.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">\u00b65 Upon receiving the information from the dispatcher, Deputy Cameron immediately suspected that the female identified by the anonymous caller was \u201cK.H.,\u201da troubled 15 year old resident of Liberty County. Deputy Cameron suspected K.H. because he knew of no other young person by the name of \u201cK\u201d who lived in Liberty County (population 2,100) or the town of Chester (population 920). Deputy Cameron also suspected K.H. because he had recently issued her a ticket for minor in possession of alcohol and knew her to hang around <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>with Morelli, another young man by the name of Tim Voise (Voise), and another young girl by the name of A.A. Deputy Cameron also knew that Kenfield was approximately 45 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">\u00b66 Deputy Cameron then proceeded from the sheriff s office to K.H.\u2019s grandmother\u2019s residence to inquire about the young girl\u2019s whereabouts. K.H.\u2019s grandmother told Deputy Cameron that K.H. was with her girlfriend \u201cA.A.\u201dDeputy Cameron then told KH.\u2019s grandmother about the report that K.H. was allegedly in a vehicle with Kenfield on the way to purchase alcohol in Inverness. After hearing who her granddaughter was possibly with and where she was possibly headed, K.H.\u2019s grandmother told Deputy Cameron to pick K.H. up. Deputy Cameron then confirmed that K.H. was not where she told her grandmother she would be that evening by going to A.A.\u2019s residence (and another female\u2019s residence suggested by A.A.\u2019s father).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">\u00b67 After leaving A.A.\u2019s residence, Deputy Cameron went back to the sheriff s office in Chester and told the dispatcher to notify Hill County that he needed to go to Inverness to look for K.H. Deputy Cameron knew that Kenfield lived in Inverness, which is located approximately 14 miles east of Chester because he knew that a colleague, Undersheriff Dave Riggin, had recently responded to a weapons complaint at Kenfield\u2019s residence. Deputy Cameron also knew that Kenfield had been investigated for stealing ladies\u2019 underwear from the local high school approximately 20 years earlier. Deputy Cameron received permission to enter Hill County but did not request assistance or backup at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">\u00b68 Before heading to Inverness, Deputy Cameron stopped to get directions to Kenfield\u2019s residence from Undersheriff Riggin. In addition to the directions, Undersheriff Riggin told Deputy Cameron that Kenfield had a penchant for hanging around with young people and that he had picked up another young girl from Kenfield\u2019s residence a couple of years earlier without incident. Deputy Cameron then proceeded towards Kenfield\u2019s residence in Inverness. While en route, Deputy Cameron learned that the repeater channel was down, which meant that he had no means of communicating with anyone once he was outside of Chester. Deputy Cameron did not stop to inform the dispatcher or otherwise notify anyone about the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">\u00b69 When Deputy Cameron arrived at Kenfield\u2019s trailer, he immediately recognized Voise\u2019s pickup truck and recorded the license plate numbers. Deputy Cameron also heard loud music and voices coming from the residence and could tell that the lights in the trailer were on, although the windows were heavily curtained. Deputy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>Cameron approached the trailer, opened the screen door, and noticed the Taint smell of marijuana.\u201d Deputy Cameron then knocked on the outside steel door and identified himself as the Sheriff s Department. At this point, the music went off, the lights went out, and Deputy Cameron heard the sound of running feet. After waiting approximately 8-10 seconds, Deputy Cameron entered the trailer, first through the screen and steel doors, and then through another interior door, which opened into the trailer\u2019s main living space.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">\u00b610 Upon entering the trailer, Officer Cameron was confronted with the \u201coverwhelming\u201d odor of marijuana and saw Voise sitting at the kitchen table. He then saw someone run down the hall into a back room and slam the door. Deputy Cameron opened the door and saw Kenfield standing in the room. Kenfield asked Deputy Cameron what he was doing in his house. Deputy Cameron explained that he was looking for K.H. In response, Kenfield said that K.H. was \u201cout there.\u201d After gathering everyone into the kitchen, Deputy Cameron noticed that Morelli was not present and left the group in the kitchen to look for him. When he returned to the kitchen, Deputy Cameron saw Kenfield washing his hands and noticed marijuana paraphernalia and residue on the kitchen stove next to Kenfield. Concerned that Kenfield was trying to destroy evidence, Deputy Cameron placed Kenfield in handcuffs and called dispatch from the trailer to request assistance. Deputy Cameron then gave Miranda warnings to Kenfield, K.H., Morelli, and Voise.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">\u00b611 After Hill County deputies arrived, they seized contraband on the stove and two open grocery bags filled with marijuana in the living room. The deputies asked Kenfield for permission to search his residence, but he refused. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was called and a search warrant for the premises was subsequently obtained. Ultimately officers seized a variety of marijuana related items, such as potting soil and marijuana leaves and stems. They also seized a video camera and three tapes from a cupboard, two rifles and a shotgun, a box of documents with telephone numbers, pornographic magazines, grow lights, and marijuana plants. The tapes evidently showed young girls, unaware that they were being filmed, using his bathroom in the trailer. The tapes also showed Kenfield supplying people with marijuana at his residence. Kenfield was charged by Information with the following offenses: Criminal Production or Manufacture of Dangerous Drugs; Criminal Distribution of Dangerous Drugs to a Minor (two counts); and Sexual Abuse of Children (three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>counts).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">\u00b612 On April 27, 2006, Kenfield filed a motion to suppress the evidence obtained by officers following the warrantless entry of his residence, including various statements Kenfield made to the officers and evidence obtained pursuant to the subsequently obtained search warrant. Kenfield claimed the entry into his residence was illegal and could not be justified by any exception to the warrant requirement. In response, the State claimed the entry was justified under the community caretaker doctrine and that Deputy Cameron had a reasonable belief that K.H. was in need of help or in peril, and that this suspicion justified the warrantless entry and search of Kenfield\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">\u00b613 Ahearing on Kenfield\u2019s motion to suppress was conducted on May 31,2006. During the hearing, Deputy Cameron stated that at the time he entered Kenfield\u2019s residence he was very concerned about K.H. and that he was sure K.H. was in the residence \u201cbecause of the vehicle and the people she\u2019s hanging out with.\u201d Deputy Cameron also said the following: T have no radio contact. I have no phone. I can\u2019t call for backup. I can\u2019t try to get a warrant. I can\u2019t try to do anything. I was concerned for [K.H.\u2019s] safe[t]y.\u201d The District Court concluded that the community caretaker doctrine justified the warrantless entry of Kenfield\u2019s residence and denied the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">\u00b614 Kenfield pleaded guilty to criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs (one count) and to criminal distribution of dangerous drugs to a minor (two counts). In exchange, the State agreed to dismiss the sexual abuse of children charges. Kenfield was sentenced to a total of 15 years to the Department of Corrections, with all but two years suspended. The sentences imposed were ordered to run concurrent with Kenfield\u2019s federal sentence, which stemmed from the same incident. Kenfield appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">\u00b615 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress to determine whether its findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its interpretation and application of the law is correct. <em>State v. Wheeler, </em>2006 MT 38, \u00b6 12, 331 Mont. 179, 134 P.3d 38. Findings of fact are clearly erroneous if they are not supported by substantial evidence, the court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>review of the record convinces us that a mistake has been made. <em>Wheeler, </em>\u00b6 12. Further, we review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law with respect to the application of the community caretaker doctrine to determine if they are correct. <em>Wheeler, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">\u00b616 Kenfield claims the District Court erred by denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained subsequent to the warrantless entry of his residence, including various statements he made to officers following the entry. Specifically, Kenfield argues that the District Court erred by applying the community caretaker doctrine to justify the warrantless intrusion. Instead, Kenfield claims that the District Court should have applied the test for the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement; a test which he also claims cannot be satisfied. Although the District Court relied on the community caretaker doctrine, we conclude that there were exigent circumstances and thus, we need not address the community caretaker doctrine. We will, however, affirm a court\u2019s decision if it reaches the correct result, albeit for the wrong reason. <em>See State v. Dickinson, </em>2008 MT 159, \u00b6 29, 343 Mont. 301, 184 P.3d 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">\u00b617 The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 11 of the Montana Constitution protect citizens from unreasonable searches and seizures. It is well-settled that warrantless searches and seizures conducted inside a home are <em>per se </em>unreasonable, subject to a few carefully drawn exceptions. <em>State v. Wakeford, </em>1998 MT 16, \u00b6 21, 287 Mont. 220, 953 P.2d 1065. The exigent circumstances exception is a recognized exception to the warrant requirement and provides that a \u201cwarrantless entry by law enforcement officials may be legal when there is a compelling need for official action and no time to secure a warrant.\u201d <em>Wakeford, </em>\u00b6 23 (citing <em>Michigan v. Tyler, </em>436 U.S. 499, 509, 98 S. Ct. 1942, 1949 (1978). In order to establish the exigent circumstances exception, the state must demonstrate the existence of both probable cause and exigent circumstances. <em>Wakeford, </em>\u00b6 22. Accordingly, we first turn to a discussion of whether probable cause has been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">\u00b618 Probable cause exists when \u201cthe facts and circumstances within the officer\u2019s personal knowledge, or imparted to the officer by a reliable source, are sufficient to warrant a reasonable person to believe that the suspect has committed an offense.\u201d <em>Wakeford, </em>\u00b6 22. Further, \u201cprobable cause is evaluated in the light of a police officer\u2019s knowledge, and all the relevant circumstances.\u201d <em>State v. Van Dort, </em>2003 MT 104, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>\u00b6 19, 315 Mont. 303, 68 P.3d 728.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">\u00b619 Kenfield claims that Deputy Cameron did not have \u201cprobable cause to believe any crime, let alone a sexual offense, had occurred or was occurring.\u201d In support of his argument, Kenfield cites testimony from Deputy Cameron provided at the hearing on the motion to suppress in which he stated that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know what was going on\u201d and that he could not \u201cdescribe everything involved in it.\u201d Kenfield claims that no reasonable person would believe that he was sexually assaulting K.H. or holding her against her will on the basis of the evidence available to Deputy Cameron. Kenfield also notes that the faint smell of marijuana noticed by Deputy Cameron prior to the entry did not, in and of itself, support a finding of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"A5R\">\u00b620 Kenfield ignores, however, that the odor of marijuana coupled with additional facts and circumstances may establish probable cause. <em>See State v. Morse, </em>2006 MT 54, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18, 331 Mont. 300, 132 P.3d 528 (concluding that other facts in addition to the odor of marijuana contributes to a determination of probable cause). Here, it is undisputed that Deputy Cameron noticed the odor of marijuana upon approaching the trailer. Further, after hearing an officer announce his presence, the occupants of the trailer did not come to the door or otherwise attempt to communicate with Deputy Cameron. Instead, the occupants immediately turned off the music and lights and attempted to evade law enforcement. These facts, when combined with the additional evidence Deputy Cameron possessed prior to the entry, including that Kenfield was headed to Inverness to purchase alcohol for an underage minor, were sufficient for the officer to form a reasonable belief that Kenfield had committed or was committing an offense. (See \u00a745-5-623(b), MCA, (stating that it is unlawful to sell or give intoxicating substances to a child under the age of majority); see also \u00a745-5-623(c), MCA, (stating that it is unlawful for a person to sell or give an alcoholic beverage to a person under the age of 21).) Based on the foregoing, we conclude that Deputy Cameron had probable cause to believe that Kenfield had committed an offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">\u00b621 This case is distinguishable from our decision in <em>State v. McBride, </em>1999 MT 127, 294 Mont. 461, 982 P.2d 453, wherein we concluded that probable cause and thus, the exigent circumstances exception, could not be established. In <em>McBride, </em>a father of a sixteen-year-old runaway, A.H., reported to police that he had received a phone call from A.H. and that the call at been placed from the defendant\u2019s residence. A.H.\u2019s father also told police that A.H. was in violation of her probation and asked the officers to respond to the location. When officers arrived at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>the defendant\u2019s residence, there were no signs of ongoing criminal activity. Further, when the officers knocked on the door, no one responded. After a second knock, which caused the door to open slightly, the defendant attempted to shut the door. The officer pushed back on the door and the door swung open. With the door open, the officer could see the defendant, who appeared to be under the age of 21, holding a beer. The defendant then refused the officer\u2019s request to enter and talk. Nevertheless, the officer entered the residence and discovered A.H. sitting in the living room. The defendant was cited for minor in possession of alcohol and was arrested on an outstanding warrant. Officers also subsequently discovered methamphetamine in the defendant\u2019s pocket. The defendant moved to suppress the evidence seized and statements he made to officers following the entry. The district court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">\u00b622 In <em>McBride, </em>we concluded that the facts and circumstances were not sufficient to establish probable cause. There was no evidence at the time of the entry that the defendant had committed an offense or that a crime was being committed at the residence. We also noted that the girl\u2019s father had no reason to believe that the defendant (or any one else in the residence) \u2018had caused his daughter to be absent from home.\u201d <em>McBride, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">\u00b623 Here, in contrast, Deputy Cameron was aware of facts and circumstances that were sufficient for an experienced officer to believe that a crime had been committed or was occurring. Specifically, Deputy Cameron noticed the smell of drugs upon approaching the trailer. He was also confronted with the sound of running feet and the lights and music going off after he knocked on the door and announced his presence. In addition, Deputy Cameron had received a report that a young girl (who he believed to be K.H.) was out with at least three older men and that they planned to purchase alcohol. He also knew that Kenfield, one of the men specifically mentioned in the report, was at least 30 years older than K.H. and had a reputation for hanging out with people much younger than he, including young girls. Additionally, Deputy Cameron knew that officers had previously responded to a weapons complaint at Kenfield\u2019s residence. These facts, taken together, are much more substantive and compelling than those in <em>McBride, </em>where the officers did not know the defendant or any of the people involved, where there was no factual, observable evidence that a crime had been committed, and where there was no attempt by the occupants to flee the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">\u00b624 We turn next to a discussion of whether exigent circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>were present. Exigent circumstances are \u201cthose circumstances that would cause a reasonable person to believe that entry (or other relevant prompt action) was necessary to prevent physical harm to the officers or other persons, the destruction of relevant evidence, the escape of the suspect, or some other consequence improperly frustrating legitimate law enforcement efforts.\u201d <em>Wakeford, </em>\u00b6 24. We have stated that \u201cexigent circumstances for conducting a warrantless search exist, \u2018where it is not practicable to secure a <em>warrant.\u2019\u201d State v. Gomez, </em>2007 MT 111, \u00b6 27, 337 Mont. 219, 1158 P.3d 442 (citing <em>State v. Bassett, </em>1999 MT 109, \u00b6 47, 294 Mont. 327, 982 P.2d 410. We have also stated that the state \u2018bears the heavy burden of showing the existence of exigent circumstances.\u201d <em>Wakeford, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">\u00b625 Kenfield argues that Deputy Cameron could not have believed that K.H. was in need of immediate assistance given that he did not race to Kenfield\u2019s residence with his lights on, nor did he stop to request backup when he realized that his radio was not working or stop to call \u2018his dispatcher or the local authorities.\u201dKenfield also notes that Deputy Cameron stopped to write down the license plates numbers of the vehicles parked in front of the trailer when he arrived, apparently insinuating that Deputy Cameron was not sufficiently concerned about KH.\u2019s well-being to justify the warrantless intrusion.</p>\n<p id=\"ARG\">\u00b626 We do not agree. Given the remote location of Inverness, the time of the incident, the failure of the communication channel, and the response to the knock and announce, it was not practicable for Deputy Cameron to secure a warrant prior to the entry of Kenfield\u2019s residence. At the hearing on the motion to suppress, Deputy Cameron expressed his concern about the circumstances; he said, \u2018I have no radio contact. I have no phone. I can\u2019t call for backup. I can\u2019t try to get a warrant. I can\u2019t try to do anything. I was concerned for [KH.\u2019s] safe[t]y.\u201d Inverness is an isolated community with no local police presence, and the failure of the communication channel left Deputy Cameron in a position where he had to decide whether to proceed into the residence or risk delaying entry and possibly exposing K.H. to further harm. Deputy Cameron also had evidence that drugs were being used in the residence. Leaving the scene to find assistance would have given the occupants an opportunity to destroy any drug related evidence. Based on the response to his knock on the door, Deputy Cameron specifically stated that he believed the occupants of the residence were attempting to hide marijuana when they reacted by turning off the music and lights and ran instead of coming to the door. As noted above, the belief that relevant evidence is being destroyed supports the existence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>exigent circumstances. These circumstances in conjunction with all of the information Deputy Cameron possessed about K.H. and Kenfield prior to the entry would cause a reasonable person to believe that an immediate entry of Kenfield\u2019s residence was necessary. Accordingly, we conclude that exigent circumstances were present. Because probable cause and exigent circumstances existed, we also conclude that Deputy Cameron\u2019s entry into Kenfield\u2019s residence was justified under the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement. Finally, since Deputy Cameron was lawfully in the residence pursuant to the exigent circumstances exception, his observation of the marijuana residue and paraphernalia was also lawful and admissible under the plain view doctrine, which \u201callows peace officers, under certain circumstances, to seize evidence in plain view without a warrant.\u201d <em>State v. Lewis, </em>2007 MT 295, \u00b6 22, 340 Mont. 10, 171 P.3d 731.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">\u00b627 For these reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s order denying Kenfield\u2019s motion to suppress evidence obtained by officers following the warrantless entry of his residence.</p>\n<judges id=\"b442-6\">JUSTICES COTTER, RICE, WARNER, MORRIS and NELSON and DISTRICT COURT JUDGE NEWMAN, sitting for CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b434-9\"> KH.\u2019s name is abbreviated for purposes of this Opinion pursuant to this Court\u2019s privacy rules.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b437-9\"> Kenfield was also convicted and sentenced in federal court for receipt and possession of child pornography under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a72252A(a)(2), (a)(5)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
