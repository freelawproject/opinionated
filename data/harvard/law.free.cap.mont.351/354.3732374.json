Keri pumped the gas while her husband and son waited in the car. Clawson and an acquaintance were also at the store buying beer. Clawson\u2019s vehicle was parked parallel to the Perez vehicle, oriented in the same direction. While Keri Perez was pumping the gas, she heard Clawson confront her husband with an obscenity, asking what he was looking at. Richard Perez was sitting in his car with the window up. Clawson continued confronting Richard who got out of his car, telling Clawson that he was only looking at Clawson\u2019s black lab dog and that Clawson should leave. Clawson was confrontational and belligerent and, according to Keri, was flailing his arms and coming toward the passenger door of their car. Her first impression was that Clawson was intoxicated. Richard could smell alcohol on Clawson\u2019s breath and saw him stumble. Keri was startled and afraid of Clawson\u2019s behavior, and Richard was concerned that Keri\u2019s son was being frightened. Richard got back into their car and told Keri that Clawson was \u201creally drunk and he shouldn\u2019t be driving\u201d and that they should call the cops. Clawson left driving his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">\u00b65 Keri used her cell phone to call the Billings Police Department dispatch to report a possible drunk driver. She told the dispatcher about the incident, that Clawson started yelling at her husband for looking at the dog, and that she thought Clawson was intoxicated. Keri described Clawson\u2019s vehicle as a maroon Chevy Blazer or Ford Explorer, and provided the number of the Iowa license plate. Keri described Clawson in detail, along with the fact that he was traveling with a passenger and had a black lab in the vehicle. She gave the street location of the incident and the direction of Clawson\u2019s travel when he left. She provided dispatch with her full name, address, and home phone and cell phone numbers. She stated that she would file a complaint if Clawson were located.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">\u00b66 Dispatch broadcast to officers that there was a possible DUI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>driver in the Heights area and relayed Keri\u2019s description of Clawson and his vehicle. Billings Police officers were dispatched to the convenience store to make contact with Keri and Richard Perez. Chris Romero was a deputy with the Yellowstone County Sheriffs Department and a 12-year law enforcement veteran who had made hundreds of DUI arrests. He heard the information from dispatch of an altercation at a gas station and a request that officers attempt to locate Clawson\u2019s vehicle. He heard that a witness had called in a report of the incident, that the suspect involved had driven off, and that the witness believed that the driver was intoxicated. Romero received a description of the vehicle as a maroon SUV with Iowa plates, a male driver and a black lab. Romero soon saw Clawson\u2019s vehicle on Five Mile Road, a rural gravel road in the area described by dispatch. Clawson\u2019s vehicle was stopped in the travel lane with the door open. The black lab was running down the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">\u00b67 When Romero arrived at Clawson\u2019s vehicle, Clawson retrieved the dog and started to drive away. Romero turned around, stopped the vehicle, talked to Clawson, and asked for his driver\u2019s license. Romero observed that Clawson\u2019s speech was slurred, his eyes were bloodshot and that his breath smelled of alcohol. Clawson stated that he had consumed \u201ca beer\u201d and Romero proceeded to investigate to determine whether Clawson was able to drive safely. During a consensual pat-down search Romero found marijuana and a pipe in Clawson\u2019s pockets. Romero gave Clawson a warning ticket for parking on the traveled way of the road. Clawson failed initial field sobriety tests conducted at the scene, as well as others conducted later at the station.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">\u00b68 Clawson was charged with DUI and possession of drugs and paraphernalia. Clawson moved to dismiss the charges on the ground that the evidence obtained at the scene of the stop should be suppressed because Romero lacked particularized suspicion to stop and conduct an investigation. The District Court held an evidentiary hearing on the motion to dismiss and concluded that Romero had sufficient information to stop Clawson and investigate. Clawson was subsequently convicted of all three offenses after a jury trial and was sentenced. He appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">\u00b69 We review denial of a motion to suppress evidence to determine whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether the court correctly applied those findings as a matter of law. <em>State v. Elison, </em>2000 MT 288, \u00b6 12, 302 Mont. 228, 14 P.3d 456. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>review a finding that an officer had particularized suspicion to conduct an investigatory stop to determine whether the finding was clearly erroneous. <em>State v. Farabee, </em>2000 MT 265, \u00b6 11, 302 Mont. 29, 22 P.3d 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">\u00b610 Both the United States and Montana Constitutions require that searches and seizures be reasonable. U.S. Const, amend. IV; Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a711. These protections apply to investigative stops. <em>State v. Gopher, </em>193 Mont. 189, 194, 631 P.2d 293, 296 (1981). An investigative stop is valid if the officer possessed a particularized suspicion that the subject has committed or is about to commit an offense. Section 46-5-401(1), MCA. Particularized suspicion requires a showing of objective data from which an officer can make certain inferences, and a resulting suspicion that the subject is or has been engaged in wrongdoing. <em>Elison, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"AsN\">\u00b611</p>\n<p id=\"A_o\">Whether an investigative stop is founded upon particularized suspicion is a question of fact that must be evaluated under the totality of the circumstances. When evaluating the totality of the circumstances a court considers the quantity or content of the information available to the officer and the quality or degree of reliability of that information. <em>Elison, </em>\u00b6 16. An arresting officer may rely on information conveyed by a reliable third party to form particularized suspicion sufficient to justify an investigative stop. <em>State v. Pratt, </em>286 Mont. 156, 162, 951 P.2d 37, 41 (1997). InPraii this Court recognized that \u201c[c]itizen informants can provide useful information and play an important role in law enforcement.\u201d <em>Pratt, </em>286 Mont. at 164, 951 P.2d at 42. We adopted three factors to use to evaluate the reliability of the report of a citizen informer in the context of whether the totality of the circumstances warranted an investigative stop: (1) whether the informant identified herself to the authorities; (2) whether the informant\u2019s report is based on personal observation; and (3) whether the officer\u2019s observations corroborate the informant\u2019s information. <em>Pratt, </em>286 Mont. at 164-65, 951 P.2d at 42-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">\u00b612 All information that the citizen informant gives to the dispatcher is relevant when evaluating the justification for an investigative stop, whether or not it is specifically relayed to the officer in the field. <em>State v. Hall, </em>2004 MT 106, \u00b6 15, 321 Mont. 78, 88 P.3d 1273. An officer in the field does not have to personally assess the reliability of the tip given to dispatch. <em>Hall, </em>\u00b6 11. Effective law enforcement often depends upon officers acting on the directions and information transmitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>swiftly from one to another and \u201cofficers cannot be expected to cross-examine their fellow officers about the foundation for the transmitted information.\u201d <em>Hall, </em>\u00b6 11, quoting, <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>536 F.2d 1298, 1299 (9th Cir. 1976). In the present case, the District Court found that while Clawson\u2019s stopping on the roadway likely did not provide sufficient particularized suspicion, Romero\u2019s investigative stop was justified by the information supplied by Keri Perez.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">\u00b613 Considering the <em>Pratt </em>factors, first it is clear that Perez adequately identified herself. She provided her name, her address, her home phone number, her cell phone number, and the location she was calling from. Second, the information was based upon her personal observations and experience. She saw and heard the unprovoked and belligerent confrontation that Clawson initiated with her husband a short distance from where she was standing pumping gas. She heard her husband\u2019s contemporaneous conclusion that Clawson was intoxicated, based upon his face-to-face interaction with Clawson. She observed and relayed details about Clawson\u2019s appearance, his vehicle type, make, color and license. She observed and relayed Clawson\u2019s direction of travel when he left. Third, the officer corroborated Keri\u2019s information. Within five to ten minutes of hearing the information over his radio, Romero found Clawson\u2019s vehicle in the area indicated by dispatch, based upon information supplied by Perez. The description of a maroon SUV with Iowa plates and a dog, based upon information supplied by Perez, matched what Romero found when he located Clawson. Clawson fit the physical description given by Perez. Clearly the three-prong test of Pratt has been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"ARrA\">\u00b6 14 Romero saw Clawson\u2019s vehicle stopped in the travel lane of the road with the door open, a traffic offense for which Romero issued a warning ticket. Even though Romero did not observe other DUI-related behavior by Clawson prior to initiating his investigative stop, direct observation of the specific illegal activity is not required as long as other salient facts are corroborated.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">In applying the Pratt test, it is important to remember that the standard of \u201cparticularized suspicion does not require that the law enforcement officer be certain that an offense has been committed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">State <em>v. Roberts, </em>1999 MT 59, \u00b6 26, 293 Mont. 476, 977 P.2d 974.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">The District Court observed in the present case that neither the informant nor the investigating officer can normally know whether the subject driver is intoxicated until \u201ctests have been done [or] field sobriety maneuvers have been done.\u201d That is usually the point of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>investigative stop: to allow the officer to make a determination as to whether further investigation is warranted. A \u201ctrained and experienced law enforcement officer is entitled to draw inferences and make deductions that might well elude a layperson in determining whether a particular stop is justified.\u201d <em>Roberts, </em>\u00b6 26. As the District Court explained, the officer gets information about \u201cthe layman\u2019s observations\u201d and attempts to verify them if the officer happens to find the subject vehicle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-4\">And if the officer has no further probable cause to believe that the person is intoxicated, nothing further happens with all of that. But if the officer further corroborates that the person that is stopped seems to be under the influence of alcohol, then it proceeds on, as it did in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Under the totality of the circumstances of this case, we find that the stop was justified and that the District Court\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous. We affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b383-6\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER, NELSON, WARNER, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
