He asserted in his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion that he was eligible for a sentence reduction based upon Amendments 591 and 599 to the Sentencing Guidelines. Issac also has moved for the appointment of counsel on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-16\">We first note Issac\u2019s argument that the district court\u2019s order included language that was irrelevant to the arguments he raised in his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Regardless of this surplus language, for the reasons discussed below, we conclude that the district court correctly found that Issac was not entitled to relief because his original sentence computations were not altered by Amendment 591 or 599.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-17\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence in certain cases where the sentencing range has been subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a). Section 3582(c)(2) applies only to retroactive guidelines amendments, as set forth in the guidelines policy statement. <em>See </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(a). If an amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range,\u201d a sentence reduction is not consistent with \u00a7 1B1.10 and is not authorized by \u00a7 3582(c)(2). \u00a7 lB1.10(a); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2). The Government concedes that Amendment 591 and 599 apply retroactively. <em>See also </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-20\">Issac argued that, in light of Amendment 591, the district court applied the incorrect guideline section to his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959 convictions. Amendment 591 emphasizes that, with certain exceptions not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>relevant here, a sentencing court \u201cmust apply the offense guideline referenced in the Statutory Index for the statute of conviction.\u201d U.S.S.G.App. C, Amendment 591 (Nov.2000) (Reason for Amendment, \u00b6 3). The Statutory Index provides that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2E1.3 applies to convictions under \u00a7 1959. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. A (Statutory Index). Because the PSR applied \u00a7 2E1.3 to Issac\u2019s \u00a7 1959 convictions, Issac has not shown that Amendment 591 would have the effect of lowering his applicable guidelines range. <em>See </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(a). We note that Issac apparently has misunderstood the PSR\u2019s subsequent application of the offense level from U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1 for his underlying offenses, which was higher; however, application of the higher offense level for the underlying offenses is required by \u00a7 2E1.3 itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Issac also argues that, in light of Amendment 599 and his convictions for possession of a firearm under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), the district court should not have applied various specific offense characteristics found in \u00a7 2B3.1, such as enhancements for making an express threat of death, for causing serious bodily injury, and for causing a permanent or life-threatening injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F), (b)(3)(B), and (b)(3)(C). Because the facts supporting each of these enhancements involved the use of a firearm, Issac argues that application of these enhancements and his conviction for the firearm offense constituted impermissible \u201cdouble-counting.\u201d At the time of Issac\u2019s sentencing, the Guidelines provided that if sentences were to be imposed for both a violation of \u00a7 924(c) and for an underlying offense, any specific offense characteristics for the possession, use, or discharge of a firearm should not be applied to the underlying offense. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2K2.4, comment, (n.2) (1991). Although Amendment 599 altered and clarified the text of the relevant Application Note, it did not change the general rule against applying the firearms enhancements to the underlying offense where the defendant also was convicted under \u00a7 924(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amendment 599 (Nov.2000). Because Amendment 599 does not have the effect of lowering Issac\u2019s applicable guideline range, a sentence reduction is not consistent with \u00a7 IB.10 and is not authorized by \u00a7 3582(c)(2). \u00a7 lB1.10(a); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">Although we have not held that a defendant is entitled to counsel when appealing a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, we have found that we have the discretion to appoint counsel in such proceedings \u201cin the interest of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>542 F.3d 1045, 1052 (5th Cir.2008). Because we have concluded that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Issac\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, we deny his motion for appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and its alternative motion for an extension of time is DENIED. Issac\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel also is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b82-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
