The district court sentenced him under \u00a7 1326(b)(2), at the bottom of the guideline range, to 37 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-26\">Galindo-Yanes argues that the court treated the range as presumptively reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>able when it directed defense counsel to be more specific in objecting to the range. Because Galindo-Yanes failed to object on that basis, we review this claim for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, 564 F.3d 357, 360 </em>(5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). Galindo cannot show error, plain or otherwise, because the district court merely sought to comply with the reasoning in <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356-57, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Galindo-Yanes also contends, as he did in the district court, that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because his prior crimes of violence that were used to support the 16-level enhancement are so old. \u201c[A] sentence within a properly calculated Guideline range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Although the prior crimes were too old to receive criminal history points, Galindo-Yanes does not dispute that he had three prior convictions for crimes of violence \u2014 convictions for aggravated assault and aggravated battery in 1988 and a 1992 conviction for taking indecent liberties with a minor child. Galindo-Yanes illegally reentered the United States in January 2009, only eight months after his April 2008 deportation, and he admitted using cocaine from 2000 to 2007. Thus, the totality of the circumstances shows that the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying a downward variance and sentencing within the guidelines range. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>see also Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b183-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
