We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and review the District Court\u2019s order for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Redmond v. Gill, </em>352 F.3d 801, 803 (3d Cir.2003).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-22\">On March 3, 2010, Bricker filed a complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 in the United States District Court for the Mid-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>die District of Pennsylvania, asserting claims against various officials and employees of the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections. Bricker\u2019s complaint was accompanied by a deficient <em>in forma pauper-is </em>motion. As a result, an Administrative Order was issued on March 9, 2010 advising Bricker to remit the appropriate filing fee or a \u201cproperly completed application to proceed <em>informa pauperis </em>and an authorization form\u201d within 30 days. Bricker was further warned that his failure to comply would result in the action being dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">While Bricker submitted an <em>in forma pauperis </em>motion and authorization form within the 30 day deadline, his forms were anything but \u201cproperly completed.\u201d Bricker altered the <em>informa pauperis </em>motion and authorization form to indicate that it was signed \u201cunder duress\u201d and to note his refusal to authorize prison officials to deduct the $350.00 filing fee from his prison account. Bricker further noted his disagreement with the filing fee provisions of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d) and the District Court\u2019s Administrative Order in the form of an Objection, wherein he noted, <em>inter alia, </em>that the PLRA \u201ccannot be force[d] on [him].... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Given Bricker\u2019s blatant refusal to comply with the Administrative Order, the District Court entered an order on April 14, 2010 dismissing his civil action without prejudice and directing the Clerk to close his case file. A timely appeal to this Court followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">As directed by the case opening letter from this Court\u2019s Clerk\u2019s Office, Bricker sought leave to proceed <em>informa pauperis </em>on appeal. However, as in the District Court, Bricker asserted that his <em>in forma pauperis </em>motion was signed \u201cunder duress\u201d and that the fee assessment was \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d Additionally, Bricker failed to submit a certified six month prison account statement (\u201cPAS\u201d). In a Clerk\u2019s Order issued on June 1, 2010, Bricker was advised that his <em>in forma pauperis </em>motion would be held in abeyance pending submission of the certified account statement. Much like his actions in the District Court, Bricker submitted the requested document but refused to have the PAS signed by an authorized officer at SCI-Houtzdale. According to appellant, \u201c[t]hese officers] had and has no Constitutional rights to make statements under oath, because they are in a job in violation of the Constitution.\u201d <em>See </em>PAS at 1. Bricker further submitted an \u201cObjection\u201d to the Clerk\u2019s non-compliance order.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">The Clerk nevertheless granted Bricker <em>in forma pauperis </em>status by Order dated June 16, 2010. In that Order, the Clerk advised Bricker of his obligation to pay the full appellate filing and docketing fees, directed the Warden to make the appropriate assessment, and notified appellant that the appeal would be submitted to the Court for a determination under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) or possible summary action under Third Circuit L.A.R. 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6. As would be expected of Bricker at this point, he filed a response objecting to the Clerk\u2019s assessment order. By Clerk\u2019s Order, Bricker\u2019s objection was thereafter referred to the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-10\">We will overrule Bricker\u2019s objections to the Clerk\u2019s Orders and deny his challenge to the assessment of the appellate filing and docketing fees. Despite Bricker\u2019s displeasure with the current state of the law, \u201cthe PLRA plainly requires a prisoner to pay the fees if he \u2018brings a civil action or files an appeal....\u2019\u201d <em>Porter v. Dept. of Treasury, </em>564 F.3d 176, 180 (3d Cir.2009), <em>citing </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b)(1). A prisoner\u2019s legal obligation to pay such fees is incurred by the filing of the notice of appeal <em>in forma pauperis. See </em>\u00a7 1915(b)(1); <em>see also Hall v. Stone, </em>170 F.3d 706, 707 (7th Cir.1999), <em>quoting Newlin v. Helman, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>123 F.3d 429, 436 (7th Cir.1997) (\u201cWhether [the prisoner] authorized the prison to disburse the money is neither here nor there. How much a prisoner owes, and how it will be collected, is determined entirely by the statute and is outside the prisoner\u2019s (and the prison\u2019s) control once the prisoner files the complaint or notice of appeal.\u201d). Moreover, as we stated in <em>Porter, </em>564 F.3d at 180, \u201cwe have no authority to waive his fees under the PLRA.\u201d <em>In forma pauperis </em>status under the PLRA, \u201cdoes not result in a waiver of the fees \u2014 it merely allows the inmate to pay the fees in installments when there are sufficient funds in his prison account.\u201d <em>Id., citing </em>\u00a7 1915(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">Given the foregoing, we must likewise conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in administratively terminating Bricker\u2019s civil action and ordering that the Clerk close his case. Given Bricker\u2019s actions, we do not hesitate to conclude that his conduct amounts to a willful failure to respond to the order issued by the District Court, and \u201cevidences an intent to flout the District Court\u2019s instructions\u201d on proper compliance with the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915. <em>Redmond v. Gill, </em>352 F.3d at 803.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Accordingly, we will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court as no substantial question is presented by this appeal. See Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6. Bricker\u2019s document titled \u201cApplication Motion for a Certificate of Appealability\u201d is denied.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b830-23\">. We view the District Court's order as a sanction for Bricker's failure to obey a court order or for failure <em>to </em>diligently prosecute, and thus as one appealable under \u00a7 1291. Moreover, it is clear from the record on appeal that Bricker insists on standing on his <em>in forma pauperis </em>documents as filed. <em>See Borelli v. City of Reading, </em>532 F.2d 950, 951 (3d Cir.1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b832-7\">. We note for appellant\u2019s information that a certificate of appealability is required where an appeal has been filed from the final order of the District Court denying a petition for writ of habeas corpus filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 or \u00a7 2254, and in a case in which \"the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a State court.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. The underlying action was filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, not 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 or \u00a7 2254, and thus a motion for a certificate of appealability is not an appropriate one to file in the instant appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
