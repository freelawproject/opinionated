Ostrander filed a brief arguing that the appeal lacks merit, in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Izard did not submit a reply brief. After independent review of the record, we agree that the appeal lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">Izard, who had served a custodial term for three bank robberies, pleaded guilty to several violations of the terms of his supervised release. This was the second time Izard was brought before the district court for violating his supervised release. After the first violation, the court sentenced him to another term of supervised release. This time, however, the court revoked the supervised release and sentenced Izard to 18 months imprisonment. We review this decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>26 F.3d 110, 112 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-11\">In Ostrander\u2019s brief, he identifies two potential, but ultimately frivolous, issues for appeal. First, Ostrander indicates that Izard could argue that he did not admit his guilt to the supervised release violation. However, this argument cannot carry the day. At his final revocation hearing, the court informed Izard of the allegations as well as his procedural rights, and Izard said he understood. The court told Izard his advisory guideline range was 21 to 27 months imprisonment, but that the statutory maximum was 24 months. Izard then admitted to the facts and circumstances of his violations. We conclude that the colloquy at the revocation hearing adequately established that Izard voluntarily acknowledged his guilt to the supervised release violations and that he understood the nature of the charges as well as the consequences of admitting his guilt to those charges. <em>See United States v. Monroe, </em>353 F.3d 1346, 1354 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-12\">The second issue Ostrander identifies is whether Izard\u2019s sentence was unreasonable. We review a sentence upon revocation of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378-79 (11th Cir.2010). Although the government recommended a term of 18 months imprisonment in exchange for Izard\u2019s guilty plea, Izard asked for leniency by explaining how he was trying to get his life back on track. Izard\u2019s attorney recommended a sentence of a year and a day, but agreed with the government that imprisonment was more likely to change Izard\u2019s behavior than another term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-13\">We see no procedural defect in Izard\u2019s sentence. <em>See id. </em>The district court properly calculated the guideline range, told Izard the guidelines were not mandatory, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>and considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8553(a) factors, noting specifically its obligation to impose a sentence that was sufficient but not greater than necessary. The court considered Izard\u2019s criminal history, his problematic conduct while on supervised release, and the fact that Izard did not avail himself of the opportunity he was given for alcohol counseling. The court need not explicitly address each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, so long as the record indicates that the court considered the facts and circumstances relevant under \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Garey, </em>546 F.3d 1359, 1363 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Izard\u2019s sentence was also substantively reasonable. <em>See Tome, </em>611 F.3d at 1379. Given that this was Izard\u2019s second time to be brought before the court on a supervised release violation, and the unanimity of opinion that a third try for success on supervised release would be pointless, the district court concluded that Izard needed to be sentenced to a custodial term. The 18 month sentence \u2014 below the guideline range for his violation \u2014 was particularly appropriate in light of Izard\u2019s repeated violation of his supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Our independent review of the record reveals no arguable issues of merit. Os-trander\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and Izard\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
