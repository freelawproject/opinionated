The district court denied Dedrick\u2019s IFP motion because he failed to present a good faith, nonfrivolous, arguable issue for appeal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>By moving for leave to proceed IFP on appeal, Dedrick is challenging the district court\u2019s determination. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">A review of this court\u2019s files shows that this appeal represents the latest in more than two dozen appeals involving Dedrick\u2019s sentence and confinement. Pertinent to this appeal, Dedrick was originally sentenced under the career criminal provisions of \u00a7 4B1.1 of the then-applicable United States Sentencing Guidelines. He challenged that application on direct appeal and lost. <em>United States v. Dedrick, </em>85 Fed.Appx. 402 (5th Cir.2004). Since that appeal, he has filed various challenges to this sentence, all unsuccessful before both the district court and this court. In 2008, he again moved to reduce his sentence; that motion was denied, and the appeal of that decision remains pending under No. 08-50673.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The motion that is the subject of the current appeal is, at best, yet another attempt to reargue his sentence. At worst, it is a successive habeas over which the district court would have no authority because Dedrick never received permission from this court to file it. In any event, Dedrick has not demonstrated a nonfrivo-lous issue for appeal. This appeal is \u201cfrom the denial of a meaningless, unauthorized motion.\u201d <em>See United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994). Dedrick has failed to show that his appeal involves \u201clegal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, the motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Dedrick is WARNED that filing further frivolous appeals will subject him to sanctions. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 38; <em>Clark v. Green, </em>814 F.2d 221, 223 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b84-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
