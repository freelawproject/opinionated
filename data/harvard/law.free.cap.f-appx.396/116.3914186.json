Fed. R.CivP. 12(b)(6). Taylor sued the defendants after receiving a traffic citation for driving without a license. Our review is de novo. <em>See True v. Robles, </em>571 F.3d 412, 417 (5th Cir.2009). Accepting all well-pleaded facts as true and viewing those facts in favor of the plaintiff, we must determine whether the plaintiff has stated a legally cognizable claim. <em>See In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litig., </em>495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir.2007). We may affirm dismissal on any basis supported by the Rule 12(b)(6) record. <em>See R2 Inv. LDC v. Phillips, </em>401 F.3d 638, 642 (5th Cir.2005). Taylor\u2019s failure to brief his arguments is a valid basis for affirming the dismissal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>his complaint. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). However, we also find that Taylor has failed to set forth a legally cognizable claim against the defendants. <em>See Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994); <em>see also Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 430-31, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976); <em>James v. Harris County, </em>577 F.3d 612, 617 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Mays v. Sudderth, </em>97 F.3d 107, 110-11 (5th Cir.1996). Further, with respect to Taylor\u2019s assertions regarding the magistrate judge and district court, we caution Taylor that any future filing containing abusive, disparaging and contemptuous language will result in the imposition of sanctions. <em>See Theriault v. Silber, </em>579 F.2d 302, 303-04 (5th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b142-10\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir.
