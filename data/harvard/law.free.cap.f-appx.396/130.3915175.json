Bentley brought suit against his former neighbor, Bobby Fanguy for alleged violations of the Clean Water Act (CWA). The district court dismissed the lawsuit pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) and taxed Bentley with costs. In a subsequent order, the district court awarded Fanguy $5,976 in attorney\u2019s fees. On appeal, Bentley does not challenge the dismissal of his complaint, but rather argues that the district court erred in awarding Fanguy attorney\u2019s fees because he is not a \u201cprevailing or substantially prevailing party\u201d for purposes of the Clean Water Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-27\">We review \u201cthe district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Gagnon v. United Teehnisource Inc., </em>607 F.3d 1036, 1043 (5th Cir.2010) (citation omitted). The district court summarily dismissed Bentley\u2019s complaint and subsequently awarded attorney\u2019s fees after conducting a hearing in which the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>I don\u2019t think this [complaint] complies with the Clean Water Act. I think it is a tremendous stretch of the imagination. This is a \u2014 this is litigation between two neighbors, who, for whatever reason, can\u2019t get along. And whatever problems there are, this belongs in state court where it is firmly rested and I am going to dismiss this action at plaintiffs cost.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJlC\">Bentley argues that the district court erred in awarding Fanguy attorney\u2019s fees as a prevailing or substantially prevailing party because the dismissal of the lawsuit obtained by Fanguy did not create a material alteration of the parties\u2019 legal relationship. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The \u201cAmerican Rule\u201d is the starting point for fee awards: Even prevailing litigants are ordinarily not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees from the losing party. <em>Buckhannon Bd. &amp; Care Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Resources, </em>532 U.S. 598, 602, 121 S.Ct. 1835, 149 L.Ed.2d 855 (2001). Under the American Rule, a fee-shift is allowed only if there is some \u201cspecific and explicit\u201d statutory exception. <em>See, e.g., Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness Soc\u2019y, </em>421 U.S. 240, 260, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975). Under the CWA, Congress has provided for such a fee-shift in 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365(d), which, in relevant part provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-6\">The court, in issuing any final order in any action brought pursuant to this section, may award costs of litigation (including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees) to any prevailing or substantially prevailing party, whenever the court determines such award is appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-7\"><em>Id. </em>While this court has not specifically addressed whether a defendant who obtains a dismissal with prejudice is a prevailing or substantially prevailing party for purposes of the CWA, we have considered that question in analogous areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">In <em>Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens\u2019 Council for Clean Air, </em>the Supreme Court interpreted \u00a7 304(d) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), which authorizes an award of attorney\u2019s fees to a successful party. 478 U.S. 546, 560, 106 S.Ct. 3088, 92 L.Ed.2d 439 (1986). Relevant here, the Court interpreted \u00a7 304(d) of the CAA in the same manner as the Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fee Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, stating \u201c[g]iven the common purpose of both \u00a7 304(d) and \u00a7 1988 to promote citizen enforcement of important federal policies, we find no reason not to interpret both provisions governing attorney\u2019s fees in the same manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe language of \u00a7 304(d) of the CAA is essentially the same as \u00a7 1365(d), the attorney\u2019s fees provision of the CWA before us today.\u201d <em>St. John\u2019s Organic Farm v. Gem Cnty. Mosquito Abatement Dist., </em>574 F.3d 1054, 1062-1063 (9th Cir.2009). \u201cThe only difference is the absence of any \u2018prevailing party\u2019 language in \u00a7 304(d), but the Supreme Court has read \u2018prevailing party1 into \u00a7 304(d) and other attorney\u2019s fees provisions in environmental statutes.\u201d <em>Id. (citing Penn. v. Del. Valley Citizens\u2019 Council for Clean Air (\u201cDelaware Valley II </em>\u201d), 483 U.S. 711, 713, 107 S.Ct. 3078, 97 L.Ed.2d 585 (1987); <em>Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club, </em>463 U.S. 680, 682 n. 1, 103 S.Ct. 3274, 77 L.Ed.2d 938 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">In <em>Anthony v. Marion County General Hospital, </em>we concluded that a defendant was a prevailing party under \u00a7 1988 when a plaintiffs Title VII racial discrimination suit was involuntarily dismissed with prejudice for want of prosecution. 617 F.2d 1164, 1169-70 (5th Cir.1980). We stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-10\">Although there has not been an adjudication on the merits in the sense of a weighing of facts, there remains the fact that a dismissal with prejudice <em>is deemed an adjudication on the merits </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>for the purposes of res judicata. As such, the [defendant] has <em>clearly prevailed in this litigation.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-4\"><em>Id. </em>(5th Cir.1980) (emphasis added); <em>see also, e.g., Schwarz v. Folloder, </em>767 F.2d 125, 130 (5th Cir.1985) (\u201c[A] dismissal with prejudice gives the defendant the full relief to which he is legally entitled and is tantamount to a judgment on the merits.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Fanguy obtained a dismissal with prejudice of Bentley\u2019s CWA claim. This outcome gave Fanguy \u201cthe full relief to which he is legally entitled and is tantamount to a judgment on the merits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As such, Fanguy has \u201cclearly prevailed in this litigation,\u201d Ant<em>hony, </em>617 F.2d at 1170, and, as such, the district court did not err in awarding him attorney\u2019s fees under the CWA as a prevailing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b156-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
