The IJ denied asylum and withholding based on his finding that Martelo was not credible. On appeal, she argues that the IJ\u2019s finding, which the BIA affirmed, is not supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-23\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, but to the extent the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as well. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Here, the BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s reasoning. Accordingly, we review both the BIA decision and the IJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>We review factual findings, including credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence test. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005). Under this standard, we affirm a factual finding \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284 (internal quotation marks omitted). We will not reverse a factual finding unless \u201cthe evidence compels a reasonable fact finder to find otherwise.\u201d <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1231 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">To establish asylum eligibility, an applicant must prove that he or she is a \u201crefugee\u201d under the Immigration and Nationality Act. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1); <em>see also Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. A refugee must have (1) suffered past persecution on account of his or her social group, political opinion, or any other protected ground, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that his or her social group, political opinion, or any other protected ground will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b). To qualify for withholding of removal, an applicant must have established that it is more likely than not that her life or freedom would be threatened on account of a statutorily protected factor if returned to her home country. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">An applicant\u2019s own testimony \u201ccan suffice [to show eligibility for asylum or withholding] where the testimony is believable, consistent, and sufficiently detailed.\u201d <em>Niftaliev v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1211, 1217 (11th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>In re S-M-J, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 722 (BIA 1997)). However, \u201cin the absence of corroborating evidence, an adverse credibility determination may be sufficient to support the denial of an application.\u201d <em>Mohammed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>547 F.3d 1340, 1345 (11th Cir.2008) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Here, the IJ\u2019s credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence in the record and therefore the BIA properly affirmed it. The IJ and BIA noted that Martelo\u2019s claim changed over time, and noted material inconsistencies between Martelo\u2019s credible fear interview, asylum application, updated asylum application, supplemental declaration, and testimony at the removal hearing. Although her asylum claim is based on alleged persecution on account of her political opinion, Martelo did not mention that she was a member of a political organization or any other group until 2008, right before her asylum hearing. Martelo originally maintained that the FARC retaliated against her for refusing to provide them with medical services, which under circuit\u2019s case law is not a protected ground for which asylum is available. See <em>Rodriguez-Morales v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen. </em>488 F.3d 884 (11th Cir.2007). Although she had multiple opportunities to describe the reasons why she felt she was persecuted \u2014 for example, in her asylum application and her updated asylum application \u2014 she did not disclose facts indicating she belonged to any political group or held any political opinion for which she faced persecution until the eve of her asylum hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">For these reasons, substantial evidence supports the immigration courts\u2019 adverse credibility determination and resulting denial of Martelo and Prasca\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b631-16\">.
