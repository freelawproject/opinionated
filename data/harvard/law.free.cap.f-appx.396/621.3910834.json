First, Mills contends that the Administrative Law Judge erred in the second step of its analysis by finding that he did not suffer from a severe mental impairment as a result of chronic pain and depression. Second, Mills contends that during a second hearing following remand from the Appeals Council, the ALJ committed reversible error by failing to elicit expert medical testimony regarding the full extent of his impairments.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-20\">When the ALJ denies benefits and the Appeals Council denies review, we review the ALJ\u2019s decision as the Commissioner\u2019s final decision. <em>Doughty v. Apfel, </em>245 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir.2001). We review the Commissioner\u2019s decision regarding disability \u201cto determine whether it is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Moore v. Barnhart, 405 F.3d </em>1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. We </em>will not reweigh the evidence, decide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>the facts anew, or make credibility determinations. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">We conclude that the ALJ\u2019s finding that Mills did not suffer from a severe mental impairment stemming from chronic pain and depression was supported by substantial evidence. Despite Mills\u2019s complaints of pain and possible depression, records of his treating, consultative, and reviewing physicians showed that he had normal orientation, and only mild difficulty maintaining concentration, persistence, or pace, and was malingering regarding the magnitude of his symptoms. Moreover, Mills denied feeling anxious, ever attempting suicide, or having suicidal thoughts, and he did not list his mental health as a reason why he had stopped working. His own testimony established that he was never treated for mental health issues, and he lived a functional existence that included talking with friends on the telephone, singing in a church chorus, fishing, some cooking, and grocery shopping with his wife. Furthermore, the ALJ\u2019s decision to disregard Dr. Legum\u2019s statement that Mills had marked mental limitations in his ability to perform work-related activities was supported by good cause since Dr. Legum\u2019s opinion was inconsistent with his own medical records and there was evidence to support a contrary finding. <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1240-41 (11th Cir.2004). The ALJ also had good cause to discount Mills\u2019s claim of total disability in light of his own inconsistent testimony regarding his daily activities. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">\u201c[T]he ALJ has a basic obligation to develop a full and fair record.\u201d <em>Ellison v. Barnhart, </em>355 F.3d 1272, 1276 (11th Cir.2003); see <em>also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 416.912(d), 416.927(f)(2). We review <em>de novo </em>an ALJ\u2019s application of legal principles, <em>Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1211, and we must reverse if the ALJ has failed to provide \u201csufficient reasoning for determining that the proper legal analysis has been conducted.\u201d <em>Keeton v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>21 F.3d 1064, 1066 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">In this case, the ALJ did not err by failing to elicit expert medical testimony at the second hearing regarding the nature and extent of Mills\u2019s back impairment. The Appeals Council merely ordered the ALJ to \u201c[o]btain evidence from a medical expert to clarify the nature and severity of the claimant\u2019s back impairment,\u201d citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(f) and 416.927(f). According to both of those sections, the ALJ \u201cmay ... ask for and consider opinions from medical experts on the nature and severity of [the] impairment(s).\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(f)(2)(Hi) and 416.927(f)(2)(iii). Thus, the ALJ was not required to obtain evidence in the form of expert medical testimony so long as it \u201cconsidered]\u201d additional evidence in some form. It is undisputed that Mills submitted and the ALJ considered additional documentary evidence from treating physicians about his back condition, and the record reflects that evidence was sufficient to develop a full and fair record.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
