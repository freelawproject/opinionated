We are now presented with Binion\u2019s challenge to this conviction. His first argument is that the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to convict him of knowingly failing to register in accordance with Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. This argument is substantially similar to others that we have rejected in the past and is unavailing. <em>See United States v. Whaley, </em>577 F.3d 254, 262 and n. 6 (5th Cir.2009); <em>see also United States v. Heth, </em>596 F.3d 255, 258 (5th Cir.2010). Binion\u2019s Commerce Clause and Due Process arguments are, as he concedes, foreclosed. <em>See Heth, </em>596 F.3d at 259-60; <em>Whaley, </em>577 F.3d at 258-62. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b105-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
