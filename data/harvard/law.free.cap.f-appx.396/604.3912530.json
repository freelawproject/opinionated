On appeal, he offers no argument on the issue of whether the district court abused its discretion in dismissing his complaint, and instead argues at length that his \u00a7 1983 complaint is meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-20\">Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(a) requires that appellate briefs contain a statement of the issues presented for review, and the appellant\u2019s contentions concerning those issues. Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(5), (a)(9). Although we liberally construe briefs filed by <em>pro se </em>litigants, issues not briefed on appeal by a <em>pro se </em>litigant are deemed abandoned. <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-21\">Because Sanderson has not offered any argument as to whether the district court abused its discretion in dismissing his complaint without prejudice, he has abandoned the sole relevant issue in this appeal. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
