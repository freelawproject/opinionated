We find no error and AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-29\">Chhim filed suit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, alleging that the Spring Branch Independent School District discriminated against him on the basis of race, national origin, and age. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>Chhim is an Asian male originally from Cambodia. He was 63-years old when the acts of alleged discrimination started.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">The crux of Chhim\u2019s complaint was that Spring Branch engaged in unlawful employment discrimination when it refused to hire him for a custodial supervisor position. Spring Branch\u2019s position description stated that language skills in \u201cSpanish and English\u201d were \u201chighly desirable.\u201d Chhim does not speak Spanish and was not hired. The position was filled by a Hispanic female fluent in both Spanish and English.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Chhim\u2019s complaint stated that Spring Branch engaged in racial and national original discrimination, arguing: \u201cBecause of the plaintiffs race and his national origin the defendant has failed to employ the plaintiff or to hire the plaintiff because he has no ability to speak, write, read, and to translate fluently in Spanish languages which are the custodial supervisor\u2019s qualifications .... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The district court granted Spring Branch\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 12(b)(6). The district court held that Chhim \u201cfailed to state a claim for national origin or race discrimination. Non-bilingual individuals are not a protected class under Title VII. Moreover, a preference, or even requirement, that employees have bilingual ability does not give rise to a discrimination claim based on national origin or race.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>a dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6). <em>In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litigation, </em>495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir.2007). \u201cTo survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a complaint does not need detailed factual allegations, but must provide the plaintiffs grounds for entitlement to relief \u2014 including factual allegations that when assumed to be true raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d <em>Cuvillier v. Taylor, </em>503 F.3d 397, 401 (5th Cir.2007) (internal quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">An employer may not discriminate based on the \u201crace, color, religion, sex, or national origin\u201d of its applicants for employment. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l). A person\u2019s language is not a listed category. We once noted that language requirements could be used as \u201ca covert basis for national origin discrimination,\u201d but also required evidence that discrimination was the purpose or result. <em>Garcia v. Gloor, </em>618 F.2d 264, 268, 270 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">Spring Branch\u2019s preference for bilingual employees did not discriminate on the basis of race or national origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-11\">Chhim argues that he should have been allowed discovery to determine whether speaking Spanish was only a preference as Spring Branch argues or was actually a requirement. The district court held, though, that neither a preference nor a requirement of bilingual ability would constitute discrimination based on race or national origin. We agree. The requested discovery would not have provided any evidence relevant to the resolution of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-12\">For the first time on appeal, Chhim makes a disparate treatment argument. It is too late to raise it now. <em>Stewart Glass &amp; Mirror, Inc. v. U.S. Auto Glass Discount Centers, Inc., </em>200 F.3d 307, 316-17 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-13\">Finally, Chhim presents an age discrimination claim on appeal. Chhim\u2019s district court pleadings contain no age discrimination claims. His complaint, first amended complaint, second amended complaint, Response to Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss, and Motion for Reconsideration discuss only race and national origin. It is too late for that claim, too. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b99-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
