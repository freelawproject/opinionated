The district court granted a certificate of appealability on the issue whether the failure of the trial judge, Judge Ronald Bodenheimer, to recuse himself constituted structural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-22\">The district court must defer to the state court\u2019s adjudication on the merits of an applicant\u2019s claims unless the state court\u2019s adjudication was \u201ccontrary to\u201d or involved an \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts. <em>See Miniel v. Cockrell, </em>339 F.3d 331, 336 (5th Cir.2003); \u00a7 2254(d)(1), (2). This court reviews the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo. <em>Buntion v. Quarterman, </em>524 F.3d 664, 670 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-23\">Sandoval argued that Judge Bodenheimer should have recused himself due to an ongoing criminal investigation against him. Sandoval did not allege that the judge had an actual bias against him or that the judge\u2019s alleged bias resulted in any specific erroneous rulings in his trial. <em>See Bracy v. Gramley, </em>520 U.S. 899, 909, 117 S.Ct. 1793, 138 L.Ed.2d 97 (1997). He has not shown presumptive bias, such as when the judge has a direct interest in the outcome of the case, the judge has been subject to abuse by the party before him, or the judge had a dual role of investigating and adjudicating disputes. <em>See Buntion, </em>524 F.3d at 672. He has not shown that there was an appearance of impropriety that rose to the level of a due process violation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number><em>See Richardson v. Quarterman, </em>537 F.3d 466, 476-79 (5th Cir.2008). His allegation that bias existed because a detective, who testified at his trial, also investigated Judge Bodenheimer is unpersuasive; it does not establish that the judge had an actual or presumptive bias or an appearance of bias that required recusal. Sandoval has not shown that the outcome of his case had any potential to affect the outcome of the unrelated case against Judge Bodenheimer. Therefore, he has not shown that the district court erred in holding that because there was no direct or presumptive bias, there was no structural error. <em>See Richardson, </em>537 F.3d at 478. The district court did not err in determining that the state court\u2019s decision was not \u201ccontrary to\u201d or an \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court. <em>See Miniel, </em>339 F.3d at 336-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b109-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
