McClure\u2019s conviction was based on his participation in the burglary of a federally-licenced firearms dealer, during which he and his 13 codefendants stole over 80 firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">On appeal, McClure argues that the district court improperly calculated his sentencing guidelines range by increasing his base offense level for possessing a firearm in connection with another felony offense, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6). McClure also argues that the application the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) sentencing enhancement constituted impermissible double counting because the district court also increased his base offense level for possessing a stolen firearm, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(4)(A). After careful review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">Section 2K2.1(b)(6) provides for a four-level increase in a defendant\u2019s base offense level \u201c[i]f the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense .... \u201d \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6). The enhancement applies \u201cif the firearm or ammunition facilitated, or had the potential of facilitating, another felony offense....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at cmt. n. 14(A). For the purposes of this enhancement, \u201canother felony offense\u201d is defined as \u201cany Federal, state, or local offense, other than the ... firearms possession or trafficking offense, regardless of whether a criminal charge was brought, or a conviction obtained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at cmt. n. 14(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">Although McClure argues that the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) enhancement was not applicable to him, the guidelines commentary states that it applies \u201cin a case in which a defendant who, during the course of a burglary, finds and takes a firearm, even if the defendant did not engage in any other conduct with that firearm during the course of the burglary....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at cmt. n. 14(B). McClure does not dispute that the facts he admitted at his plea colloquy were sufficient to show that he took the firearms during the course of a burglary. Rather, he contends that comment 14(B) does not apply in a case such as this, where the object of the burglary was to steal firearms. However, the commentary makes no distinction between circumstances where a burglary was committed in order to steal firearms, and those where a defendant found and took a firearm while committing a burglary for some other reason. Comment 14(B) states that the enhancement is warranted \u201cbecause the presence of the firearm has the potential of facilitat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>ing another felony offense[,]\u201d which is true whether the theft of the firearm was merely incidental to the burglary or was its object. <em>Id. </em>at cmt. n. 14(B). Therefore, the application of the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) enhancement was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">McClure also argues that the application the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) sentencing enhancement constituted impermissible double counting because it addressed the same kind of harm that was fully accounted for by the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(A) sentencing enhancement he received for possessing stolen firearms. However, the kind of harm accounted for under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6), possession of a firearm during a burglary, is conceptually distinct from the notion that a defendant should be punished more severely for possessing a firearm that was stolen. Because the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(A) sentencing enhancement did not fully account for the kind of harm addressed by \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6), the district court did not err in applying both enhancements in calculating McClure\u2019s sentencing guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b646-9\">. McClure also argues, for the first time on appeal, that the application of the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(A) sentencing enhancement constituted impermissible double counting because the district court also increased his base offense level due to the number of firearms involved in his offenses, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(1)(C). He contends that applying both enhancements constituted impermissible double counting.</p>\n<p id=\"ACN\">Because these sentencing enhancements deal with conceptually separate notions relating to sentencing \u2014 possession of a <em>stolen </em>firearm and the <em>number </em>of firearms involved, respectively \u2014 the district court did not plainly err by applying both in calculating McClure\u2019s sentencing guidelines range.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
