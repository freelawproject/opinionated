Vasquez argues that his sentence is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and that he should have been sentenced below the guidelines range. He contends that the guidelines sentencing range was too severe because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based and resulted in the double counting of his prior aggravated assault conviction. He also argues that the 16-level sentencing enhancement he received as a result of that prior aggravated assault conviction overstated the gravity of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-19\">Vasquez\u2019s empirical data argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). In addition, we have previously rejected the argument that the double counting of a defendant\u2019s criminal history necessarily renders a sentence unreasonable. <em>See Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n. 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-24\">Vasquez\u2019s assertions regarding the seriousness of his prior aggravated assault offense are insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008); <em>United States v. Velazquez-Overa, </em>100 F.3d 418, 422 (5th Cir.1996). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1009-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
