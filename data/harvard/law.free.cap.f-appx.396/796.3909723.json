Millhouse, Jr., a prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals from the order of the District Court dismissing his habeas petition filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. Because the appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm. <em>See </em>3d Cir. LAR 27.4; 3d Cir. IOP 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-17\">Millhouse was convicted of money laundering and related crimes in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. He filed in that court a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which was dismissed in 2007. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals denied relief in 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-18\">In January 2009, Millhouse filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, raising eleven claims for relief. The District Court dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction, and we affirmed that decision. <em>See Millhouse v. Grondolsky, </em>331 Fed.Appx. 108, 109 (3d Cir.2009). In December 2009, Millhouse filed the \u00a7 2241 petition at issue here, raising the same eleven claims. The District Court again dismissed Millhouse\u2019s petition for lack of jurisdiction. Millhouse appealed, and also seeks appointment of counsel and release on bail pending resolution of his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-19\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal determinations and apply a clearly erroneous standard to its factual findings. <em>See Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-20\">As we explained in Millhouse\u2019s prior appeal, a \u00a7 2255 motion is the presumptive means for a federal prisoner to challenge the validity of his conviction or sentence. <em>See Davis v. United States, </em>417 U.S. 333, 343, 94 S.Ct. 2298, 41 L.Ed.2d 109 (1974); <em>In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 249 (3d Cir.1997). A petitioner may seek relief under \u00a7 2241 only if the remedy provided by \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255; <em>Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d at 249-51. Section 2255 is not inadequate or ineffective merely because a petitioner cannot meet the gatekeeping requirements of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>\u00a7 2255, <em>see Okereke v. United States, </em>807 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir.2002), or because the sentencing court does not grant relief. <em>See Cradle, </em>290 F.3d at 539. Millhouse fails to demonstrate that his is one of the rare cases in which \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective, as he once again only raises arguments concerning his conviction that could have been raised on direct appeal or in his \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">We have considered the record and Mill-house\u2019s arguments in his memorandum in support of his appeal and his other filings. Because 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e) deprived the District Court of the authority to consider Millhouse\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition, his appeal plainly lacks merit, and we will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court. Millhouse\u2019s motions for summary action, counsel, and bail are denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
