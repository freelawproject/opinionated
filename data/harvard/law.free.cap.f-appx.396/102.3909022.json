The district court dismissed several claims against various defendants with prejudice as frivolous and for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted and dismissed any claim for monetary compensation (for an allegedly unconstitutional conviction and sentence) as frivolous until such time as the conditions in <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), are met. The district court noted, and its docket sheet reflects, that claims remain pending against numerous defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-18\">Because the district court dismissed some but not all claims and defendants, this court must examine whether it has jurisdiction. <em>See Martin v. Halliburton, </em>618 F.3d 476, 480-82 (5th Cir.2010). We have jurisdiction over appeals from final decisions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291; certain interlocutory decisions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292; partial judgments certified as final under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), <em>United States v. Powell, </em>468 F.3d 862, 863 (5th Cir.2006); and certain decisions under the collateral order doctrine, <em>Martin, </em>618 F.3d at 480-83. Lewis\u2019s appeal does not fall into any of these eatego-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>ries, so we lack jurisdiction, and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b128-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
