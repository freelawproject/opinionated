For the reasons that follow, we will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-25\">Gross is presently incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution-Schuylkill in Minersville, Pennsylvania, serving a sentence imposed in 2008 by the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. On January 28, 2010, he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in the District Court. In it, he argued that the sentence imposed by the Federal District Court in Maryland was improperly enhanced by a prior Maryland State Court conviction deriving from a plea obtained in violation of the Constitution. The District Court dismissed his petition for lack of jurisdiction, explaining that his claim was not cognizable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 because \u00a7 2255 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>provided an adequate remedy for Gross\u2019s habeas claims. Gross appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(a). We will summarily affirm the order of the District Court because this appeal presents no substantial question. <em>See </em>3d Cir. LAR 27.4 &amp; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">Gross presents in great detail his argument regarding the unconstitutionality of his plea agreement with the State of Maryland. In 2000, in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, Gross pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute cocaine and was sentenced to five years in prison. The record does not reflect that he ever filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition to challenge this conviction and sentence. In February 2008, he filed a petition for a writ of error coram nobis in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, arguing that his plea was not knowing and voluntary as he was not advised of the elements of the charge to which he pled guilty, either by the court or by his counsel. Following a hearing, his petition was denied. That decision was affirmed on appeal and the Maryland Court of Special Appeals denied relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">On June 23, 2008, Gross was convicted in the Federal District Court in Maryland of one count of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute more than fifty grams of cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A) &amp; 846, and sentenced to 188 months in prison. Based on his prior state court conviction, he was designated a career offender under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. He argues that because his state court conviction was unconstitutionally obtained, his federal sentence should not have been enhanced on that basis. Because he is now in federal custody and can no longer bring a \u00a7 2254 petition, Gross argues that the only way to challenge his underlying state court conviction and sentence is through a \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">Gross does not dispute that he could have filed a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition to challenge the legality of his plea agreement following the conclusion of his state court proceedings. <em>See Daniels v. United States, </em>532 U.S. 374, 381, 121 S.Ct. 1578, 149 L.Ed.2d 590 (2001). The fact that he waited until 2008 to pursue any relief in state court does not mean that he can now seek relief under \u00a7 2241. In <em>In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245 (3d Cir.1997), we permitted the petitioner to proceed under \u00a7 2241 because he had \u201cno earlier opportunity to challenge his conviction\u201d based on an intervening change in the law. <em>See id. </em>at 251. Here, the law has remained the same since Gross\u2019s conviction. It appears that the only thing that has changed has been his understanding of the law. This does not justify his prosecution of a petition under \u00a7 2241. <em>Cf. Daniels, </em>532 U.S. at 382, 121 S.Ct. 1578 (explaining that, for the purposes of \u00a7 2255, if \u201ca prior conviction used to enhance a federal sentence is no longer open to direct or collateral attack in its own right because the defendant failed to pursue those remedies while they were available ..., then that defendant is without recourse\u201d); <em>Lackawanna Cnty. Dist. Att\u2019y v. Coss, </em>532 U.S. 394, 396-97, 121 S.Ct. 1567, 149 L.Ed.2d 608 (2001) (extending holding of <em>Daniels </em>to state prisoners seeking to challenge enhanced state sentences under \u00a7 2254).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-10\">As the District Court explained, the proper course of action for Gross would have been to file a direct appeal or petition for collateral relief in the appropriate state courts in Maryland, followed by a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. <em>See Daniels, </em>532 U.S. at 381, 121 S.Ct. 1578. Additionally, to the extent he seeks to challenge the calculation of his sentence based on his status as a career offender, he has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>demonstrated that \u00a7 2255, if properly utilized, would have provided an \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d means of relief. <em>See Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538-39 (3d Cir.2002) (per curiam) (\u201cIt is the inefficacy of the remedy, not the personal inability to use it, that is determinative.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">Based on the foregoing, we agree that the District Court properly dismissed Gross\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition and will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>3d Cir. LAR 27.4 &amp; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b830-10\">. While the District Court could have treated Gross's \u00a7 2241 petition as a \u00a7 2254 petition and transferred it to the Maryland District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631, we conclude that doing so would not have been \u201cin the interest of justice,\u201d particularly in light of Gross's own representation that he can no longer pursue relief under \u00a7 2254.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
