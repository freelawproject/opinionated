She petitions this court to review the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), dismissing her appeal from the decision of the Immigration Judge (IJ) that she is removable and not eligible for discretionary relief from removal. Pagallaman has waived any challenge to the IJ\u2019s determination that she is removable and not eligible for cancellation of removal by failing to challenge this determination in her petition for review. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003). Further, this court lacks jurisdiction to review Pagalla-man\u2019s claims that her procedural due process rights were violated because she failed to present the claims to the BIA. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 137 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-21\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DISMISSED FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION IN PART and DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1022-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
