He later filed a motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (\u201cIFP\u201d). By order entered May 18, 2010, the District Court denied Townsend\u2019s IFP motion on the ground that his claims are collaterally es-topped by the dismissal of Townsend\u2019s similar complaint in <em>Townsend v. Calderone, </em>D.N.J. Civ. No. 09-cv-03803. Townsend appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and review the District Court\u2019s denial of leave to proceed IFP for abuse of discretion. <em>See Deutsch v. United States, </em>67 F.3d 1080, 1083 (3d Cir.1995). We conclude that the District Court abused its discretion here. In this Circuit, leave to proceed IFP generally turns solely on indigence. <em>See id. </em>at 1084 n. 5; <em>Roman v. Jeffes, </em>904 F.2d 192, 194 n. 1 (3d Cir.1990). If the plaintiff is unable to pay the filing fee, leave to proceed IFP generally should be granted. <em>See Deutsch, </em>67 F.3d at 1084 n. 5. If a district court grants IFP status, it may then decide whether to dismiss the complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2). <em>See id. </em>(addressing former \u00a7 1915(d)); <em>Roman, </em>904 F.2d at 194 n. 1 (same). What it generally may not do, however, is deny leave to proceed IFP on the basis of non-financial considerations such as the merits of the plaintiffs complaint. <em>See Sinwell v. Shapp, </em>536 F.2d 15, 18-19 (3d Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-10\">We have recognized that denial of leave to proceed IFP for other than financial reasons might be warranted under \u201cextreme circumstances.\u201d <em>Deutsch, </em>67 F.3d at 1084 n. 5. The District Court concluded merely that Townsend\u2019s claims are barred by collateral estoppel. The District Court ultimately may be right, and we express no opinion on that issue. We conclude, however, that any deficiency with Townsend\u2019s complaint does not justify denying leave to proceed IFP instead of addressing his claims within the proper legal framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-11\">Accordingly, we will summarily vacate the District Court\u2019s order denying Townsend leave to proceed IFP. On remand, the District Court should decide Townsend\u2019s IFP motion on financial grounds alone and then conduct such further proceedings as may be necessary consistent with this opinion. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4 (2010); 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b814-8\">. Townsend\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP in this Court is granted. His motion to expedite this appeal is denied as moot in light of our disposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
