In this appeal, he argues that his within-guidelines sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court failed to properly weigh his mitigating evidence concerning his reasons for returning to this country, gave too much weight to his criminal history, and failed to properly account for the fact that many of his prior offenses were due to his drug addiction. We disagree with these arguments, and our review of the record and pertinent jurisprudence shows no abuse of discretion in connection with the sentence imposed. <em>See United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 752 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">The appellant\u2019s arguments concerning the reasonableness vel non of his sentence amount to a disagreement with the district court\u2019s weighing of certain sentencing factors and the appropriateness of the within-guidelines sentence imposed. This disagreement does not suffice to show error in connection with the sentence imposed. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 526 (5th Cir.2008). This disagreement likewise does not suffice to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to the within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554-55 (5th Cir.2006). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b149-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
