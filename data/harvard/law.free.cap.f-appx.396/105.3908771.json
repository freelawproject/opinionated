He contends defendants were deliberately indifferent to his medical needs in violation of the Eighth Amendment because they refused to provide him with a new pair of high-top work boots during the period of 10 June 2008 through 16 January 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-23\">Although Ganther had a medical pass to have his prison-issued boots replaced with new ones, his request was denied by defendants, pursuant to prison policy that boots be issued only to field workers. Ganther\u2019s assignment was instead in the kitchen.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Our court reviews <em>de novo </em>denials of motions for judgment as a matter of law, and for summary judgment, and dismissals for failure to state a claim. <em>E.g., Arsement v. Spinnaker Exploration Co., </em>400 F.3d 238, 248 (5th Cir.2005); <em>Gutierrez v. City of San Antonio, </em>139 F.3d 441, 444 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Black v. Warren, </em>134 F.3d 732, 733-34 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The Eighth Amendment protects prisoners from \u201cthe wanton and unnecessary infliction\u201d of injury that results in \u201cpain without any penological purpose\u201d or an \u201cunquestioned and serious deprivation of basic human needs\u201d. <em>Rhodes v. Chapman, </em>452 U.S. 337, 347, 101 S.Ct. 2392, 69 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981) (citing <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 103, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976); <em>Hutto v. Finney, </em>437 U.S. 678, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 57 L.Ed.2d 522 (1978)). A violation of the Eighth Amendment occurs only when: there is a deprivation that is \u201cobjectively, \u2018sufficiently serious\u2019 \u201d, resulting \u201cin the denial of \u2018the minimal civilized measure of life\u2019s necessities,\u2019 \u201d ... and the \u201cprison official ... [has] a \u2018sufficiently culpable state of mind\u2019 \u201d. <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994) (quoting <em>Wilson v. Seiter, </em>501 U.S. 294, 297-98, 111 S.Ct. 2321, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991); <em>Rhodes, </em>452 U.S. at 347, 101 S.Ct. 2392). In <em>Farmer, </em>the Court held that a prison official acts with deliberate indifference to inmates\u2019 health \u201conly if he knows that [they] face a substantial risk of serious harm and disregards that risk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 847, 114 S.Ct. 1970. The prisoner must \u201csubmit evidence that prison officials refused to treat him, ignored his complaints, intentionally treated him incorrectly, or engaged in any similar conduct that would clearly evince a wanton disregard for any serious medical needs\u201d. <em>Gobert v. Caldwell, </em>463 F.3d 339, 346 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Given the prison\u2019s policy of issuing boots only to field workers and Ganther\u2019s assignment to the kitchen, defendants\u2019 denial of boots was <em>not </em>conduct that was \u201c \u2018causeless[ ], without restraint, and in reckless disregard\u2019\u201d of Ganther\u2019s health such that it could be termed wanton in violation of the Eighth Amendment. <em>Johnson v. Treen, </em>759 F.2d 1236, 1238 (5th Cir.1985) (quoting 30 American and English Encyclopedia of Law 2-4 (2d ed.1905) (footnotes omitted)). For purposes of receiving the relief requested in this appeal, Ganther fails to show that defendants acted with the knowledge that denial of boots would pose to him a substantial risk of serious harm. The denial of boots, based upon prison policy, was at most negligence, which is <em>not </em>actionable. <em>See Gobert, </em>463 F.3d at 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Because reasonable jurors could have arrived at a verdict contrary to Ganther\u2019s position and because there was a genuine issue of material fact, the district court did <em>not </em>err by dismissing Ganther\u2019s motions for judgment as a matter of law and for summary judgment. <em>See Arsement, </em>400 F.3d at 248-49; <em>Gutierrez, </em>139 F.3d at 444. Additionally, Ganther\u2019s complaint failed to allege facts sufficient to support a conclusion of deliberate indifference. Thus, he fails to show that the district court erred by dismissing his \u00a7 1983 action for failure to state a claim. <em>See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 556, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b132-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
