In the first robbery, Plowright threatened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>a store clerk with a pistol. In the second incident, he shot another store clerk three times and inflicted severe injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Plowright and the government entered into an agreement. As part of that agreement, he pleaded guilty to brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii), and discharging a firearm during another crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1)(A)(iii). In exchange, the government dismissed eight counts charging him with other crimes. The agreement also included the government\u2019s promise that it would \u201cnot object\u201d to Plowright receiving a sentence reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. That promise was of no real significance because the consecutive minimum sentences mandated by \u00a7 924(c) made Plo-wright ineligible for any such reduction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4(b) &amp; cmt. n. 5 (\u201cthe guideline sentence is the minimum term of imprisonment required by statute\u201d). Plo-wright was sentenced to 32 years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Plowright appeals his convictions and sentence, contending that his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary because he was misled into believing he would be eligible for a sentence reduction if he accepted responsibility. Because any such error did not affect Plowright\u2019s substantial rights, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Due process requires that a guilty plea be made \u201cknowingly and voluntarily.\u201d <em>United States v. Moriariy, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1019 (11th Cir.2005). And Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1) requires the court to make sure that the defendant understands the consequences of his plea, including \u201cany mandatory minimum penalty\u201d he will face. Plo-wright faced a mandatory minimum prison term of 7 years on the first \u00a7 924(c) count for brandishing a firearm, and a consecutive mandatory minimum term of 25 years on the second count, for a total of 32 years. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii) &amp; (c)(l)(C)(i). He was informed of this fact at least five times: when the government filed its certification of penalty along with the indictment; in the plea agreement; at the plea colloquy; in the presentence report; and again at sentencing. Despite these clear warnings, it is conceivable that the government\u2019s promise to \u201cnot object\u201d to a sentence reduction, coupled with the district court\u2019s remark at the Rule 11 hearing that Plowright would \u201close [his] acceptance of responsibility credit\u201d if he were not completely truthful with his probation officer, may have led Plowright to believe there was a possibility of a reduced sentence. If so, however, that misconception was cleared up by the presentence report, which specifically said that an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility \u201ccannot be applied.\u201d Plowright, who was represented by counsel throughout the process, did not object at that point and did not seek to withdraw his plea. Nor did he object or make any motion when the district court at sentencing failed to afford him an acceptance of responsibility reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-13\">Where a defendant failed to object in the district court to an alleged violation of Rule ll\u2019s plea requirements, we review only for plain error. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>586 F.3d 1342, 1345 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cTo establish plain error, a defendant must show there is (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d at 1019. To show his substantial rights were affected, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>Plowright must demonstrate a reasonable probability that, but for the alleged error, he would not have pleaded guilty. <em>See Brown, </em>586 F.3d at 1345. In <em>Brown, </em>we concluded that the defendant failed to show his substantial rights were affected by wrong information he had received during his plea hearing, because he had not objected after his presentence report corrected that misinformation. <em>Id. </em>at 1346. In other words, the defendant\u2019s silence after he learned the truth indicated that the earlier error did not affect his decision to plead guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Even if his lack of objection to the pre-sentence report were not dispositive, Plo-wright has otherwise failed to establish a reasonable probability that he would not have pleaded guilty had he been properly informed. <em>See Brown, </em>586 F.3d at 1345. In reviewing whether a Rule 11 error affected a defendant\u2019s substantial rights, we \u201cconsider the whole record.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Nothing in that record suggests Plowright would have turned down the plea deal if he had known he could not get a two\u2014 or three-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility. The evidence against him\u2014 which would have included testimony from at least two co-defendants that Plowright had participated in the robberies and had admitted shooting the store clerk; surveillance video of Plowright selling the same gun used in the shooting to an undercover officer several weeks later; and traffic video of Plowright leading police on a high-speed chase through a residential neighborhood and a school parking lot \u2014 was such that he would have been ill-advised to take his chances with a jury. Plowright\u2019s sentence, severe as it was, could have been worse.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Even if Plowright was misinformed, because his substantial rights were not harmed there was no plain error. <em>See Brown, </em>586 F.3d at 1346.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b615-8\">. In fact, the only way Plowright's sentence could have been reduced below the statutory minimum would have been for the government to file a substantial assistance motion under either U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 (before sentencing) or Fed.R.Crim.P. 35 (after sentencing). The government did not do so, nor did it ever promise that it would.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b616-5\">. Even without a \u00a7 3E1.1 reduction, Plo-wright did benefit from the plea deal in two important ways. First, in return for his guilty plea to the two \u00a7 924(c) counts, the government dropped eight other counts. If convicted and sentenced within applicable guidelines on those counts, Plowright would have received an additional consecutive sentence of 121 to 151 months. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(D)(ii) (sentences under \u00a7 924(c) cannot run concurrently with any other sentence). Second, it should be kept in mind that Plowright faced a statutory <em>maximum </em>sentence of life in prison on each \u00a7 924(c) count. The district court could have varied upward and imposed a more severe sentence than it did; had Plowright not accepted responsibility and expressed remorse for his crime, the court might well have done so. <em>Cf. Brown, </em>586 F.3d at 1347 (district court gave defendant \"the benefit of his bargain\" by imposing only the minimum sentence) (quotation marks and alteration omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
