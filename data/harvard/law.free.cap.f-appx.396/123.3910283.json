Mar-Rivera contends the district court improperly imposed the enhancement, claiming the Government failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish his prior offense constituted such an offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Guidelines are advisory only, and an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the advisory Guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005). On the other hand, an issue raised for the first time on appeal is reviewed only for plain error. <em>E.g., United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">As Mar-Rivera concedes, he did <em>not </em>object in district court to the 16-level enhancement; therefore, this issue is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Arviso-Mata, </em>442 F.3d 382, 384 (5th Cir.2006). To establish reversible plain error, Mar-Rivera must show a clear or obvious error that affects his substantial rights. <em>E.g., Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he does so, this court retains the discretion to correct the error; generally, we will do so if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-12\">Mar-Rivera is unable to show error, much less reversible plain error. In conjunction with the addendum to the presen-tence investigation report, which Mar-Rivera\u2019s counsel apparently did not receive, the probation officer provided the district court with copies of the indictment and judgment in the Kentucky drug-trafficking proceeding. <em>See Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) (holding a reviewing court may examine the statutory definition, charging document, plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to verify an earlier conviction). (Although these documents are <em>not </em>attached to the addendum in the record on appeal, the Government provided them with its brief here. They are not challenged in a reply brief.) These documents, along with the Kentucky drug-trafficking statute, confirm Mar-Rivera\u2019s pre-deportation crime constituted a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d, warranting the 16-level enhancement. <em>See </em>Ky.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 218A.010(34), 218A.1411 (West 2005); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. n. l(B)(iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>In the light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Mar-Rivera challenges the constitutionality of treating prior convictions as sentencing factors under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b), rather than elements of the separate offense that must be presented to the jury. As Mar-Rivera concedes, this contention is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>See United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007).
