The district court sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>tenced Olmos to 96 months of imprisonment, which was within the advisory guidelines imprisonment range of 77 to 96 months. The calculation of this range included a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) because Olmos was previously deported following a conviction for a crime of violence. He now appeals, arguing that his sentence is unreasonably long and greater than necessary to satisfy the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He also argues that the guidelines that govern illegal reentry offenses lack an empirical foundation and thus deprive his sentence of a presumption of reasonableness on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">The district court heard Olmos\u2019s arguments in mitigation of his sentence and nevertheless concluded that a within-guidelines sentence was appropriate in light of the facts before it. That conclusion is entitled to deference, and we presume it is reasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Newson, </em>515 F.3d 374, 379 (5th Cir.2008). The district court was \u201cin a superior position to find facts and assess their import under \u00a7 3553(a),\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, and we see no reason to disturb the district court\u2019s discretionary decision to impose a sentence within the guidelines range. Furthermore, as Olmos concedes, his argument that the appellate presumption of reasonableness is inapplicable due to the lack of an empirical basis in the guidelines governing illegal reentry offenses is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b189-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
