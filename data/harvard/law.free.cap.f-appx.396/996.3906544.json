In his brief, Puna-wala appears to challenge both the BIA\u2019s dismissal of his appeal of the immigration judge\u2019s (IJ) denial of withholding of removal and the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reconsider. The Respondent has moved for summary affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-8\">As the Respondent correctly argues, because Punawala did not file a separate petition for review from the BIA\u2019s dismissal of his appeal from the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision dismissing his appeal. <em>See Guevara v. Gonzales, </em>450 F.3d 173, 176 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-9\">We do, however, have authority to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary action in ruling on Punawala\u2019s motion for reconsideration. <em>See Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 302-03 (5th Cir.2005). We review the denial of a motion to reconsider under a \u201chighly deferential abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 303. The BIA\u2019s decision on Punawala\u2019s reconsideration motion easily meets this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-10\">Punawala\u2019s motion failed to specify any errors of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s decision dismissing his appeal from the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C). Punawala merely recycled the legal arguments he raised in his earlier appeal. The BIA\u2019s denial of the motion for reconsideration was not arbitrary or even unreasonable. <em>See Zhao, </em>404 F.3d at 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-13\">Although Punawala now avers that he established \u201ca past pattern of persecution\u201d so as to give rise to a presumption of future persecution and that the IJ and BIA erred in not shifting the burden of rebutting that presumption to the Respondent, he did not raise this precise argument in his motion for reconsideration. Because Punawala has not exhausted this issue by raising it before the BIA, this court\u2019s consideration of the issue is juris-dictionally barred. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-14\">For the foregoing reasons, we DISMISS Punawala\u2019s petition in part and DENY it in part. We GRANT the Respondent\u2019s motion for summary affirmance.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1023-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
