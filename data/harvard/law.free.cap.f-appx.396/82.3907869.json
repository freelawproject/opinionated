Brown, </em>920 F.2d 1212, 1216-17 (5th Cir.1991), <em>abrogated on other grounds by United States v. Candia, </em>454 F.3d 468, 472-73 (5th Cir.2006), which held that a district court may order a term of imprisonment to run consecutively with an unimposed state sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-23\">To the extent that Johnson argues that the district court erred in ordering that his revocation sentences run consecutively with a federal sentence imposed in any prosecution relating to the criminal conduct in the matter, any such error was rendered harmless or moot. Johnson\u2019s subsequently imposed 120-month sentence following his guilty plea to theft of firearms from a licensed firearm dealer was ordered to run concurrently with his revo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>cation sentences. <em>See United States v. Ahmed, </em>324 F.3d 368, 374 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Rocky v. King, </em>900 F.2d 864, 867 (5th Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Quintana-Go-mez, </em>521 F.3d 495, 497-98 (5th Cir.2008). The Government\u2019s motion for summary af-firmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b108-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
