Allen, Mississippi prisoner # 103328, filed a pro se civil rights com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>plaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 alleging that the defendants denied him access to medical care. The parties consented to proceed before a magistrate judge, who dismissed Allen\u2019s complaint on the ground that he failed to state a claim against the defendants for constitutionally inadequate medical care. The MJ granted Allen leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal, but denied Allen\u2019s request for a transcript of the hearing held pursuant to <em>Spears v. McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179 (5th Cir.1985), on May 12, 2009. Allen now moves this court for a copy of the transcript at government expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Allen cannot satisfy the criteria for obtaining a transcript at government expense set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(f) because his appeal is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Allen\u2019s allegations, if true, amount to nothing more than a disagreement with medical treatment, which is insufficient to give rise to a \u00a7 1983 claim. <em>See Gobert v. Caldwell, </em>463 F.3d 339, 346 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Domino v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>239 F.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir.2001). Accordingly, Allen\u2019s motion for a transcript at government expense is denied, and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">We caution Allen that dismissal of this appeal as frivolous and the MJ\u2019s dismissal of his complaint for failure to state a claim each count as a strike. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). If Allen accumulates three strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b158-16\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5tii Cir. R. 47.5, the court has delermined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
