On June 8, 2009, appellant and a co-worker collected money from a Wachovia Bank Currency Center and transported it to a Brinks warehouse in Miami. After appellant left the warehouse, Brinks conducted an audit and discovered that $754,000 was missing from the money appellant and his co-worker had picked up from the Wacho-via Currency Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">Appellant was arrested and charged with bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(b). He pled guilty unconditionally to the offense, and the district court sentenced him to prison for a term of 84 months. He appeals his sentence on the grounds that the district court (1) erred in enhancing the base offense level for robbery by two levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 for obstruction of justice, and (2) abused its discretion in imposing a prison term that is 33 months above the sentencing range prescribed by the Sentencing Guidelines, 41 to 51 months. A term of 84 months, he contends, is substantively unreasonable. We address these two grounds in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">I.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-10\">Section 3C1.1 of the Guidelines provides: If (A) the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice with respect to the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction, and (B) the obstructive conduct related to (i) the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction and any relevant conduct; or (ii) a closely related offense, increase the offense level by 2 levels.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-12\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 (2009). The commentary to this section lists various examples of obstructive conduct, including where a defendant provides \u201cmaterially false information to a judge\u201d or to \u201ca law enforcement officer that significantly obstructed or impeded the official investigation or prosecution of the instant offense.\u201d \u00a7 3C1.1, comment. (n.4(f) and (g)). \u201cMaterial\u201d means \u201cevidence, fact, statement, or information that, if believed, would tend to influence or affect the issue under determination.\u201d \u00a7 3C1.1, comment, (n.6).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-13\">The district court adjusted appellant\u2019s base offense level pursuant to \u00a7 3C1.1 because appellant provided materially false statements to the FBI and to the court during the sentencing hearing. The false statements to the FBI were material because they affected law enforcement\u2019s ability to apprehend all culpable parties and recover the stolen money; hence, the statements impeded the official investigation or prosecution of the offense in this case. The statements to the court were material since they related to relevant conduct: what did appellant do with the money and who else was involved in the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-15\">We review a variance from the Guidelines sentencing range for reasonableness under the abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>United States v. Shaw. </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1232, 1237 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2847, 174 L.Ed.2d 566 (2009). Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the district court was required to impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in [\u00a7 3553(a)(2) ],\u201d for, among other things, to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter others from committing the offense, and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s predictable criminal behavior. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A),(B), and (C). The court complied with this requirement here. It varied upward from the sentencing range because, as the court stated, the offense was \u201cvery serious, involving a large amount of money based upon a circumstance of a man who was a trusted employee for a very important job.\u201d Moreover, the variance was required to deter others, like appellant, who might be \u201cin positions where they are given trust\u201d and \u201chandle large amounts of cash.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Appellant\u2019s sentence of 84 months is well below the maximum sentence that could have been imposed, 120 months imprisonment. Given the court\u2019s sentencing objectives, the satisfaction of the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) and (B) sentencing goals, we conclude that appellant has not shown his sentence to be unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
