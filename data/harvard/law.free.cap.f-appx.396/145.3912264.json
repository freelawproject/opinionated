He reserved his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress evidence. His sole contention on appeal is that the policeman\u2019s affidavit supporting the search warrant was a \u201cbare bones\u201d affidavit so lacking in any indicia of probable cause that reliance on the warrant was unreasonable. He argues that the affidavit revealed no basis for the knowledge or reliability of two confidential informants (CIs) and that the CIs\u2019 information did not support a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-21\">If a search warrant is supported by more than a bare bones affidavit, the officers executing the warrant may rely in good faith on the warrant, even if it is subsequently invalidated. <em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 922-23, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984); <em>United States v. Satterwhite, </em>980 F.2d 317, 321 (5th Cir.1992). A bare bones affidavit is one that contains wholly conclusory statements and is \u201cso lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable.\u201d <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 923, 104 S.Ct. 3405; <em>Satterwhite, </em>980 F.2d at 321 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We apply de novo review to the sufficiency of the warrant and to the reasonableness of a policeman\u2019s reliance on the warrant. <em>Satterwhite, </em>980 F.2d at 321; see <em>United States v. Cherna, </em>184 F.3d 403, 406-407 (5th Cir.1999). Unless the defendant\u2019s motion concerns a novel question of law, it is unnecessary to address the issue of whether there was probable cause for the search if we determine that the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule applies. <em>Satterwhite, </em>980 F.2d at 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-22\">Whether an affidavit is a bare bones affidavit is determined under the totality of the circumstances. <em>See United States v. Fisher, </em>22 F.3d 574, 578 (5th Cir.1994). Such a determination examines the veracity, reliability, and basis of knowledge of a confidential informant. <em>Id. </em>Although we review the sufficiency of the warrant de novo, a magistrate must be allowed to draw reasonable inferences from the affidavit, and the ultimate determination of its adequacy is entitled to great deference on review. <em>United States v. May, </em>819 F.2d 531, 535 (5th Cir.1987). \u201cTechnical requirements of elaborate specificity once <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>exacted under common law pleadings have no proper place in this area.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Rather, the affidavit must be construed \u201cin a common sense manner.\u201d <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>818 F.2d 345, 348 (5th Cir.1987) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). There is no requirement that all of an informant\u2019s tips be corroborated by police investigation in order to be considered credible. <em>See United States v. Blount, </em>123 F.3d 831, 836 (5th Cir.1997) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">The affidavit stated in pertinent part that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-5\">Your Affiant has received information from a Confidential Informant, referred to as a Cl that the Cl has personally seen SHAW in possession of two (2) handguns, described by the Cl as being semi-auto handguns and possibly being .45 caliber, within the last 72 hours. Your Affiant has also received information from another Cl that there is a locked box in the closet in this one bedroom apartment that contains an additional handgun. Your Affiant has also received information from numerous concerned citizens that SHAW has been seen carrying a handgun on his, SHAWS, person. The Cl\u2019s have been proven true, correct, and reliable in past.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">This case does not concern a novel question of law, so we turn to the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule. We have upheld similar affidavits based on the personal observations of a previously reliable informant. <em>See United States v. McKnight, </em>953 F.2d 898, 904-05 (5th Cir.1992) (\u201cThe Constable\u2019s assertion that the confidential informant was \u2018reliable\u2019 and had \u2018furnished him with information in the past that has proved to be reliable and true\u2019 provided the magistrate with sufficient indicia of the reliability and veracity of the informant\u2019s tip.\u201d); <em>Satterwhite, </em>980 F.2d at 321 (approving of an affidavit that \u201cprovided the magistrate with facts, and not mere conclusions\u201d); <em>Christian v. McKaskle, </em>731 F.2d 1196, 1198, 1200 (5th Cir.1984) (finding that \u201ca factual basis for the credibility of an informant can be supplied by an \u2018explicit claim of past reliability\u2019 \u201d; and finding that an affidavit was adequate where the Cl asserted that he saw drugs at a location within the previous 24 hours). In this case, it is notable there were two distinct, previously reliable confidential informants who provided information about the defendant\u2019s possession of firearms, as well as information from \u201cnumerous concerned citizens.\u201d Additionally, the second confidential informant provided a specific description of where the handgun could be found in the defendant\u2019s apartment, providing a sufficient nexus between the evidence and the place to be searched. Under a common sense reading of the affidavit, a magistrate could presume that the second confidential informant must have had some familiarity with the defendant\u2019s residence in order to describe the firearm\u2019s location with such specificity. The police officer-affiant, who also participated in the search, explained at the defendant\u2019s suppression hearing that the defendant\u2019s address was common knowledge to him based on years of patrolling the area and his recent investigation of the defendant for drug trafficking.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">Under the totality of the circumstances, and affording proper deference to the magistrate who read the affidavit and issued the warrant, the affidavit set forth ample facts and circumstances from which the magistrate could reasonably find probable cause. The good faith exception to the exclusionary rule therefore applies, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b171-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
