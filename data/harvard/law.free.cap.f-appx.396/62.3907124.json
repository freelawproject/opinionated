After briefing in this case was complete, Cortinovis submitted a letter pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(j) notifying us of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2577, 177 L.Ed.2d 68 (2010). Because the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Caraehuri-Rosendo </em>rejected the same reasoning used by the BIA in Cortinovis\u2019s case, Cortinovis argues that the BIA\u2019s decision should be overturned, and that his case should be remanded to the BIA for reconsideration of his application for cancellation of removal. The Respondent concurs with Cortinovis\u2019s request for a remand. Because the legal basis for the BIA\u2019s determination that Cortinovis was ineligible for cancellation of removal was invalidated by the Supreme Court in <em>Caraehuri-Rosendo, </em>we GRANT his petition for review and REMAND this case to the BIA for further proceedings to adjudicate his application for cancellation of removal. In light of the remand, we decline to address the remaining issues raised in Cortinovis\u2019s initial brief. We also deny Cortinovis\u2019s request to issue an order permitting him to reenter the United States at this time.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b89-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
