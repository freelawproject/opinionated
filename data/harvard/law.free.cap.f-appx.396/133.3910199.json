We conclude that the district court properly granted UDC judgment on the pleadings, and that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Garcia\u2019s motion for leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-16\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b160-17\">Garcia\u2019s common-law husband, Jorge Vargas, was killed in a single-car crash on July 15, 2008. Garcia\u2019s sparse complaint-just eight sentences of factual allegations \u2014 indicates that UDC employed Vargas and \u201csent him to various job sites in different states.\u201d A medical examiner determined that his blood-alcohol content at the time of death was 0.12%, well above the legal limit. Garcia\u2019s complaint states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-18\">[Vargas] should not have been driving. Worse, it is apparent from the early time of the accident as well as its temporal proximity to his leaving the drilling site, that Jorge Vargas has been given alcohol to drink while working, yet sent to drive home alone despite his severe intoxication.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-19\">The complaint makes no further factual allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-20\">Garcia filed her complaint in state court on March 16, 2009. Several weeks later, UDC filed an answer and removed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>case to federal court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court issued a pretrial order on August 26, 2009, mandating that all amendments to pleadings be filed no later than December 1, 2009. The pretrial order also called for discovery to be completed no later than April 30, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">On February 12, 2010, UDC filed its motion to dismiss and motion for judgment on the pleadings. On March 5, 2010, Garcia filed her opposition memorandum. She also filed a motion for leave to amend her complaint, three months after the deadline to amend pleadings. Garcia sought to amend to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-6\">(1) correct the names of the parties to this lawsuit; (2) set forth [her] allegations under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; (3) add allegations concerning Oklahoma law; (4) add allegations concerning defendant\u2019s knowledge of decedent\u2019s intoxication; and (5) add allegations concerning the degree of control exercised by defendant over decedent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdH\">The district court denied Garcia\u2019s motion for leave to amend and granted UDC\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>motions to dismiss and motions for judgment on the pleadings. The standard is the same for both. Viewing the facts as pled in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, a motion to dismiss or for a judgment on the pleadings should not be granted if a complaint provides enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. Moreover, the complaint must allege more than labels and conclusions, a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do, and factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief about the specula-five level.\u201d <em>Jebaco, Inc. v. Harrah\u2019s Operating Co., Inc., </em>587 F.3d 314, 318 (5th Cir.2009) (internal citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">\u201cWe review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s denial of leave to amend.\u201d <em>S &amp; W Enters. v. Southtrust Bank of Ala., </em>315 F.3d 533, 535 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-12\">A. Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings</p>\n<p id=\"b161-13\">We review first the district court\u2019s order granting UDC judgment on the pleadings. The district court concluded that Garcia\u2019s sparse complaint failed to lay out the elements of her claims, much less facts that would make her claims plausible. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-14\">Under Texas law, Garcia\u2019s claims of negligence and gross negligence require proof that Vargas\u2019s employer exercised control over Vargas and that the employer failed to act in a reasonably prudent manner \u201cto prevent the employee from causing an unreasonable risk of harm to others.\u201d <em>Otis Eng\u2019g Corp. v. Clark, </em>668 S.W.2d 307, 310 (Tex.1983). Garcia\u2019s complaint plainly fails to allege that Vargas\u2019s employer exercised control over Vargas while Vargas was drinking. Moreover, if Vargas\u2019s employer carried any duty, it would be to prevent Vargas from causing an unreasonable risk of harm <em>to others. See id. </em>As the district court noted, Texas courts have refused to extend the <em>Otis </em>duty to preventing incapacitated persons from harming themselves. <em>See Verdeur v. King Hospitality Corp., </em>872 S.W.2d 300, 302 (Tex.1994) <em>(\u201c[Otis </em>] does not create a duty which requires an employer to protect an intoxicated employee from injuring herself.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Likewise, Garcia\u2019s claims under the Texas Dram Shop Act, Tex. Alco. Bev.Code Ann. \u00a7 2.02 (West 2007), similarly fail to allege that Vargas\u2019s employer was a <em>provider </em>of alcoholic beverages within the meaning of \u00a7 2.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">B. Motion for Leave to Amend</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">We next review the district court\u2019s denial of Garcia\u2019s motion for leave to amend. As a general matter, courts should grant leave to amend pleadings \u201cfreely ... when justice so requires.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a). Normally, \u201cleave to amend is to be granted liberally unless the movant has acted in bad faith or with a dilatory motive, granting the motion would cause prejudice, or amendment would be futile.\u201d <em>Jebaco Inc. v. Harrah\u2019s Operating Co. Inc., </em>587 F.3d 314, 322 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">However, when a pretrial scheduling order\u2019s deadline to amend has expired, as was the case here, amendments are governed by the more strict Rule 16 standard rather than the liberal Rule 15 standard. <em>S &amp; W Enters. v. Southtrust Bank of Ala., </em>315 F.3d 533, 536 (5th Cir.2003). Under Rule 16, late amendments may be accepted \u201conly for good cause and with the judge\u2019s consent.\u201d Fed.R.CivP. 16(b). In the Fifth Circuit, \u201cthe good cause standard requires the party seeking relief to show that the deadlines cannot reasonably be met despite the diligence of the party needing the extension.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 535 (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">We have articulated four factors relevant to determining good cause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-8\">(1) the explanation for the failure to timely move for leave to amend; (2) the importance of the amendment; (3) potential prejudice in allowing the amendment; and (4) the availability of a continuance to cure such prejudice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-9\"><em>Sw. Bell Tel. Co. v. City of El Paso, </em>346 F.3d 541, 546-47 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">At no time has Garcia offered an explanation for her nearly year-long delay in amending her pleadings, nor has she proffered an excuse for missing the December 1, 2009 amendment deadline. Further, the district court found that even if Garcia were allowed to amend her complaint in the five ways she described, the outcome would be no different: \u201cNone of these proposed amendments change the Court\u2019s determination that Garcia\u2019s claims against Unit Drilling fail as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">Allowing Garcia to add Oklahoma law claims would require UDC to respond to additional discovery. As the district court noted, \u201c[i]n the face of an impending discovery-close date and dispositive-motion cut-off date, requiring Unit Drilling to defend against new factual allegations would be unfair and prejudicial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">Finally, UDC\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings hardly came as a surprise to Garcia. UDC raised these deficiencies as an affirmative defense on May 6, 2009: \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 Original Petition fails to state a cause of action upon which relief may be granted for negligence and gross negligence against Defendants for violation of the Texas Dram Shop Act.\u201d Thus, Garcia was on notice seven months before the amendment deadline that UDC believed her complaint to be deficient. Garcia had ample time to amend, and such amendments would have been allowed almost as a matter of course if done before December 1, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-13\">While some district courts might have reached a different conclusion on the belated motion for leave to amend, we review only for abuse of discretion, and we find none. Garcia has failed to show that she could not meet the court\u2019s deadline \u201cdespite [her] diligence,\u201d <em>S &amp; W Enters., </em>315 F.3d at 535. We see no compelling reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>to overturn the \u201csound discretion of the district court\u201d in this instance. <em>Nance, </em>817 F.2d at 1180. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b160-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b161-9\">. The original complaint listed two additional defendants that were later terminated from the lawsuit pursuant to a joint stipulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
