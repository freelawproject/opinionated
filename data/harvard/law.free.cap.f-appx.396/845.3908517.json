We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-28\">Rosario filed a habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 challenging his 2001 conviction in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. Rosario was convicted of conspiracy to commit robbery and attempted robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951 (Hobbs Act), use of a firearm in relation to crimes of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1), and four counts of murder. In his petition, Rosario focused on claims of actual innocence and newly discovered evidence; he also raised, but did not describe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>or argue, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Rosario alleged that the sole witness the Government relied upon to prove the interstate commerce element of the Hobbs Act offenses perjured himself by testifying differently a year later in a civil case than he did at Rosario\u2019s trial. He claimed that the transcript from the civil case reveals the alleged perjury, and that it is newly discovered evidence of his actual innocence of the Hobbs Act offenses (because there was insufficient evidence of the interstate commerce element) and the lack of jurisdiction of the sentencing court. Rosario also claimed that the transcript shows that the witness was a paid informant and that the Government failed to disclose this fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">The Magistrate Judge recommended that Rosario\u2019s petition be dismissed because a motion to vacate sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 filed in the sentencing court is the exclusive means to challenge his conviction. The Magistrate Judge noted that Rosario had filed a \u00a7 2255 motion with the sentencing court, as well as a request to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, and that both were denied. Nonetheless, the Magistrate Judge concluded that Rosario\u2019s claims did not satisfy the narrow exception allowing a petition to be filed under \u00a7 2241 where a \u00a7 2255 motion would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d to test the legality of detention. The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s report and recommendation and dismissed the petition. Rosario filed a motion for reconsideration, which the District Court also denied. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">As recognized by the District Court, \u201c[mjotions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 are the presumptive means by which federal prisoners can challenge their convictions or sentences that are allegedly in violation of the Constitution.\u201d <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir.2002). Although a petitioner may challenge a conviction pursuant to \u00a7 2241 where a \u00a7 2255 motion would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective,\u201d a \u00a7 2255 motion is not inadequate or ineffective because the sentencing court denies relief, the one-year statute of limitations has expired, or the petitioner is unable to meet \u00a7 2255\u2019s ga-tekeeping requirements. <em>Cradle v. United States, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538-39 (3d Cir.2002) (per curiam). Rather, a \u00a7 2255 motion is inadequate or ineffective \u201conly where the petitioner demonstrates that some limitation of scope or procedure would prevent a \u00a7 2255 proceeding from affording him a full hearing and adjudication of his wrongful detention claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 538. <em>See also In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 248-52 (3d Cir.1997) (construing \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d provision of \u00a7 2255).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-10\">Rosario has not made such a showing. He explains that he tried to raise his claims before the sentencing court, but the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied his request to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion \u201cwithout prejudice to filing a 28 U.S.C. 2241 motion in the district court\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that we should \u201ccorrect this error.\u201d App. Mem. of Law, filed June 3, 2010. Rosario provided a copy of the Second Circuit\u2019s order, which states that his request to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion was denied because he did not satisfy the criteria for a such a motion, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h), and that his actual innocence claim does not fall within the savings clause, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e), because he failed to show that he could not have raised his claim at an earlier time.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>The fact that Rosario did not meet the stringent requirements for filing a second \u00a7 2255 motion does not mean that a \u00a7 2255 motion is \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d such that Rosario may proceed via \u00a7 2241. <em>Cradle, </em>290 F.3d at 539. Furthermore, Rosario\u2019s claims are based upon the transcript of a deposition that he says took place in 2002, about eight years ago. Rosario has failed to show that this evidence is new or that he could not have raised his claims earlier. The \u201csafety valve\u201d provided by \u00a7 2255(e) is a narrow one that applies only in rare situations, such as when a prisoner has had no prior opportunity to challenge his conviction for a crime later deemed not criminal due to a change in the law. <em>See In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d at 251. Rosario has not demonstrated that his is such a rare situation. Because this appeal does not raise a substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b872-6\">. The copy of the order Rosario provided does not show this language. However, even if it were present, it would not alter the fact that Rosario has failed to show that \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
