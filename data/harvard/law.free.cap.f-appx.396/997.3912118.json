In his motion, Sanders asserted that he was transferred between prison units on June 18, 2010, and did not regain access to the Indigent Mail Program until June 26, 2010, on which date he provided the court with a notice of his change of address. Sanders requested an extension of time as \u201cnecessary for reasons beyond his control, such as unit transfers, transient status, and use of the Uniform Access to Courts Indigent Mail Process.\u201d The district court found that Sanders had not provided any explanation for why he was unable to file his notice of appeal between June 26 and July 22, 2010. The district court denied the motion, finding that Sanders had not shown good cause for the extension of time.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the extension motion,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and we affirm that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-15\">Sanders\u2019s notice of appeal of the district court\u2019s summary judgment for Martinez was untimely; therefore, this court does not have jurisdiction to hear his appeal of the judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Sanders had 80 days to file a notice appeal with the district court from the date judgment was entered.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judgment was entered on June 22, 2010. Sanders filed his notice of appeal on August 19, 2010, outside of the prescribed time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-16\">* <em>* </em>*</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-17\">The order denying the extension of time to file a notice of appeal is AFFIRMED; the motion to dismiss the appeal of the summary judgment is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1024-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
