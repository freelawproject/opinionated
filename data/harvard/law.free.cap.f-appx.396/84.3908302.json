In 1979, Castaneda pleaded guilty to conspiracy to transport illegal aliens within the United States by means of a motor vehicle, and he was sentenced to three years probation. In 2007, the Department of Homeland Security instituted removal proceedings against Castaneda. An immigration judge (IJ) determined that Castaneda was subject to removal and denied Castaneda\u2019s request for a waiver of deportability under former \u00a7 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which, prior to its repeal, was codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c). The IJ ordered Castaneda removed to Mexico. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) dismissed Castaneda\u2019s appeal. Castaneda filed a timely petition for review in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-21\">Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), we lack jurisdiction to consider challenges to a removal order based on the commission of an aggravated felony. <em>See Hernandez-Castillo v. Moore, </em>436 F.3d 516, 519 (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>Cir.2006). Nevertheless, no jurisdiction-stripping provision of the INA \u201cshall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised on a petition for review.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Hernandez-Castillo, </em>436 F.3d at 519. The substantive issues raised by Castaneda in this court challenge the BIA\u2019s legal determinations that Castaneda was not eligible for a waiver of deportability under former INA \u00a7 212(c) because (1) the ground for his removal did not have an inadmissibility statutory counterpart, and (2) the statutory counterpart requirement is impermissibly retroactive. Consequently, we have jurisdiction to consider Castaneda\u2019s petition for review. <em>See Brieva-Perez v. Gonzales, </em>482 F.3d 356, 359 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Castaneda contends that the BIA erred by ruling that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)(i) is not the statutory counterpart to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(N). The BIA so ruled because (1) the statutory subsections used dissimilar language, (2) 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(N) included offenses concerning aliens who were already in the United States while 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)(i) did not, and (3) 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)(i) was the statutory counterpart of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(E)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">The BIA properly applied its comparability analysis based on the dissimilarity in the language used in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(N) and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)\u00ae and because 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)\u00ae was more comparable to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(E)\u00ae. <em>See Leon-Medina v. Holder, </em>351 Fed.Appx. 881 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Popoca v. Holder, </em>320 Fed.Appx. 252, 253-59 (5th Cir.2009). Accordingly, Castaneda is statutorily ineligible for relief under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">Castaneda also contends that the BIA\u2019s statutory-counterpart requirement is im-permissibly retroactive. This argument is unavailing. <em>Vo v. Gonzales, </em>482 F.3d 363, 369-71 (5th Cir.2007). Consequently, Castaneda\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b110-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
