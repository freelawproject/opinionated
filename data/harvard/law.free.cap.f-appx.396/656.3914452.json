The district court dismissed the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim, Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-17\">In her complaint, Plaintiff alleged that Defendant \u2014 an Alabama circuit court judge- in the domestic relations division\u2014 violated her constitutional rights based on his rulings in a proceeding between Plaintiff and her ex-husband about the modification of their child custody agreement. Plaintiff sought equitable relief in addition to attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The district court concluded that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs claim for equitable relief under the <em>Rooker-Feld-man doctrine.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>And to the extent Plaintiff sought money damages, the court concluded that judicial immunity barred Plaintiffs suit and granted Defendant\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-18\">On appeal, Plaintiff largely repeats the allegations she made in her complaint about Defendant\u2019s allegedly illegal and unconstitutional acts in the custody proceedings. She argues that neither the <em>Rooker-Feldmcm </em>doctrine nor judicial immunity precluded consideration of her claims because the state judgment was based on the corruption of the judicial process and violated her civil rights. She asks that Defendant\u2019s orders in the case be deemed void as a matter of law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-19\">The <em>Roolcer-Feldman </em>doctrine precludes federal courts \u2014 other than the United States Supreme Court \u2014 from re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>viewing final judgments of state courts. <em>Casale, </em>558 F.3d at 1260. <em>Rooker-Feld-man </em>bars lower federal court jurisdiction in \u201ccases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1261 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">We conclude, as did the district court, that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>criteria are satisfied. Defendant ruled against Plaintiff in the custody proceeding; thus, Plaintiff was the losing party in state court. The state proceeding had ended: Plaintiff noted in her complaint that the state court issued its order modifying the custody agreement almost two years before she filed her section 1983 complaint. And in her section 1983 complaint, Plaintiff alleged injuries \u2014 including her loss of custody, contempt sentence, and financial hardship \u2014 caused by Defendant\u2019s state court rulings. Finally, Plaintiff sought to have the federal court \u201creview and reject\u201d the state court proceedings because she wished to have Defendant\u2019s rulings declared void as a matter of law. <em>See id. </em>(observing that, when a party believes that the state court erred, the proper remedy is direct appeal, and not an attack in federal court); <em>see also Staley v. Ledbetter, </em>837 F.2d 1016, 1017-18 (11th Cir.1988) (concluding that we lacked subject-matter jurisdiction under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine to consider a party\u2019s section 1983 claim that \u201cin essence sought to reverse a state court\u2019s child custody determination\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">To the extent Plaintiff sought money damages, the district court concluded correctly that she stated no claim for relief because Defendant was entitled to absolute judicial immunity. <em>See Sibley, </em>437 F.3d at 1070-71 &amp; n. 3 (the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine does not apply when a party seeks money damages for the state court\u2019s alleged constitutional deprivations). Judges are entitled to absolute judicial immunity from damages under section 1983 for those acts taken while they are acting in their judicial capacity unless they acted in the clear absence of all jurisdiction. <em>Mireles v. Waco, </em>502 U.S. 9, 112 S.Ct. 286, 288, 116 L.Ed.2d 9 (1991). A judge does not act in the \u201cclear absence of all jurisdiction\u201d when he acts erroneously, maliciously, or in excess of his authority, but instead, only when he acts without subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>Dykes v. Hosemann, </em>776 F.2d 942, 947-48 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">Here, the acts about which Plaintiff complained were related directly to the adjudication of her custody case. <em>See Sibley, </em>437 F.3d at 1070 (explaining that acts constituting normal judicial functions, events occurring in the judge\u2019s chambers or in open court, and acts about cases pending before the judge are taken in a judicial capacity). Even if Defendant\u2019s acts \u2014 including allegedly basing his decision on false evidence and suborning perjury \u2014 were erroneous or malicious, as Plaintiff contends, it does not change that the acts were undertaken in a judicial ca-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>parity. And Plaintiff fails to show that Defendant acted in the clear absence of subject-matter jurisdiction; in fact, in her complaint, Plaintiff conceded that Defendant was a circuit court judge with jurisdiction to hear custody cases.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">We reject Plaintiffs argument that she was entitled to an evidentiary hearing in the district court on judicial immunity. Plaintiffs case was before the court on a motion to dismiss. And a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim \u201calways presents a purely legal question; there are no issues of fact because the allegations contained in the pleading are presumed to be true.\u201d <em>See Chudasama v. Mazda Motor Corp., </em>123 F.3d 1353, 1367 (11th Cir.1997). Because an evidentiary hearing would have served no purpose, the district court abused no discretion in denying Plaintiffs request for one.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b683-13\">. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusion that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>Casale v. Tillman, </em>558 F.3d 1258, 1260 (11th Cir.2009). And we review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. <em>Clark v. Riley, </em>595 F.3d 1258, 1264 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b683-14\">. <em>D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>Rooker v. Fid. Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b683-21\">.We note that, when a licensed lawyer appears <em>pro se, </em>we do not provide her pleadings with the liberal construction customarily reserved for other <em>pro se </em>litigants. <em>Olivares v. Martin, </em>555 F.2d 1192, 1194 n. 1 (5th Cir.1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b684-5\">. We also agree with the district court\u2019s alternative analysis for concluding that, even if it had subject-matter jurisdiction over Plaintiff's claims for equitable relief, Plaintiff did not satisfy the requirements of section 1983 for suing a judge for equitable relief. <em>See Sibley v. Lando, </em>437 F.3d 1067, 1073 (11th Cir.2005) (to receive declaratory or injunctive relief, \"plaintiffs must establish ... the absence of an adequate remedy at law\u201d). Because Plaintiff could have appealed the orders at issue to a higher state court, she had an adequate remedy at law and was unentitled to equitable relief under section 1983. <em>See </em>Ala. Code \u00a7 12-3-10 (providing a right to appeal domestic relations cases to the Alabama Court of Civil Appeals).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"AWc\">. Plaintiff's claim that Defendant was criminally liable under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242 and, thus, not shielded by immunity, is meritless. Section 242 provides no basis for damages under section 1983. <em>See Hanna v. Home Ins. Co., </em>281 F.2d 298, 303 (5th Cir.1960).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
