According the Commissioner\u2019s decision the deference required by law, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">In 2004, Monica Gilabert filed an application for disability benefits, alleging an inability to work due to bipolar and panic disorders, spastic colon, and thyroid disease. She claimed an onset date of November 16, 2003, soon after she lost her job as a makeup artist.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-11\">Gilabert experienced numerous medical difficulties after her alleged onset date.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She suffered physical complications following a 2003 gastric bypass operation, including a spastic colon and gastric ulcer that required her hospitalization. In February 2005, Gilabert was admitted to the hospital after overdosing on Seroquel and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and opiate dependence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In May 2005, Gilabert was involuntarily admitted to Orlando Regional Hospital for suicidal ideation. In August 2005, she was admitted to the hospital again for moderate bipolar disorder and stimulant abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-16\">In October 2006, Dr. Adly Thebaud, Gi-labert\u2019s treating physician, completed a mental residual functioning capacity (RFC) evaluation for Gilabert. He noted that she was having hallucinations and that she was paranoid. He stated that she suffered from depression, mood swings, irritability, and could not handle work stress, concentrate, or function in the workplace. Despite this assessment, between 2003 and 2007, Thebaud consistently rated Gila-bert\u2019s Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) from the high 50s to 60s, a rating indicating only moderate difficulty in functioning. In March 2004, Thebaud also stopped all of Gilabert\u2019s medications except Trazodone after Gilabert informed him that she was pregnant.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-17\">Two other doctors also performed RFC evaluations on Gilabert between 2003 and 2007.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In June 2004, Dr. Alvarez-Mullin completed an RFC and noted that Gilabert had suffered only mild limits on her daily activities and social functioning. He also found that Gilabert had moderate limitations in concentration but had the ability to work a full week. In May 2005, Dr. Bee completed a psychiatric review at the state\u2019s request. Although he noted Gila-bert\u2019s mood disturbance and panic disorder, he found only mild limits on her social functioning and concentration. He also completed an RFC consistent with Dr. Alvarez-Mullin\u2019s evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>After her initial application for disability benefits was denied, Gilabert appealed this decision to an administrative law judge (ALJ). At a hearing in February 2007, Dr. Neil Lewis testified as a consulting psychologist for the Commissioner of Social Security. Lewis disagreed with Thebaud\u2019s 2006 RFC evaluation, stating that it was inconsistent with the level of severity described in Thebaud\u2019s progress notes and in the GAF scores he assigned Gilabert. In rebuttal, Gilabert introduced Thebaud\u2019s deposition testimony. This testimony stated that he had based the RFC on his progress notes and his experience treating Gilabert. He also testified that although Gilabert\u2019s bipolar disorder would make her appear more normal at times, during the mood swings she was unable to function and could not work. At a supplemental hearing, Lewis responded to Thebaud\u2019s deposition testimony. He agreed that Gila-bert had a documented history of chronic affective disorder that had caused more than minimal limitations on her ability to work for at least two years, but he noted that on some occasions Gilabert\u2019s mental status exams indicated that her concentration was fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">After hearing this evidence, the ALJ stated that if he found Dr. Thebaud\u2019s RFC credible, \u201cthere would be no question that [Gilabert could not] work.\u201d In his decision, however, the ALJ \u201cdiscredited\u201d Dr. Thebaud\u2019s RFC as inconsistent with The-baud\u2019s own notes and the medical record as a whole. In particular, the ALJ noted that Dr. Thebaud\u2019s GAF scores did not support the level of disability in the RFC. Giving weight to the opinions of the non-examining physicians and taking the record evidence as a whole, he concluded that Gilabert did not qualify for disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Gilabert appealed this decision to the district court, arguing that the ALJ had failed to give the necessary weight to opinion of her treating physician, Thebaud, and that substantial evidence did not support the ALJ\u2019s decision. The district court approved the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It concluded that the ALJ had given the proper weight to Thebaud\u2019s notes but not to the RFC assessment because the RFC was inconsistent with those notes. Gilabert appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">When reviewing the ALJ\u2019s decision, we ask whether it was supported by substantial evidence and whether the correct legal standards were applied. <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cSubstantial evidence is something more than a mere scintilla, but less than a preponderance. If the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, this court must affirm, even if the proof preponderates against it.\u201d <em>Dyer v. Barnhart, </em>395 F.3d 1206, 1210 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation <em>marks </em>omitted). Under this limited standard of review, we will not decide the facts anew, make credibility determinations, or re-weigh the evidence. <em>Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1211.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">Gilabert argues that the ALJ applied the wrong legal standard and made findings unsupported by substantial evidence when he discredited Thebaud\u2019s RFC and relied on the opinion of a non-examining consultant. In particular, she contends that the ALJ was required to consider Thebaud\u2019s RFC because it was consistent with his progress notes and her frequent hospitalizations. Furthermore, she argues that the ALJ\u2019s reliance on Thebaud\u2019s GAF scores to discredit his RFC was unwarranted because GAF scores do not take into consideration occupational functioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>The opinion of a treating physician \u201cmust be given substantial or considerable weight unless \u2018good cause\u2019 is shown to the contrary.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1440 (11th Cir.1997). Good cause is shown when the: \u201c(1) treating physician\u2019s opinion was not bolstered by the evidence; (2) evidence supported a contrary finding; or (3) treating physician\u2019s opinion was con-clusory or inconsistent with the doctor\u2019s own medical records.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1241 (11th Cir.2004). Where the ALJ articulated specific reasons for failing to give the opinion of a treating physician controlling weight, and those reasons are supported by substantial evidence, there is no reversible error. <em>Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1212.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">In this case, therefore, the critical question is whether substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s articulated reasons for rejecting Thebaud\u2019s RFC. The ALJ explained that Thebaud\u2019s RFC was \u201cinconsistent with his own treatment record, as well as inaccurate.\u201d In particular, he found that Thebaud\u2019s RFC assessment conflicted with his frequent decisions to assign Gila-bert GAF scores that indicated only moderate psychiatric symptoms. The ALJ also cited Lewis\u2019s testimony as further evidence of this discrepancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Here, more than a \u201cmere scintilla\u201d of evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s reasoning. <em>Dyer, </em>395 F.3d at 1210. It is undisputed that the GAF scores Thebaud assigned to Gilabert indicated only moderate difficulty in functioning and were therefore inconsistent with the severe limitations that The-baud outlined in his RFC assessment. Furthermore, two non-examining consultants found Gilabert to have only mild to moderate psychiatric symptoms. Finally, Thebaud took Gilabert off all of her medications except Trazodone in March 2004 when she reported that she was pregnant, providing further evidence that her condition was not as severe as Thebaud\u2019s RFC suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">Accordingly, the decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b679-12\">. Prior to her onset date, Gilabert had been diagnosed with recurrent and moderate depression, panic disorder, and anxiety.
