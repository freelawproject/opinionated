Nwokedi asserts that the IJ erred by denying his motion to continue. Nwokedi, however, does not brief any argument regarding the BIA\u2019s determination that he failed to show good cause for a continuance. He also does not address the BIA\u2019s determination that he failed to show that the denial of his motion to continue violated any of his statutory or regulatory rights or that his hearing was unfair. Nwokedi\u2019s conclusional statement on appeal about the denial of his motion to continue is insufficient to preserve the issue for review. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Nwokedi, who is represented by counsel, is not entitled to a liberal construction of his arguments. <em>See Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972) (pro se briefs must be liberally construed). Because Nwokedi\u2019s counsel failed to sufficiently argue whether the motion to continue was improperly denied, the issue is abandoned. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993) (arguments not briefed on appeal are deemed abandoned).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Nwokedi\u2019s appeal also conclusionally states that he qualifies and is entitled to cancellation of removal. The IJ found that Nwokedi was not entitled to cancellation of removal because he could not prove the ten year continuous presence requirement or the exceptional and extremely unusual hardship requirement. Nwokedi fails to identify and brief any arguments challenging these reasons for the denial of relief. Thus, these issues are deemed abandoned. <em>Yohey, </em>985 F.2d at 224-25; <em>Brinkmann, </em>813 F.2d at 748. Furthermore, even if Nwokedi\u2019s challenge to the denial of cancellation of removal was not abandoned, under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, this court does not have jurisdiction to review any judgment regarding the granting or denying of discretionary relief in the form of cancellation of removal. <em>See Rueda v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 831, 831 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Nwokedi\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED. His motion to stay his removal is DENIED as MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b111-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
