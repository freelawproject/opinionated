His application was denied based on the adverse credibility determination of the immigration judge (IJ), which was upheld by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) when it dismissed Qing\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-22\">As detailed below, Qing contends the record does not support the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determinations. This court has authority to review only the order of the BIA unless the underlying decision of the IJ influenced the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). Because the IJ\u2019s findings influenced the BIA\u2019s decision to affirm the denial of Qing\u2019s application, this court reviews both decisions. <em>Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 593-94 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-23\">Qing maintains: he fully explained why he filed an initial false application; his explanation was reasonable enough to overcome any adverse inference; he did <em>not </em>present inconsistent evidence; the inconsistencies identified by the IJ and BIA do <em>not </em>concern the basis of his claim and are insufficient to sustain an adverse credibility finding; and, the IJ\u2019s finding that his demeanor reflected poorly on his credibility should be given little weight because the IJ failed to give a specific description of his demeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-24\">An immigration court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for substantial evidence. <em>E.g., Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 536 (5th Cir.2009). That an alien is <em>not </em>eligible for asylum, withholding of removal, or relief under the CAT are findings of fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>reviewed for substantial evidence. <em>Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 344-45 (5th Cir.2005). In other words, an immigration court\u2019s factual findings will <em>not </em>be reversed unless \u201cthe evidence was so compelling that <em>no </em>reasonable factfinder could conclude against it\u201d. <em>Wang, </em>569 F.3d at 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Under the REAL ID Act of 2005, \u201can IJ may rely on <em>any </em>inconsistency or omission in making an adverse credibility determination as long as the totality of the circumstances establishes that an asylum applicant is not credible\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 538 (emphasis in original, internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see also 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). As stated, we will \u201cdefer therefore to an IJ\u2019s credibility determination unless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that <em>no </em>reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling\u201d. <em>Wang, </em>569 F.3d at 538 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Qing admitted to falsely claiming, in his first application, that he was persecuted for violating the Chinese government\u2019s family-planning policy; he claimed he lied because he feared persecution by the Chinese government if he told immigration officials he was persecuted for supporting Falun Gong. The IJ determined reasonably that Qing\u2019s explanation was incredible in the light of: the large sum of money ($70,000) he paid to be smuggled into the United States, purportedly because he was persecuted for supporting Falun Gong; his concession that he was already identified by the Chinese government as a Falun Gong supporter.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The adverse credibility finding is also supported by: the IJ\u2019s findings that Qing\u2019s demeanor reflected poorly on his credibility; Qing offered inconsistent and fabricated testimony and evidence in support of his application; Qing points to no evidence that compels a contrary conclusion, <em>see id. </em>at 539-40; and, Qing\u2019s assertion that these inconsistencies do <em>not </em>concern the basis of his claim and, therefore, do <em>not </em>compel an adverse credibility finding is based on the pre-REAL ID Act standard for assessing credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">In the light of Qing\u2019s false claim in his first application and the other inconsistencies and incredible testimony found by the IJ, it is <em>not </em>plain that \u201cno reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 538 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Qing\u2019s claims (asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the CAT) were all based on persecution for supporting Falun Gong. Because the credibility determinations of the IJ and BIA withstand review, the decision to deny Qing relief is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Zhang, </em>432 F.3d at 344-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b181-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
