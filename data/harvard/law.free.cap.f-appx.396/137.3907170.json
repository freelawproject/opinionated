She filed suit against Monsanto, claiming that she was dismissed in retaliation for protected activity under the Louisiana Environmental Whistleblower Statute, La.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 30:2027. Specifically, she alleged that she had been dismissed in retaliation for communicating with other employees about her reasonable, albeit erroneous, belief that a chemical spill had taken place that was legally required to be reported to state or federal authorities. Alexander subsequently amended her complaint to additionally allege that she was dismissed because of her race, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. The case went to trial and a jury ruled in Monsanto\u2019s favor. The district court accordingly entered judgment for Monsanto, and we now affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">Alexander raises four issues on appeal. First, she claims that counsel for Monsanto misstated the plaintiff\u2019s burden of proof under Title VII during closing argument. Second, she claims that Monsanto\u2019s counsel also misstated various facts during closing argument. Third, she claims that during voir dire, Monsanto\u2019s counsel asked questions and made remarks that misled and prejudiced prospective jurors. Fourth, she claims that the district court erred by excluding certain evidence and testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">As to the claim that Monsanto\u2019s counsel misstated the law during closing argument, the applicable standard of review is plain error because no objection was made. <em>See Alaniz v. Zamora-Quezada, </em>591 F.3d 761, 776 (5th Cir.2009). \u201cReversal is appropriate if the error is (1) plain, (2) affects the appellant\u2019s substantial rights, and (3) seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. An error is \u2018plain\u2019 if it is clear or obvious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-12\">During closing argument, Monsanto\u2019s counsel said, \u201cTo believe Ms. Alexander\u2019s story that she was terminated because of her race, you\u2019re going to have to believe that every white manager in the room is racist. You\u2019re also going to have to believe that all of these managers made up stories and lied about the fact that she was a poor performer.\u201d Alexander\u2019s counsel did not object. Alexander now argues that these comments amounted to an incorrect statement of the law because, as she puts it, \u201call that is required is to prove that race is \u2018one\u2019 factor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-13\">\u201cTitle ATI explicitly permits actions proceeding under a mixed-motive framework,\u201d in which \u201cthe employee concedes that discrimination was not the <em>sole </em>reason for her discharge, but argues that discrimination was a motivating factor in her termination.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Monitronics Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>434 F.3d 327, 333 (5th Cir.2005) (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(m)). Therefore, the statement by Monsanto\u2019s counsel was not entirely correct. In order to prevail on her discrimination claim, Alexander did not have to convince the jury that every white manager who had anything to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>with her dismissal was racist, nor that all the testimony regarding her poor performance was false. She only had to convince the jury that racial discrimination was one motivating factor in her dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">However, Alexander fails to explain why this misstatement warrants reversal under the plain error standard of review. Even if the remark was a clear or obvious misstatement of law, Alexander has not established that it affected her substantial rights \u2014 in other words, that \u201cit affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Velasquez-Torrez, </em>609 F.3d 743, 746 (5th Cir.2010). After closing arguments, the district court instructed the jury that \u201c[sjtatements and arguments of the attorneys are not evidence and are not instructions on the law.\u201d The court then correctly and specifically instructed the jury that the \u201c[pjlaintiff does not have to prove that unlawful discrimination was the only reason [the] defendant terminated her.\u201d Under these circumstances, it is unlikely that the jury rendered a verdict in Monsanto\u2019s favor because of confusion about what Alexander was required to prove.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The second issue raised by Alexander is that Monsanto\u2019s counsel misstated certain facts during closing argument. However, Alexander\u2019s brief fails to include citations to the record on appeal, and therefore provides no support for her assertions that the statements at issue were factually incorrect. \u201cNot surprisingly, the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure require that appellants, rather than the courts of appeals, ferret out and articulate the record evidence considered material to each legal theory advanced on appeal.\u201d <em>Conto v. Concord Hosp., Inc., </em>265 F.3d 79, 81 (1st Cir.2001). <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A); 5th Cir. R. 28.2.2. As a result, this issue is waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Alexander\u2019s third argument is that Monsanto\u2019s counsel engaged in misleading and prejudicial lines of questioning when speaking to prospective jurors during voir dire. This issue is again subject to plain error review because Alexander\u2019s counsel did not object to any of the remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">During voir dire, counsel for Monsanto asked prospective jurors several hypothetical questions such as, \u201c[If] somebody told you just because you are white and because you live here that they considered you a racist, would you find that offensive?\u201d These rather inflammatory questions were apparently intended to imply that Alexander believed that all white people from southeastern Louisiana are racist. On appeal, Monsanto defends this line of questioning, contending that it was \u201clegitimately based on Alexander\u2019s deposition testimony\u201d because she had \u201ctestified at her deposition that she believed all people in South Louisiana were racist\u201d and therefore \u201c[c]ounsel anticipated Alexander would testify similarly on cross-examination at trial.\u201d However, the record does not support Monsanto\u2019s assertion that Alexander ever said that all people, or all white people, in southern Louisiana were racist. At most, she stated in her deposition that, compared to Chicago, \u201cLouisiana would have a culture that leans more toward\u201d racism. Therefore, Monsanto\u2019s counsel\u2019s implication that Alexander believed that all white people from southeastern Louisiana are racist was inaccurate and unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">Nonetheless, under plain error review, Alexander has not shown that these questions during voir dire affected her substantial rights. At trial, counsel for Monsanto cross-examined Alexander regarding her beliefs about racism. (Alexander does not argue on appeal that this line of questioning during cross-examination was improper.) Counsel said to Alexander, \u201c[Y]ou <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>claimed that in this area of the country, southeast Louisiana, that people who live here have a \u2018problem\u2019 with African Americans.\u201d Alexander answered, \u201cI absolutely did not say that.\u201d She explained that she believed that \u201cthere is a percentage of the population ... who have racist hearts\u201d in southeastern Louisiana and in other places. Insofar as the jury may have considered Alexander\u2019s general beliefs about racism in southeastern Louisiana to be relevant to their decision at all, they had the opportunity to hear her testimony and to take that into account in their deliberations. Therefore, Alexander has not shown that counsel\u2019s earlier hypothetical questions about racism during voir dire affected the outcome of the trial, as required under plain error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Alexander also claims that during voir dire, Monsanto\u2019s counsel misled potential jurors regarding the Louisiana Environmental Whistleblower Statute, La.Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 30:2027. Counsel asked prospective jurors several questions regarding the difference between ordinary and legal definitions of the term \u201cwhistleblower\u201d and whether they believed that all chemical spills should be reported to the government regardless of the size of the spill or the toxicity of the chemical. Alexander\u2019s appellate brief fails to explain how any of these questions were misleading as to the whistleblower statute\u2019s requirements or as to whether Alexander fulfilled those requirements. Therefore, this issue is waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Next, Alexander claims that Monsanto\u2019s counsel misled prospective jurors regarding a \u201cperformance improvement plan\u201d which, according to Alexander, never existed. Counsel stated during voir dire that \u201cMonsanto, my client, it\u2019s their position that Ms. Alexander had several performance problems, they would put her on performance improvement plans and that she, in fact, failed to improve her performance and that\u2019s why she was terminated.\u201d This statement was not misleading: it was an accurate description of the version of the facts that was put forward by Monsanto\u2019s witnesses. Alexander had a different version of the facts, but there was nothing misleading about this statement by counsel at voir dire. It did not amount to error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">Finally, Alexander contends that the district court erred by excluding certain documentary evidence and testimony. However, this set of arguments is unavailing because Alexander does not appear to have made any offers of proof regarding the excluded evidence and testimony, as required under Fed.R.Evid. 103(a)(2). \u201c[T]his circuit will not even consider the propriety of the decision to exclude the evidence at issue, if no offer of proof was made at trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Clements, </em>73 F.3d 1330, 1336 (5th Cir.1996) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>United States v. Winkle, </em>587 F.2d 705, 710 (5th Cir.1979)) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cAlthough a <em>formal </em>offer is not required to preserve error, the party must at least inform the trial court \u2018what counsel intends to show by the evidence and why it should be admitted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Ballis, </em>28 F.3d 1399, 1406 (5th Cir.1994)). Alexander\u2019s appellate brief does not mention any offers of proof, and does not cite to any pages of the record on appeal that might indicate that offers of proof were ever made regarding the excluded evidence and testimony. Therefore, this argument is waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b165-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
