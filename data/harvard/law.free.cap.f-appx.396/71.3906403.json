McGrew, Louisiana state prisoner #413135, proceeding pro se, moves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) in an appeal of the district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice of his civil rights complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies and from the court\u2019s denial of his motion seeking a temporary restraining order (TRO) and a preliminary injunction. McGrew\u2019s IFP motion is a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). This court\u2019s inquiry into whether the appeal is taken in good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">This court lacks jurisdiction over the denial of McGrew\u2019s request for a TRO. <em>See Faulder v. Johnson, </em>178 F.3d 741, 742 (5th Cir.1999). McGrew has identified no \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d warranting a reversal of the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a preliminary injunction. <em>See White v. Carlucci, </em>862 F.2d 1209, 1211 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The district court dismissed sua sponte McGrew\u2019s civil rights complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). In <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>the Supreme Court held that an inmate\u2019s failure to exhaust is an affirmative defense and that \u201cinmates are not required to specially plead or demonstrate exhaustion in their complaints.\u201d 549 U.S. 199, 216, 127 S.Ct. 910, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007). We have interpreted <em>Jones </em>to allow a district court to \u201cdismiss a case prior to service on defendants for failure to state a claim, predicated on failure to exhaust, if the complaint itself makes clear that the prisoner failed to exhaust.\u201d <em>Carbe v. Lappin, </em>492 F.3d 325, 328 (5th Cir.2007) (action under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971)). In <em>Carbe, </em>we stated that a \u201cdistrict court cannot by local rule sidestep <em>Jones </em>by requiring prisoners to affirmatively plead exhaustion.\u201d 492 F.3d at 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of McGrew\u2019s complaint based on his failure to exhaust administrative remedies was premature because it was not clear from the face of his complaint that McGrew had failed to exhaust all remedies available to him. <em>See Jones, </em>549 U.S. at 216-17, 127 S.Ct. 910; <em>Carbe, 492 </em>F.3d at 328; <em>Holloway v. Gunnell, </em>685 F.2d 150, 154 (5th Cir.1982). Thus, the district court erred in sua sponte dismissing McGrew\u2019s complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">McGrew\u2019s motion for IFP is granted. His appeal from the denial of a TRO is dismissed. The district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed with respect to the denial of a preliminary injunction. The district court\u2019s judgment dismissing McGrew\u2019s civil rights complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">IFP GRANTED; APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART and AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b97-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
