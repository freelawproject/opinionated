The district court denied Maracalin leave to proceed IFP.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-28\">Maracalin argues that the district court erred by treating the Guidelines and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>post-amendment sentencing range as mandatory, in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) and contends that the district court should have considered his prison record when determining the sentence to be imposed. He argues that the district court should have considered his arguments that the drug quantity finding, firearm and role adjustments, and fine in his case violated <em>Booker, </em>and that the district court should have considered a departure pursuant to <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence in certain cases where the sentencing range has been subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). In such cases, the district court may reduce the sentence after considering the applicable factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and the pertinent guideline policy statements. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under section 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010). An abuse of discretion occurs when a ruling is grounded in a legal error or a clearly erroneous analysis of the evidence. <em>In re Sealed Appellant, </em>194 F.3d 666, 670 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">District courts are limited to the reduction allowed by the two-level decrease in a defendant\u2019s offense level resulting from the application of Amendment 706; they may not depart downwardly from the resulting offense level. <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 237-39. Maracalin\u2019s arguments as to the amendment based on <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>therefore are unavailing. Moreover, \u201c[a] \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is not a second opportunity to present mitigating factors to the judge, nor is it a challenge to the appropriateness of the original sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995). The district court thus did not err by declining to address as \u00a7 3582(c)(2) issues, specifically Maracalin\u2019s contentions regarding drug quantity, offense level adjustments, and the fine imposed with regard to his original sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">Maracalin attached to his pro se section 3582(c)(2) motion a progress report indicating that he has received good work evaluations, undergone counseling, and pursued educational opportunities in prison. The district court did not mention the progress report in the order denying section 3582(c)(2) relief. However, the report was before the district court, and the district court articulated extensive reasons for denying Maracalin a sentence reduction. The district court presumptively considered Maracalin\u2019s progress report and determined that the factors against a reduction outweighed Maracalin\u2019s progress towards rehabilitation. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">Maracalin has failed to demonstrate that his appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits. His IFP motion is DENIED. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See United States v. Boutwell, </em>896 F.2d at 884, 889 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b145-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
