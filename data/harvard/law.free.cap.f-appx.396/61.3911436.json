The district court construed the petition as raising only \u00a7 2254 claims arising out of Rosin\u2019s prison disciplinary procedures and denied it on the basis that Rosin did not have a liberty interest at stake. Rosin does not dispute the district court\u2019s decision that he was not entitled to relief under \u00a7 2254. Instead, he argues that he does not seek habeas corpus relief but instead seeks damages and injunctive relief for civil rights violations under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. We construe Rosin\u2019s request for a COA as both a request for a COA for any \u00a7 2254 claims and an appeal of the dismissal of his civil rights claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">The label attached to a prisoner\u2019s pro se pleading is not controlling; rather, courts must look to the content of the pleading. <em>United States v. Santora, </em>711 F.2d 41, 42 n. 1 (5th Cir.1983). Rosin alleged in his petition that his prison disciplinary proceedings did not meet minimum standards of procedural due process, a claim that may be cognizable in a \u00a7 1983 suit as long as it does not implicate the validity of the disciplinary conviction or affect the duration of Rosin\u2019s sentence. <em>See Muhammad v. Close, </em>540 U.S. 749, 751, 124 S.Ct. 1303, 158 L.Ed.2d 32 (2004). Rosin\u2019s allegations potentially give rise to two other cognizable \u00a7 1983 claims: that prison officials violated his right under the First Amendment by harassing and retaliating against him for filing grievances, and that officials were deliberately indifferent when they forced him to perform work that did not comport with his medical restrictions, causing him to fall and break his arm. The district court, however, did not address whether Rosin stated cognizable claims under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Serio v. Member of La. St. Bd. of Pardons, </em>821 F.2d 1112, 1119 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">Accordingly, Rosin\u2019s request for a COA to appeal the dismissal of his \u00a7 2254 claims is DENIED. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Rosin\u2019s civil rights claims is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for the district court to consider whether Rosin has alleged any civil rights claims cognizable under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b88-8\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
