Harper, federal prisoner #24496-013, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition, in which he challenged his convictions for armed bank robbery and for using or carrying a firearm during the robbery. The district court determined that Harper could not proceed under Section 2241 because his claims did not satisfy the requirements of the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). Harper\u2019s brief is entirely devoted to the merits of his claims for relief. Harper has not argued, much less shown, that he is entitled to proceed under Section 2241 based on the savings clause of Section 2255(e). <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 900-01, 904 (5th Cir.2001). Harper has waived the issue by failing to brief it. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Harper\u2019s emergency motion for affirmative relief is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b84-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
