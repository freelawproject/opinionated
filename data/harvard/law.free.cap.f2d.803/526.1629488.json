Mitchell, an attorney, appeals from a district court order denying his motions for attorney\u2019s fees and for leave to intervene. The Millers appeal from a district court order in a separate action denying their motion for attorney\u2019s fees. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm both orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">These appeals arise from similar factual and procedural settings. In No. 84-6616, Mitchell represented the Willards in a civil rights action against the City of Los Angeles. The Willards and the City stipulated to a settlement of the action: the City agreed to pay the Willards $10,000, if plaintiffs agreed to waive attorney\u2019s fees. After the district court dismissed the action, Mitchell, acting on his own behalf, moved for an award of .attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, and, in the alternative, for leave to intervene in order to seek attorney\u2019s fees. The district court denied both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">In No. 85-5749, the Millers settled their civil rights action against the City of Long Beach in exchange for the sum of $6,000, which included all attorney\u2019s fees potentially recoverable under section 1988. After the Millers voluntarily dismissed their action, they moved for an award of attorney\u2019s fees under section 1988. The district court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">We review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Chalmers v. City of Los Angeles, </em>796 F.2d 1205, 1210 (9th Cir.1986). We review de novo an order denying intervention as of right, except for the issue of timeliness, which we review for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. $129,374, </em>769 F.2d 583, 585 (9th Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>--- U.S. ---, 106 S.Ct. 863, 88 L.Ed.2d 901 (1986). We review for abuse of discretion the denial of permissive intervention. <em>Id. </em>at 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-11\">Mitchell\u2019s claim to attorney\u2019s fees is premised on the contention that the right to attorney\u2019s fees under section 1988 lies with the attorney, not with his client. In its -recent opinion in <em>Evans v. Jeff </em>D., --- U.S. ---, 106 S.Ct. 1531, 89 L.Ed.2d 747 (1986) (Evans), the Supreme Court expressly rejected this contention and held that section 1988 vests the right to attorney\u2019s fees in the \u201cprevailing party\u201d rather than in his attorney. <em>Id. </em>106 S.Ct. at 1538-40 &amp; n. 19. It follows that an attorney has no standing under section 1988 to seek attorney\u2019s fees in his own behalf. <em>Brown v. General Motors Corp., </em>722 F.2d 1009, 1011 (2d Cir. 1983) <em>(Brown), see Evans, </em>106 S.Ct. at 1539 n. 19 (citing <em>Brown </em>with approval). m Since Mitchell lacked standing, the district court properly denied his motion for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-13\">Since Mitchell had no right to seek attorney\u2019s fees under section 1988, the district court properly denied his motion for leave to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-14\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b603-15\">The Millers argue that the settlement of a civil rights action may not be conditioned on waiver of section 1988 attorney\u2019s fees. From this premise, they conclude that the attorney\u2019s fees condition of their settlement is unenforceable and that the district court should have granted their section 1988 motion. This argument, however, must fail since it plainly contradicts the Supreme Court\u2019s recent holding in <em>Evans </em>that settlements of civil rights actions may be conditioned on waiver of section 1988 attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Evans, </em>106 S.Ct. at 1542-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-16\">The Millers next attempt to raise an issue left undecided by <em>Evans. </em>In <em>Evans, </em>the Supreme Court held that a district court may, under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e), approve a class action civil rights settlement that includes a waiver of section 1988 attorney\u2019s fees. The Court declined to address whether such approval might be improper where a defendant has a statute, policy, or practice of requiring waiver of attorney\u2019s fees as a condition of settlement or where the waiver condition reflects a defendant\u2019s vindictive effort to deter attorneys from representing civil rights plaintiffs. 106 S.Ct. at 1543-44. The Millers suggest that their settlement might fall within these potential exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-17\">The Millers\u2019 argument differs in one important respect from the issue left open by the Supreme Court in <em>Evans: </em>while the district court in <em>Evans </em>had a duty to ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>prove or disapprove the terms of <em>Evans\u2019 class action </em>settlement under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e), <em>Evans, </em>106 S.Ct. at 1537, the district court in this case had no such duty with respect to the Millers\u2019 settlement of their <em>individual </em>action. <em>See id. </em>at 1540, 1543 n. 30; <em>see also Marek v. Chesny, </em>473 U.S. 1, 105 S.Ct. 3012, 3018, 87 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985) (section 1988 does not place \u201ccivil rights claims ... on any different footing from other civil claims insofar as settlement is concerned\u201d). We need not decide, however, whether the possible exceptions identified by the Supreme Court in <em>Evans </em>apply to individual actions. Nor need we decide whether the consequence of applying an exception would be merely to render unenforceable the attorney\u2019s fee condition or instead to invalidate the entire settlement. <em>Cf. Evans, </em>106 S.Ct. at 1537 (Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e) does not empower court to require the parties to accept a settlement to which they have not agreed). Here, the record does not indicate that the City of Long Beach has adopted a statute, policy, or practice requiring waiver of fees as a condition of settlement or that it has vindictively sought to deter attorneys from bringing civil rights suits. We therefore must reject the Millers\u2019 challenge to the settlement condition waiving attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See id. </em>at 1544. The district court properly denied the motion for section 1988 attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
