Brazzalle, prior to his death. The ALJ denied her benefits under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(a)(4) (1986) on the ground that medical testimony offered to establish a disability due to black lung disease (pneumoconiosis) was not based on \u201creasoned medical judgment.\u201d We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-22\">Mr. Brazzalle was born on April 17,1914. He was employed as a miner for coal mining companies near Centerville, Iowa, in the late 1930s and at other times from 1956 to 1967. Subsequently, Mr. Brazzalle worked as a punch machine operator for Fuller Manufacturing Co. until November of 1976 when he was layed off.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-23\">In 1973, Dr. Stephen S. Jewett, a general practitioner, examined Mr. Brazzalle for an insurance company. At that time, Dr. Jewett concluded that Mr. Brazzalle was not suffering from a disabling pulmonary or respiratory impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-24\">Mr. Brazzalle first filed a claim for black lung benefits on December 26, 1973, under 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 925 (1986). On May 14, 1974, an x-ray and a ventilatory study were ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>ministered to Mr. Brazzalle. Neither test revealed abnormal lung impairment. On April 9, 1975, the Department of Labor denied Mr. Brazzalle\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-4\">On September 8, 1976, Dr. Jewett again examined Mr. Brazzalle. In a letter of September 9, 1976, Dr. Jewett summarized the results: The chest was reported to be symmetrical. A mild systolic type of hypertension, tachycardia, and a grade 1-4 systolic murmur were present. An occasional rhonchi in both lung fields was heard but no respiratory wheezing. No clubbing of the fingers, cyanosis of the extremities or pedal edema was evident. Urinalysis was normal and hct. was 45%. He weighed 172 pounds and was 5'4\" inches in height.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">During the examination Mr. Brazzalle reported to the doctor that he had increasing shortness of breath and a chronic cough over the years. He stated his breathing had recently become worse. He stated that although he had no difficulty breathing at rest or at nighttime, he could not push a lawnmower, walk up a flight of stairs, or walk a city block without shortness of breath. Dr. Jewett concluded the letter stating that in his \u201copinion, this patient has a form of chronic lung disease and chronic form of bronchitis with mild respiratory impairment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">On May 16,1977, Mr. Brazzalle died. On his certificate of death, the cause of death was stated as \u201cacute myocardial infarction\u201d or heart attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-7\">The claim now on appeal began when claimant filed for benefits under the Black Lung Benefits Act as a dependent of Raymond Brazzalle on July 26, 1979. The Director of the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs (Director) denied her benefits. A formal hearing was held on December 3, 1980, after which AU Arthur C. White determined that the testimony of Dr. Jewett (admitted in deposition form) was sufficient to establish that the disability of claimant\u2019s deceased husband prior to his death was due to pneumoconiosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-13\">On June 11, 1984, the Benefits Review Board of the Department of Labor, reversed AU White\u2019s decision, stating that Dr. Jewett\u2019s testimony was too equivocal to support a finding that Mr. Brazzalle\u2019s disability was due to coal dust inhaled while working in a mine. Claimant appealed the Benefits Review Board decision to this Court. On May 15, 1985, this Court issued an order requiring an AU to determine on remand whether Mr. Brazzalle had been totally disabled \u201cby a respiratory or pulmonary impairment within the meaning of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(a)(4), or any other applicable regulation, at or prior to the date of his death.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The order also allowed claimant and the Director to depose Dr. Jewett with regard to establishing total disability under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(a)(4). Using the additional testimony in claimant\u2019s interrogatories and the Director\u2019s deposition of Dr. Jewett, AU G. Marvin Bober held that claimant was not entitled to benefits. Appeal of this decision is presently before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-14\">The pertinent regulation, section 727.-203(a), states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-15\">A miner who engaged in coal mine employment for at least 10 years will be presumed to be totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis, or to have been totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis at the time of death, or death will be presumed to be due to pneumoconiosis, arising out of that employment, if one of the following medical requirements is met:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-16\">(1) A chest roentgenogram (X-ray), biopsy, or autopsy establishes the existence of pneumoconiosis * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-17\">(2) Ventilatory studies establish the presence of a chronic respiratory or pulmonary disease * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-18\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>(3) Blood gas studies which demonstrate the presence of an impairment in the transfer of oxygen from the lung alveoli to the blood * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-4\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-5\">(4) Other medical evidence, including the documented opinion of a physician exercising reasoned medical judgment, establishes the presence of a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">Reasoned medical judgment has been defined in personal injury cases as a hypothesis representing a physician\u2019s professional judgment \u201cas to the most likely one among the possible causes of the physical condition involved.\u201d <em>Norland v. Washington General Hospital, </em>461 F.2d 694, 697 (8th Cir.1972) (per curiam). This definition has been accepted in litigation under the Black Lung Benefits Act. <em>See Underhill v. Peabody Coal Co., </em>687 F.2d 217, 223 (7th Cir.1982) (citing <em>Kirschner v. Broadhead, </em>671 F.2d 1034, 1039-40 (7th Cir.1982)). Therefore, if Dr. Jewett\u2019s opinion does not adequately explain why Mr. Brazzalle more likely was disabled due to pneumoconiosis, as opposed to any other ailment, the ALJ could not consider it reasoned medical judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">In reviewing the AU\u2019s determination under section 727.203(a)(4) we must use the substantial evidence test. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 923(b) (incorporating 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) of the Social Security Act); <em>see Peabody Coal Co. v. Benefits Review Board, </em>560 F.2d 797, 801-02 (7th Cir.1977). That is, we must ask whether the ALJ examined the evidence and provided a satisfactory explanation of the decision including a \u201crational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u201d <em>See Citizens State Bank of Marshfield v. FDIC, </em>718 F.2d 1440, 1444 (8th Cir.1983) (citations omitted). Applying the test to this case, it is apparent the AU\u2019s determination that Dr. Jewett did not base his decision on reasoned medical judgment is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-10\">Two depositions of Dr. Jewett were taken in this matter, one by the claimant\u2019s attorney on December 3, 1980, for the initial hearing, and one by the Director, on August 29, 1985, for the record on remand. Analysis of the two depositions and other evidence submitted shows that viewed in light of the entire record, Dr. Jewett\u2019s diagnosis of Mr. Brazzalle\u2019s condition was both inconclusive and inconsistent. Furthermore, the diagnosis of Dr. Samuel V. Spagnolo,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a board-certified specialist in pulmonary diseases consulted by the Department of Labor, casts serious doubt on Dr. Jewett\u2019s diagnosis of Mr. Brazzalle\u2019s condition before he died.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-11\">First, Dr. Jewett did not conduct any ventilatory studies, arterial blood gas studies, or chest x-rays in examining Mr. Brazzalle. Moreover, Dr. Jewett did not have access to the x-ray and ventilatory study done in 1974. Such a lack of testing is not fatal under section 727.203(a). It shows, however, that Dr. Jewett was unaware of whether Mr. Brazzalle\u2019s respiratory or pulmonary condition, as indicated by these tests, had deteriorated after those tests had been performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-12\">Second, Dr. Jewett relied on statements made to him by Mr. Brazzalle which are contradicted by other evidence. For example, although Mr. Brazzalle complained of a chronic cough, neither Dr. Jewett nor anyone testifying at the hearing, including claimant, noted that Mr. Brazzalle suffered from a chronic cough. Dr. Jewett admitted that in most instances of respiratory im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>pairment, \u201cthere will be a cough of some sort:</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">Third, in his diagnosis, Dr. Jewett relied on Mr. Brazzalle\u2019s statements that he had no difficulty breathing at rest or at nighttime, i.e., that he <em>did not </em>have orthopnea. According to Dr. Jewett, an absence of orthopnea was \u201cvery, very important\u201d in his diagnosis that Mr. Brazzalle suffered from a lung impairment and not heart disease. Testimony at the hearing by claimant, however, suggested that Mr. Brazzalle did indeed suffer from orthopnea. In the second deposition, after being confronted about the possible presence of orthopnea, Dr. Jewett conceded that he might have to reexamine his notes and use his \u201cclinical ability\u201d to reevaluate his initial diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">Finally, Dr. Spagnolo considered both Dr. Jewett\u2019s report and the additional information not initially considered by Dr. Jewett, including the 1974 x-ray and pulmonary studies, the absence of a chronic cough, and the presence of orthopnea. Dr. Spagnolo stated that Mr. Brazzalle\u2019s symptoms, including those actually noted by Dr. Jewett, amounted to \u201cclassic findings of early congestive failure,\u201d i.e., a form of heart disease, which eventually lead to Mr. Brazzalle\u2019s death in 1977. Dr. Spagnolo further concluded that even if there were a showing of mild chronic bronchitis, the tests conducted and the symptoms shown could not have been sufficiently severe to cause a total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">Dr. Spagnolo\u2019s evaluation may not establish the sole or even primary cause of Mr. Brazzalle\u2019s condition before death; however, when combined with the inconsistencies in Dr. Jewett\u2019s testimony, it does sufficiently discredit Dr. Jewett\u2019s diagnosis such that an ALJ might properly determine that it is not the \u201cmost likely\u201d explanation of Mr. Brazzalle\u2019s disability prior to his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-8\">Thus, the record shows substantial evidence supporting the AU\u2019s conclusion that Dr. Jewett\u2019s opinion was not based on reasoned medical judgment. The decision of the AU must be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1011-8\">. The Department of Labor Benefits Review Board had reviewed AU White\u2019s decision under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 410, Subpart D (1986). Since the Director conceded on appeal that Mr. Brazzalle had worked ten years or more in a coal mine, the case could properly be considered under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203(a)(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1012-8\"><em>. </em>Dr. Spagnolo\u2019s opinion was contained in an August 7, 1985, letter to counsel for the Director. This letter was introduced in the August 29, 1985, deposition of Dr. Jewett by counsel for the Director. Claimant's counsel objected to introduction of the letter primarily on the ground that he did not have an opportunity to cross-examine Dr. Spagnolo at a hearing. This objection is without merit. On remand, claimant\u2019s counsel neither objected to a decision on the record without a hearing (where claimant\u2019s counsel could have possibly cross-examined Dr. Spagnolo), nor did claimant\u2019s counsel request an opportunity to depose Dr. Spagnolo.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
