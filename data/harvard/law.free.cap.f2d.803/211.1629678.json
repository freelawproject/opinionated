Plaintiff filed an application on July 6, 1983, alleging disability as of July, 1974, due to \u201cheart trouble.\u201d The application was denied at all administrative levels. At plaintiff\u2019s request, a <em>de novo </em>hearing was held before an administrative law judge (\u201cAU\u201d). The AU\u2019s decision, which became the final decision of the Secretary after the Appeals Council\u2019s refusal to grant review, is that plaintiff failed to establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>the existence of a severe impairment, thus terminating the sequential evaluation at step two. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">In reviewing the final decision of the Secretary, our inquiry is limited to a determination of whether substantial evidence exists in the record to support the Secretary\u2019s decision and to a review for any legal errors. <em>Kirk v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>667 F.2d 524 (6th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>461 U.S. 957, 103 S.Ct. 2428, 77 L.Ed.2d 1315 (1983). The determination of whether there is substantial evidence to support the Secretary\u2019s findings must be based on the record as a whole. <em>Hephner v. Mathews, </em>574 F.2d 359, 362 (6th Cir.1978). Substantial evidence means more than a scintilla; it is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind would accept as adequate to support a conclusion. <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 1427, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">An impairment is non-severe only if it is a \u201cslight abnormality which has such a minimal effect on the individual that it would not be expected to interfere with the individual\u2019s ability to work, irrespective of age, education and work experience.\u201d <em>Farris v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>773 F.2d 85, 90 (6th Cir.1985); <em>see also Salmi v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>774 F.2d 685, 692 (6th Cir.1985). Plaintiff first argues that this standard has not been met because Dr. Robert Cornett, his treating physician, stated that plaintiff \u201cis not able to be gainfully employed. Even mild exertion brings on the angina pectoris.\u201d App. at 119. Dr. Cornett stated in his one-page letter that plaintiff suffers from heart enlargement, coronary artery disease, generalized arthritis, conversion reaction psychosis and obesity. However, the record contains no underlying clinical findings. <em>See Houston v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>736 F.2d 365 (6th Cir.1984):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-7\">[T]he opinion of the treating physician should be given greater weight than that of the government\u2019s physician____ This is true, however, only if the treating physician\u2019s opinion is based on sufficient medical data____ Ultimately, the determination of disability is the prerogative of the Secretary, not the treating physician, and the brief conclusory letter from [the] treating physician, was not dispositive of the issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 367 (citations omitted); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-12\">\n<em>Conclusion by physicians concerning your disability.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-13\">We are responsible for determining whether you are disabled. Therefore, a statement by your physician that you are \u201cdisabled\u201d or \u201cunable to work\u201d does not mean that we will determine that you are disabled. <em>We have to review the medical findings and other evidence that support a physician\u2019s statement that you are \u201cdisabled. \u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-14\">Plaintiff also relies on a one-page letter from Dr. Emanuel Turner, who states he saw plaintiff sixty-six times between February 1977 and February 1984. Dr. Turner asserted that plaintiff suffers from hiatal hernia, hypertension, unstable angina pectoris and osteoarthritis. Dr. Turner continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-15\">I feel that Ms. Landsaw\u2019s most disabling condition is the unstable angina pectoris. I understand that Dr. Cornett referred her to a cardiologist in Lexington at one time who recommended cardiac catherization. I am not sure if that was ever done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-16\">In my judgment Ms. Landsaw is totally and permanently disabled from seeking and holding gainful employment at this time and also in the future.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-17\">App. at 97. However, Dr. Turner\u2019s opinion suffers from the same infirmity as Dr. Cornett\u2019s in that the record contains no underlying clinical data.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-18\">On the other hand, the Secretary relies on a one-page letter from Dr. James Cooper, of the Mountain Comprehensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>Health Corporation (\u201cMCHC\u201d), dated July 8, 1983, wherein he states, \u201cThere is no evidence of disability of any kind today.\u201d App. at 87. Dr. Cooper\u2019s opinion, unlike those of Drs. Cornett and Turner, is supported by the following clinical data from plaintiff\u2019s stay at MCHC.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">On May 4, 1983, a chest X-ray showed fluid levels in both lung bases. Although an EKG was within normal limits, plaintiff was diagnosed as suffering from congestive heart failure. App. at 89. From May 6, 1983, through June 15, 1983, plaintiff showed steady improvement. App. at 89-92. On July 8, 1983, the following progress note was entered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-5\">She has multiple vague complaints____ No chest pain. No nocturnal dyspnea____ Exercise tolerance is impossible to evaluate____ Lungs are clear, without rales or wheezes. Heart normal rhythm____ This patient does not appear to have high blood pressure or to be in [congestive heart failure]____ I reviewed her chest X-rays and they do not indicate [congestive heart failure]. Her EKG today is normal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">App. at 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-12\">As the government argues, Dr. Cooper\u2019s letter along with its supporting clinical data represents substantial evidence that plaintiff\u2019s heart trouble improved during 1983 and does not rise to a severe impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-13\">The only other medical evidence of note reflects that plaintiff was seen in the Appalachian Regional Hospital Emergency Room on September 6,1985, complaining of chest pain, cold sweats, smothering and weakness. A \u201clow voltage\u201d EKG was \u201cotherwise normal,\u201d and plaintiff was diagnosed as suffering from \u201cangina-stable.\u201d Plaintiff was not admitted, however, and her condition was noted as \u201csatisfactory.\u201d App. at 95. This evidence does not significantly detract from the Secretary\u2019s finding that plaintiff\u2019s impairment is not severe.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-14\">Plaintiff\u2019s next argument is that the AU applied the wrong standard by using the \u201cListings of Impairments\u201d to determine that she does not suffer from a severe impairment. The government counters that the AU used the listings merely as a guide. The government\u2019s interpretation of the AU\u2019s opinion is not unreasonable. In any event, as set forth <em>supra, </em>substantial evidence supports the AU\u2019s decision under the correct legal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-16\">Plaintiff\u2019s third argument is that the Secretary erred in failing to accord plaintiff a full and fair hearing by declining to order a cardiovascular consultative examination. The burden of providing a complete record, defined as evidence complete and detailed enough to enable the Secretary to make a disability determination, rests with the claimant. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 416.-912, 416.913(d). Moreover, as the government argues, the regulations do not require an AU to refer a claimant to a consultative specialist, but simply grant him the authority to do so if the existing medical sources do not contain sufficient evidence to make a determination. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.917(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-17\">As to the AU\u2019s duty to conduct a \u201cfull inquiry,\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1444, we adopt the following statement by the Fifth Circuit which applies equally to the present case and disposes of plaintiff\u2019s argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-18\">\u201c[F]ull inquiry\u201d does not require a consultative examination at government expense unless the record establishes that such an examination is <em>necessary </em>to enable the administrative law judge to make the disability decision. In appellant\u2019s case, the evidence in the record upon which the administrative law judge based his denial of benefits fully developed the facts necessary to make that determination. The [evidence] supports the conclusion that appellant is not disabled____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-19\"><em>Turner v. Califano, </em>563 F.2d 669, 671 (5th Cir.1977) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-20\">Plaintiff's remaining arguments are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-21\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-22\">Having fully reviewed the record and finding no reversible errors of law and finding substantial objective medical evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>dence to support the Secretary\u2019s findings, we AFFIRM the decision of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
