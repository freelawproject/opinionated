Marchant\u2019s contentions are without merit, and we affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Marchant admitted at trial that he has been a collector of sexually explicit (pornographic) materials for several years, and that he frequently corresponds with other individuals about pornographic materials. Marchant ordered many of these materials from abroad, allegedly five at a time, through price lists or through brochures that show small pictures of the covers of pornographic magazines. Marchant received the magazines at a post-office box, which he listed under multiple aliases. At some point prior to January 1985, Marchant ordered at least one \u201cLolita\u201d magazine. Six \u201cLolita\u201d magazines were seized by officials in Jamaica, New York, and a notice of seizure was sent to Marchant. Marchant claims to have had no knowledge that \u201cLolita\u201d magazines were child pornography and to have had no \u201cLolita\u201d magazines in his possession at that time. Marchant learned that \u201cthere was a problem with messing around with child pornography ... [and that] it\u2019s no problem as long as [he didn\u2019t] order \u2018Lolita\u2019s\u2019____\u201d Tr., Yol. 2, at 129. Marchant subsequently received at his post office box a \u201cLolita Extra Z,\u201d which he put in a dresser drawer in his bedroom. Marchant claims that he placed an order for five adult pornographic magazines, but that he received the \u201cLolita Extra Z\u201d and other magazines that he did not order.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-14\">On May 14,1985, postal inspectors seized six pornographic magazines addressed to one of the aliases at Marchant\u2019s post office box. One of the magazines seized, \u201cLolita Color Special 18,\u201d was the child pornography upon which Marchant\u2019s conviction is based. Another of the magazines contained pornographic depictions of humans with animals. Customs officials, cooperating with the post office, performed a controlled delivery of the seized magazines. Marchant accepted the magazines, took them to his home, and placed them, after examination, in the drawer containing the \u201cLolita Extra Z.\u201d Marchant testified that he had ordered only five magazines, all of which he claims were adult pornography. He contends that, of the four magazines he ordered that were received, he knew that two were \u201chard core,\u201d presumed that a third was \u201chard core,\u201d and did not know about the fourth. He asserts that he did not receive \u201cColor Climax,\u201d the fifth magazine which he had ordered. He also testified that he did not know the contents of the package when he accepted it from the post office, and that he was not interested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>in and did not order either \u201cLolita\u201d that he received. Marchant \u201cguessed\u201d that he received the child pornography and bestiality magazines because discount pornography suppliers substitute available magazines, rather than refund the purchase price, when they run out of the ordered magazines.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">After performing the controlled delivery, customs and postal officials obtained a search warrant for the premises of Mar-chant\u2019s home. The search was executed on May 22, 1985. The officials seized multiple \u201chard core\u201d pornographic magazines, including bestiality magazines and magazines with titles such as \u201cTeenage Sex 20,\u201d \u201cTeenager 17,\u201d \u201cSchulmadchen 4,\u201d \u201cSweet Little 16,\u201d the \u201cLolita Extra Z,\u201d and the six magazines subject to the controlled delivery. Also seized were several hundred letters (some of which contained currency sent to Marchant, allegedly to defray his cost of sending pornographic pictures), and several thousand photographic negatives of pictures from pornographic magazines. Finally, the officials seized a letter from a woman in Oklahoma addressed to Mar-chant, not to an alias. The letter expressed thanks for a picture that Marchant had sent, and promised to reciprocate with a picture of herself and her son Marvin. The letter stated: \u201c[Marvin] just turned three years old this year, and he is all boy if you know what I mean.\u201d Marchant contends that this was a \u201clonely hearts type letter, rather than a pornographic contact letter.\u201d Tr. Yol. 2, at 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Marchant was charged with the knowing receipt of sexually explicit material involving minors that has been shipped in interstate or foreign commerce, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252, and with the use of the mails to receive nonmailable material, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1461. At the bench trial, the customs agent in charge of the case testified that the practice in child pornography shipment is to order pornography pre-paid and to mail ordered materials, without invoices or letters. No letters accompany such materials even when the ordered materials are not available or when an overpayment is made. The agent also testified that such materials are not sent unless payment is received in advance, and that he had never heard of anyone paying for materials to be received by anyone else. The trial judge acquitted Marchant on the use of the mail count, but returned a guilty verdict on the knowing receipt of child pornography. Marchant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">II. Sufficiency of the Evidence to Find Scienter</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">Marchant argues that insufficient evidence was adduced at trial to support the scienter requirement of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252, that he <em>knowingly </em>received child pornography. The standard of review was fully set forth in <em>United States v. Niver, </em>689 F.2d 520, 529 (5th Cir.1982):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-9\">[W]e must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the government; Our task is not to reweigh the evidence or to determine the credibility of the witnesses, and we must affirm the verdict if it is supported by substantial evidence. Gla<em>sser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942).... \u201cThe test is whether the evidence is sufficient to justify the trial judge, as trier of facts, in concluding beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty____\u201d <em>Gordon v. United States, </em>438 F.2d 858, 868 n. 30 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 828, 92 S.Ct. 139, 30 L.Ed.2d 56 (1971); <em>United States v. Hull, </em>437 F.2d 1, 3 (5th Cir. 1971); <em>see generally </em>3 C. Wright, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 374 (1982).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-12\">Stated differently, we review the entire record to determine \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-13\">Marchant here argues that the receipt of the \u201cLolita Color Special 18\u201d that formed the basis for conviction; the previous or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>dering of at least one clearly child-pornographic \u201cLolita\u201d magazine, allegedly before understanding the nature of its contents; the possession of one \u201cLolita\u201d and of other questionably child pornographic \u201cteen\u201d magazines; the placement of the \u201cLolita Color Special 18\u201d in the same dresser as another, allegedly non-ordered, \u201cLolita\u201d magazine in Marchant\u2019s collection; the unlikely coincidences of receiving two \u201cLolita\u201d magazines that were not ordered and of (but for seizure) receiving on two occasions six magazines instead of the five allegedly ordered; the testimony of the customs official that magazines were sent only if pre-paid; the possession of a letter allegedly indicating Marchant\u2019s interest regarding child pornography; and the possession of a notice of seizure of six \u201cLolita\u201d magazines are all insufficient to permit a reasonable trier of fact to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Marchant had <em>knowingly </em>received the \u201cLolita Color Special 18,\u201d rather than unknowingly receiving a substitution for what he had allegedly ordered. This argument is hogwash.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Because we draw all inferences in favor of the government, the fact of receipt by itself <em>might </em>be sufficient to infer, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the receiver knows what he obtains. There can, it is true, be possession or receipt of objectionable material in ways that perfume the contents possessed or received. When the receipt occurs at the invention or with the consent of the possessor, it is more difficult to camouflage the fulsome scent of forbidden knowledge. Here, there is a veritable sty full of facts and inferences from which to detect the fragrance of scienter. The record indicates that \u201cLolita Color Special 18\u201d was not received on April Fool\u2019s Day, and we are not so naive as to require reversal on Mar-chant\u2019s mere protestation that Lolita was a stranger in his household.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">There is no question that a trier of fact could reasonably conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Marchant intended to and knowingly received the \u201cLolita Color Special 18.\u201d Other courts similarly have rejected challenges to the sufficiency of evidence to support scienter in receipt of child pornography. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Hurt, </em>795 F.2d 765, 773-74 (9th Cir.1986); <em>United States v. Hale, </em>784 F.2d 1465, 1471 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">III. Unconstitutional Application of .18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252 to Knowing Receipt of Child Pornography for Personal Use</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">Because there is sufficient evidence of knowing receipt, we must address Mar-chant\u2019s constitutional challenge to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252, as applied. Child pornography under \u00a7 2252 falls within the standards of <em>New York v. Ferber, </em>458 U.S. 747, 764, 102 S.Ct. 3348, 3358, 73 L.Ed.2d 1113 (1982). <em>Ferber </em>held the First Amendment does not protect materials that <em>\u201cvisually </em>depict sexual conduct by children below a specified age. The category of \u2018sexual conduct\u2019 must also be suitably limited and described.\u201d Id. (emphasis in original). Marchant does not dispute that \u201cLolita Col- or Special 18\u201d is child pornography within 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252, nor does he address whether the pornography in question falls within the <em>Ferber </em>criteria of unprotected material. <em>See Ferber, </em>458 U.S. at 764-765, 102 S.Ct. at 3358-59. Rather, Marchant argues that, <em>Stanley v. Georgia, </em>394 U.S. 557, 89 S.Ct. 1243, 22 L.Ed.2d 542 (1969), establishes that the First Amendment shields knowing receipt of child pornography from criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">Because <em>Stanley </em>protects the right to possess obscene material<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in the privacy of one\u2019s own home, <em>Stanley </em>allegedly protects the right to possess child pornography in one\u2019s own home. We are unable to locate any <em>post-Ferber </em>cases that <em>directly </em>address whether the <em>Stanley </em>right applies to child pornography, as well as to obscenity. <em>Cf United States v. Garot </em>and <em>United States v. Janell Ruth van Y, </em>801 F.2d 1241, 1246 n. 5 (10th Cir.1986) (refusing to reach con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>stitutipnality of an Oklahoma statute prohibiting possession of child pornography because conviction was not based on possession); <em>United States v. Thoma, </em>726 F.2d 1191, 1198 (7th Cir.1984) (implicitly assuming that <em>Stanley </em>applies to child pornography in determining that an investigation did not \u201cimpermissibly induce\u201d defendant to leave the <em>Stanley </em>zone of protection), <em>cert. denied </em>467 U.S. 1228, 104 S.Ct. 2683, 81 L.Ed.2d 878 (1984). We too do not reach this question, because <em>Stanley </em>does not extend to knowing receipt, even if it does extend to child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">The Supreme Court\u2019s determination in <em>United States v. Orito, </em>413 U.S. 139, 141, 93 S.Ct. 2674, 2677, 37 L.Ed.2d 513 (1973), is controlling: \u201c[T]he essence of Appellee\u2019s contention is that <em>Stanley </em>has firmly established the right to possess obscene material in the privacy of the home and that this creates a correlative right to receive it, transport it, or distribute it. We have rejected that reasoning.\u201d <em>See also United States v. 12 200-ft Reels of Super 8mm. Film, </em>413 U.S. 123, 127, 129, 93 S.Ct. 2665, 2668, 2669, 37 L.Ed.2d 500 (1973) (the attempt to extend <em>Stanley </em>\u201coverlooks the explicitly narrow and precisely delineated <em>privacy </em>right on which <em>Stanley </em>rests. That holding reflects no more than what Mr. Justice Harlan characterized as the law\u2019s \u2018solicitude to protect the privacies of the life within [the home].\u2019 <em>Poe v. Ullman, </em>367 U.S. 497, 551, 81 S.Ct. 1752, 1781, 6 L.Ed.2d 989 (1961) (dissenting opinion)____ The Constitution does not compel, and Congress has not authorized, an exception for private use of obscene material.\u201d) (footnotes omitted) (emphasis added); <em>United States v. Reidel, </em>402 U.S. 351, 91 S.Ct. 1410, 28 L.Ed.2d 813 (1971) (refusing to extend <em>Stanley </em>to commercial distribution of pornography); <em>United States v. Thirty-Seven Photographs, </em>402 U.S. 363, 91 S.Ct. 1400, 28 L.Ed.2d 822 (1971) (refusing to extend Stanley to importation of pornography from abroad). Existing authority from other circuits holds that <em>Orito </em>controls the application of <em>Stanley </em>to knowing receipt of child pornography, whether under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252 or otherwise. <em>See Hurt, </em>795 F.2d at 771; <em>Hale, </em>784 F.2d at 1471; <em>United States v. Miller, </em>776 F.2d 978 (11th Cir.1985), <em>cert denied, </em>--- U.S. ---, 106 S.Ct. 1659, 90 L.Ed.2d 201 (1986).
