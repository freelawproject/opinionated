We hold that plaintiff\u2019s appeal to this Court was untimely, and we therefore dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Although the dispute between the parties presents interesting substantive issues, we confine our discussion to the procedural events that took place after the district court\u2019s dismissal, events best understood if set out chronologically. On November 5, 1984, the district court entered its judgment of dismissal. On November 14, the district court approved the parties\u2019 stipulation granting an extension of time, to November 22, in which to file a Rule 52(b), Fed.R.Civ.P., motion to amend or to make additional findings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On November 29, again at the parties\u2019 request, the district court granted a second extension of time to <em>file, </em>this time to November 30.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The record indicates that plaintiff\u2019s counsel mailed a Rule 52(b) motion to the district court from New York on November 30. However, the court did not receive the motion until December 5, five days after the second extension had expired. The district court denied plaintiff\u2019s Rule 52(b) motion on December 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Plaintiff filed its notice of appeal on January 11, 1985, clearly after expiration of the general 30-day time limit for filing a notice of appeal, which runs from the date on which final judgment is entered (in this case, November 5, 1984). Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1). However, an exception to the general rule provides that a \u201ctimely\u201d Rule 52(b) motion will delay the running of the time to file a notice of appeal until the order granting or denying the motion is entered. Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4). Since plaintiff filed its notice of appeal to this Court within 30 days of the district court\u2019s denial of its Rule 52(b) motion, the only issue is whether plaintiff\u2019s Rule 52(b) motion in the district court was \u201ctimely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">\u201cFiling with the court\u201d is defined as filing with the clerk of the court, or, if the judge permits, with the judge. Fed.R.Civ.P. 5(e). If mailed, the filing is accomplished only when actually received by the clerk or when placed in the clerk\u2019s post office box. <em>Lee v. Dallas County Board of Education, </em>578 F.2d 1177, 1178, 1179 (5th Cir.1978). Filings reaching the clerk\u2019s office after a deadline are untimely, even if mailed before the deadline. <em>Ibid.; Wiss v. Weinberger, </em>415 F.Supp. 293, 294 (E.D.Pa. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">The record indicates that although plaintiff\u2019s counsel mailed the Rule 52(b) motion from New York on November 30, 1984, the district court did not receive the motion until December 5, 1984-five days too late. Thus, even assuming that the district court properly granted the extensions of time, the motion was not timely filed. Similarly, plaintiff\u2019s appeal to this Court was untimely, and we accordingly dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b300-7\">. Because we hold that plaintiffs appeal to this Court is untimely in any event, we do not reach the issue of whether the district court could properly grant an extension. <em>Compare </em>Rule 6(b), Fed.R.Civ.P. (which provides that a district court may not extend the time for making Rule 52(b) motions) <em>with Thompson </em>v. <em>Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em>375 U.S. 384, 84 S.Ct. 397, 11 L.Ed.2d 404 (1964). <em>See also Wolfsohn v. Hankin, </em>376 U.S. 203, 204, 84 S.Ct. 699, 699, 11 L.Ed.2d 636 (1964) (Clark, J., dissenting) (\"this Court has given trial judges the <em>de facto </em>power to grant extensions of time, directly <em>contra </em>to the definite requirements of Rule 52(b)____\")</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b300-14\">. This second stipulation was mailed to the judge on November 20, prior to the expiration of the first extension.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
