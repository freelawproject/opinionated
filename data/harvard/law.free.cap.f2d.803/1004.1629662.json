Curl is a 34 year old lawyer, a partner in a small firm in Tucson, Arizona. He has an A.B. from Illinois University and a J.D., class of 1977, from Southern Illinois University. He has served as Assistant State Attorney in Vermilion County, Illinois. He is a member of the state bars of Illinois and Arizona, the Illinois Trial Lawyers\u2019 Association, and the American Bar Association. He is on the Grievance Committee of Pima County, Arizona.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-27\">On July 22, 1986, this court issued an order to David L. Curl that he show cause why sanctions should not be imposed on him for a misrepresentation made by him as counsel for Johnny E. Henry in the case of <em>International Harvester Credit Corporation (Harvester) v. Henry, </em>decided by this court July 22, 1986. David L. Curl responded with an affidavit seeking to excuse his misrepresentation. We now impose a sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-28\"><em>Background. </em>On September 8, 1980, Henry executed a contract with Wes-Tex Equipment Company for the purchase of a drilling rig and water tank truck. Wes-Tex assigned the contract to Harvester. Henry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>paid $49,962.54 as a down payment and financed the remaining balance of $283,-121.09. When Henry purchased the equipment he told Wes-Tex that he needed Bills of Sale and Manufacturer\u2019s Statements of Origin to register the equipment in California. Wes-Tex supplied these documents. He made payments totaling $45,355.51 on the equipment, but in August 1981, defaulted. The next month he secreted the equipment through a sham sales transaction, and took it to Mexico. Before the Third Civil Court of Sonora, Harvester sought to foreclose upon Henry. That court, basing its decision solely on Henry\u2019s answer, which alleged he had made payment in full, decided in his favor on March 24, 1983. On appeal before the Supreme Court of Sonora, the judgment was, in the words of that court, \u201cmodified\u201d (\u201cse modifica\u201d). The foreclosure action (\u201cla via ejecutiva\u201d) was found to have failed because of Harvester\u2019s failure to tender a return of the down payments. Harvester was condemned to pay the costs of the trial. All rights of Harvester were preserved to be asserted as appropriate (\u201cpor lo que se dejan a salvo sus derechos para que los haga valer en la via y forma correspondiente\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">After the decision by the lower Mexican court and before the appeal was heard, Harvester served- Henry in the United States. Henry sought summary judgment asking that the lower court decision in Mexico be accorded comity. Judge Alfredo C. Marquez denied this motion on May 31, 1984. Trial was scheduled for October 10, 1984. The day before the trial David L. Curl, Henry\u2019s counsel, presented a certified copy of the decision of the Supreme Court of Sonora in Spanish. In open court, Curl told Judge Marquez that the decision \u201caffirms the lower court\u2019s order.\u201d The trial proceeded before a jury, which gave a verdict in favor of Harvester.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">On appeal, Curl contended that there should have been no trial because the lower Sonora court decision should have barred Harvester\u2019s suit. \u201cThe Appellee here brought his original action in the Mexican court system and lost,\u201d his brief asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-7\">This court found that no genuine issue was presented by Henry\u2019s appeal; that Harvester\u2019s rights had been expressly preserved by the decree of the Supreme Court of Sonora; and that Henry\u2019s appeal, based on the assertion of a Mexican judgment in his favor, had rested on a mischaracterization of the judgment. Attorney\u2019s fees and double costs were awarded Harvester against Henry. We then issued the show cause order directed to the more serious question of Curl\u2019s responsibility for the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-9\"><em>Curl\u2019s Response. </em>On August 18, 1986 Curl filed an affidavit in which he swore that, when he first received the judgment of the Supreme Court of Sonora, he \u201ccontacted his client,\u201d who told him that Raul Encinas, a Mexican lawyer from Hermosillo, had told Henry that the judgment \u201cupheld the trial court in its entirety\u201d; that Curl then had the judgment translated; that he then saw that it appeared that \u201cthe appeal had been dismissed without prejudice\u201d; that Curl again contacted Henry who in turn contacted Encinas, who continued to maintain that Henry \u201chad won the appeal in its entirety\u201d; that after judgment against Henry in the federal district court and before taking this appeal, Curl spoke to another Mexican lawyer for Henry, Arturo Serrano of Aqua Prieta and that Curl speaking in \u201cbroken Spanish\u201d and Serrano in \u201cbroken English,\u201d Serrano assured him that the Sonora judgment was entirely in Henry\u2019s favor, that \u201cthe bar to foreclosing on the property was bar to gaining possession of the property,\u201d and that Serrano would so testify if called as a witness. In summary, Curl swore that he and Henry were \u201cmisled by at least two Mexican attorneys.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-10\">Curl further pointed out that he had submitted the Sonoran judgment in Spanish and an accurate English translation of it to this court, leaving this court \u201cfree to decide what the interpretation of the Mexican Judgment\u201d was. He added that it was his \u201cduty to his client to represent him, within the bounds of ethics, and to take a position which may be sustained by evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-11\"><em>Discussion. </em>A lawyer\u2019s duty to an appellate court consists in more than not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>putting false evidence before the court. Curl complied with the elementary obligation of not falsifying the record by providing the Sonoran judgment in Spanish with an accurate English translation. But Curl\u2019s obligations were greater. He had a duty not to misrepresent the evidence in argument before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\">Curl in his brief for Henry stated that \u201cthe Mexican judgment had been rendered in favor of Defendant-Appellant Johnny Bo Henry in the appropriate amount of $370,-000.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief, p. 5. Curl noted that the judgment had then been taken to a higher Mexican court. His appeal to our court was from the district court\u2019s failure \u201cto recognize the Mexican judgments.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief, p. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-5\">In his \u201cStatement of Facts and Issues,\u201d Curl cited the words of the lower Mexican court that Henry had \u201cpayed the price of the transaction.\u201d He then stated that the Supreme Court of Sonora had \u201caffirmed the lower court.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief, p. 4. In his \u201cSummary of Argument,\u201d Curl began: \u201cSince International Harvester voluntarily brought its action before the Mexican court system and lost, the doctrines of comity, collateral estoppel and <em>res judicata </em>should bar an attempt to relitigate the matter in the U.S. court system.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief, p. 5. The rest of the brief was a development of this position which rested squarely on the bar created by the judgment of the Supreme Court of Sonora.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-6\">Curl reiterated his basic position that \u201cthe Mexican Court\u201d had \u201centered its finding that the Defendant had paid for the property and absolved Defendant of the claims of Plaintiff.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief, p. 8. This judgment, Curl reported, \u201chad been made final by a decision of the Third Section of the Supreme Tribunal of Justice of Hermosillo (akin to state supreme court).\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief, p. 10. \u201cAs a result,\u201d he continued, \u201cthe Mexican proceedings are conclusive \u2014 Plaintiff was barred by the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>from relitigating his claim here.\u201d <em>Id. </em>His 26 page brief presented variations on this theme. At no point did Curl in any fashion indicate that there was ambiguity or uncertainty in his reading of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Sonora. His assertions were completely affirmative and unqualified. Harvester, he maintained, was absolutely barred by the Mexican judgment against it. At oral argument, Curl took the same line.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-8\">If by some piece of legal ingenuity or quirk of Mexican law, the Sonoran judgment could have been construed as a judgment on the merits, it was Curl\u2019s duty to explain the inference by which one could reach this conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-9\">[A lawyer] may assert any inferences from the facts of the case that seem to him arguable, but he cannot present his inferences from the facts as if they were the very facts themselves. When he is indulging, as he has every right to do, in inferences or reasoning from the facts, he must say so \u2014 there are many words in the English language fitted to express this process of inference \u2014 and to be effective he should state the facts in the record from which he is making his inferences. A fortiori, if, as here, there are no facts on which to predicate a statement or from which he may reason or argue, he makes such false statement of facts or false inferences from such non-existing facts at his peril. The failure of his adversary to discover his mistake here or below is no excuse for what may turn out to be an imposition on the court, even if it can be attributed merely to carelessness and lack of thoroughness in the preparation of the appeal. <em>In re Greenberg, </em>15 N.J. 132, 104 A.2d 46 (1954) (per Vanderbilt, C.J.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1082-10\">When Curl chose to state as a fact what was at the best a guess and a hope, he engaged in misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-11\">Curl misrepresented the judgment on which his appeal depended. If- we accept his affidavit, he did so in part because of statements made to him by his client, Henry. Curl had no reason to believe Henry, an oil driller, on a matter of law. Henry\u2019s basic story, that he had paid Harvester, was disbelieved by the jury in this case, and was wholly implausible. At oral argument Curl acknowledged that Henry\u2019s story was \u201cwild.\u201d We do not address here the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>duty of a lawyer never to put on the witness stand a client he has reason to know is committing penury. <em>See Nix v. Whiteside, </em>--- U.S. ---, 106 S.Ct. 988, 995, 89 L.Ed.2d 123 (1986). But the implausibility of Henry\u2019s story bears on the reasonableness of Curl relying on him. No reasonable lawyer would have taken Henry\u2019s word for what another lawyer said was the meaning of a foreign judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-7\">Curl\u2019s other reliance was on a lawyer with whom he conversed with difficulty because neither could speak the other\u2019s language fluently. On a matter of central importance to his case it was reckless for Curl to depend on his understanding of the broken English of Serrano responding to questions framed by him in broken Spanish. Ordinary prudence required Curl to get a written opinion of the meaning of the judgment, especially so when his own reading of it, like ours, showed him that the judgment was procedural only. Recklessly, Curl chose to hear what he wanted to hear and charged ahead.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-8\">Curl\u2019s excuses do not relieve him of responsibility for having brought an appeal that should never have been brought, for subjecting Harvester to the burden of appellate litigation, and for having put this court to the task of reading, analyzing, and judging his baseless arguments. Curl\u2019s conduct has been professionally irresponsible in violation of the standards of legal ethics and his duty to this court. Sanctions are appropriate and indeed required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-9\">By Rule 5 of the Rules of this court, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \u201cwhenever relevant\u201d are part of the rules of this court. Rule 11, Fed.R.Civ.P. prescribes that \u201cthe signature of an attorney\u201d constitutes \u201ca certificate by him\u201d that to the \u201cbest of his knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry,\u201d the paper he is filing with the court is \u201cwell grounded in fact.\u201d The brief filed by Curl was not well-grounded in fact and he had not made reasonable inquiry. Rule 11 prescribes that in such a situation the court \u201cshall impose\u201d \u201can appropriate sanction\u201d upon the attorney. The imposition of sanctions is mandatory. <em>Golden Eagle Distributing Corp. v. Burroughs Corp., </em>801 F.2d 1531 (9th Cir.1986); <em>Eastway Construction Corp. v. City of New York, </em>762 F.2d 243 at 254 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-11\">A majority of this court believes the public admonishment of this opinion is sufficient sanction. The majority is willing to believe that Curl did not intentionally attempt to perpetrate a fraud on this court. There is no evidence that Curl has been subject to prior disciplinary proceedings. The court will not hesitate to sanction future negligence with substantial monetary fines, suspension, or disbarment from practice before our court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-13\">Editor\u2019s Note: The opinion of the United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, in <em>Miller v. Hedlund, </em>published in the advance sheet at this citation, 803 F.2d 1007-1015, was withdrawn from bound volume pending resolution by the United States Supreme Court of <em>324 Liquor Corp. v.
