We have jurisdiction pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1121 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1982). Because we hold that the district court did not err in its application of \u00a7 43(a) nor abuse its discretion in denying attorney\u2019s fees, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-22\">Both parties in this case are Pennsylvania corporations and competitors in the kitchen textile products business. In 1961, the John Ritzenthaler Company designed the Ritz Flemish Wonder towel No. 117 and entered into an exclusive distribution arrangement with Abbeloos <em>&amp; </em>Fils, a Belgium firm that manufactures the towel. The Ritz Flemish Wonder towel is made from a weave designated in the industry as \u201cglass type,\u201d made from a huckaback weave. This weave is characterized by white squares of relatively coarse material enclosed by stripes of plain, or smooth material.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This particular weave produces a strong but absorbent towel that requires no ironing. Shen acquired the John Ritzenthaler Company sometime in late 1960 or early 1961.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-23\">In 1984, Standard Terry began to manufacture a towel that it concedes is a copy of the Ritz Flemish Wonder towel that Standard Terry calls the Supra-Weave towel. Like Shen\u2019s towel, the Supra-Weave towel is a glass type towel made of 100% cotton. Both towels feature a similar \u201cwindowpane <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>check\u201d pattern created by coloring the stripes of plain weave surrounding the huckaback weave. The differences between the two towels are relatively minor. The Supra-Weave towel is smaller than the Ritz towel, woven in a two-ply as opposed to a one-ply construction, and the colored stripes are slightly brighter. The towels also differ in that the Ritz Flemish Wonder towel has both horizontal and vertical border stripes while the Supra-Weave towel has only a horizontal border stripe. The labels on the towels differ completely in appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">In early June 1984, Shen discovered Standard Terry\u2019s Supra-Weave towel at a trade show in New York City. On June 11, Shen\u2019s counsel wrote Standard Terry asserting Shen\u2019s common law trademark claim in its towel under \u00a7 43(a) of the Lanham Act and demanding that Standard Terry cease marketing the Supra-Weave towel. After further communications between counsel proved unavailing, Standard Terry brought the instant action for a declaratory judgment in Montgomery County Court. Shen successfully moved for removal to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and counterclaimed for injunctive relief against Standard Terry.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">After a bench trial the court held that both the weave and the windowpane check pattern of the Ritz Flemish Wonder towel were functional and therefore could not be protected under \u00a7 43(a) of the Lanham Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court relied on our discussion of the doctrine of \u201caesthetic functionality\u201d in <em>Keene Corporation v. Paraflex Industries, </em>653 F.2d 822 (3d Cir.1981) <em>(\u201cParaflex Industries\u201d), </em>in reaching its conclusion that the towel\u2019s trade dress did not qualify for \u00a7 43(a) protection. The court also denied Standard Terry\u2019s application for attorneys\u2019 fees under \u00a7 35 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117 (1982).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-10\">To succeed in a claim of trade dress infringement, Shen needed to prove: (i) that the Ritz Flemish Wonder towel\u2019s trade dress is nonfunctional; (ii) that its trade dress had acquired a secondary meaning among consumers as a means of identifying the source of the product; and (iii) that public was likely to confuse the Ritz Flemish Wonder with the Supra-Weave towel. <em>See Freixenet, S.A. v. Admiral Wine &amp; Liquor Co., </em>731 F.2d 148, 151 (3d Cir.1984). The district court decided this case on the basis of its evaluation of the first factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">The functionality doctrine accommodates the twin purposes behind the Lanham Act. It protects the manufacturer (and the consumer) from the copying of those fea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>tures that signify a product\u2019s source (and quality) and encourages competition by preventing one manufacturer from acquiring a monopoly by attempting to trademark those features of a design essential to a successful product of that type. <em>See W.T. Rogers Co. v. Keene, </em>778 F.2d 334, 338-39 (7th Cir.1985); <em>Paraflex Industries, </em>653 F.2d at 824. As we previously have observed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-5\">the essence of the question [of functionality] is whether a particular feature of a product or service is substantially related to its value <em>as a product or service, i.e., </em>if the feature is part of the \u201cfunction\u201d served, or whether the primary value of a particular feature is the identification of the provider.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-6\"><em>United States Golf Association v. St. Andrews Systems, </em>749 F.2d 1028, 1033 (3d Cir.1984), <em>citing Morton-Norwich Products, Inc., </em>671 F.2d 1332 (C.C.P.A.1982); <em>see Ives Laboratories, Inc. v. Darby Drug Co., </em>601 F.2d 631, 643 (2d Cir.1979) (functional features are those that prove \u201can important ingredient in the commercial success of the product\u201d rather than simply an \u201carbitrary embellishment \u2014 primarily adopted for the purposes of identification and individuality\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">Shen\u2019s claim that the trade dress of its Ritz Flemish Wonder towel is protected by \u00a7 43(a) may be analyzed by looking to the towel\u2019s two distinguishing features, the huckaback weave and the windowpane check design. Standard Terry presented evidence that the weave originated in Europe in the early 19th century and presently is used widely in the textile industry in the manufacture of glass type toweling. There is general agreement between the parties that huckaback weave is a superior material for toweling. On the basis of this evidence, the district court concluded that the Ritz Flemish Wonder towel\u2019s huckaback weave was functional. We agree: the weave is directly related to the function of the towel and does not serve to identify any particular towel producer.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">The proper characterization of the towel\u2019s windowpane check design is governed by the related doctrine of aesthetic functionality. In this circuit, a particular design is nonfunctional, and therefore entitled to common law trademark protection, if the design \u201cis not significantly related to the utilitarian function of the product, but is merely arbitrary.\u201d <em>Paraflex Industries, </em>653 F.2d at 825. Thus, we held in <em>Paraflex Industries </em>that the shape of an outdoor luminaire could not be the subject of \u00a7 43(a) protection when the evidence showed that its shape functioned to enhance its architectual compatibility with the structures on which it could be mounted. <em>Id. </em>at 826. Standard Terry presented evidence that the colored stripes in the windowpane check were made of plain woven fabric which gave the towel strength and durability, two features that are lacking in pure huckaback fabric. Standard Terry also demonstrated that windowpane check is a generic term in the textile industry as well as a favorite pattern for kitchen textiles. Faced with this evidence, the trial court concluded that Standard Terry\u2019s check pattern served to make the Supra-Weave towel strong, durable, and compatible with contemporary kitchen decor. The court recognized that Standard Terry could have made some slight variations in the check pattern without sacrificing the workability of its product. However, relying on our decision in <em>Paraflex Industries, </em>the court concluded that Standard Terry\u2019s failure to make such miniscule changes did not render its design nonfunctional. <em>See, id. </em>at 827. We cannot say the district court\u2019s finding regarding the functionality of the check pattern was clearly erroneous. <em>See Ciba-Geigy Corp. v. Bolar Pharmaceutical Co., </em>747 F.2d 844, 850 (3d Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>--- U.S. ---, 105 S.Ct. 2678, 86 L.Ed.2d 696 (1985) (functionality is a question of fact). We therefore conclude that Standard Terry\u2019s imitation did not constitute unfair competition or trademark infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-13\">Standard Terry argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>application for attorneys\u2019 fees under \u00a7 35 of the Lanham Act. In particular, Standard Terry alleges that the following actions constitute grounds for an' award of attorneys\u2019 fees: Shen\u2019s initial assertion of a protected interest in the Ritz Flemish Wonder\u2019s trade dress; Shen\u2019s alleged inability to support its claim that the trade dress had acquired a secondary meaning in the market and to substantiate other pretrial assertions of the towel\u2019s unique qualities; and Shen\u2019s use of a copyright symbol on the towel\u2019s label despite the Copyright Office\u2019s denial of Shen\u2019s application for copyright registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">Before we review the district court\u2019s decision, we face the initial question whether attorney\u2019s fees may be awarded at all in a suit for unfair competition under the Lanham Act. The general or \u201cAmerican\u201d rule is that a prevailing party ordinarily may not recover attorneys\u2019 fees absent statutory authorization. In 1975, Congress amended \u00a7 35 to provide for awards of attorneys\u2019 fees in \u201cexceptional cases\u201d in registered trademark infringement suits. Standard Terry argues that \u00a7 35 should apply as well to actions for common law trademark infringement brought under \u00a7 43(a) despite the statute\u2019s clear requirement that the trademark be one \u201cregistered in the Patent and Trademark Office.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although \u00a7 35\u2019s language seems clearly to preclude an award of attorneys\u2019 fees brought for actions to enforce unregistered trademarks, a number of appellate courts have extended \u00a7 35 in this manner. <em>See Transgo, Inc. v. Ajac Transmission Parts Corp., </em>768 F.2d 1001, 1025-26 (9th Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>--- U.S. ---, 106 S.Ct. 802, 88 L.Ed.2d 778 (1986); <em>Rickard v. Auto Publisher, Inc., </em>735 F.2d 450, 453-58 (11th Cir.1984); <em>Metric &amp; Multistandard Components v. Metric\u2019s Inc., </em>635 F.2d 710, 715-16 (8th Cir.1980). While these courts observed that the extension of \u00a7 35\u2019s remedial scheme to \u00a7 43(a) actions is consistent with Congress\u2019s underlying goals in passing the Lanham Act, <em>see Rickard, </em>735 F.2d at 457, the motivation behind this judicial gloss is the realization that the federal courts would face the undesirable prospect of creating a common law remedy for \u00a7 43(a) rights were they to hold that \u00a7 35\u2019s remedies did not apply in common law trademark infringement suits. <em>See Rickard, </em>735 F.2d at 457; <em>Metric &amp; Multistandard Components, </em>635 F.2d at 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">Like the district court below, we have doubts whether we should rectify Congress\u2019s oversight and hold that attorney\u2019s fees are available in this case. We previously have assumed without holding that \u00a7 35 applies to common law trademark actions brought under the Lanham Act, <em>see Donsco, Inc. v. Casper Corporation, </em>587 F.2d 602, 608 (3d Cir.1978), and we refrain today from deciding the issue because the record does not reveal that the district court abused its discretion in denying Standard Terry\u2019s application for fees. We cannot agree with Standard Terry that Shen\u2019s claim of common law trademark protection was groundless or brought primarily for the purpose of harassing Standard Terry. The record reveals that Shen\u2019s conduct is consistent with the vindication of rights that it believed in good faith were infringed by Standard Terry\u2019s Supra-Weave towel. Nor do we believe that Shen\u2019s temporary use of a copyright symbol should be a factor in the calculation as there is no showing that it has any connection with this suit: Shen never claimed that Standard Terry had infringed a registered copyright. In short, Standard Terry has not shown that this is an exceptional case that warrants attorneys fees award.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>Finally, Standard Terry urges that we charge Shen for the costs of this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912 (1982) and damages under Fed.R.App.P. 38. Such an award is appropriate only when the appeal is wholly without merit, however. <em>See Sauers v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>771 F.2d 64, 70 n. 9 (3d Cir.1985). In light of our discussion above, we do not believe that the issues raised by Shen\u2019s appeal are completely frivolous and therefore accordingly decline to award either costs or damages to Standard Terry.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">It may seem anomalous that the law will not protect the producer of a successful product from an admitted copier. Nevertheless, the functionality doctrine protects consumers \u2014 and producers \u2014 from the monopoly that would result if a producer could protect those features that, in effect, provide the product with its essential characteristics. We agree with the district court that the weave and the decorative pattern of the Ritz Flemish Wonder towel are such characteristics. Accordingly, we will affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b855-12\">. This section provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-13\">False designations of origin and false descriptions forbidden</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-14\">(a) Any person who shall affix, apply, or annex, or use in connection with any goods or services, or any container or containers for goods, a false designation of origin, or any false description or representation, including words or other symbols tending falsely to describe or represent the same, and shall cause such goods or services to enter into commerce____ shall be liable to a civil action ... by any person who believes he is or is likely to be damaged by the use of any false description or representation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-17\">This section includes within its scope common law, or unregistered, trademark infringement. <em>See United States Golf Association v.

Standard Terry argues that Shen has not shown that it owns any interest in the trade dress of the Ritz Flemish Wonder towel because it did not prove that John Ritzenhaler designed the towel. Because Standard Terry did not raise this issue at trial, we will not consider it here. <em>See Newark Morning Ledger Co. v. United States, </em>539 F.2d 929, 932 (3d Cir.1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b856-6\">. Shen also asserts its common law trademark rights under \u00a7 1126 of the Pennsylvania Trademark Act, 54 Pa.Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 1101-26 (Supp. 1986). The parties appear to agree that the elements of common law trademark infringement under Pennsylvania and federal law are identical, a conclusion reached by a number of district courts. <em>See University of Pittsburgh v. Champion Products, Inc., </em>566 F.Supp. 711, 719 (W.D.Pa.1983); <em>Artus Corp. v. Nordic Co., Inc., </em>512 F.Supp. 1184, 1187-88 (W.D.Pa.1981): <em>International Society for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Stadium Authority, </em>479 F.Supp. 792, 798 (W.D.Pa.1979). Our review of these cases and Pennsylvania decisions, <em>see, e.g., Zimmerman v. Holiday Inns of America, Inc., </em>438 Pa. 528, 534-35, 266 A.2d 87, 90 (1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 992, 91 S.Ct. 456, 27 L.Ed.2d 440 (1971), leads us to conclude that except for the element of interstate commerce required to support a claim under the Lanham Act, the two causes of action are sufficiently similar to permit us to restrict our discussion to the federal claim alone.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b856-12\">.

For the text of \u00a7 35, <em>see supra </em>note 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b858-7\">. In their reply brief, Standard Terry argues that our recent decision in <em>Lieb v. Topstone Industries, Inc., </em>788 F.2d 151 (3d Cir.1986) concerning attorneys\u2019 fees awards under \u00a7 101 of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 505 (1982), controls this issue. Although <em>Lieb </em>is certainly instructive, it does not provide the legal precepts governing attorney fees under \u00a7 35 of the Lanham Act. Unlike the Lanham Act provision, the Copyright Act does not restrict attorneys\u2019 fees to \"exceptional cases.\u201d According to the Senate Report, Congress intended the Lanham Act attorneys\u2019 fees provision to encompass cases such as where the trademark infringement was \"\u2018malicious/ \u2018fraudulent,\u2019 \u2018deliberate/ or \u2018willful.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AR_\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>S.Rep.
