First National also alleges that Regent was liable for Jera,mie\u2019s injuries under theories of strict tort liability, implied warranty of merchantability, and negligence. The district court granted Regent\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the federal claim under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1261 <em>et seq., </em>and on the strict liability claim, as well as the implied warranty and negligence claims. First National appeals from the district court\u2019s granting of summary judgment. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1498-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1498-18\">On July 2, 1982, Joanne Farmer went to a Walgreen\u2019s Company store and purchased a set of \u201cSlider Jarts\u201d manufactured by the Regent Sports Corporation (Regent) for her daughter, Paula Bradford. Paula reimbursed her mother for the \u201cJarts.\u201d \u201cSlider Jarts\u201d are used in a lawn dart game in which players toss the \u201cJarts,\u201d or lawn darts, into a ring placed on the ground some distance from the players. On July 4, 1982, Paula and her husband hosted a picnic at their home which was attended by George and Mary Ann Aimone and their son, Jeramie, two and one-half years of age. During the picnic, some children took out the \u201cSlider Jarts\u201d and began playing with them. Cindy Jo Harp, Joann Farmer\u2019s eight-year old granddaughter, threw one of the \u201cJarts\u201d into the air. On its descent to the ground, the lawn dart struck Jeramie in the head, entered his skull, causing permaneht brain damage. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1433\">*1433</page-number>Jeramie through his guardian, First National, and parents filed suit against Walgreen\u2019s Company, Regent Sports Corporation, Paula Bradford and her husband. On appeal, we are concerned only with the claims against Regent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1499-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1499-5\">Jeramie Aimone initially appeals the summary judgment granted by the district court to Regent on Count III of his complaint. Jeramie brought Count III under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2072(a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> alleging that Regent introduced a product into interstate commerce in violation of the regulations promulgated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, specifically 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 1500.-18(a)(4).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Consumer Product Safety Commission has the authority to issue these regulations under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1261 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1499-10\">The district court may grant a summary judgment \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions of file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.Pro. 56(c). The party moving for a summary judgment carries the burden of establishing that no genuine issue as to any material fact exists and that the movant is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Goldstick v. ICM Realty, </em>788 F.2d 456, 458 (7th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1499-11\">Pursuant to 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 1500.-3(b)(4)(i)(D),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> all products determined by the Consumer Product Safety Commission to present mechanical hazards to children are categorized as \u201chazardous substances\u201d and are banned from interstate commerce under 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 1500.3(b)(15)(i).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under 16 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1434\">*1434</page-number>C.F.R. \u00a7 1500.18(a)(4), lawn darts such as \u201cSlider Jarts\u201d are classified as mechanical hazards and are consequently banned from interstate commerce because they are unsuitable for children.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While lawn darts cannot be sold for use by children, they may be marketed under 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 1500.-86(a)(3)(i)(ii)(iii) as a game of skill for adults.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1500-4\">Regent repeats the argument it made before the district court now on appeal that, despite the fact that the \u201cSlider Jarts\u201d may have been improperly resold by Walgreen\u2019s, Regent\u2019s \u201cproduct satisfied all the requirements for which it [Regent] could be held responsible and, therefore, that it [Regent] did not commit a \u2018knowing (including willful)\u2019 violation of the regulation as required by section 2072.\u201d <em>Aimone by Aimone v. Walgreen\u2019s Co., </em>601 F.Supp. 507, 513 (D.C.Ill.1985). Lawn darts cannot be sold in toy stores or store departments dealing predominantly in toys and other children\u2019s articles. <em>See </em>16 C.F.R. \u00a7 1500.-86(a)(3)(iii). Regent\u2019s invoices to retailers selling \u201cSlider Jarts\u201d state \u201cNot to be sold in toy or children\u2019s departments.\u201d 601 F.Supp. at 513. In the catalogs distributed by Regent, the description of the lawn dart game clearly set forth: \u201cNot a toy. (Not to be sold in toy departments).\u201d Regent also has clearly imprinted on the outside of its shipping cartons: \u201cNot to be sold in toy departments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Federal regulations not only prohibit the sale of lawn darts in toy stores or toy departments but also in \u201cstore departments dealing predominantly in toys and other children\u2019s articles.\u201d 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 1500.86(a)(3)(iii). By specifically stating that \u201cSlider Jarts\u201d are not to be sold in toy stores, Regent does not exclude the possibility that the \u201cSlider Jarts\u201d may be sold in store departments dealing primarily in \u201cother children\u2019s articles.\u201d In its Answer to Interrogatories, Regent did admit selling its Jarts to sporting goods stores. A question arises as to whether sporting goods fall into the category of \u201cother children\u2019s articles.\u201d In a House Report treating 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1261, the statute which grants authority .to the Consumer Product Safety Commission to ban dangerous items, a House Committee stated that the phrase \u201cother articles intended for the use of children\u201d used in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1261 included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1500-13\">\u201cgames; dolls, stuffed animals, and other toys; swings, slides, seesaws, and other playground equipment; sleds, toboggans, bicycles, tricycles, and other recreational equipment; infants\u2019 carriages and strollers; slatted, netted, or lidded cribs and other nursery equipment; children\u2019s furniture; science and construction kits; children\u2019s footwear; and sports equipment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1500-14\">H.R.Rep., 91-389, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 9 (1969), <em>reprinted in </em>U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1969, pp. 1231, 1236. Given the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1435\">*1435</page-number>similarity between the phrase used in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1261 and the regulation promulgated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 1500.86(3)(iii), it is obvious that sporting goods are \u201cother children\u2019s articles\u201d under 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 1500.-86(3)(iii). In this case, the \u201cSlider Jart\u201d that injured Jeramie was sold in the \u201csporting goods\u201d section of a Walgreen\u2019s Company store. Thus, a question of fact exists as to whether Regent knowingly violated 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 1500.86(3)(iii) in marketing their \u201cSlider Jarts\u201d as sporting goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b1501-4\">To be liable under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2072(a), Regent must have knowingly violated 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 1500.86(a)(3). The district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1501-5\">\u201cIt is clear that Regent took a number of precautions in distributing the lawn darts, whether or not the darts were improperly retailed by Walgreen\u2019s. It made it clear in its catalog, invoices and cartons, that the darts were not to be sold with toys. It purposely determined not to sell the product to toy stores. Walgreen\u2019s, to which it did sell, deals primarily in drugs, cosmetics and adult items. In addition, Regent delivered the product not to individual stores but to Walgreen\u2019s warehouses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1501-6\">601 F.Supp. at 513-14. While Regent did take precautions in distributing its lawn darts, its marketing practices may have resulted in \u201cSlider Jarts\u201d being sold in violation of 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 1500.86(3)(iii). In his motion for reconsideration, Jeramie presented evidence that Regent sold its \u201cSlider Jarts\u201d as part of a \u201c5-Game Combination\u201d package which also included badminton, volleyball, backyard tennis, and rubber horseshoe games, all games frequently played by children. The sale of lawn darts with children\u2019s articles violates 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 1500.86(3)(iii). Although the lawn dart that injured the plaintiff in this case did not come from a \u201c5-Game Combination\u201d package, such packaging is evidence that Regent conceivably may have indirectly violated 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 1500.86(3)(iii) by promoting the sale of lawn darts as athletic equipment suitable for the use of children.</p>\n<p id=\"b1501-8\">Appellant also points out that Regent\u2019s instruction sheet included in the box with the Jart game detailing the use of the \u201cSlider Jarts\u201d may have violated 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 1500.86(3)(ii). In its instructions Regent states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1501-9\">\u201cALWAYS OBSERVE RULES OF SAFETY! All participants must stand behind the players tossing Jarts. The area in front and to the sides of the players must be clear of any children, adults, or pets. <em>In the event any adult permits a child or minor to participate in this sport, it is necessary to obtain parents\u2019 or legal guardian\u2019s consent. </em>Even then, careful adult supervision by the parents or legal guardian is required.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1501-10\">Instructions to \u201cSlider Jart\u201d game.</p>\n<p id=\"b1501-11\">The district court found that \u201cit cannot be concluded from the instruction sheet that the same was intended for use by children.\u201d Mem. Op. &amp; Or. 5/7/85, p. 2. The court went on to say that \u201cRegent took into account that no matter what the game, whether it involves darts or some other hazard, some adults will let some children participate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Whether or not some reader will conclude after reading these instructions that children may safely use \u201cSlider Jarts\u201d is a question of fact for a jury. Accordingly, we make no comment on whether Jeramie should prevail. We limit our holding and state that the district court should not have granted summary judgment on Jeramie\u2019s claim that Regent violated 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 1500.86(3)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1501-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1501-13\">Jeramie through First National also appeals the summary judgment granted to Regent on his strict tort liability claim. The Illinois Supreme Court adopted the theory of strict products liability in <em>Suvada v. White Motor Company, </em>32 Ill.2d 612, 210 N.E.2d 182 (1965). In <em>Suvada, </em>the court adopted the position taken in section 402A of the American Law Institute\u2019s revised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1436\">*1436</page-number>Restatement of the Law of Torts. Quoting from the Restatement, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzC\">\u201c \u2018(1) One who sells any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer or to his property is subject to liability for physical harm thereby caused to the ultimate user or consumer, or to his property, if</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A45\">\u2018(a) the seller is engaged in the business of selling such a product, and \u2018(b) it is expected to reach the user or consumer in the condition in which it is sold.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1502-4\">\u2018(2) The rule stated the subsection (1) applies although</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1502-5\">\u2018(a) the seller has exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of his product, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1502-6\">\u2018(b) the user or consumer has not bought the product from or entered into any contractual relation with the seller.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1502-7\"><em>Suvada v. White Motor Company, </em>32 Ill.2d 612, 210 N.E.2d 182 (1965), <em>quoting </em>RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS \u00a7 402A (1964). Thus, under Illinois law, \u201cto recover in strict liability, the injury must result from a condition of the product, the condition must be unreasonably dangerous and the condition must have existed at the time the product left the manufacturer\u2019s control.\u201d <em>Hunt v. Blasius, </em>74 Ill.2d 203, 210, 23 Ill.Dec. 574, 384 N.E.2d 368 (1978). On appeal, Jeramie claims that the \u201cSlider Jart\u201d was unreasonably dangerous because Regent failed to provide adequate warnings. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 23. \u201cIt is well recognized that a failure to warn of a product\u2019s dangerous propensities may serve as the basis for holding a manufacturer or seller strictly liable in tort.\u201d <em>Woodill v. Parke Davis &amp; Co., </em>79 Ill.2d 26, 37 Ill.Dec. 304, 306, 402 N.E.2d 194, 196 (1980). In Illinois, \u201c[t]he adequacy of warnings ... usually present jury questions.\u201d <em>Palmer v. Avco Distributing Corporation, </em>82 Ill.2d 211, 45 Ill.Dec. 377, 362, 412 N.E.2d 959, 964 (1980) (citations omitted). \u201cOther jurisdictions have recognized that warnings could be inadequate, for example, if they did not specify the risk presented by the product, if they did not provide the reason for the warning or if they did not reach foreseeable users.\u201d <em>Palmer v. Avco Distributing Corp., </em>82 Ill.2d 211, 45 Ill.Dec. 377, 362, 412 N.E.2d 959, 964 (1980) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-9\">In order for a product to be classified as unreasonably dangerous \u201c[t]he article sold must be dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer who purchases it, with the ordinary knowledge common to the community as to its characteristics.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402A comment i (1964). <em>See also Camp Creek Duck Farm, Inc. v. Shell Oil Company, </em>103 Ill.App.3d 81, 58 Ill.Dec. 443, 430 N.E.2d 385 (1982). In <em>Hunt v. Blasius, </em>74 Ill.2d 203, 211-12, 23 Ill.Dec. 574, 578, 384 N.E.2d 368, 372 (1978), the Illinois Supreme Court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1502-10\">\u201cVirtually any product is capable of producing injury when put to certain uses or misuses____ Injuries are not compensable in products liability if they derive merely from those inherent properties of a product which are obvious to all who come in contact with the product. The injuries must derive from a distinct defect in the product, a defect which subjects those exposed to the product to an <em>unreasonable </em>risk of harm. The Restatement (Second) of Torts concludes that strict liability applies only when the product is \u2018dangerous to an extent <em>beyond </em>that which would be contemplated by the ordinary [person] ..., with the ordinary knowledge common to the community as to its characteristics.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1502-12\">74 Ill.2d 203, 211-12, 23 Ill.Dec. 574, 578, 384 N.E.2d 368, 372 (1978). In rendering its decision, the district court relied on <em>Pitts v. Basile, </em>35 Ill.2d 49, 219 N.E.2d 472 (1966). In that case, the Illinois Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1502-13\">\u201cIn this court, however, the plaintiff urges that the defendants\u2019 \u2018non-defective\u2019 dart manifestly was not safe when used by small children for the purpose for which it was intended. The dart in question was intended to be thrown at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1437\">*1437</page-number>various objects * * *. Its propensity to cause serious injury, particularly to the eyes, was demonstrated by the very injury suffered by the infant plaintiff in the instant case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1503-4\">\u201cThere are many things used by children that may be said to be unsafe when used for the purpose for which they are intended. A baseball, a baseball bat, a pen knife, a Boy Scout hatchet, a bicycle, all have the capacity to injure the user or others in the course of their normal use. They are not, however, to be categorized as \u2018dangerous instrumentalities____\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1503-6\">\u201c \u2018To us it is simply inconceivable that a 10-year-old boy, much less his mother, would be unacquainted with the use of so common an article as the one here in question.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1503-7\">35 Ill.2d 49, 51-52, 219 N.E.2d 472, 474 (citations omitted). In <em>Pitts, </em>a child struck by a dart thrown by another child, who had purchased the dart at a neighborhood grocery, brought an action against the wholesaler of the dart and the retailers, who operated the grocery. Although the <em>Pitts </em>decision was based on a theory of negligence, the case makes it clear that the Illinois courts consider that the danger inherent in a dart should have been obvious to a child of ten years of age. In a similar Oklahoma case based on strict liability in which a child was injured by a lawn dart, the court there, relying on <em>Pitts, </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvO\">\u201cThere are many toys and playthings, perfectly harmless and inoffensive in themselves, but whose common use can be perverted into a dangerous use or design, and there are very few of the most harmless toys which cannot be used to injure another. The dart\u2019s propensities to cause injury is demonstrated by the injury sustained but the fact that an injury was sustained does not necessarily mean that the manufacturer or retailer are liable for those injuries.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1503-8\"><em>Atkins v. Arlans Department Store of Norman, </em>522 P.2d 1020, 1022 (Okla.1974). In <em>Martin v. Harrington and Richardson, </em>743 F.2d 1200 (7th Cir.1984), this court in interpreting Illinois law stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1503-9\">\u201cUnder Illinois law, a product is \u2018unreasonably dangerous\u2019 when it is \u2018dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer who purchases it, with the ordinary knowledge common to the community as to its characteristics.\u2019 A product may be unreasonably dangerous because of a design or manufacturing defect or because of failure to warn of a danger posed by the product of which the average consumer would not already be aware. A nondefective product that presents a danger that the average consumer would recognize does not give rise to strict liability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1503-10\">743 F.2d 1200, 1202 (citations omitted). <em>See also Garrison v. Heublein, Inc., </em>673 F.2d 189 (7th Cir.1982) (Illinois law does not require warnings on alcoholic beverages as dangers posed by alcohol are common knowledge).</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-11\">Regent promoted the game of \u201cSlider Jarts\u201d as a game of skill for adults. Regent argues that the lawn darts were not unreasonably dangerous for their intended use. The district court held that \u201cbecause the dangers involved with lawn darts were inherently obvious, Illinois holds them to be not unreasonably dangerous.\u201d 601 F.Supp. 507, 515. We agree with the district court that the dangers presented by \u201cSlider Jarts\u201d should be obvious even to children of the tender age of eight.</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-12\">The \u201cSlider Jarts\u201d also cannot be held to be an unreasonably dangerous product due to a failure to warn. Regent printed the following warnings on the \u201cSlider Jart\u201d itself in raised letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-13\">WARNING</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-14\">NOT A TOY FOR USE BY CHILDREN</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-15\">MAY CAUSE SERIOUS OR FATAL INJURY</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-16\">READ INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-17\">KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN.</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-18\">Affidavit Exhibit \u2014 Motion for Reconsideration. These warnings were also repeated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1438\">*1438</page-number>on Regent\u2019s shipping cartons, the game box, and in Regent\u2019s instruction booklet. The district court stated that \u201cit can hardly be said that defendant\u2019s warnings were insufficient, in light of their presence on the box, on the instruction sheets and on the Jarts themselves.\u201d Mem.Op. &amp; Or. 5/7/85, p. 5. We agree with this finding and hold that the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on First National\u2019s strict liability claim was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1504-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1504-5\">Jeramie through First National further appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Regent on Count VII of the amended complaint. Count VII of the amended complaint alleged that Regent breached an implied warranty of merchantability. The district court expressed some doubt as to whether Jeramie could succeed under a theory of implied warranty because Jeramie might not be in privity of contract with Regent as required by Illinois law. <em>See </em>Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 26, 112-318. However, we need not reach this question because our decision to affirm the district court\u2019s decision on the strict liability claim mandates that we affirm the district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment on the breach of implied warranty claim. In Illinois, as long as a plaintiff meets certain privity requirements, the issue in a products liability suit brought on breach of warranty is essentially the same as one brought under strict tort liability theory. <em>Nave v. Rainbo Tire Service, Inc., </em>123 Ill.App.3d 585, 78 Ill.Dec. 501, 462 N.E.2d 620 (1984). The inquiry is whether the product is \u201cfit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used.\u201d Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 26, \u00b6 2-314(2)(c). The Illinois courts have found this inquiry to be practically the same as determining whether an item was a \u201cdefective product unreasonably dangerous,\u201d the test for liability under strict tort liability theory. In <em>Dunham v. Vaughan &amp; Bushnell Manufacturing Co., </em>86 Ill.App.2d 315, 333, 229 N.E.2d 684 (1967), <em>aff'd </em>42 Ill.2d 339, 247 N.E.2d 401 (1969), the court said \u201c[t]he strict liability theory is essentially the liability of implied warranty divested of the contract doctrines of privity, disclaimer and notice.\u201d <em>Id. See also Nave v. Rainbo Tire Service, Inc., </em>123 Ill.App.3d 585, 78 Ill.Dec. 501, 506, 462 N.E.2d 620, 625 (1984). Since we held that Regent is not liable under the theory of strict tort liability, we hold that Regent did not breach an implied warranty of merchantability and that the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Regent on Count VII of the amended complaint was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1504-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1504-8\">Finally, Jeramie through First National appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Regent on Count VIII of the amended complaint. Count VIII of the amended complaint alleged that Jeramie\u2019s injuries resulted from Regent\u2019s negligence. The district court found that \u201cin this factual situation Regent owed no duty to Jeramie.\u201d 619 F.Supp. 820, 823 (N.D.Ill.1985). In Illinois, no duty to the plaintiff exists if it is not foreseeable that the defendant\u2019s conduct would create a risk of harm to the plaintiff. <em>Osborne v. Sprowls, </em>84 Ill.2d 390, 50 Ill.Dec. 645, 419 N.E.2d 913 (1981). Count VIII of the amended complaint alleged that Regent was negligent because it placed \u201cSlider Jarts\u201d on the market. In <em>Maramba v. Neuman, </em>82 Ill.App.2d 95, 227 N.E.2d 80 (1967), the Illinois Appellate Court affirmed a trial court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint alleging that a manufacturer was negligent for placing a boomerang on the market. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1504-9\">\u201cWe conclude that a boomerang, which is used by children, is not a dangerous instrumentality as such, merely because after it is thrown its flight cannot be controlled, any more than a baseball, a dart or many other articles, which are classified as toys, can be held to be dangerous instrumentalities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1504-10\">\u201cWe further conclude that an injury occasioned by the use of the boomerang in question by an inexperienced child, even where the merchant could reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1439\">*1439</page-number>ably have foreseen that the boomerang was to be used by that ten-year-old child, does not impose liability upon him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1505-7\">227 N.E.2d at 83-84. Similarly, in <em>Pitts v. Basile, </em>35 Ill.2d 49, 219 N.E.2d 472 (1966), the Illinois Supreme Court held that a wholesaler was not negligent for selling darts to retailers and consequently was not liable to the plaintiff who was injured by a dart which the wholesaler had marketed. The present case is analogous to the <em>Pitts </em>case in that Regent, acting as a wholesaler, distributed the lawn dart which injured Jeramie. The district court concluded that \u201cRegent did not negligently place a dangerous or defective item on the market because the lawn darts are not unreasonably dangerous under Illinois law and were not defective.\u201d 619 F.Supp. 820, 824.</p>\n<p id=\"b1505-8\">Count VIII of the amended complaint also alleged that Regent negligently failed to provide adequate warnings for the use of \u201cSlider Jarts.\u201d Regent placed warnings not only in the instructions to the game of \u201cSlider Jarts\u201d but also on the box in which the \u201cJarts\u201d were sold and on the \u201cSlider Jarts\u201d themselves. The warning on the lawn dart itself stated that the dart \u201cmay cause serious or fatal injury.\u201d The warning went further and directed \u201ckeep out of reach of children.\u201d Further, Regent structured its marketing practices to avoid selling the \u201cSlider Jarts\u201d to children. Regent did not sell to toy stores and informed retailers not to sell the \u201cSlider Jarts\u201d in toy departments. The district court found that \u201cRegent took enough precautions to legally shift the responsibility for Jeramie\u2019s injuries to others.\u201d 619 F.Supp. at 824. We agree and hold that the district court properly granted summary judgment for Regent on Count VIII of the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1505-9\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b1505-10\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED IN PART and REVERSED IN PART.
