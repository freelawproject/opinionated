In each order, the Commission granted an application for a permit to \u201coperate as a <em>contract carrier, ... </em>transporting <em>general commodities </em>(except classes A and B explosives and household goods), ... under continuing contracts) with commercial shippers or receivers of such commodities.\u201d Joint Appendix (\u201cJ.A.\u201d) at 73,163A, 201 (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because we conclude that in each case the Commission acted within the scope of its authority to issue contract carrier permits, <em>see </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10923, and to determine what evidence applicants for such permits must present, the petitions for review are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-3\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-4\">A. <em>The Statutory Definition of Motor Contract Carriage</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1253-14\">At issue is the meaning of the statutory definition of motor contract carriage, now codified at 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10102(14)(B). That section defines a \u201cmotor contract carrier\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1253-15\">(B) a person providing motor vehicle transportation of property for compensation under continuing agreements with one or more persons\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1253-16\">(i) by assigning motor vehicles for a continuing period of time for the exclusive use of each such person; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1253-17\">(ii) designed to meet the distinct needs of each such person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1253-18\">In issuing the permits challenged here, the Commission relied on \u00a7 10102(14)(B)(i), commonly referred to as the \u201cdedication of equipment\u201d prong of the definition. (Section 10102(14)(B)(ii) is referred to as the \u201cdistinct needs\u201d prong.) An applicant for a permit to operate as a motor contract carrier must satisfy only one of the two tests. <em>Aero Mayflower Transit Co. v. ICC, </em>711 F.2d 224, 227 (D.C.Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-19\">In contrast, a \u201cmotor common carrier\u201d is defined as \u201ca person holding itself out to the general public to provide motor vehicle transportation for compensation.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10102(13). There are significant differences in the kind and degree of regulation imposed upon common and contract carriers. For example, common carriers are required to file with the Commission tariffs specifying rates for the transportation they provide; contract carriers are not.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A common carrier may not \u201ccharge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1188\">*1188</page-number>or receive from a person a different compensation ... for a service rendered ... than it charges or receives from another person for performing a like and contemporaneous service,\u201d nor may it \u201csubject a person, place, port, or type of traffic to unreasonable discrimination.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10741(a)-(b). Contract carriers, on the other hand, are not subject to these anti-discrimination provisions. <em>See Central &amp; Southern Motor Freight Tariff Ass\u2019n v. United States, </em>757 F.2d 301, 325 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>--- U.S. ---, 106 S.Ct. 568, 88 L.Ed.2d 553 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-5\">Contract carriage and common carriage were distinguished originally in the Motor Carrier Act of 1935, Pub.L. No. 74-255, 49 Stat. 543, which was \u201cdesigned ... in large part, to prevent depression-squeezed contract carriers from encroaching on the domain of common carriers.\u201d <em>Central &amp; Southern Motor Freight, </em>757 F.2d at 309; <em>see Contracts of Contract Carriers, </em>1 M. C.C. 628, 629 (1937) (\u201cThe underlying purpose [of the 1935 Act] is plainly to promote and protect adequate and efficient common-carrier service____ The patent object of Congress is to protect the common carriers against cut-throat competition.\u201d), <em>modified, </em>11 M.C.C. 693 (1938).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The 1935 Act defined a \u201ccontract carrier by motor vehicle\u201d as a person who provided transportation of passengers or property by motor vehicle for compensation \u201cunder special and individual contracts or agreements.\u201d Pub.L. No. 74-255, \u00a7 203(a)(15), 49 Stat. 543, 544-45 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-14\">Worried in 1957 that \u201c[t]he present law has proved inadequate to maintain proper distinctions between common and contract carriage,\u201d Congress made several changes in the definition of contract carriage. S.Rep. No. 703, 85th Cong., 1st Sess. 7, <em>reprinted in </em>1957 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1599, 1604.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The 1957 amendments required a contract carrier to enter into \u201ccontinuing contracts with one person or a limited number of persons\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1189\">*1189</page-number>meet either the dedication of equipment or the distinct needs test. Pub.L. No. 85-163, \u00a7 1, 71 Stat. 411, 411 (1957). The aim of the 1957 amendments was to provide greater protection for the interests of common carriers. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 703, 85th Cong., 1st Sess. 7 (bill required by public interest \u201cin a stable and adequate system of common carriage\u201d), <em>reprinted in </em>1957 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1599, 1605; <em>cf. Central &amp; Southern Motor Freight, </em>757 F.2d at 310 (aim of 1957 amendments \u201cwas unabashed protection of common carriers\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-4\">The statutory definition of contract carriage was again amended by the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, Pub.L. No. 96-296, 94 Stat. 793. The premise of the 1980 Act, however, was that \u201cthe statutes governing Federal regulation of the motor carrier industry are outdated and must be revised to reflect the transportation needs and realities of the 1980\u2019s.\u201d Pub.L. No. 96-296, \u00a7 3, 94 Stat. 793, 793 (codified at 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10101. note).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> With respect to contract carriers, the Act was intended to \u201cremovef ] many of the obstacles that have kept motor contract carriers from realizing their full potential.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 1069, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 22, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 2283, 2304. The Motor Carrier Act eliminated the requirement that a contract carrier enter into agreements with a \u201climited number of persons.\u201d Pub.L. No. 96-296, \u00a7 10(a)(1), 94 Stat. 793, 799 (1980). The congressional reports indicate that this change was intended to ratify the Commission\u2019s recent abolition of the \u201cRule of Eight,\u201d under which the Commission had for many years limited the number of shippers a contract carrier could serve- to eight,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but that \u201c[m]otor contract carriers will continue to be required to meet the standard of dedication of equipment or providing a service to meet a shipper\u2019s distinct need, but will be able to expand their service to serve more shippers.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 1069, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 22, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 2283, 2304; S.Rep. No. 641, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 27 (1980). The 1980 Act eliminated several other restrictions on the operations of contract carriers: it permitted a carrier to operate as both a contract and a common carrier, prohibited the Commission from requiring a contract carrier \u201cto limit its operations to carriage for a particular industry or within a particular geographic area,\u201d and authorized contract carriers to provide services to freight forwarders. Pub.L. No. 96-296, \u00a7 10, 94 Stat. 793, 799-801 (1980); <em>see </em>H.R. Rep. No. 1069, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 22-23, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 2283, 2304-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-10\">B. <em>The Commission\u2019s 1983 Policy Statement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1255-11\">In deciding to issue the permits challenged here, the ICC relied on its policy statement, <em>Issuance of Permits Authorizing Industry-wide Service, </em>133 M.C.C. 298 (1983), in which the Commission announced that applicants would be granted contract carrier authority \u201cto serve an industry or industries as a class, ... provided applicant meets the equipment dedication or distinct needs test of contract carriage with respect to the class as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 298. Noting that \u201c[t]here is no longer any statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190\">*1190</page-number>justification for restricting the scope of competitive activity among contract carriers,\u201d the Commission concluded that \u201c[gjranting contract carrier permits by class or industry provides important potential competition because it allows contract carriers to solicit additional contracts without obtaining prior regulatory approval to serve new customers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301. The Commission stated that an applicant for a contract carrier permit could satisfy the dedication of equipment requirement by \u201crepresenting] that it will enter into contracts only with those shippers to which it will dedicate equipment,\u201d and it refused to \u201crequire the dedication of specific equipment to each shipper within a given class prior to service.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301-02. The Commission reasoned that such a requirement would \u201ccreate an evidentiary impasse,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 301, apparently because an applicant would be unable to dedicate equipment to specific shippers without identifying which shippers it intended to serve. The Commission also announced that an applicant for a contract carrier permit to serve a class of shippers need not submit statements of shipper support, noting that the applicable ICC regulation \u201cpermits applicants to submit verified certifications of shipper or witness support.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 302 &amp; n. 7 (emphasis in original) (citing 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1160.5(d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-4\">C. <em>The Haslerig Trucking Company Proceeding </em>(No. 85-1373)</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-5\">Haslerig Trucking Company, Inc. (\u201cHaslerig\u201d) applied in December, 1984 for a contract carrier permit to transport general commodities under continuing contracts with commercial shippers or receivers of such commodities. J.A. at 7. In its application, Haslerig stated that it would meet the statutory requirements of contract carriage \u201c[b]y assignment of motor vehicles for a continuing period of time for the exclusive use of class of persons served. In addition, applicant will meet any distinct needs that may be required in providing service.\u201d J.A. at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-6\">Haslerig\u2019s president submitted a verified statement in support of the application, in which he indicated that Haslerig was already operating as a contract carrier, but that it was seeking a broader commodity authorization to enable it to \u201cprovide a more efficient, responsive and dedicated service to its shippers.\u201d J.A. at 12. Haslerig also submitted certificates of support from five shippers. All of the shippers indicated that they were currently using common carrier transportation services, and all left blank the spaces provided for shippers to list \u201cUnsatisfactory aspects of these [current] services, if any\u201d and \u201cSpecialized service needs, if any.\u201d J.A. at 18, 21, 24, 27, 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-8\">The American Trucking Associations, Inc., Regular Common Carrier Conference, and International Brotherhood of Teamsters, petitioners in this case, filed protests in opposition to Haslerig\u2019s application. J.A. at 65. The protestants argued that the proposed contract carrier authority contravened the statutory definition of contract carriage and effectively eradicated the distinction between contract carriage and common carriage which Congress intended to preserve. J.A. at 40-43, 58-61. Granting the application would, moreover, place contract carriers in direct competition with common carriers of general commodities. Because contract carriers are permitted to discriminate with respect to the shippers they serve and the prices they charge, contract carriers would be able to \u201ccorner the most profitable traffic by refusing to serve, or charging discriminatory rates to, the less attractive shippers,\u201d creating a \u201cruinous competitive disadvantage\u201d for common carriers. J.A. at 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-9\">The ICC granted Haslerig\u2019s application on May 14, 1985. The Commission determined that Haslerig had satisfied the dedication of equipment prong of the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar9\">Applicant ... has proposed to dedicate equipment to the exclusive use of each shipper with which it will contract. It has thus satisfied the exclusive use test, and its proposal therefore meets the statutory definition of contract carriage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1256-10\">J.A. at 68. The Commission also concluded that the class to be served, which it defined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number>as \u201cthose commercial shippers with whom applicant will enter into continuing contracts under which it agrees to dedicate at least one vehicle to the contracting shipper,\u201d was a valid class under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10923(d)(2).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> J.A. at 69. Finally, the Commission considered the public interest criteria set out at 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10923(b)(3). The Commission noted that Haslerig was an experienced contract carrier, and that granting the application would enable it both to provide more complete service to its current shippers and to expand its contract carrier operations to other shippers. Rejecting arguments raised by the protestants about possible competitive disadvantage to common carriers, the Commission stated that \u201c[restricting the growth of contract carriers to insulate common carriers from competition, as protestants apparently would have us do, is not the approach taken by the Motor Carrier Act of 1980.\u201d J.A. at 69. The Commission found that denial of the application would restrict Haslerig\u2019s ability to expand its services, would force Haslerig to \u201cexpend additional funds and energies in filing applications for permits each time it finds a shipper desirous of contracting for its service,\u201d and would deprive shippers \u201cof the availability of a variety of service and price options.\u201d J.A. at 69-70. Based on its consideration of these factors, the Commission concluded that the application should be granted. J.A. at 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-5\">Chairman Taylor dissented from the decision, noting that the Commission had authorized Haslerig \u201cto serve essentially <em>all </em>potential shippers and receivers of general commodities.\u201d J.A. at 71 (emphasis in original). Because, in his view, \u201ca \u2018class\u2019 means something less than all potential shippers and receivers,\u201d Chairman Taylor concluded that the Commission had failed to follow its decision in <em>Issuance of Permits Authorizing Industry-wide Service, </em>133 M.C.C. 298 (1983), in which it announced that contract carrier applicants could be authorized to serve an \u201cindustry or industries as a class.\u201d J.A. at 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-3\">D. <em>The River Bend Transport Company Proceeding </em>(No. 85-1374)</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-7\">River Bend Transport Company (\u201cRiver Bend\u201d) also applied in December, 1984 for contract carrier authority to transport general commodities under continuing contracts with shippers, receivers, or brokers of those commodities. J.A. at 81. In a statement submitted by River Bend\u2019s president, the applicant indicated that it currently held both common carrier authority to transport general commodities and contract carrier authority to transport a wide variety of commodities under continuing contracts with shippers, distributors, manufacturers or receivers of such commodities. J.A. at 87-88. River Bend stated that it was seeking broader contract carrier authority because it had been \u201crequested by its existing customers to haul products not encompassed by the [current] contract carrier authority.\u201d J.A. at 88. It indicated that it would meet the statutory definition of contract carriage by \u201cdedicatpng] equipment to the exclusive use of shippers, receivers and brokers requiring the same.\u201d J.A. at 93. River Bend did not submit any statements of shipper support for its application. J.A. at 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-8\">The American Trucking Associations, Inc., Regular Common Carrier Conference, and International Brotherhood of Teamsters protested River Bend\u2019s application. In addition to reiterating the arguments they made in the Haslerig proceeding, the protestants argued that \u201cin the absence of evidence presented by supporting shippers, the Commission cannot make the requisite reasoned findings under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10923(b)(3).\u201d J.A. at 158; <em>see </em>J.A. at 108-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-9\">The ICC granted River Bend\u2019s application on April 22, 1985. As in the Haslerig decision, the Commission defined the class of shippers to be served as those commercial shippers with whom the applicant would enter into contracts under which it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1192\">*1192</page-number>agreed to dedicate equipment to the shipper\u2019s exclusive use. J.A. at 159. The Commission concluded that the dedication of equipment test was satisfied by the applicant\u2019s \u201cpropos[al] to dedicate at least one vehicle to the exclusive use of each shipper with which it will contract.\u201d J.A. at 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-4\">Noting that \u201capplicant holds extensive common and contract carrier authority and has been serving contracting shippers in numerous industries,\u201d the Commission stated that it could make the \u201creasoned findings\u201d required by 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10923(b)(3) without statements of shipper support for the application. J.A. at 159. The Commission found that granting River Bend the authority it sought \u201cwould enable it not only to provide current contracting shippers a more complete service but also to logically expand its already extensive contract carrier operation,\u201d while denial of the application would \u201cprevent [River Bend] from expanding its services in a manner consistent with the Motor Carrier Act,\u201d would require it to return to the Commission for additional authority before it could contract to serve new shippers, and would \u201cdeprive shippers of the availability of a variety of service and price options.\u201d J.A. at 159-60. Chairman Taylor again dissented on the same grounds as in the Haslerig decision. J.A. at 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-5\">E. <em>The Guy Clark &amp; Son Proceeding </em>(No. 85-1394)</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-6\">Guy Clark <em>&amp; </em>Son (\u201cGuy Clark\u201d) applied in November, 1984 for authority to operate as a contract carrier transporting general commodities under continuing contracts with commercial shippers, receivers or brokers of such commodities. J.A. at 168. Guy Clark indicated that it would satisfy the statutory requirements \u201c[b]y both (1) providing a specialized service tailored to meet the distinct needs of the above named classes of persons and (2) by the assignment of motor vehicles for a continuing period of time for the exclusive use of the classes of persons shown above.\u201d J.A. at 169; <em>see also </em>J.A. at 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-10\">In its statement in support of the application, Guy Clark indicated that it was currently operating as a contract carrier transporting lumber, wood products, and building materials for five named shippers. J.A. at 173. Guy Clark stated that it was seeking broader contract carrier authority because its current shippers had other commodities which they wanted Guy Clark to transport, and because other shippers had expressed a desire to use Guy Clark\u2019s services. J.A. at 173-74. Guy Clark submitted no statements of shipper support for the application. J.A. at 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-11\">Deaton, Inc. (\u201cDeaton\u201d), the petitioner in No. 85-1394, protested the Guy Clark application.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Deaton argued that because \u201cClark\u2019s headquarters from which it proposes to conduct operations is in the very heart of Deaton\u2019s operation,\u201d the proposed permit would allow Guy Clark to \u201cdivert a portion of the traffic which Deaton desperately needs in order to maintain its daily operations.\u201d J.A. at 182-83. Deaton also argued that Guy Clark\u2019s application had failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case for a grant of contract carrier authority \u201cbecause it does not contain any shipper support or other type of supporting evidence for the proposed operation.\u201d J.A. at 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-12\">In a brief decision issued on March 26, 1985, the Commission (Division 1) granted Guy Clark\u2019s application. Relying on its 1983 statement of policy, the Commission stated that the absence of shipper support did not preclude it from granting the application. J.A. at 200 (citing <em>Issuance of Permits Authorizing Industry-wide Service, </em>133 M.C.C. 298, 302-03 (1983)). The Commission noted that \u201cApplicants state that they will not only dedicate equipment to the exclusive use of contracting shippers, but that they will set up a specialized service designed to meet the specific and precise needs of contracting shippers\u201d and concluded that Guy Clark had satisfied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1193\">*1193</page-number>both the dedication of equipment and the distinct needs tests. J.A. at 199-200. In considering the criteria of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10923(b)(3), the Commission found that Deaton had not shown that a grant of the authority sought \u201cwould endanger or impair its operations to an extent contrary to the public interest.\u201d J.A. at 200. Denial of the requested authority, on the other hand, might force shippers to use services which were inadequate to meet their shipping needs and would require Guy Clark to file a separate application for contract carrier authority to serve each additional shipper. J.A. at 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-4\">Deaton appealed the Commission\u2019s decision, arguing that there was no evidence in the record to support Guy Clark\u2019s application or the Commission\u2019s conclusion. J.A. at 202-08.

J.A. at 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-6\">The petitioners challenge the orders at issue here on two grounds. They argue first, that the issuance of a contract carrier permit to serve the class of commercial shippers of general commodities contravenes the statutory definition of contract carriage and second, that an applicant for a contract carrier permit must submit statements of shippers indicating that the shippers need or want to use the applicant\u2019s equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-10\">A. <em>The Validity of the Class of Commercial Shippers of General Commodities Under \u00a7 10102(H)(B)(i)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1259-11\">A motor contract carrier permit must</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1259-12\">specify necessary conditions, including each person or class of persons ... for which the carrier may provide transportation\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1259-13\">(A) to ensure that the carrier provides transportation as a motor contract carrier and within the scope of the permit____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1259-14\">49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10923(d)(2)(A). The petitioners do not dispute that the Commission may issue a contract carrier permit to serve a class of shippers \u2014 indeed, this is clear from the statute itself. Rather, the petitioners assert that the class involved here \u2014 commercial shippers of general commodities\u2014 is so broad that the Commission cannot fulfill its statutory responsibility to ensure that the applicants will operate as contract carriers by dedicating equipment to each person served.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-15\">Petitioners correctly assert that the class of commercial shippers of general commodities \u201cis the broadest possible shipper class.\u201d Brief of Petitioner International Brotherhood of Teamsters at 22. As Chairman Taylor noted in dissenting from the Haslerig and River Bend decisions, \u201cthe applicant here has been permitted to serve essentially <em>all </em>potential shippers and receivers of general commodities.\u201d J.A. at 71, <em>see </em>J.A. at 161 (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1194\">*1194</page-number>The Commission makes no attempt to argue that the terms \u201ccommercial shippers\u201d and \u201cgeneral commodities\u201d place any limit on the breadth of the class to be served. Instead, the Commission concedes that the class embraces all those commercial shippers with whom an applicant will enter into continuing contracts under which it agrees to assign at least one vehicle for the exclusive use of each shipper. <em>See </em>J.A. at 69, 159. In defining the class as those shippers to whom an applicant <em>will </em>dedicate equipment after the permit is issued, the Commission takes the view that, under the dedication of equipment test, an applicant for a contract carrier permit is not required to identify and dedicate equipment to each shipper in the class to be served at the time the application is filed. The ICC\u2019s position is rather that the dedication of equipment test is satisfied if an applicant \u201crepresent\u00e9] that it will enter into contracts only with those shippers to which it will dedicate equipment.\u201d <em>Issuance of Permits Authorizing Industry-wide Service, </em>133 M.C.C. 298, 301-02 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-4\">We find that, although unprecedentedly broad, the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the dedication of equipment requirement is consistent with the language of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10102(14)(B)(i), which requires only that a contract carrier dedicate equipment to each shipper it contracts to serve, not to each shipper it is authorized to serve. Nevertheless, the petitioners argue that the Commission is required to determine whether the definition of contract carriage has been satisfied at the time an application for a contract carrier permit is filed, and that, in order to do this, the Commission must require the applicant to \u201cidentify each shipper to be served, and ... \u2018dedicate equipment\u2019 to each shipper\u2019s exclusive use.\u201d Brief of Petitioner International Brotherhood of Teamsters at 16.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1260-8\">In the policy statement on which these decisions were based, the Commission refused to \u201crequire the dedication of specific equipment to each shipper within a given class prior to service.\u201d <em>Issuance of Permits Authorizing Industry-wide Service, </em>133 M.C.C. 298, 301 (1983). Instead, the Commission decided to encourage competition among contract carriers and other carriers by \u201callowpng] contract carriers to solicit additional contracts without obtaining prior regulatory approval to serve new customers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Commissioner\u2019s emphasis on promoting competition by contract carriers is supported by the Motor Carrier Act of 1980 and its legislative history, which indicate that one of the principal goals of the Act was to increase competition among motor carriers by eliminating anticompetitive government regulations. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1069, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 3 (Act provides \u201clegislative solution aimed at increasing competition and reducing unnecessary federal regulations\u201d), <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.

Such a requirement would thwart the congressional goal of encouraging contract carriers to compete for customers with common carriers and other providers of transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-4\">As the Fifth Circuit has noted, \u201c[t]he concepts underlying motor contract carriage \u2014 dedication of equipment, distinct needs, public interest, and service of the national transportation policy \u2014 are not defined by the statute. The Commission is given broad discretion to define these terms----\u201d <em>Global Van Lines v. ICC, </em>704 F.2d 829, 832 (5th Cir.), <em>modified, </em>709 F.2d 11 (5th Cir.1983). The question for this court, therefore, \u201cis whether the agency\u2019s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d <em>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2782, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). In its interpretation of the statute to promote competition by contract carriers, the Commission undoubtedly blurs the distinction between contract carriage and common carriage. But, as this court recently noted, Congress in 1980 \u201cconcluded that less regulation and more competition would improve motor carrier service.\u201d <em>Central &amp; Southern Motor Freight, </em>757 F.2d at 320. The Commission\u2019s decisions are consistent with this congressional intent, as well as with the language and intent of the 1957 Act, and must be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-9\">B. <em>The Petitioners\u2019 Contention that an Applicant for a Contract Carrier Permit Must Submit Statements of Shipper Support</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1261-10\">The petitioners argue that, even if the class of shippers at issue here is a valid one, the permits should have been denied because the applicants failed to submit statements of shippers indicating that the shippers needed or wanted the applicants to dedicate equipment to their exclusive use. The petitioners assert that \u201c[t]he proper focus [of the dedication of equipment test] is whether the shipper needs or wants dedicated equipment, and if so, what type and amount\u201d and, further, that \u201cthere must be supporting shipper evidence in order to demonstrate that a shipper needs dedicated equipment.\u201d Brief of Petitioners Regular Common Carrier Conference and American Trucking Associations, Inc. (\u201cRCCC Brief\u201d) at 24. Because River Bend and Guy Clark submitted no shipper statements in support of their applications, and because the statements submitted by Haslerig did not indicate that shippers \u201cneeded or wanted dedicated equipment,\u201d RCCC Brief at 7, the petitioners argue that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1196\">*1196</page-number>Commission could not reasonably find that the applicants had met the dedication of equipment test.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-4\">The dedication of equipment prong of the statutory definition of contract carriage does not on its face require a showing that shippers need or want the equipment proposed to be dedicated. To satisfy the dedication of equipment test, an applicant must demonstrate that it will provide \u201ca degree of continuing commitment, of continuity in service at some contracted-for level,\u201d <em>see Dixie Midwest Express, Inc., </em>132 M.C.C. 794, 813 (1982), but it need not demonstrate that potential shippers need or desire that commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-5\">The legislative history of the 1957 amendments indicates that, while Congress sought to amend the statutory definition of contract carriage to emphasize the importance of maintaining \u201cproper distinctions between common and contract carriage,\u201d it specifically rejected the need requirement petitioners seek to impose. S.Rep. No. 703, 85th Cong., 1st Sess. 7, <em>reprinted in </em>1957 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1599, 1604. As originally introduced, the bill which eventually became Pub.L. No. 85-163 defined a contract carrier as a carrier operating \u201cunder continuing contracts with one person or a limited number of persons for the furnishing of transportation services of a special and individual nature <em>required by the customer </em>and not provided by common carriers.\u201d S.Rep. No. 703, 85th Cong., 1st Sess. 2, <em>reprinted in </em>1957 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News at 1600 (emphasis added). The bill also provided that a contract carrier permit could only be issued if \u201cexisting common carriers are unwilling or unable to provide the type of service <em>for which a need has been shown.\u201d Id. </em>at 3, <em>reprinted in </em>1957 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News at 1600 (emphasis added). The Senate Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce amended the bill to eliminate both of these provisions on the ground that the bill as originally introduced \u201cwould be unduly restrictive on contract carriage.\u201d <em>Id., reprinted in </em>1957 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News at 1601. The enactment of the 1957 amendments represented the peak of congressional protectionism toward common carriers. <em>See Central &amp; Southern Motor Freight, </em>757 F.2d at 310. Even in 1957, however, Congress was unwilling to require, as the petitioners would have us do, that an applicant for a contract carrier permit demonstrate a need for the proposed service.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-7\">The petitioners argue, however, that the statute implicitly requires an applicant for a contract carrier permit to submit statements of shipper support because without such statements, the Commission is unable to make a reasoned determination of whether granting the application is in the public interest under the criteria set out in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10923(b)(3). That subsection provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1262-8\">(3) In deciding whether to approve the application of a person for a permit as a motor contract carrier of property, the Commission shall consider\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1262-9\">(A) the nature of the transportation proposed to be provided;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1262-10\">(B) the effect that granting the permit would have on the protesting carriers if such grant would endanger or impair their operations to an extent contrary to the public interest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1262-11\">(C) the effect that denying the permit would have on the person applying for the permit, its shippers, or both; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1262-12\">(D) the changing character of the requirements of those shippers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1262-13\">This court has held that, in considering these factors, the Commission is not required to conduct \u201ca detailed analysis of each and an explicit weighing of each against the other. The Commission\u2019s determination is adequate if logical processes in reaching that decision are reasonably discernible and the essential basic findings are revealed.\u201d <em>International Detective Service, Inc. v. ICC, </em>613 F.2d 1067, 1077 (D.C.Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-14\">As the Commission itself acknowledges, the need of shippers for dedicated equipment is a \u201cpertinent issue\u201d in considering the public interest criteria of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10923(b)(3). Joint Brief for Respondents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1197\">*1197</page-number>Interstate Commerce Commission and United States of America at 46 (quoting <em>A.D. McMullen, Inc., </em>No. MC-3328 (Sub-No. 5) (served April 24, 1984)). The petitioners have not explained, however, why the Commission may not rely on an applicant\u2019s statements concerning the needs and desires of existing and potential customers, rather than demanding that the applicant submit statements of the shippers themselves. The Commission relied on such statements by applicants in the River Bend and Guy Clark decisions. <em>See </em>J.A. at 155 (\u201cApplicant seeks the involved authority in part because it has been requested by existing customers to haul products not encompassed by its existing contract carrier authority.\u201d); <em>id </em>at 199 (\u201cApplicants state that their present contracting shippers have other commodities which they do not have authority to transport and that other shippers have expressed a desire to utilize their service.\u201d). The petitioners have failed to show why the Commission\u2019s reliance on these statements is unfounded or why a special evidentiary requirement should be imposed with respect to the issue of shippers\u2019 need for dedicated equipment.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1263-5\">III.

While this observation is certainly correct, it does not follow that the Commission may not find that the dedication of equipment test was satisfied by the applicants in these cases.
