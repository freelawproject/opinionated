We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-11\">In 1979, Robert Start entered the United States as the unmarried son of a lawful permanent resident under section 203(a)(2) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(a)(2) (1982). However, at the time of entry he was in fact married to Marylou M. Quimbo. Moreover, after admission into the United States, Start married Quimbo a second time, in order to enable her and their children to obtain an immigrant visa.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-15\">Deportation proceedings against Start commenced on October 28, 1982. Start was formally charged with entering the United States by fraud. Start had claimed that he was the unmarried son of a lawful permanent resident when in fact he was married to Quimbo, in violation of section 212(a)(19) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(19) (1982). He was also charged with entering without a valid labor certification or other valid entry document, in violation of sections 212(a)(14) and 212(a)(20), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(14) &amp; (a)(20), respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-16\">At the hearing, Start requested that his deportation be waived pursuant to section 241(f)(1) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(f)(1) (1982), in light of the fact that his father, mother, three brothers and two sisters are all either United States citizens or lawful permanent residents. Moreover, four days before his deportation hearing, Start was married to a United States citizen. After the hearing, a child was born to Start and his American wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-17\">Section 241(f)(1) affords the Attorney General discretion to waive the deportation of an alien who is the spouse or parent of a United States citizen, and was in the possession of an immigrant visa procured by fraud or misrepresentation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Prior to 1981, waiver under section 241(f) was mandatory, if the alien had the requisite family connection to the United States, and the fraud for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>which the alien was charged was of the type forgivable by the provision. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(f) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">The immigration judge found Start deportable and denied waiver relief. The judge determined that Start\u2019s conduct, which included the \u201cfurther\u201d fraud of trying to procure an immigrant visa for his wife in the Philippines by marrying her a second time, warranted not invoking the forgiveness provision. The judge, however, characterizing Start\u2019s behavior as a \u201csingle lapse\u201d of moral character, granted a request for voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Start appealed to the BIA, which affirmed the denial of the section 241(f)(1) waiver. The BIA based its decision on the adverse credibility finding regarding Start\u2019s contention of good faith, and the fact that Start \u201ccompounded [his fraud at entry] with a new instance of misrepresentation by participating in a second marriage ceremony, claiming it to be his first, and using it to attempt to immigrate his Filipino wife.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">Start timely appeals the BIA\u2019s denial of the section 241(f)(1) waiver of deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">The narrow question on this appeal concerns the exercise of discretion not to grant a waiver from deportation under section 241(f)(1) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(f)(1). Start does not contest the finding of deportability by the immigration judge and the BIA. Moreover, Start\u2019s eligibility for the waiver is not at issue. Both the immigration judge and the BIA explicitly concluded that Start met the requirements for relief under section 214(f)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision not to invoke the forgiveness provision under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>Hernandez-Robledo v. INS, </em>777 F.2d 536, 540 (9th Cir.1985). We note initially that the abuse of discretion standard leaves the BIA with much flexibility in exercising its judgment. <em>See id. </em>at 540-41 (affirming denial of section 241(f)(1) relief as \u201crational\u201d); <em>Dallo v. INS, </em>765 F.2d 581, 587 (6th Cir.1985) (noting \u201chigh level of discretionary authority\u201d vested in Attorney General).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-13\">Start contends that because the waiver provision was intended to ensure that aliens would not be separated from family members lawfully in the United States, proof of substantial family connections in the United States was sufficient to compel the BIA to grant discretionary relief. We reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-14\">In 1981, Congress amended section 241(f) to make the once mandatory waiver provision discretionary. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 264, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. 25, <em>reprinted in </em>1981 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 2577, 2593-94; <em>see also Hernandez-Robledo, 777 </em>F.2d at 540. The purpose of the amendment was neither to expand nor circumscribe the scope of the forgiveness provision. Rather, Congress was responding to the fact that \u201cdiffering administrative and judicial interpretations have left the law in a state of confusion which makes it virtually impossible for the INS to uniformly administer section 241(f).\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 264, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. 25, <em>reprinted in </em>1981 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 2577, 2594 (citation omitted). By clarifying the scope of the forgiveness provision and by making the waiver discretionary, Congress intended to \u201cobviate the need for further litigation\u201d and to \u201cpromote the uniform administration of this section.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To achieve these goals, this circuit has indicated that the BIA may refuse to exercise its discretion in favor of an alien who is statutorily eligible for relief and who would probably have qualified for the mandatory waiver of deportation prior to the recent amendment. <em>See Hernandez-Robledo, 777 </em>F.2d at 539-41. Thus, proof of family connections in the United States, while a necessary element in the determination of whether to grant waiver, is not solely dispositive of the issue. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 541 (finding BIA\u2019s denial of section 241(f)(1) waiver \u201crational\u201d because deportation would not disrupt petitioner\u2019s primary family unit and because petitioner had been \u201crecently convicted of a crime for which an alien can be excluded\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Start also argues that the BIA abused its discretion in finding that a second distinct instance of fraud justified denial of the waiver, when the immigration judge held that he had committed only one \u201csingle lapse\u201d in moral character. He contends that because the instance of fraud for which an alien is charged should not be considered an adverse factor by the BIA, the \u201csingle lapse\u201d for which he had been charged is insufficient to justify denial of the waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">The INS concedes that the underlying fraud for which Start is deportable should not constitute an adverse factor in determining whether to exercise discretionary waiver. <em>See Hernandez-Robledo, </em>777 F.2d at 541 (discounting the fraud for which alien was charged). Nevertheless, the INS correctly argues that the BIA\u2019s denial of the waiver was justified on the basis of misrepresentations made by Start other than the fraud for which he was charged. These additional misrepresentations include: marrying his wife in the Philippines a second time in order to allow her and the children to immigrate into the United States, and possibly, marrying his wife for the sole purpose of getting her into the United States, i.e. with no intent to remain married.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Start argues that the immigration judge found that Start committed a single, continuous fraud, and that this finding should prevail as a matter of law over the BIA\u2019s conclusion that he committed multiple frauds. However, while the immigration judge characterized Start\u2019s behavior as a \u201csingle lapse of moral character,\u201d he did not conclude that Start committed a single fraud. Moreover, in light of the uncontested factual findings by both the BIA and the immigration judge concerning the scope of Start\u2019s fraudulent activities, we hold that the BIA did not abuse its discretion by concluding that Start committed multiple frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Start additionally requests a remand to allow the BIA to consider his marriage to a United States citizen for over two years, and the fact that a child has been born to the couple since the initial deportation hearing. At the time of the initial deportation hearing, Start had been married to his present wife for only four days, a fact that the immigration judge did not consider in his favor. In affirming the denial of the section 241(f)(1) waiver, however, the BIA did consider the length of Start\u2019s marriage and the fact that he had had a child since the deportation hearing. After weighing this factor against adverse factors, the BIA concluded that denial of the waiver was appropriate. Because the BIA did consider these facts, no remand is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">Finally, Start asks this court to reevaluate the equities in this case, arguing that the BIA was in error in denying the favorable exercise of discretion. Other than the issue regarding his marriage to an American citizen and the birth of his child, Start does not contend that the BIA considered improper factors or ignored relevant equities in the exercise of discretion. This circuit has indicated that the BIA is required to consider all relevant evidence presented by the petitzioner. <em>See, e.g., Mattis v. INS, </em>774 F.2d 965, 968 (9th Cir.1985); <em>Zavala-Bonilla v. INS, </em>730 F.2d 562, 568 (9th Cir.1984); <em>Ramirez-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>695 F.2d 1208, 1211-12 (9th Cir.1983). It is clear that the BIA has fulfilled such an obligation in this particular case. It thoroughly examined Start\u2019s family situation, including the fact that a child was born to Start and his American wife during the pendency of his appeal. <em>See generally INS v. Errico, </em>385 U.S. 214, 224, 87 S.Ct. 473, 479, 17 L.Ed.2d 318 (1966) (Congress\u2019 fundamental purpose in enacting section 241(f)(1) was to unite families); <em>Hernandez-Robledo, </em>777 F.2d at 541 (same). It noted that Start provides financial assistance for his parents, that he is a college graduate, and that he is employed and financially secure. Despite the proper consideration of all the relevant equities raised by Start, the BIA found these positive equities outweighed by the adverse factor of Start\u2019s multiple fraudulent activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">In light of the serious consideration given by the BIA to the relevant facts raised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>by Start, we will not substitute our view of the equities for the conclusion drawn by the BIA denying discretionary waiver of deportation. <em>See id.; cf. Hyun Joon Chung v. INS, </em>720 F.2d 1471, 1475 (9th Cir.1983) (court may not substitute its judgment for decision by the INS to deny discretionary suspension of deportation under section 244(a)(2) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a)(2), absent an abuse of discretion), <em>cert. denied, </em>467 U.S. 1216, 104 S.Ct. 2659, 81 L.Ed.2d 366 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The petition for review of the BIA decision is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b616-12\">.

Based upon this grave misdeed, Start, a law-abiding person and a design engineer for the B-l bomber, is being deported. Although Courts of Appeal do not have the authority to substitute their judgment for that of the BIA, we do have the responsibility of ensuring that the BIA considers all appropriate factors. Because this court fails to fulfill that responsibility, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Start sought relief from deportation under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(f). The \u201coriginal intent of the section was simply to waive relatively minor grounds for deportation \u2014 those arising out of misrepresentations in arranging entry \u2014 for aliens with a close family relative who was a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident.\u201d House Report to the Immigration and Nationality Act Amendments of 1981, H.Rep. No. 264, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. 25 (1981), <em>reprinted in </em>1981 U.S.Code, Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2577, 2594. The section was specifically designed to apply to the type of deception engaged in by Start \u2014 and at issue here. It was also specifically designed to apply to persons like Start whose immediate family, including his father, mother, three brothers, and two sisters are all United States citizens or permanent residents.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-13\">This section was amended by Pub.L. No. 97-116, effective December 29, 1981, which modified the previously mandatory waiver of deportability for violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1251(a)(1) and 1182(a)(19) (visa fraud or misrepresentation) and expanded its scope. The amendment gave the BIA discretionary authority over the broadened subject matter. The purpose of the amendment was two-fold: one, to expand the classes of people for whom the waiver of deportability was available;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and two, to enable the BIA to settle troublesome legal questions regarding eligibility in an equitable manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-14\">Prior to the recent amendment, Start would have had an absolute right to remain in this country.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The intent of Congress in amending the section was not to enable the BIA to deport an individual, like Start, who clearly qualified for relief. Rather, the purpose of the amendment was to alter agency authority at the margins by permitting the BIA to exercise its discretion in cases in which the courts previously were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>required to make fine distinctions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Here, however, the BIA used its new-found discretion to cut back on rights clearly afforded to Start by the unamended statute, a result certainly not contemplated by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">There is a serious question as to whether this agency action could be sustained because it is so manifestly contrary to the intent of the Congress. Courts overturn an agency action when that action \u201crests upon a policy judgment that is so unacceptable as to render the action arbitrary.\u201d <em>A Restatement of Scope-of-Review Doctrine, </em>35 Ad.L.Rev. 235, 235 (1986) (\u00a7 (b)(3)) (prepared by Section of Administrative Law of the ABA). <em>See also Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 416, 91 S.Ct. 814, 824, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971) (in determining arbitrariness, a court must ask \u201cwhether there has been a clear error of judgment.\u201d); <em>Dugan v. Ramsay, </em>727 F.2d 192, 196 (1st Cir.1984) (Breyer, J.) (\u201c[W]e believe that the agency interpretation here at issue is so totally unreasonable as to be without support in the authorizing statute.\u201d); <em>Conway v. Watt, </em>717 F.2d 512, 513 (10th Cir. 1983) (agency action \u201cwould not be valid if shown to bear no reasonable relation to congressional intentions (as expressed in the Act at issue or in legislative history) ...\u201d). <em>Cf. INS v. Rios-Pineda, </em>471 U.S. 444, 105 S.Ct. 2098, 2103, 85 L.Ed.2d 452 (1985) (when the BIA exercises discretionary authority it must ground its decision in \u201clegitimate concerns about the administration of the immigration laws\u201d). Any concern expressed by the BIA that is wholly contrary to the intent of Congress cannot be considered to be either legitimate or acceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The majority upholds the BIA\u2019s decision on the ground that the BIA \u201cproperly\u201d divided Start\u2019s single misrepresentation into a number of smaller ones, <em>viz. </em>\u201cmarrying his wife in the Philippines a second time to allow her and the children to immigrate into the United States, and possibly, marrying his wife for the sole purpose of getting her into the United States.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 542. The IJ considered Start\u2019s action a <em>\u201csingle lapse of moral character.\u201d </em>The reliance by the BIA on artificially segmented components of Start\u2019s \u201csingle lapse\u201d may well have been inappropriate, and its decision may be reversible on that ground as well. <em>See, e.g., Siang Ken Wang v. INS, </em>413 F.2d 286, 287 (9th Cir.1969) (consideration of irrelevant factor is an abuse of discretion). However, even assuming that the BIA\u2019s discretion extends to Start and that Start\u2019s action was not effectively one act \u2014 a formalistic division at best \u2014 reversal is required because the BIA failed to consider the equities in Start\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">Our obligation as a reviewing court is to set aside agency action when the \u201cagency has relied on factors that may not be taken into account under, or has ignored factors that must be taken into account under, any [governing] source[] of law.\u201d <em>Restatement of Scope-of-Review Doctrine, </em>35 Ad. L.Rev. at 235 (\u00a7 (b)(2)). As we noted in <em>Mattis v. INS, </em>774 F.2d 965 (9th Cir.1985), \u201c[w]e have consistently required the BIA to state its reasons and show proper consideration of all factors when weighing equities and denying relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 968. We reverse actions of the BIA under section 1251(f) when the Board has abused its discretion. Herna<em>ndez-Robledo v. INS, </em>777 F.2d 536, 540 (9th Cir.1985). Here, the BIA has clearly done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">Under section 1251(f), the BIA must consider \u201cthe reasons that an alien should be allowed to stay, despite the illegality\u201d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>his entry. <em>Hernandez-Robledo, </em>777 F.2d at 541. We there noted at least two reasons militating for the exercise of administrative discretion in the alien\u2019s favor: length of stay and stable employment record. <em>Id. </em>Here, the government admitted at oral argument that it was required to consider all of the factors set forth in the decision issued by the BIA in this case. Those factors include not only hardship to family, but also stable employment history, evidence of value and service to the community, rehabilitation if a criminal record exists (and a finding of whether a criminal record exists), and good character. While the BIA certainly has discretion in assigning the relative weight to the factors it need consider, <em>cf. INS v. Wang, </em>450 U.S. 139, 145, 101 S.Ct. 1027, 1031, 67 L.Ed.2d 123 (1981) (Attorney General has the authority to determine what constitutes \u201cextreme hardship\u201d narrowly), the agency has no authority to refuse to consider relevant factors or to fail to accord the application individualized treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">The BIA failed to consider some of the very factors that its own decision in this case states it must. We need look no further than the face of the BIA decision to observe its internal inconsistencies and the patent error committed by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">To begin with, the BIA did not fully discuss Start\u2019s family ties and family relationships. As to employment, it merely stated that Start was employed as a design engineer and earned $33,000 a year. An acknowledgement of current employment by the BIA does not constitute full or adequate consideration of \u201cstable employment history.\u201d Although the record before the Immigration Judge reflects the fact that the petitioner was employed for approximately five years, the BIA did not consider that factor sufficiently important to mention as an equity in Start\u2019s favor. Nor is there any mention by the BIA of Start\u2019s value or service to the community, although he has worked for some time in our national defense effort. Moreover, the BIA makes no mention of the fact that Start has never been arrested for, let alone convicted of, any crime (unlike the petitioner in Hernandez-Robledo) or the fact that Start is of \u201cgood moral character,\u201d as the IJ found him to be. In all these respects, the BIA decision violates, beyond any doubt, the rule set forth in <em>Mattis. </em>774 F.2d at 968.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">The BIA appears to have abused its new-found discretion under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(f)(1) in a number of ways. Its decision is contrary to the intent of Congress in amending the statute and thus is neither acceptable nor legitimate. The BIA\u2019s segmentation and reliance on aspects of Start\u2019s visa fraud was improper. Finally, the BIA failed to consider a number of the requisite factors in denying relief under the amended section in violation of <em>Mattis. </em>The BIA\u2019s action is both unreasoned and arbitrary. It should be reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b619-9\">. It should also be noted that Start is currently married to an American citizen and is the father of an American child born to her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b619-10\">. Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion that the \"purpose of the amendment was neither to expand nor circumscribe the scope of the forgiveness provision\", <em>ante </em>at 541, the amendment made relief available both for innocent and fraudulent misrepresentations and for aliens charged with deportability based on violation of \u00a7 212(a)(14) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(14).
