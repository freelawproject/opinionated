The Senior Services Division of the State of Oregon withheld from plaintiffs certain \u201cheavy-care\u201d Medicaid payments and reimbursements. The district court dismissed the action for failure to state a claim. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Because a cognizable claim for statutory entitlement has been stated under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-19\">The Supreme Court has held that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 can provide a cause of action in federal court for the denial of rights created by a federal statute. <em>Maine v. Thiboutot, </em>448 U.S. 1, 4, 100 S.Ct. 2502, 2504, 65 L.Ed.2d 555 (1980). <em>Thiboutot </em>has been narrowed as applied to some federal statutes, <em>see Middlesex County Sewerage Auth. National Sea Clammers Ass\u2019n, </em>453 U.S. 1, 19, 101 S.Ct. 2615, 2625, 69 L.Ed.2d 435 (1981); <em>Pennhurst State School &amp; Hosp. v. Halderman, </em>451 U.S. 1, 28, 101 S.Ct. 1531, 1545, 67 L.Ed.2d 694 (1981). However, <em>Thiboutot </em>still governs actions brought to compel participating states to comply with the provisions of the Social Security Act. Specifically, in this and other circuits, actions which properly allege violations of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(A) are entitled to consideration on the merits. <em>Nebraska Health Care Ass\u2019n v. Dunning, </em>778 F.2d 1291, 1295-96 (8th Cir.1985); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1062\">*1062</page-number><em>Washington State Health Facilities Ass\u2019n v. State of Washington Dep\u2019t of Social &amp; Health Servs., </em>698 F.2d 964, 965 and n. 4 (9th Cir.1982); <em>Yapalater v. Bates, </em>494 F.Supp. 1349, 1357-58 (S.D.N.Y.1980), <em>aff'd, </em>644 F.2d 131 (2d Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 908, 102 S.Ct. 1255, 71 L.Ed.2d 447 (1982); <em>Thomas v. Johnston, </em>557 F.Supp. 879, 902-04 (W.D.Tex.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-5\">The district court relied primarily on <em>Pennhurst </em>to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 action. It concluded that because the language of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(A) is directed mainly to allocating Medicaid program funding obligations among state and federal sources, the statute did not create rights in favor of plaintiffs that are enforceable under \u00a7 1983. We disagree. <em>Thiboutot </em>rather than <em>Pennhurst </em>governs this case, and it was not necessary to engage in a <em>Pennhurst </em>analysis. Even if <em>Pennhurst </em>properly applies here, these plaintiffs can enforce 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-6\"><em>Pennhurst </em>established two exceptions limiting the effect of <em>Thiboutot </em>on cases involving the enforcement of federal statutory rights. Access to a \u00a7 1983 remedy should be denied if (1) the language of the statute indicates a congressional intent to foreclose \u00a7 1983 enforcement by making alternative remedies available, or (2) the statute does not create \u201crights\u201d enforceable by private parties under \u00a7 1983. <em>Almond Hill School v. United States Dep\u2019t of Agric., </em>768 F.2d 1030, 1035 (9th Cir.1985); <em>Keaukaha-Panaewa Community Ass\u2019n v. Hawaiian Homes Comm\u2019n, </em>739 F.2d 1467, 1470-71 (9th Cir.1984); <em>Boatowners &amp; Tenants Ass\u2019n v. Port of Seattle, </em>716 F.2d 669, 671 (9th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-7\">With respect to the first exception, the focus should be on the \u201ccomprehensiveness\u201d of a statute\u2019s remedial scheme. Specific and detailed procedures for administrative and judicial review are more likely to foreclose or preclude recourse to \u00a7 1983. <em>See Almond Hill School, </em>768 F.2d at 1035. Here, Title XIX permits states to establish administrative review procedures for disputes over Medicaid reimbursements. However, the statute does not provide for formal federal or state judicial or federal administrative review procedures. Indeed, in some cases, judicial review of such matters has been achieved only by permitting an \u201cimplied\u201d right of action to be drawn out of the language of the statute itself. <em>See California Hosp. Ass\u2019n v. Schweiker, </em>559 F.Supp. 110 (C.D.Cal.1982), <em>aff'd, </em>705 F.2d 466 (9th Cir.1983) (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)); <em>California Hospital Ass\u2019n v. Obledo, </em>602 F.2d 1357 (9th Cir.1979) (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(A)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1130-11\">Although state violations of Title XIX may be remedied by means of the cut off of federal funding for a state\u2019s programs, this generalized remedial opportunity is not sufficiently precise to preclude remedies otherwise properly available under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Keaukaha-Panaewa, </em>739 F.2d at 1471.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude that the first <em>Pennhurst </em>exception should not bar this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-12\">The second <em>Pennhurst </em>exception examines the character of the \u201cright\u201d created by a federal statute. In <em>Boatowners, </em>we indicated that a useful method to determine whether a statutory \u201cright\u201d is sufficiently important for \u00a7 1983 enforcement is to borrow from the \u201cimplied\u201d right of action line of authority. <em>Boatowners, </em>716 F.2d at 672. In essence, we examine whether a statute meets the first of the four elements required by <em>Cort v. Ash, </em>422 U.S. 66, 95 S.Ct. 2080, 45 L.Ed.2d 26 (1975), for recourse to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1063\">*1063</page-number>private enforcement under an \u201cimplied\u201d right of action theory. <em>Boatowners, </em>716 F.2d at 672. The first <em>Cort </em>element considers whether a statute was enacted for the special benefit of a plaintiff or a plaintiff class. Borrowing from <em>Cort, </em>this circuit has stated that if a plaintiff is one of a class for whose special benefit a statute was enacted, and if Congress has not expressly proscribed private actions to enforce the benefit, the entitlement will support a plaintiffs \u00a7 1983 action. <em>Keaukaha-Panaewa, </em>739 F.2d at 1471; <em>Boatowners, </em>716 F.2d at 673, 672-73 (citing <em>Cort v. Ash, </em>422 U.S. 66, 95 S.Ct. 2080, 45 L.Ed.2d 26 (1975)); <em>Fisher v. City of Tucson, </em>663 F.2d 861, 863 (9th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 881, 103 S.Ct. 178, 74 L.Ed.2d 146 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-4\">Plaintiffs in this action are a private health-care facility and individual Medicaid patients residing in the facility. Patients confined by illness, disability, or age to a long-term health-care facility are intended beneficiaries of the Medicaid statutes in general and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(A) in particular. Private health-care providers caring for Medicaid patients, such as Coos Bay Care Center, also have a direct financial interest in the availability of Medicaid reimbursement. In several similar cases, courts have permitted providers to bring actions to enforce the Medicaid statutes. <em>California Hosp. Ass\u2019n v. Obledo, </em>602 F.2d 1357 (9th Cir.1979); <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp. v. Weiner, </em>569 F.2d 1156 (1st Cir.1978); <em>California Ass\u2019n of Bioanalysts v. Rank, </em>577 F.Supp. 1342, 1347 n. 6 (C.D.Cal.1983). These cases have recognized that Medicaid patients and health-care providers have parallel interests with respect to Medicaid funding and reimbursement. No reason has been advanced to justify the denial of a health-care provider\u2019s right to stand as co-plaintiff with individual Medicaid recipients in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-5\">We do not suggest that plaintiffs in this action necessarily will prevail on the merits of their claim. We do not reach the merits. Rather, we hold simply that statutory rights under Title XIX of the Social Security Act have been alleged in the complaint which are sufficient to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. To prevail on the merits, plaintiffs must convince the trial court that the actions and non-action of the State of Oregon violate the standard set out in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(A). We do not reach the other issues raised in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1130-8\">. It is not a bar to a \u00a7 1983 action that a private right of action cannot be \"implied\u201d from the federal statute itself. <em>Keaukaha-Panaewa, </em>739 F.2d at 1470. Rather, an independent \u00a7 1983 inquiry is required because \u2018\u201cthere could well be federal rights enforceable under section 1983 which are not enforceable by means of a private right of action under the statute creating them.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-9\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Boatowners, </em>716 F.2d at 674).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1130-13\">. We decline to review the state administrative procedures and contractual remedies assertedly available to plaintiffs under Oregon law. In a \u00a7 1983 <em>Pennhurst </em>analysis, we are bound to consider only those remedial procedures established by the federal statute in issue. Complementary state procedures and remedies are not relevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
