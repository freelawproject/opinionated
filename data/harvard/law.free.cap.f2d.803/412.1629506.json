On June 10, 1977 she requested a thirty-day leave of absence. Leave was granted but she was told that she would have to be examined by a company doctor if she wished to have her leave extended. Walsh did not do this. Instead, at the end of the thirty-day leave of absence, Walsh delivered a note to the company by her personal physician, stating that she should have medical leave for an additional sixty days because of pregnancy. The company twice asked Walsh\u2019s personal physician to provide a detailed report supporting the request for the sixty-day leave extension. Walsh\u2019s doctor did not respond to the company\u2019s request and did not advise Walsh that the request had been made. On August 8, 1977 Walsh was fired. The purported basis of her dismissal was Rule 43(f) of the collective bargaining agreement negotiated between the railroad and the Brotherhood of Railway, Airline and Steamship Clerks (\u201cBRAC\u201d), Walsh\u2019s authorized representative. Rule 43(f) states that: \u201cFailure to report for duty at the expiration of leave of absence shall terminate an employee\u2019s service and seniority, unless a reasonable excuse for such failure is furnished not later than ten days after expiration of leave of absence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">On August 23, 1977 BRAC requested a post-termination hearing pursuant to Rule 43(g) of the collective bargaining agreement. Rule 43(g) provides that an employee \u201cvoluntarily leaving\u201d or absent from duty without \u201cproper leave of absence\u201d (except in cases of illness) will be terminated, but conditions this termination upon the holding of a formal hearing. The request for a hearing was denied on August 24, 1977 on the basis of the railroad\u2019s belief that Rule 43(f) and not Rule 43(g) applied to Walsh\u2019s termination. Negotiations between BRAC and the railroad ensued but to no avail. On December 21, 1982 the railroad and the union agreed to establish a special adjustment board (Public Law Board No. 3314) as permitted by the Railway Labor Act. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 153 Second.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">Public Law Board No. 3314 heard arguments from both the railroad and the union, and on May 29, 1983 rendered Award No. 4 ordering Walsh\u2019s reinstatement but without backpay or benefits. The Board stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-11\">The Board concurs with the Carrier\u2019s view that the Claimant had the responsibility to furnish the reasons for the requested medical leave of absence; and when the Chief Engineer wrote Dr. Taylor on July 14, 1977 that the Carrier\u2019s Medical Director wanted a detailed report of the reasons for granting an extension, the Claimant should have taken steps to see her doctor honored this request. The Claimant cannot put herself on leave or extend her leave by inference or assumption. The Claimant had to take positive measure to secure an extension of her existing leave. However, the only flaw in the record is that the Chief Engineer did not inform the Claimant that her physician was not complying with the Medical Director\u2019s request. While the Board admits it is difficult for a patient to get a doctor to comply with a third party\u2019s request, nevertheless, the Carrier should have put her on notice that her physician was not honoring a valid request.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">The union and the railroad adopted Award No. 4 and Walsh resumed her employment on July 18,1983. Nevertheless, on November 29, 1983 she filed a complaint against both the railroad and the union in the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska seeking recovery for wrongful discharge and breach of duty of fair repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>sentation and to have Award No. 4 set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">In a series of memorandum opinions and orders culminating in an appealable final order issued on September 30, 1985 the district court dismissed the wrongful discharge and fair representation claims, but set aside Award No. 4 and entered judgment in the amount of $130,253.63 against the railroad in backpay benefits. The district court held that the Board award failed to \u201cdraw its essence\u201d from the collective bargaining agreement and was thus unenforceable. <em>See United Steelworkers of America v. Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp., </em>363 U.S. 593, 597, 80 S.Ct. 1358, 1361, 4 L.Ed.2d 1424 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">It is well-established that if an arbitrator\u2019s award does not draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement, the reviewing court must vacate or modify the award. <em>International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers v. Sho-Me Power, </em>715 F.2d 1322, 1325 (8th Cir.1983). But in determining whether an arbitrator has exceeded his authority, the agreement must be broadly construed with all doubts resolved in favor of the arbitrator\u2019s award. <em>Lackawanna Leather Co. v. United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Int\u2019l Union, </em>706 F.2d 228, 230-31 (8th Cir.1983 (en banc). The test \u201cis not whether the reviewing court agrees with the Board\u2019s interpretation of the bargaining contract, but whether the remedy fashioned by the Board is rationally explainable as a logical means of furthering the aims of the contract.\u201d <em>Brotherhood of Railway, Airline &amp; Steamship Clerks v. Kansas City Terminal Railway, </em>587 F.2d 903, 906-07 (8th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 907, 99 S.Ct. 1997, 60 L.Ed.2d 376 (1979) (quoting <em>Diamond v. Terminal Railway Alabama State Docks, </em>421 F.2d 228, 233 (5th Cir. 1970)).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">The district court felt justified in setting aside the arbitrator\u2019s award because \u201cthe Board\u2019s decision does not follow logically from its findings of fact.\u201d Specifically, the district court noted that the Board itself was not convinced that the blame for the termination lay <em>solely </em>with Walsh. The Board acknowledged that the railroad should have informed Walsh of her physician\u2019s failure to respond to its inquiries. As we read the district court\u2019s decision, having found that Walsh did not bear <em>sole </em>blame, the Board was required by the terms of the bargaining agreement to find that she deserved a complete vindication. The court observed that: \u201cUnder the circumstances, the Court finds that the plaintiff complied with the terms of the collective bargaining agreement.\u201d The court further found that Walsh \u201cwas not culpable to any degree.\u201d These rulings by the district court flatly contradict the findings of the Board. We cannot approve of the district court\u2019s usurption of the authority vested by Congress in the Public Law Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">In this case the Board was presented with a question requiring it to interpret, and possibly to choose between, two provisions of a collective bargaining agreement. As we read its decision the Board found that neither party had fully lived up to the spirit of the agreement. The award it issued was the Board\u2019s obviously well-considered attempt to balance the conduct of the parties in light of the terms of the existing labor contract. Matters of contract interpretation are committed to the arbitrator. <em>United Steelworkers of America v. American Mfg. Co., </em>363 U.S. 564, 567-68, 80 S.Ct. 1343, 1346, 4 L.Ed.2d 1403 (1960). Ambiguities in the opinion accompanying an award are normally not a reason for refusing to enforce an award. <em>Steelworkers v. Enterprise Wheel, </em>363 U.S. at 597-98, 80 S.Ct. at 1361. \u201cWhen an arbitrator is commissioned to interpret and apply the collective bargaining agreement, he is to bring his informed judgment to bear in order to reach a fair solution of a problem. This is especially true when it comes to formulating remedies. There the need is for flexibility in meeting a wide variety of situations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597, 80 S.Ct. at 1361. In this case the district court refused to permit the arbitrator to exercise that flexibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>In <em>Zeviar v. Local No. 2747, Airline, Aerospace &amp; Allied Employees, </em>733 F.2d 556 (8th Cir.1984), this court affirmed a district court decision dismissing a petition for review of an arbitration award. In <em>Zeviar, </em>as in this case, the employee had been dismissed for being absent without leave. In <em>Zeviar, </em>as in this case, the arbitrator found that neither party was completely blameless. In <em>Zeviar, </em>the arbitrator ordered the employee reinstated but with only half of lost wages because \u201cshe too was at fault.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 558. In <em>Zeviar, </em>as in this case, the employee claimed that partial exoneration required, under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, reinstatement with full backpay. We rejected that argument stating that: \u201cIn the absence of full exoneration [the agreement] does not require an award of full back pay. Thus the Board had authority to exercise its discretion in formulating a remedy, and the award drew its essence from the collective bargaining agreement.\u201d That this case is controlled by <em>Zeviar </em>could not be clearer. The district court\u2019s attempt to distinguish the case is unpersuasive and relies on what seems to be a misreading of the Board\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The decision of the district court is REVERSED and the award of Public Law Board No. 3314 is REINSTATED.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b491-6\">JOHN R. GIBSON, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AVk\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">I respectfully dissent. The district court concluded that reinstatement of Walsh and denial of back pay \u201cfails to draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement.\u201d In my opinion, the district court did not err in so concluding.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">The collective bargaining agreement, Rule 45(c), provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-9\">\n<em>If the final decision decrees that charges against the employe were not sustained, the record shall be cleared of the charge; if suspended or dismissed, the employe shall be reinstated and compensated for any loss of wages.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-10\">Where an employe is dismissed or suspended from service for cause and subsequently it is found that such discipline was unwarranted and the employe is restored to service with pay for time lost, earnings in other employment shall be used to offset the loss of earnings. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-12\">In granting Award No. 4, Public Law Board No. 3314 concluded that \u201cthe record does not support the termination\u201d of Walsh. This is an express finding that the charges against Walsh were not sustained. Rule 45(c) thus requires that the record be cleared of the charge and that Walsh be reinstated and compensated for any loss of wages; the Board has no discretion to deny compensation for loss of wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-13\">The Memorandum of Agreement signed by the parties authorizing the formation of Public Law Board No. 3314 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-14\">The Board shall not have jurisdiction of disputes growing out of requests for changes in rates of pay, rules and working conditions, and shall not have authority to change existing agreements/governing rates of pay, rules and working conditions, and shall not have the right to write new rules. '</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-15\">This limiting provision deprives the Board of authority to change existing agreements or write new rules. This, however, is precisely what the Board did in this case. The district court correctly determined that the Public Law Board had violated the express language of the collective bargaining agreement and the Memorandum of Agreement when it denied back pay after finding that the record did not support termination. The situation is similar to that in <em>International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 9 v. Shank-Artukovich, </em>751 F.2d 364 (10th Cir.1985), wherein the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Akc\">Article VII, \u00a7 5 of the collective bargaining agreement at issue here contains express language that required the employer to pay damages if it violates the manning provision of the agreement. The agreement is unequivocal:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-16\">If violations of the manning provisions ... are found by ... the Arbitrator and if an individual(s) is found entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>to back pay, the same shall be paid by the violator, but if no individual is found entitled to damages the violator shall remit such damages to the Trustees of the Colorado Journeymen and Apprentice Training Fund for Operating Engineers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-4\">The plain language of the agreement contemplates damages whenever the employer violates the manning provisions of the agreement. If no individual is entitled to damages, the agreement requires the employer to pay damages to the union training fund.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-5\">The arbitrator found that the employer had violated the manning provisions of the agreement. He also concluded that no individual was entitled to backpay. However, he ruled that the employer was not required to pay damages to the union training fund. His decision did not draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement. It was contrary to the express terms of the agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\"><em>Zeviar v. Local No. 2747, </em>733 F.2d 556 (8th Cir.1984), does not require a different result. <em>Zeviar </em>dealt specifically with the collective bargaining agreement\u2019s use of the word \u201cexonerated.\u201d In <em>Zeviar, </em>the collective bargaining agreement provided that if an employee is \u201cexonerated,\u201d she should be reinstated and paid for lost time. We concluded that the chairman did not consider Zeviar to be fully exonerated in the sense of bearing no responsibility for her discharge. Accordingly, the Board was free to exercise its discretion in formulating a remedy. The collective bargaining agreement in this case is substantially different, referring only to the situation where the charges \u201cwere not sustained\u201d; exoneration is not an issue. The Board\u2019s conclusion that the record did not \u201csupport the termination\u201d comes squarely within the language of Rule 45(c) and thus, unlike the situation in <em>Zeviar, </em>leaves no room for the exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">As the award was directly contrary to the express terms of the agreement, the district court did not err in its determination that the Public Law Board\u2019s award did not draw its essence from the contract. I would affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
