The administrative law judge (ALJ) found that, although Mr. Weakley\u2019s back impairment constituted a disability under the statute, he was not entitled to benefits because he refused to submit to prescribed back surgery. Both the Social Security Administration Appeals Council and the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma denied Mr. Weakley relief. This court reversed the decision of the district court, holding that the Secretary failed to demonstrate by substantial evidence that the surgery would restore Mr. Weakley\u2019s ability to work. <em>Weakley v. Heckler, </em>795 F.2d 64 (10th Cir.1986). Claimant\u2019s attorney has subsequently moved this court to award attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412 (Supp. III 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">EAJA provides that \u201ca court shall award to a prevailing party other than the United States fees and other expenses, in addition to any costs awarded pursuant to subsection (a), ... unless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-13\">The burden rests with the government to prove that it was substantially justified in arguing, in this case, that the AU\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence. <em>Wyoming Wildlife Federation v. United States, </em>792 F.2d 981, 985 (10th Cir.1986) (\u201cOnce it has been established that plaintiffs are prevailing parties, the burden shifts to the Government to prove that it was substantially justified in asserting its litigating position.\u201d); <em>Fulton v. Heckler, </em>784 F.2d 348, 349 (10th Cir.1986) (\u201cThe issue is whether the Government was [substantially justified] in arguing that the ALJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-14\">The standard under which substantial justification is scrutinized, articulated in EAJA\u2019s legislative history and uniformly cited by most courts addressing the issue (including this court), is that of \u201creasonableness in both law and fact.\u201d <em>See Wyoming Wildlife Federation, </em>792 F.2d at 985; <em>Fulton, </em>784 F.2d at 349; <em>United States v. Community Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>768 F.2d 311, 314 (10th Cir.1985); <em>United States v. 2,116 Boxes of Boned Beef, </em>726 F.2d 1481, 1486 (10th Cir.1984); <em>see also </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1418, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 10-11, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4953, 4984, 4989-90. Neither this court nor any other court has applied a more stringent standard under which fees would be denied unless the government\u2019s position at least bordered on the frivolous or showed bad motivation or intransigence. The court in <em>S &amp; H Riggers &amp; Erectors, Inc. v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Commission, </em>672 F.2d 426, 430 (5th Cir.1982), as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>serted that the government need show more than that its suit was not frivolous and, moreover, particularly when a party has had to engage in lengthy administrative proceedings before a final vindication of his or her rights in the courts, the government should have to make a \u201cstrong showing\u201d of substantial justification. In fact, the more stringent standard of \u201carbitrary, frivolous, unreasonable or groundless\u201d proposed by the Department of Justice was explicitly rejected as too burdensome a standard for prevailing plaintiffs to meet. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1418, <em>supra, </em>at 14, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 4993. Even the government\u2019s response opposing the fee award concedes that the substantial justification standard is one of reasonableness. <em>See </em>Appellee\u2019s Response in Opposition to Appellant\u2019s Motion for Attorney Fees at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">In the present case, the controlling Tenth Circuit law with respect to the underlying dispute was clear. <em>Teter v. Heckler, </em>775 F.2d 1104, 1107 (10th Cir.1985), described the test to be applied in determining whether Mr. Weakley\u2019s refusal to submit to surgery could properly be the basis for denying him benefits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-5\">Courts reviewing whether a claimant\u2019s failure to undertake treatment will preclude the recovery of disability benefits have considered four elements, each of which must be supported by substantial evidence: (1) the treatment at issue should be expected to restore the claimant\u2019s ability to work; (2) the treatment must have been <em>prescribed; </em>(3) the treatment must have been refused; (4) the refusal must have been without justifiable excuse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">In the present case, the government failed to satisfy the first prong of the <em>Teter </em>test. <em>Weakley, </em>795 F.2d at 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">The ultimately controlling question with respect to awarding attorney\u2019s fees, then, is whether the government was <em>reasonable </em>in arguing that there was <em>substantial evidence </em>that the surgery would restore Mr. Weakley\u2019s ability to work. <em>See Fulton v. Heckler, </em>784 F.2d at 348. The record reveals that the testimony of only one physician, Dr. Zindel, arguably supported the government\u2019s position. Dr. Zindel, a consulting physician who evaluated Mr. Weakley during his hospitalization from November 30 to December 3, 1982, testified that \u201c[t]he problem is correctable by surgery,\u201d but then immediately qualified that assessment by stating that Mr. Weakley \u201cwould still have a residual of disability of a permanent nature estimated to be 15% to the body as a whole.\u201d Record, vol. 2, at 92. No medical testimony unequivocally supported the government\u2019s position. The testimony of Drs. Allen, Parkinson, Thomas, and Davis was contrary to the government\u2019s assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">The posture of this case is very similar to that of <em>Fulton v. Heckler, </em>760 F.2d 1052 (10th Cir.1985), where an ALJ denied benefits to a claimant on the strength of only one physician\u2019s testimony that the claimant could return to work, which conflicted with several other medical opinions. The district court affirmed the AU\u2019s determination. This court reversed, concluding that the AU\u2019s determination was not supported by substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 1056. Subsequently, this court awarded attorney\u2019s fees under EAJA, finding the government\u2019s position not substantially justified since \u201c[t]he only proper evidence supporting the administrative decision was a report by Dr. Donica which conflicted with the other medical opinions, with the testimony at the hearing, and with the history of Fulton\u2019s illness and treatment.\u201d 784 F.2d at 349; <em>cf. Ceglia v. Schweiker, </em>566 F.Supp. 118, 124 (E.D.N.Y.1983) (government\u2019s position denying benefits not substantially justified since AU relied exclusively on a consulting physician who did not examine claimant but reviewed medical evidence of record); <em>Kauffmann v. Schweiker, </em>559 F.Supp. 372, 375 (M.D.Pa.1983) (government\u2019s position not substantially justified since only medical evidence that claimant could work came from one physician who performed onetime examination); <em>Hornal v. Schweiker, </em>551 F.Supp. 612, 617 (M.D.Tenn.1982) (government\u2019s position not substantially justified since only medical evidence sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>porting Secretary\u2019s position was submitted by a doctor who examined claimant once and was contrary to evidence submitted by claimant\u2019s regular physician).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The government argues that the mere fact that the district court below affirmed the AU\u2019s decision \u201cstrongly suggests that the government\u2019s position was reasonable and therefore substantially justified.\u201d It cites <em>Brissette v. Heckler, </em>613 F.Supp. 722, 725 (E.D.Mo.1985), which summarily states this proposition without discussion in denying attorney\u2019s fees under EAJA. However, the more considered position in this regard can be found in <em>Broad Avenue Laundry &amp; Tailoring v. United States, </em>693 F.2d 1387 (Fed.Cir.1982). Although the court found the government\u2019s position to be substantially justified, it noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">[T]he position of the United States is not shown to have been substantially justified merely because the government prevailed before the tribunal below and endeavored to uphold the decision in its favor. If that were the rule, attorney\u2019s fees never could be awarded in favor of an appellant against the government.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq4\"><em>Id. </em>at 1392.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">The record supports the conclusion that the government was unreasonable, and hence not \u201csubstantially justified\u201d for purposes of EAJA, in maintaining that there was <em>substantial evidence </em>indicating that the surgery would restore Mr. Weakley\u2019s ability to work. It follows that a fee award pursuant to EAJA is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">Claimant\u2019s counsel requests $125.00 per hour for his representation of claimant in this case. EAJA prescribes a statutory rate of $75.00 per hour \u201cunless the court determines that an increase in the cost of living or a special factor, such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys for the proceedings involved, justifies a higher fee.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(2)(A). Claimant\u2019s attorney states that 75% of his practice is devoted to Social Security cases. He also asserts that \u201c[l]egal assistance in cases of this nature in the Eastern District of Oklahoma is almost nonexistent. Appellant\u2019s attorney can present evidence to support the limited legal resources available to a claimant such as the Appellant.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief in Support of Motion for Attorney Fees at 6. However, no such evidence was presented. Counsel has failed to demonstrate by affidavit or otherwise that adequate legal services to handle appellant\u2019s problem could not be obtained for $75 per hour. This court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-10\">Incomparable expertise, standing alone, will not justify the higher rate. An upward adjustment of the statutory rate is only to be made if the attorneys exceed the expected standards for attorneys of equal caliber____ The \u201climited availability of counsel\u201d exception to the $75 per hour limitation is confined to the unusual situation where appropriately specialized legal services cannot be obtained in the market for $75 or less.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-12\"><em>Vibra-Tech Engineers, Inc. v. United States, </em>787 F.2d 1416, 1420 (10th Cir.1986) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-13\">Appellant\u2019s Reply to Appellee\u2019s Response Regarding Appellant\u2019s Motion for Attorney Fees at 5, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-14\">Appellant is preparing affidavits which will be filed in this Court within ten days of this filing. The affidavits will outline the Appellant\u2019s position on this point. Appellant requests that the Court defer ruling on this Motion for at least ten days so that said affidavits may be filed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARs\">Appellant also wishes to amend his court cost request to include a $68.80 reimbursement for photocopying. However, appellant\u2019s entire reply, filed September 2, 1986, was untimely. Appellee filed its response to appellant\u2019s motion on July 30, 1986; thus, under Fed.R.App.P. 27(a), the reply to appellee\u2019s response was due by August 8, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-15\">The appellant\u2019s counsel has failed to satisfy his burden to timely establish that the statutory exception to the $75.00 per hour ceiling should apply. Therefore, the prescribed statutory rate should control. Appellant\u2019s attorney has documented 11.25 hours spent at the district court level and 56 hours spent at the appellate level on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>appellant\u2019s case. These totals are reasonable. Therefore, $843.75 should be awarded for work done at the district court level and $4,200.00 should be awarded for work done at the appellate level. Costs in the amount of $130.00 should also be awarded for filing fees. Costs for travel expenses and postage fees are not authorized. <em>See Massachusetts Fair Share v. Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, </em>776 F.2d 1066 (D.C.Cir.1985); <em>Wyandotte Savings Bank v. NLRB, </em>682 F.2d 119 (6th Cir.1982). Hence, appellant\u2019s attorney-should be awarded a total of $5,173.75 pursuant to EAJA.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Appellant has made an alternative motion for attorney\u2019s fees under the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b)(1) (1982), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-5\">Whenever a court renders a judgment favorable to a claimant under this sub-chapter who was represented before the court by an attorney, the court may determine and allow as part of its judgment a reasonable fee for such representation, not in excess of 25 percent of the total of the past-due benefits to which the claimant is entitled by reason of such judgment____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Congress made clear in the 1985 reenactment of EAJA that cases falling within the fee provision of the Social Security Act may also be subject to EAJA. To prevent double payment of fees for the same work under both statutes, however, Congress directed that the smaller amount be given to the client, since the Social Security Act fee award reduces the client\u2019s recovery of past due benefits. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 120, 99th Cong. 1st Sess. 20 (1985), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1985, pp. 132, 148. Thus, the attorney will receive both the award under EAJA and the award under the Social Security Act, but will be required to pay the smaller amount to his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">The sum of $3,042.25 of Mr. Weakley\u2019s past due benefits is being held by the Social Security Administration for award to his attorney, should this court so order. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Alternative Motion for Attorney Fees at 1. If such fees are awarded and no EAJA award is made, Mr. Weakley\u2019s past due benefit award will be reduced by the amount paid to his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">Mr. Weakley\u2019s counsel moves this court to order the Secretary to pay over the $3,042.25, stipulating</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWr\">that in the event the Court orders fees pursuant to the [EAJA], that Appellant\u2019s attorney will reimburse the Appellant for said [EAJA] fees up to the amount of the [EAJA] fees, but only to the extent of $3,042.25 and that any additional [EAJA] fees be awarded directly to Appellant\u2019s attorney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">Brief in Support of Appellant\u2019s Alternative Motion for Attorney Fees at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-11\">In light of our prior conclusion that EAJA applies to the facts of this case, it is ordered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-12\">(1) that the government pay appellant\u2019s counsel fees and costs pursuant to EAJA in the amount of $5,173.75;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-13\">(2) that the Secretary of Health and Human Services release to appellant\u2019s counsel the monies withheld from Mr. Weakley\u2019s past due benefits in the amount of $3,042.25; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-14\">(3) that appellant\u2019s counsel pay over to his client, Mr. Weakley, the amount of $3,042.25.</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
