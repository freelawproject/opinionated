Co., Inc. (A to Z), a bankrupt corporation, pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6672.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-14\">A to Z filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code on August 3, 1984. Thereafter, the IRS assessed a penalty against certain officers and shareholders of the debtor corporation requiring them to pay taxes withheld from its employee\u2019s wages pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6672. A to Z filed a complaint against the IRS seeking to enjoin collection of the assessed penalties. The bankruptcy court, held that it was barred by the anti-injunction statute, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421(a), from issuing an injunction. Thus, the bankruptcy court dissolved a preliminary injunction prohibiting the IRS from taking any action to collect the tax liabilities and dismissed A to Z\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-15\">The district court 58 B.R. 1138, affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision, and this appeal followed. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-16\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-17\">A to Z argues that the \u201canti-injunction\u201d statute is not relevant to the present case inasmuch as Congress, in enacting the bankruptcy code, has evidenced an intention to enact a complete scheme overriding the anti-injunction act. In support of its argument, A to Z relies on <em>Bostwick v. United States, </em>521 F.2d 741 (8th Cir.1975). <em>Bostwick </em>is inapposite to the case at hand. The injunction upheld in <em>Bostwick </em>was against collection of taxes assessed against the <em>debtors </em>in bankruptcy. 521 F.2d at 746. Thus, if a tax were assessed against the debtor, <em>Bostwick </em>may permit the bankruptcy court to override the anti-injunction act. Yet, this case involves an attempt to prohibit the IRS from collecting a tax assessed against officers and shareholders in their personal capacity. The anti-injunction act prohibits such a suit. <em>Kelly v. Lethert, </em>362 F.2d 629 (8th Cir.1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
