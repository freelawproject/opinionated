Defendants Martin, Griffen &amp; Brand of McAllen, Inc. (G <em>&amp; </em>B), Presidio Valley Farmers Association (PVFA) and Presidio Valley Farms, Inc. (PVF) appeal the judgment holding them liable to plaintiffs for violations of the Farm Labor Contractor Registration Act (FLCRA), 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2041 <em>et seq. </em>(repealed 1983).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiffs cross-appeal, contesting the district court\u2019s denial of certain alleged class members\u2019 claims. We affirm in part, reverse in part and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-23\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-24\">Presidio is a remote agricultural enclave in Southwest Texas, along the Rio Grande <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1345\">*1345</page-number>River adjacent to the Mexican city of Ojinaga. Until 1977, Presidio growers regularly hired undocumented workers from Ojinaga to harvest their onion, cantelope and pepper crops from May through July or August. In the spring of 1977, however, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) decided to enforce the border, cutting off the flow of Mexican workers. Thus faced with no guaranteed supply of workers for their upcoming harvests, Presidio growers joined together to form the Presidio Valley Farmers Association. PVFA\u2019s main, short-term objective was to secure enough workers, either domestically or from Mexico, to harvest its members\u2019 crops.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-5\">Billy Joe Bishop, president and co-owner with G &amp; B of Presidio Valley Farms, was named president of PVFA. On behalf of both PVF and PVFA, he enlisted the help of G &amp; B, a registered farm labor contractor, in finding workers for Presidio.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Upon learning of the labor crunch, G &amp; B president Othal Brand in turn contacted Glen Martin, G &amp; B\u2019s principal farm worker recruiter.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Brand told Martin to \u201cdo whatever was necessary\u201d to find domestic farm workers for Presidio.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-6\">In May and early June, Martin spoke to numerous crew leaders, orally offering them work in Presidio for themselves and their crews. No housing was available, however, and the crew leaders would not go where there was no place to live.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-7\">Finally, Martin added housing to the terms of the offer. Thereafter, plaintiffs Crispin Sanchez, Juanita Martinez, Santiago Quintero and Florencio Camacho accepted and began assembling crews; Camacho also asked crew member Jose Flores to help him find additional people. As the work was to begin in mid-June, these crew leaders were told to return between June 9 and 13 for exact departure instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-12\">Meanwhile, PVFA had also been negotiating with INS and the Department of Labor (DOL) throughout the spring for 809 temporary worker (H-2) visas for the Mexican workers they had previously employed. After much hesitation, INS suddenly issued the visas on June 9 or 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-13\">With an adequate supply of workers from across the border, Presidio growers no longer needed domestic crews. Thus, when the crew leaders appeared as agreed for departure instructions, Martin informed them that the deal was off, leaving plaintiffs without work for most of June. Martin did offer work in July in Fort Stockton/Pecos; Martinez and Camacho accepted although most of their crews drifted off to other jobs before that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-14\">Several crew members brought the present suit soon thereafter, seeking damages against these defendants<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for breach of the employment agreements and FLORA violations. Following various delays, a class of the recruited farm workers was certified in 1980, and a bench trial held in 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-15\">The district court found that Martin had violated three provisions of the FLORA, and awarded liquidated damages of $500 to each class member for each violation. Then, applying agency principles, it held G &amp; B and PVFA jointly and severally liable with Martin for these violations. The court further found that PVF had violated another FLORA provision, and awarded $500 per member for that, violation. In addition, it awarded plaintiffs costs and attorney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1346\">*1346</page-number>fees, under Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 2226 (Vernon 1971), <em>repealed &amp; replaced by </em>Tex.Civ.Prac. &amp; Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 38.001-006 (Vernon 1986), and interest as of the date of the liability order. The court also found defendants liable to the four crew leaders on breach of contract claims, but it later determined that they had failed to prove any contract damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-4\">Notice was then sent to all potential class members. Two hundred and three people filed claims. Defendants challenged numerous claimants; after a hearing in 1984 at which each crew leader identified the members of his crew, 159 claims were approved. Final judgment was entered in May 1985, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-5\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-6\">Defendants appeal virtually every aspect of the trial court\u2019s rulings. In addition, plaintiffs cross-appeal the treatment of certain claims. The issues fall into three general categories: liability and damages; class certification and claims; and interest and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-7\">I. <em>Liability-Related Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"AnF\">According to defendants, the court committed legal and factual errors in imposing any liability upon them. The court held Martin, G &amp; B and PVFA liable for violating three FLORA provisions, by failing (1) to inform plaintiffs, in writing, of the correct terms of employment, \u00a7\u00a7 2044(b)(2) &amp; 2045(b); and (2) to provide the promised work, \u00a7 2044(b)(4). It also held PVF liable under \u00a7 2043(c), for dealing with an unregistered farm labor contractor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As the liability of the other defendants partly depends on the court\u2019s findings concerning Martin, we will begin by examining their contentions as to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-10\">A. <em>Martin</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1412-11\">Defendants first argue that Martin was exempt from the statute\u2019s coverage, under \u00a7 2042(b)(6), as a full-time employee of a registered farm labor contractor. This argument is nullified by the clear provision of the statute. The exemption applies only to the registration requirements. Although Martin did not need to register as a farm labor contractor, he was bound by all the other provisions of the Act. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2043(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-12\">They next contend that he received no \u201cfee\u201d for his services. This argument is equally unmeritorious. The Act defines \u201cfee\u201d to include \u201cany money or other valuable consideration paid or promised to be paid to a person for services as a farm labor contractor.\u201d \u00a7 2042(c). The district court correctly found that Martin\u2019s salary constituted a \u201cfee,\u201d for \u00a7 2042(c) purposes. <em>See Castillo v. Givens, </em>704 F.2d 181, 197 (5th Cir.) (finding that crew leader\u2019s wage constituted fee), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 850, 104 S.Ct. 160, 78 L.Ed.2d 147 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-13\">Defendants then claim that Martin is not liable to the plaintiff crew <em>members </em>because he had direct contact only with the crew <em>leaders. </em>This argument runs contrary to our case law. \u201c[A] person may not insulate himself from the provisions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1347\">*1347</page-number>Act by simply conducting his activities through underlings who deal more directly with the workers.\" <em>Soliz v. Plunkett, </em>615 F.2d 272, 277 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-5\">Defendants last contend that two critical factual findings are unsupported by any \u201ccredible\u201d evidence. We review the district court\u2019s factual findings under a \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). This standard</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuZ\">recognizes and rests upon the unique opportunity afforded the trial court to evaluate the credibility of witnesses and to weigh the evidence. Because of the deference due the trial judge, unless [we are] left with the \u2018definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed,\u2019 [we] must accept the trial court\u2019s findings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1413-6\"><em>Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc., </em>456 U.S. 844, 855, 102 S.Ct. 2182, 2189, 72 L.Ed.2d 606 (1982) (quoting <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 541, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948)) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-7\">First, defendants challenge the court\u2019s finding that Martin actually recruited plaintiffs. Martin testified, they point out, that he lacked authority to enter into any \u201ccontracts\u201d with crew leaders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-8\">We need not decide whether Martin\u2019s offer and plaintiffs\u2019 acceptance constituted a \u201ccontract\u201d or merely an enforceable promise under a promissory estoppel theory: the recruitment system may be <em>sui generjs. </em>All of the testimony clearly demonstrates that, due to his position, Martin\u2019s word carried the authority to send workers out into the fields to work either for G &amp; B or, upon request, for other growers who were expected to pay for that work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-12\">Plaintiffs all testified that Martin had recruited them and their crews to pick cantelopes in Presidio. In addition, Martin himself, in explaining his recruitment system, testified that he lined up willing workers from the lower Rio Grande Valley and then \u201c[t]hey go to Presidio and contact them out there and they take care of [the details].\u201d Depo. of G. Martin at 22; <em>see also id. </em>at 17-22, 43-44; T.R. 483. Bishop testified that G &amp; B officers had told him that \u201cif there was a need for people [in Presidio], let them know and that they would tell these people that there was a job out there if they wanted to come,\u201d Depo. of B. Bishop at 55; in fact, the three domestic crews from McAllen who regularly worked for PVF had contracted through G &amp; B before coming, <em>id. </em>Furthermore, Martinez and Camacho testified, without contradiction, that Martin offered them jobs in Fort Stockton in July \u2014 the offer alone sufficed; there is no evidence that they were required to contact Fort Stockton growers in advance, but simply to show up there to work. In light of this evidence, we find no error in the court\u2019s decision to credit plaintiffs\u2019 testimony of their recruitment for Presidio.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1413-13\">Based on this finding, the court determined that Martin had violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1348\">*1348</page-number>\u00a7 2044(b)(4) (failure to comply with promised terms); and \u00a7 2045(b) (failure to provide written copies of the terms). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"ACA\">The \u00a7 2044(b)(4) violation clearly follows from the finding that Martin recruited plaintiffs; defendants do not dispute that, once the H-2 visas were issued, Presidio growers did not need domestic workers and could not have provided work even if they had come.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The \u00a7 2045(b) violation is equally clear. Plaintiffs testified that Martin gave them nothing in writing, and Martin himself admitted that he never gives crew leaders written copies of the employment terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-5\">Second, defendants challenge the court\u2019s finding that Martin misrepresented the terms of employment, by offering plaintiffs free housing in Presidio.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Mindful of the limited scope of our review, we conclude that this finding is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-6\">All admit that almost no housing was available for workers in Presidio; the little housing that did exist was across the river in Ojinaga. Indeed, the growers\u2019 main difficulty in securing H-2 visas had been the non-existence of housing in Presidio. DOL would not approve the visa applications without first testing the domestic labor market, but no test was possible unless suitable housing could be offered.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>E.g., </em>P.Exs. 3, 7, 14, 16, 20, 29, 32, 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-7\">It is also agreed that domestic farm workers will not go to an area without adequate housing. The crew leaders consistently testified that Martin\u2019s June offer to them included housing, T.R. 229, 288, 343; Depo. of F. Camacho at 25; <em>see also </em>Depo. of J. Flores at 16; because of their responsibility to their crews, they would not have accepted the offer without assurances that housing would be available, <em>e.g., </em>T.R. 255, 294-95. In addition, Martin testified that, when he first started recruiting in early May, no crew leaders were interested after he told them about the scarcity of housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-13\">Yet, according to Martin, Bishop and Brand, Martin was under great pressure to find workers for Presidio by late May and early June. <em>See, e.g., </em>T.R. 490, 508, 566, 570, 616; Depo. of G. Martin at 16, 34 (finding workers was \u201chigh priority item\u201d); Depo. of O. Brand at 25. He was repeatedly told to do whatever was necessary to get people out there to harvest the crops before they were ruined. The promise of housing, the court concluded, was a last-ditch gamble that, after traveling all the way to Presidio, plaintiffs would agree to live in Ojinaga. The evidence supports this conclusion. Martin\u2019s liability for the \u00a7 2044(b)(2) violation (misrepresentation of employment terms) plainly follows from this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-14\">B. <em>Vicarious Liability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1414-15\">Applying agency principles, the court held G &amp; B and PYFA jointly liable for Martin\u2019s violations.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Both defendants contest that holding because, they claim, the statute does not allow for \u201cvicarious liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1349\">*1349</page-number>In accordance with the Act\u2019s distinction between farm labor contractors and farmer-users, we have refused to hold farmer-users vicariously liable for the recruiting violations of independent farm labor contractors. <em>See Beliz v. W.H. McLeod &amp; Sons Packing Co., </em>765 F.2d 1317, 1333-34 (5th Cir.1985); <em>see also Jenkins v. S. &amp; A. Chaissan &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>449 F.Supp. 216, 226-28 (S.D.N.Y.1978). G &amp; B and PYFA are not farmer-users, however. Their liability is premised, instead, on the finding that they are farm labor contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-6\">Neither case law nor the statute itself abrogates ordinary respondeat superior principles. As Martin\u2019s employer, G &amp; B was responsible for all of Martin\u2019s actions within the scope of his employment. <em>E.g., De la Fuente v. Stokely-Van Camp, Inc., </em>514 F.Supp. 68, 79 (C.D.Ill.1981), <em>modified on other grounds, </em>713 F.2d 225 (7th Cir.1983); <em>cf. Soliz, </em>615 F.2d at 277-78. G &amp; B does not argue that Martin exceeded that scope in recruiting plaintiffs; its liability flows directly from Martin\u2019s.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1415-7\">We find no support for the court\u2019s application of agency principles to PVFA, however. The record indicates that PVFA enlisted G &amp; B\u2019s services as an independent contractor; as G &amp; B\u2019s employer, PVFA is not liable for G &amp; B\u2019s actions without some wrongful conduct of its own. <em>See Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7\u00a7 409-14 (1965), W. Prosser, <em>The Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 71, at 468-70 (4th ed. 1971). Yet the court made no specific findings concerning PVFA\u2019s participation in or knowledge of Martin\u2019s \u00a7\u00a7 2044(b) and 2045(b) violations. Unless PVFA contributed to or had reason to know of Martin\u2019s misconduct, the blanket imposition of joint and several liability against PVFA cannot stand. We therefore vacate the judgment against PVFA and remand to the trial court for further findings.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1415-11\">On remand, the court may also conclude that PVFA <em>independently </em>violated the Act. For example, the court has already found that PVFA\u2019s domestic recruiting activities, including the G &amp; B connection that led to plaintiffs\u2019 recruitment, made PVFA a farm labor contractor within the meaning of \u00a7 2042(b);<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> this finding is not clearly erroneous, <em>e.g., </em>P.Exs. 30-31, 38-43, 48; T.R. 610-16. PVFA was admittedly not registered, a possible violation of \u00a7 2043(a). The court may find other violations; we in no way attempt to substitute our judgment for that of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-12\">C. <em>PVF</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1415-13\">The court concluded that PVF violated \u00a7 2043(c), by relying on PVFA to meet its 1977 labor needs. Section 2043(c) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number>prohibits farmer-users from utilizing the services of an unregistered farm labor contractor. PVFA, through Bishop, acted as a farm labor contractor in recruiting plaintiffs; it is undisputed that PVFA was not properly registered. To affirm the judgment of PVF\u2019s liability, however, we would also have to find that Bishop\u2019s contacts with G &amp; B were <em>exclusively </em>in his capacity as PVFA president. <em>Compare Presidio Valley Farmers Association v. Brock, </em>765 F.2d 1353, 1357-58 (5th Cir.1985) (individual growers not liable for PVFA\u2019s violations despite unincorporated status), <em>cert. denied, --</em>- U.S. ---, 106 S.Ct. 833, 88 L.Ed.2d 804 (1986). We agree with defendants that the record does not support this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-5\">Plaintiffs have offered no evidence that PVF\u2019s labor requests were funnelled through PVFA; indeed, the contrary inference is strong. G &amp; B and Bishop were co-owners of PVF, with a compelling interest in the farm\u2019s economic being. This fact alone suggests that they would not have treated PVF\u2019s labor needs on a par with those of the other PVFA members. Finding no support in this record for this violation, we reverse the liability finding and corresponding award of damages against PVF.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-6\">D. <em>Damages</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1416-7\">The court awarded $500 in liquidated damages to each plaintiff for each statutory violation. Defendants now contend that the award is too high because it exceeds the amount plaintiffs could have earned if they had actually gone to Presidio. This argument has no merit.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1416-8\">FLCRA relief need not be measured by actual damages alone. \u201c[T]he purpose of this civil remedy is not restricted to compensation of individual plaintiffs. It is designed also to promote enforcement of the Act and thereby deter and correct the exploitative practices that have historically plagued the migrant farm labor market.\u201d <em>Beliz, </em>765 F.2d at 1332. Under \u00a7 2050a(b), the court has discretion to award damages \u201cup to and including an amount equal to the amount of actual damages, or $500, or other equitable relief\u201d for each violation. In fixing the amount of the award, the court should consider numerous factors, including the nature of the violations, the extent of the defendant\u2019s culpability, the total amount of the award, the substantive or technical nature of the violations and the cost \u2014 in all senses \u2014 to the plaintiffs of bringing the suit. <em>See Beliz, </em>765 F.2d at 1333; <em>Salazar-Calderon, </em>765 F.2d at 1346-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-13\">Here, the record indicates that the court carefully considered these factors and determined that $500 was appropriate. <em>Cf. Washington v. Miller, </em>721 F.2d 797, 803 (11th Cir.1983) (affirming maximum damages for nontechnical violations). Defendants have not shown this to be an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-14\">II. <em>Class-Related Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"A5h\">Defendants\u2019 litany of class-related issues divides into two main groups. They raise numerous issues pertaining to the certification itself and, then, challenge the claims of . individual claimants. Plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeal also involves the claims question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-15\">A. <em>Class Certification</em></p>\n<p id=\"AIz_\">First, defendants argue that suits brought under the FLCRA may not be handled as class actions. On the contrary, however, the class action device has frequently been approved in suits under the FLORA. <em>E.g., Almandarez v. Barrett-Fisher Co., </em>762 F.2d 1275. (5th Cir.1985); <em>De la Fuente, </em>713 F.2d at 231-32; <em>Alvarez v. Joan of Arc, Inc., </em>658 F.2d 1217 (7th Cir.1981); <em>Izaguirre v. Tankersley, </em>516 F.Supp. 755 (D.Or.1981); <em>see also Salazar-Calderon, </em>765 F.2d at 1350 (suggesting possibility of class certification on remand of FLCRA suit).</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1351\">*1351</page-number>Second, they contend that certification in this case is improper because the claims arise out of alleged oral misrepresentations. Such claims have been found unsuitable for class treatment when individual questions, such as reliance and damages, predominate over class questions. <em>See, e.g., </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3) 1966 Advisory Committee Notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-6\">The district court has great discretion in certifying and managing a proposed class action. <em>Kilgo v. Bowman Transportation, Inc., </em>789 F.2d 859, 877 (11th Cir.1986); <em>Jenkins v. Raymark Industries, Inc., </em>782 F.2d 468, 471 (5th Cir.1986); <em>see Salazar-Calderon, </em>765 F.2d at 1350. Where the court has determined that class certification is appropriate, we may reverse its decision only upon a showing of abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-7\">The court acted well within its discretion in certifying this suit as a class action.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>See De la Fuente, </em>713 F.2d 225 (FLCRA class action for violations of \u00a7 2045 (failure to disclose)). Despite defendants\u2019 characterization, the claims are for statutory violations. <em>Cf. Greenhaw v. Lubbock County Beverage Association, </em>721 F.2d 1019, 1024 (5th Cir.1983) (class device appropriate \u201cenforcing mechanism for congressionally sanctioned goals\u201d). Moreover, due to the system of recruitment, the predominant liability questions are common to all plaintiffs. The job offers Martin made to the four crew leaders were, for the most part, identical; an offer to a crew leader extended equally to all of his crew. <em>See General Telephone Co. v. Falcon, </em>457 U.S. 147, 155, 102 S.Ct. 2364, 2309, 72 L.Ed.2d 740 (1982) (class action \u201c \u2018peculiarly appropriate\u2019 when the \u2018issues involved are common to the class as a whole\u2019 and ... \u2018turn on questions of law applicable in the same manner to each member of the class\u2019 \u201d) <em>(quoting Califano v. Yamasaki, </em>442 U.S. 682, 700-01, 99 S.Ct. 2545, 257-58, 61 L.Ed.2d 176 (1979)); <em>cf. Alliance to End Repression v. Rockford, </em>565 F.2d 975, 979 (7th Cir.1977) (common issues predominate in pattern-and-practice suit). Furthermore, the liquidated damages awards obviated any need to resolve individual questions of reliance and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-10\">Third, defendants argue that the decision to certify, made three years after institution of the suit, was untimely. We disagree. Although the district court should make its initial ruling on class certification \u201c[a]s soon as practicable after the commencement of an action,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(1), there is no set deadline by which the court must act. <em>See Gore v. Turner, </em>563 F.2d 159, 165-66 (5th Cir.1977) (maintenance of class action possible even without explicit Rule 23(c)(1) determination); <em>see also Chateau de Ville Productions, Inc. v. Tams-Witmark Music Library, Inc., </em>586 F.2d 962, 966 (2d Cir.1978) (precipitous action unnecessary). Part of the delay here is attributable to plaintiffs\u2019 post-filing discovery efforts; we find no abuse in the court\u2019s decision to await those results, <em>see Gore, </em>563 F.2d 159; <em>Huff v. N.D. Cass Co., </em>485 F.2d 710, 712-13 (5th Cir.1973). Still more delay resulted from the docket backlog in Brownsville, over which plaintiffs had no control. Especially in light of the unusually timely filing of this case, we do not find that defendants were unduly prejudiced by the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-11\">Last, defendants contest the adequacy of the class notice, claiming that it violates Rule 23(c)(2)\u2019s requirement of \u201cthe best notice practicable under the circumstances.\u201d There is no merit at all to this claim. The rule requires only that notice be mailed individually to \u201call class members whose names and addresses may be ascertained through reasonable effort.\u201d <em>Eisen v. Carlisle &amp; Jacquelin, </em>417 U.S. 156, 173, 94 S.Ct. 2140, 2150, 40 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number>732 (1974); <em>cf. In re Beef Industry Antitrust Litigation, </em>607 F.2d 167, 178-79 (5th Cir.1979) (stressing trial court\u2019s great discretion over matters of notice and determination of class), <em>cert. denied, </em>452 U.S. 905, 101 S.Ct. 3029, 69 L.Ed.2d 405 (1981). By contrast, the court here not only required plaintiffs to mail individual notice in English and Spanish to all persons they could reasonably locate, it also ordered bilingual radio and newspaper announcements for a sixty-day period in the areas where class members were most likely to be found. In addition, over defendants\u2019 objection, plaintiffs personally contacted as many class members as possible. Given the mobile, semi-literate character of the class, these efforts fully satisfied the dictates of Rule 23(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-4\">B. <em>Claims and Claimants</em></p>\n<p id=\"AZTI\">Defendants\u2019 first challenge to individual claimants concerns two crew leaders, Martinez and Quintero, and any crew members who could not legally work in Presidio. These persons, they contend, are not included in the definition of the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-5\">This contention overlooks what the court did under its broad authority to redefine the class \u201cas appropriate in response to the progression of the case from assertion to facts.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Byrd, </em>709 F.2d 1016, 1019 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 1009, 104 S.Ct. 527, 78 L.Ed.2d 710 (1983). The class, as originally certified, did exclude crew leaders and consist only of \u201cdomestic farm workers,\u201d defined as United States citizens-or aliens lawfully admitted to work in the United States.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In conformance with the evidence as the suit progressed, however, the court periodically exercised its discretion to restructure the class. By final judgment, the class included each of the four crew leaders and all recruited crew members regardless of immigration status.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Defendants have not shown this to constitute an abuse of discretion. <em>See Kilgo, </em>789 F.2d at 877-78 (no abuse in court\u2019s post-trial decision to expand class to include other members where additions simply conformed to evidence at trial); <em>cf. Holsey v. Armour &amp; Co., </em>743 F.2d 199, 205 (4th Cir.1984) (no abuse in court\u2019s decision to allow two class members to intervene as plaintiffs after trial), <em>cert. denied, </em>470 U.S. 1028, 105 S.Ct. 1395, 84 L.Ed.2d 784 (1985). For clarity, however, the judgment should be modified on remand to reflect the precise final definition of the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-9\">Defendants\u2019 next argument concerns the approval of awards to claimants who had either forgotten or never known the details of the Presidio job offers. These claimants, defendants argue, are not entitled to damages because they could have formed no adequate expectations about the promised employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-10\">This argument, like their earlier misrepresentation and damage arguments, suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of the case. Their liability rests on statutory violations, for which only liquidated damages, not actual damages, were awarded. Regardless of whether crew members expected wages of $2.50 or $2.20 for 8-hour days or 10-hour days in Presidio or the lower Rio Grande Valley, they all shared two basic expectations: the existence of work and the existence of housing. Defendants violated the Act primarily because their actions first created and then destroyed these expectations. Any claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1353\">*1353</page-number>who suffered as a result is entitled to the relief.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1419-5\">Last, defendants challenge the grant of certain claims, specifically: (1) in the Camacho crew, some Camacho family members, Roberto Blanco, and Layda and Ramon Perez; and (2) in the Martinez crew, Rolando Palacios and Enedelia Pena. According due deference to both the magistrate and the district court, we find substantial evidence to support their findings as to (1) the Camachos: We see no inconsistency between Camacho\u2019s testimony and his family\u2019s claims. Although defendants object to the inclusion of Camacho\u2019s parents, for example, he expressly testified at trial that they were going; (2) Roberto Blanco: Despite defendants\u2019 interpretation of Blanco\u2019s testimony, a close reading reveals that his vagueness as to dates results from a linguistic confusion of March with May and June with July. We see nothing to contradict his repeated assertions, corroborated by his name on the original crew list, that he was ready to go with Camacho to work; and (3) Rolando Palacios: Martinez reasonably explained the omission of the trucker Palacios\u2019 name from her list,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and her trial testimony is not inconsistent. She stated that <em>she </em>was taking only the people, but was not asked whether any of the <em>people </em>were taking trucks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-6\">On the other hand, the record currently provides slim support for the claims of the two Perezes and Enedelia Pena. Lucia Perez unequivocally testified twice that her husband and one child were not going; at the hearing, Camacho did not adequately explain the basis of their claims. Similarly, Martinez clearly stated at trial that she was taking only three of her children, none of whom was Enedelia Pena; her cryptic explanation at the hearing sheds no real light on the merits of Pena\u2019s claim. With the exception of these three people, however, we affirm the awards to the approved claimants and turn now to plaintiffs\u2019 cross appeal, which is directed solely at the rejection of certain persons who claimed to be members of the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-10\">Plaintiffs contend that no self-proclaimed crew member should be excluded from the class without being given an opportunity to substantiate his claim. We agree.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>See </em>H. Newburg, <em>Class Actions </em>\u00a7 4600 (1977); <em>cf. Greenhaw, </em>721 F.2d at 1032-33 (no abuse of discretion in courts order requiring claimants to appear to substantiate claims). A few of the rejected claims, such as that of Santa Reyna and possibly those of Irene Jaramillo, Tomasa Jaramillo, George Luis Rangel, Eubin Gomez and Emilio Vargas, appear meritorious on the existing record. Beyond the information on the claims forms, we know nothing about most of the others. The crew leaders\u2019 lists, while strong evidence of class membership, should not alone serve as a basis for excluding any claimant who wants and is able to prove the merits of his claim. Accordingly, we remand, for further proceedings, the claims of the following individuals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1419-11\">1.

At that time, the court ordered that a kind of interim interest of 9% per year begin to accrue on the awards. Analogizing to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216 (1982), defendants now claim that \u201cprejudgment interest\u201d is barred on any liquidated damages award. <em>See Brooklyn Savings Bank v. O\u2019Neil, </em>324 U.S. 697, 715, 65 S.Ct. 895, 906, 89 L.Ed. 1296 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-8\">We are not persuaded by defendants\u2019 analogy; the FLSA provision differs significantly from that of the FLCRA.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Nevertheless, plaintiffs are not entitled to interest, prejudgment, on their award in this case and, therefore, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-9\">Interest before final judgment is generally awarded to compensate a plaintiff fully for an actual monetary loss he has suffered as a result of a defendant\u2019s breach of an obligation. <em>See Rodgers v. United States, </em>332 U.S. 371, 373, 68 S.Ct. 5, 7, 92 L.Ed. 3 (1947). Its assessment furthers the purpose of making the injured plaintiff whole. <em>Cf Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. Texas Eastern Transmission Corp., </em>551 F.2d 943, 944 (5th Cir.1977) (contrasting actual damages with penalties, on which prejudgment interest does not usually accrue). Thus, had plaintiffs chosen to recover actual damages, interest \u2014 from the date of breach \u2014 would no doubt have been appropriate. They made no real attempt to prove - actual damages, however, but instead requested only liquidated damages\u2014 in an amount which no one argues is related to the actual losses suffered. Interest from the date of the order does not serve to make them any more whole. While we do not condone defendants\u2019 dilatory tactics, we find no legal basis for the court\u2019s hybrid interest award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-12\">B. <em>Attorney\u2019s Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1420-13\">The court awarded plaintiffs attorney\u2019s fees under Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 2226 (Vernon 1971), <em>repealed &amp; replaced by </em>Tex.Civ.Prac. &amp; Rem.Code \u00a7\u00a7 38.001-006 (Vernon 1986). <em>Compare Williams v. Tri-County Growers, Inc., </em>747 F.2d 121, 137-38 (3d Cir.1984) (awarding attorney\u2019s fees for both FLCRA and related state labor law violations where state labor law provided for fee award). Defendants contest the legal basis for this award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-14\">We agree that an award under article 2226 was inappropriate on the facts of this case. Article 2226 authorizes attorney\u2019s fees in suits for common law breach of an oral contract. Here, only the four crew leaders pursued common law contract claims; the vast majority of attorney time may not be covered by the statute. More importantly, we do not find that the crew leaders \u201cprevailed\u201d on their contract claims. Despite the liability finding, the court concluded they had not established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1355\">*1355</page-number>any right to recover damages for these claims. Texas courts do not allow article 2226 awards where the plaintiff is not the prevailing party and has recovered no damages on his claim. <em>See James Holmes Enterprises, Inc. v. John Bankston Construction &amp; Equipment Rental, Inc., </em>664 S.W.2d 832, 834 (Tex.App. --- Beaumont 1983, writ ref\u2019d n.r.e.). Accordingly, we vacate the award under article 2226.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-6\">Plaintiffs clearly prevailed on their FLCRA claims, however. Even in the absence of a statutory provision,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> federal courts may award attorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing plaintiff if the losing party has been guilty of bad faith. <em>Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, </em>421 U.S. 240, 258-59, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 1622, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975); <em>Alvarez v. Longboy, </em>697 F.2d 1333, 1340 (9th Cir.1983) (suggesting possibility of such an award in FLCRA case). The court here hinted that plaintiffs might be entitled to an award on a bad faith theory, but it did not rule on this alternate ground. As we cannot substitute our opinion for the trial court\u2019s, we remand the case for further findings. Defendants have not contested the amount previously awarded. Should the court determine that defendants\u2019 conduct justifies an award of attorney\u2019s fees, this issue, as well as the remaining claims, can presumably be resolved without further appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-7\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-8\">We reverse the judgment against Presidio Valley Farms, Inc., the judgment in favor of Enedelia Pena, Layda Perez and Ramon Perez, and the award of prejudgment interest. We remand the cause' for reconsideration of the claims of the enumerated persons and for further consideration of the claim against Presidio Valley Farmers Association and for attorney\u2019s fees. Otherwise, the judgment may be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"A0Z\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part) an(j REMANDED,</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1410-15\">.

It should be construed broadly to effectuate its remedial purposes. <em>Almendarez v. Barrett-Fisher Co., </em>762 F.2d 1275, 1278-83 (5th Cir.1985); <em>Soliz v. Plunkett, </em>615 F.2d 272, 275 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-14\">The Act defines \"farm labor contractor\u201d as \"any person, who, for a fee, either for himself or on behalf of another person, recruits, solicits, hires, furnishes, or transports migrant workers ... for agricultural employment.\u201d \u00a7 2042(b). Such persons must register as farm labor contractors and comply with other requirements, including furnishing recruited workers with written copies of the employment terms, \u00a7 2045(b); correctly stating those terms, \u00a7 2044(b)(2); and actually providing the promised employment on the promised terms, \u00a7 2044(b)(4). Farmer-users may also incur liability if they deal with a farm labor contractor without ascertaining that the contractor is properly registered. \u00a7 2043(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1413-9\">. In challenging plaintiffs\u2019 credibility, defendants rely heavily on G &amp; B payroll records \u25a0 indicating that both Sanchez and Martinez had been working for G &amp; B during and after the time they testified they were ready to leave for Presidio. The court implicitly found, however, that the records did not seriously impeach these crew leaders\u2019 testimony. With due deference to the court\u2019s opportunity to assess witness credibility, we conclude that the finding is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-10\">According to the records, Sanchez worked no full days while he was assembling his crew and only a few hours with a crew of 12 after the scheduled departure date. D.Exs. 8-11. Martinez\u2019 crew worked only a half-day on June 9th, the day she testified she went to receive her departure instructions. Thereafter, the shifting crews she led worked diminishing amounts, some days only a couple of hours, through June 19 when the records stop. D.Exs. 17-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-15\">The rest of their testimony was fully corroborated by the other crew leaders. To the extent their testimony is inconsistent with the records, the court could reasonably conclude that they had simply forgotten about the work in the five years between the events and the trial. It is not unlikely that plaintiffs, upon discovering that their alternate plans had fallen through, would take whatever work they could find on a day-today basis. The evidence indicated that growers in the lower Rio Grande Valley often hired day-to-day in mid-June because their harvests were winding down and workers were leaving for more profitable areas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1414-8\">. Both Martin and G &amp; B' clearly knew about PVFA\u2019s concurrent negotiations with INS and DOL about the visas. Martin was present during at least one meeting between G &amp; B officers and a Texas Employment Commission agent whom PVFA had contacted pursuant to its efforts to obtain visa approval. <em>See </em>P.Ex. 22. Moreover, G &amp; B President Brand personally contacted several government officials to encourage them to issue the visas. <em>E.g., </em>Depo. of O. Brand at 10-23, 36-44; Depo. of B. Bishop at 72-73; Depo. of W. Harris at 49-50.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1414-9\">. It is arguable whether Martin also misrepresented the wages, promising $2.50 per hour in contrast to PVFA\u2019s standing offer of $2.20 per hour. In light of Bishop\u2019s testimony that growers were willing to pay over $2.20 if necessary, we conclude that the offer of $2.50 did not constitute a knowing misrepresentation for \u00a7 2044(b)(2) purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1414-17\">. DOL H-2 visa regulations presume that domestic farm workers will not work in an area unless housing is available.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1414-18\">. Although the Liability Order refers only generally to \"vicarious liability,\u201d at the May 2, 1983 hearing, the court explained that the term meant \"agency liability.\u201d <em>See </em>Transcript of Proceedings of May 2, 1983, at 20.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1415-8\">. G &amp; B also argues that It received no \"fee\" for Martin\u2019s services. This argument directly contradicts Othal Brand\u2019s testimony, however. Brand testified that, while the company paid Martin\u2019s salary, it always received some form of compensation when Martin supplied crews to a grower. <em>See </em>T.R. 571, 491-92, 506-08 (testimony of Martin). <em>Cf. De la Fuente v. Stokely-Van Camp, Inc., </em>713 F.2d 225, 235 (7th Cir.1983); <em>Alvarez v. Joan of Arc, Inc., </em>658 F.2d 1217, 1221 (7th Cir.1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1415-9\">. There is no merit in PVFA\u2019s contention that Bishop\u2019s only contacts with G &amp; B were in his capacity as PVF president, thereby relieving PVFA of liability for his acts. All of the evidence, including defendants\u2019 own testimony, indicates that the recruiting arrangement between Bishop and G &amp; B encompassed the labor needs of all Presidio growers. According to both Bishop and Brand, their discussions focused on the labor crisis in all Presidio, not merely at PVF. <em>See </em>T.R. 490, 508, 566, 616; P.Ex. 22; Depo. of B. Bishop at 67. Brand appeared at one of PVFA\u2019s June meetings with INS and even offered PVFA $250,000 out of G &amp; B\u2019s coffers to build housing for workers in the future. T.R. 558, 561-2; Depo. of O. Brand at 23-24. Brand also told Martin to find workers for the whole area, <em>e.g. </em>T.R. 566; Depo. of G. Martin at 16, 34, and Martin told plaintiffs only that the work would be in Presidio, <em>e.g., </em>T.R. 339-40, 527-28; Depo. of F. Camacho at 21, 26. Although Bishop no doubt included PVF in his request, he was clearly acting primarily as president of PVFA. <em>Cf. De la Fuente, </em>713 F.2d at 236 n. 8 (for purposes of defendant contractor\u2019s liability, no distinction between plaintiffs recruited for defendant\u2019s operations and those recruited for others).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1415-15\">. The court correctly found that the growers\u2019 dues constituted a \"fee\u201d for PVFA\u2019s recruitment services. Bishop testified that the dues were used to defray PVFA\u2019s recruiting expenses. <em>E.g., </em>T.R. 629-30.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1416-9\">. Defendants also suggest that the $500 award resulted from the court\u2019s belief that it had no discretion to award less than $500. This explanation for the court\u2019s award is belied, however, by the court's own remarks, which reflect complete awareness that the amount is discretionary. <em>See </em>Transcript of Proceedings of May 2, 1983 at 46.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1417-8\">. Defendants also challenge the conclusory nature of the certification order. We agree that more detail would be preferable and, were the order all we had, might have remanded for greater specificity. However, we also have the parties\u2019 briefs, other orders and the trial record as well as transcripts of the numerous hearings. From these, it is clear that the court not only considered the Rule 23(b)(3) factors initially but also carefully re-evaluated them \u2014 and redefined the class \u2014 throughout the succeeding five-year period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1418-6\">. The only claimant whose immigration status has been expressly challenged is Federico Meza. We note that, although his visa restricted him to work in th\u00e9 Brownsville area, he nevertheless would be included in the group of those lawfully admitted to work in the United States.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1418-7\">. At the May 2, 1983 hearing, the court explicitly included Martinez and Quintero: \"I am going to redefine the class to include [the crew leaders].\u201d Transcript of Proceedings of May 2, 1983 at 22. The court also approved notice directed to: \u201cAgricultural field workers in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas and Mexico who were offered jobs in May and June 1977 to harvest melons in Presidio, Texas, but who were not taken to Presidio,\u201d R. 989, <em>see also </em>Transcript of Proceedings of May 2, 1983 at 22-23, and barred inquiry into the immigration status of the people who responded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1419-7\">. We similarly reject defendants\u2019 contention that they are somehow relieved of liability because some crew leaders allegedly also failed to comply with the statute. The district court correctly determined that defendants lack standing to raise this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-8\">Defendants also challenge the credibility of all of the crew leaders and suggest that we disapprove, on that ground, all of the claims of all of the claimants, particularly those in Martinez's crew and in the Jose Flores contingent of Camacho\u2019s crew. We have already substantially approved the court\u2019s findings in this extremely factual case; for the same reasons, we reject this credibility challenge here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-12\">We further find no merit in any of defendants\u2019 challenges to the facial validity of the claims forms themselves.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1419-13\">.

The most important point is the excessive nature of the judgment. The opinion of the majority neglects to report the amount of the judgment here awarded against the defendants. That judgment was in excess of $466,000 at the date of entry in April, 1985, making it by far the largest judgment ever awarded against farm labor contractors for violations of FLORA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The standards used by this court to test FLCRA awards, a comparison of awards in other cases for FLCRA violations, and the context of defendants\u2019 violations all overwhelmingly indicate that the district court exceeded the bounds of reason in its award of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-11\">In <em>Beliz v. W.H. McLeod &amp; Sons Packing Co., </em>765 F.2d 1317 (5th Cir.1985), this court noted several factors that should be considered in awarding FLCRA liquidated damages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1421-12\">Whether an award accomplishes this [deterrent] purpose, in addition to affording compensation, is determined by considering not only <em>the amount allowed to each plaintiff for each violation </em>but also <em>the total amount of the award, the nature and persistence </em>of the violations, the extent of the <em>defendant\u2019s culpability, damage awards in similar cases, the defendant\u2019s ability to prevent future violations of the act, the substantive or technical nature of the violations, and the circumstances of each </em>case____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1421-14\">765 F.2d at 1332. <em>See also Salazar-Calderon v. PVFA, </em>765 F.2d 1334, 1347 (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1356\">*1356</page-number>Cir.1985) (refusing to upset FLCRA damage award where \u201cthe district court supported its decision with factors that could properly be considered by it\u201d). According to these cases, the district court is required to articulate the factors that lead to its statutory damage award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-4\">A variety of factors must be considered, because FLCRA contains both \u201ctechnical\u201d and \u201csubstantive\u201d regulatory features whose impact upon the plaintiff farmworkers may vary widely. The deterrent potential of the award must be tempered with consideration of its realistic effect upon the farmer or contractor. As this court suggested in <em>Salazar-Calderon, </em>the success of farmers and farmworkers along the Rio Grande is intertwined and mutually dependent. Overly punitive assessment of FLCRA awards could endanger the already precarious state of domestic agriculture and thus indirectly harm the very people FLCRA was designed to protect. 765 F.2d at 1347.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-5\">The district court in this case awarded each plaintiff the maximum statutory penalty ($500.00) on each of four FLCRA violations, three of which were technical in nature. Contrary to the statement in the majority opinion that, \u201cthe record indicates that the court carefully considered these factors and determined that $500 was appropriate,\u201d I find no written or oral statement by the district judge concerning the egregious size of the damage award. This fact alone should require remand for a reassessment of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-6\">The only substantive FLCRA violation in this case is defendants\u2019 failure to comply with the promised terms of employment of the farm workers. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2044(b)(4). Although withdrawal of the offers of employment to the crewleaders is regrettable, it can hardly be denied that the facts underlying this violation were unique and not likely to be repeated. The Presidio Valley farmers were left hanging by the Federal Immigration and Naturalization Service while that federal agency dithered over whether to grant visas for seasonal non-immigrant laborers, who had always harvested the canteloupes in the past. Naturally, the farmers had to try to hire workers from any source in the event INS should deny clearance for workers from Ojinaga, Presidio\u2019s sister-city across the Rio Grande. This situation, which persisted within two or three weeks of harvest time, was desperate, requiring desperate measures on the part of Glen Martin and whoever else was recruiting for the farmers. Desperation does not justify failure to comply with the terms of employment, but it explains the need to hire domestic workers from the Valley and represents a unique set of conditions for the violation. Because of the INS-created turmoil, the \u201cnature and persistence of the violations,\u201d a factor mentioned in <em>Beliz, </em>does not, in my view, weigh heavily against the defendants. Even if the substantive FLCRA violation warranted the maximum penalty, however, the district court failed to distinguish between it and two technical violations (failure to provide written copies of the terms of employment and the representation of free housing), and penalized the defendants the maximum amount for those as well. By appellees\u2019 own admission, the actual damages suffered by each class member could not have exceeded $500. Record at 736. Moreover, the record establishes that many if not most class members mitigated damages by working for Defendant Griffin &amp; Brand when the Presidio employment prospect vanished. Yet, the district court made no attempt to explain why a huge dividend to the class was required to fulfill FLCRA\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-9\">The award in this case dwarfs other FLCRA judgments. An award of $500 per plaintiff per violation has been made in only one other germane case<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, <em>Wash</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1357\">*1357</page-number><em>ington v. Miller, </em>721 F.2d 797 (11th Cir.1983), but that case involved only seven plaintiffs and flagrant, uncontested, substantive FLORA violations (housing in violation of health codes, failure to keep required records, failure to disclose terms and conditions of employment, and failure to provide itemized earning statements). Moreover, the total award is also unparalleled. <em>See Beliz, supra </em>($200 per worker against the grower and $500 per worker against the FLORA contractor; 21 plaintiffs [approximately $14,700]); <em>Salazar-Calderon, supra </em>($15 per violation per class member, 5 violations, \u201cover 150 persons\u201d); <em>Washington, supra </em>(total FLORA award approximately $17,000); <em>Alvarez v. Longboy, </em>697 F.2d 1333 (9th Cir.1983) ($150 per plaintiff, 92 plaintiffs, total award: $13,800); <em>Alvarez v. Joan of Arc, Inc., </em>658 F.2d 1217 (7th Cir.1981) (total award approximately $30,000); <em>De la Fuente, supra </em>($100 per worker per season [approximately $115,000]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-5\">The unaccountable disparity between the award in the instant case and those in other FLORA cases is even more poignant because several factors suggest that the defendants should have received some leniency from the district court. As noted, the circumstances leading to the violation are not likely to recur. Unlike many FLORA cases where the existence of substantive FLORA violations was uncontested, <em>see, e.g., Washington, Rivera, Alverez, </em>liability was hotly contested in this case. Additionally, the record reveals that many of the plaintiffs suffered no actual damages from the defendants\u2019 conduct, as they were given other work by these defendants themselves.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The credibility of many of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims was also severely undermined by documentary evidence,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a fact that was noted by the district court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> No distinction was made between technical and substantive violations \u2014 both were penalized at the highest possible rate.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nor was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1358\">*1358</page-number>there any finding (or, for that matter, any evidence) that any of the defendants were likely to violate FLORA in the future unless some massive deterrent award was levied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-4\">Unlike the district court in <em>Salazar-Calderon, </em>which \u201cwas careful to outline the considerations that guided it in determining [damages],\u201d 765 F.2d at 1347, the district court\u2019s award here has no articulated basis. Perhaps that is because, tested by awards in other cases, it defies justification. Discretion can be abused, particularly if no attempt is made explicate one\u2019s exercise of discretion. It is no palliative, given <em>Beliz </em>and <em>Salazar-Calderon, </em>to conclude that the district court was within its discretion when, for all that we know from the record, the court may have made his award because he disliked the defendants or their counsel. The district court\u2019s failure to discriminate and failure even to articulate the standards for its award cry out for revision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-5\">My second disagreement with the majority lies in the scope of remand to reconsider PVFA\u2019s liability. The majority, correctly, finds no support in the record for vicarious liability of PVFA \u201cwithout some wrongful conduct of its own.\u201d Remand to obtain findings whether PVFA contributed to or had reason to know of Martin\u2019s violations of FLORA is therefore appropriate. The majority goes further than this, however, in opening for remand the question whether PVFA independently violated the provisions of FLORA. Quite simply, the district court found no such FLORA violation by PVFA, <em>and no party has raised that issue on appeal. </em>The district court\u2019s opinion and the parties\u2019 briefs discuss PVFA\u2019s liability only in terms of its vicarious responsibility for the acts of Glen Martin and/or Griffin and Brand. PVFA\u2019s independent culpability is thus being raised <em>sua sponte, </em>and without justification, by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-8\">Because I firmly believe that the district court\u2019s .damage award was irresponsibly punitive, I would Vacate and Remand. I would also decline to assist in making the plaintiffs\u2019 case on issues of PVFA liability which were not appealed. On these matters, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1421-15\">. Because this court reverses a portion of the judgment, the amount affirmed is actually $238,500 in statutory liquidated damages of $1,500 for each of 159 plaintiffs plus a possible award of attorney\u2019s fees. Even as modified, the judgment is several times larger than any comparable award I could find.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1422-7\">. Both <em>Espinoza v. Stokely-Van Camp, Inc., </em>641 F.2d 535, 539 (7th Cir.1981), and <em>Rivera v. Adams Packing Co., </em>707 F.2d 1278 (11th Cir.1983) also involved an award of $500 per plaintiff per violation, but these cases did so on the belief that FLCRA mandated this approach. This circuit has rejected this interpretation of FLCRA. <em>See Salazar-Calderon v. PVFA, supra. </em>However, like <em>Washington, </em>both of these cases involved flagrant, glaring FLCRA violations, the fact of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1357\">*1357</page-number>which does not appear to have been seriously questioned. As such, they are distinguishable from a case such as this where factual culpability was hotly contested and where the majority of the violations were technical in nature.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1423-7\">. For example, the Martinez crew worked for G &amp; B in Mission, Texas from June 1 until June 19, a period that they would have been working in Presidio. The Sanchez crew also worked for G &amp; B from June 2 until June 16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1423-8\">. Juanita Martinez testified that Glen Martin had offered her crew work in Presidio beginning June 9, 1977, that she and her crew had no work from the end of May until the beginning of July, and that she had actually assembled a crew and was ready to leave for Presidio on June 9. On cross-examination, however, she was confronted with payroll records, signed by Mrs. Martinez, that showed that her crew worked in Mission for G &amp; B from June 1 until June 19. [Tr. 539 <em>et </em>seq.] Faced with this evidence, Mrs. Martinez claimed that she had made a mistake and that she and her crew were to go to Presidio on <em>July </em>9, a date when the Presidio harvest would have been long over. Crispin Sanchez testified that Martin recruited him and his crew during that last days of May for the Presidio harvest, that he spent the first two weeks of June without work, during which time he was getting his crew ready to go to Presidio, and that he was ready to go to Presidio on June 13. However, payroll records (BX 7-11) clearly show that he and his crew were working for G &amp; B from June 2 until at least June 16, seriously undermining Sanchez\u2019s claims that he was planning to go to Presidio and that he was getting a crew together at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-12\">The Flores crew does not appear to have existed at all until the hearing on damages. There was no evidence that Flores even met with Martin, and thus there was no basis for the district court to hold that the Flores \"crew\u201d had any agreement with Martin. Plaintiff-appellees case on Flores is instead based on the testimony at the damages hearing that <em>Camacho </em>told Flores to get 20-25 workers together. As Camacho testified at trial that Martin asked him to get together 50-60 hands [Tr. 307], that he, Camacho, was planning to take 53 or 54 hands to Presidio [Tr. 313], and that the plaintiffs\u2019 original petition alleged that the Camacho crew was 55 workers, of which Flores was only a member, Camacho\u2019s later claim that he was going to take 75 workers, 50 of which were Camacho\u2019s and 25 of which were to be Flores', is so utterly contradicted by his own earlier testimony and pleadings as to render it unbelievable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1423-13\">. \"I don\u2019t know that he [plaintiffs\u2019 attorney] wants to impeach her [Martinez] any more than she is already impeached.\u201d Tr. 547.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1423-14\">. <em>E.g. </em>PVF was held liable to each plaintiff for $500 for using PVFA, an unregistered farm labor contractor.

It is interesting to note than in <em>Salazar-Calderon, supra, </em>PVFA\u2019s failure to register as a FLCRA contractor was termed a technical violation that gave rise to liquidated damages of $15 per plaintiff. Yet, a nearly-identical violation was penalized at a rate 33 times higher by the district court in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
