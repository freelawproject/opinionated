In this case, however, we reach what would appear to be the unlikely conclusion that a provider of services may recover from the Medicare program a portion of the costs of educational services for children. This holding merits some explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1543\">*1543</page-number>I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1609-5\">Charter Peachford Hospital, Inc. (\u201cCharter Peachford\u201d), is a psychiatric hospital which is certified to be a \u201cprovider\u201d of services under the Medicare Program. Further, it provides its services to the general community. As part of its treatment plan, Charter Peachford provides an educational program for patients who are eighteen years old or younger. Charter Peach-ford employs teacher-therapists to teach academic subjects and, as to members of the hospital\u2019s multi-disciplinary treatment team, provide various direct therapeutic services to its minor patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b1609-6\">Charter Peachford sought reimbursement under the Medicare Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395 <em>et seq. </em>(1982 and Supp. II 1984), for part of the teacher-therapists\u2019 salaries for the 1980 fiscal year.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The \u201cfiscal intermediary,\u201d authorized by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the \u201cSecretary\u201d) to make such reimbursement pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395h (1982 and Supp. II 1984), denied reimbursement for any part of the educational costs. Although Charter Peachford did not originally claim reimbursement for the salaries in its 1980 cost report, it later appealed the intermediary\u2019s disallowance of these costs to the Provider Reimbursement Review Board (\u201cPRRB\u201d). After conducting an evidentiary hearing, the PRRB affirmed the decision of the fiscal intermediary, holding that educational costs were specifically disallowed by section 2104.5 of the Provider Reimbursement Manual (HIM-15). Alternatively, the PRRB held that even if the educational costs were allowable, they were \u201cancillary costs\u201d rather than \u201croutine costs.\u201d Because no Medicare beneficiaries received services under the educational program, none of the costs could be reimbursed. The Deputy Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, acting on behalf of the Secretary, affirmed the PRRB\u2019s decision on both grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1609-8\">Charter Peachford subsequently brought this action in district court contending that the Secretary\u2019s decision should be reversed because it was not supported by substantial evidence. The case was referred to a magistrate who recommended that the Secretary\u2019s decision be affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded for calculation of the percent of salary costs attributable to therapeutic activities. The magistrate\u2019s recommendation was based on three findings: (1) the cost of Charter Peachford\u2019s purely educational program was not eligible for reimbursement because the program could not be used by Medicare beneficiaries; (2) the Secretary\u2019s conclusion that the teacher-therapists\u2019 time was spent entirely on education-related activities was not supported by substantial evidence and, in fact, the evidence showed that approximately 70 percent of their time was spent in therapy-related activities; and (3) the Secretary\u2019s conclusion that the cost of any time attributable to therapy would be ancillary was not supported by substantial evidence. The district court rejected the magistrate\u2019s recommendation and affirmed the Secretary\u2019s decision, holding that the Secretary\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1609-9\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1609-10\">Judicial review of a decision of the Deputy Administrator is governed by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo(f) (1982 and Supp. II 1984) which incorporates the standards of Section 706 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706 (1982). <em>Carmway Methodist Medical Center v. Heckler, </em>753 F.2d 1006, 1009 (11th Cir.1985). An agency\u2019s decision must not be overturned unless it is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, not in accordance with law, or unsupported by substantial evidence in the record taken as a whole. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1609-11\">In exercising its review of legal questions, the court is required to accord substantial deference to the interpretation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1544\">*1544</page-number>of an agency charged with the administration of a statute. <em>See, e.g., Connecticut Department of Income Maintenance v. Heckler, </em>471 U.S. 524, 105 S.Ct. 2210, 2215, 85 L.Ed.2d 577 (1985). An agency\u2019s interpretation of a regulation it has been authorized to promulgate is also entitled to great deference and must be upheld unless it is unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious or inconsistent with the statute. <em>Carraway Methodist Medical Center, </em>753 F.2d at 1009.</p>\n<p id=\"b1610-4\">III. THE MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAM</p>\n<p id=\"b1610-5\">This appeal involves Part A of the Medicare Program, Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395 <em>et seq. </em>Part A provides hospital insurance benefits for services rendered by a \u201cprovider of services,\u201d as defined in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(u) (Supp. II 1984), including hospitals. Providers are entitled to be reimbursed for the reasonable cost of furnishing covered services to Medicare patients or, if lower, the customary charges for such services. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395f(b) (1982 and Supp. II 1984).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The statute defines \u201creasonable cost\u201d as \u201cthe cost actually incurred, excluding therefrom any part of incurred cost found to be unnecessary in the efficient delivery of needed health services\u201d as determined under the Secretary\u2019s regulations. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(v)(l)(A) (Supp. II 1984). The Secretary is directed to establish methods for determining reasonable cost that will account for both direct and indirect costs and prevent cross-subsidization \u2014 that is, not shift the cost of furnishing care to Medicare beneficiaries onto other patients or vice versa. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1610-6\">Under the Secretary\u2019s regulations, Medicare reimbursement involves a two-step determination of: (1) the provider\u2019s \u201callowable costs\u201d for supplying services and (2) the proportion of those costs that is to be borne by Medicare. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.403(a) (1985). Separate principles, set out in the regulations, govern each of the two steps. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1610-9\">In determining the total amount of a provider\u2019s \u201callowable costs,\u201d the regulations recognize \u201c[a]ll necessary and proper expenses of an institution in the production of services,\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.402(a) (1985), subject to specific limitations. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.451(a) (1985). \u201cNecessary and proper costs are costs which are appropriate and helpful in developing and maintaining the operation of patient care facilities and activities. They are usually costs which are common and accepted occurrences in the field of the provider\u2019s activity.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.451(b)(2) (1985). The following types of costs are deemed unallowable: \u201camounts not related to patient care, specifically not reimbursable under the program, or flowing from the provision of luxury items or services____\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.451(c)(3) (1985). The regulations repeat the statutory admonition that any determination of the reasonable cost of services must be based on costs related to the care of Medicare beneficiaries, 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.451(c)(3) (1985) and that costs should not be shifted between Medicare and non-Medicare patients. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.402(a) (1985). Nonetheless, the definition of <em>allowable </em>costs, the first step toward determining <em>reasonable </em>cost, is not limited to services related to Medicare patient care. In effect, the determination of allowable costs results in a large pool of costs related to patient care. The second step of the formula, apportionment, then narrows that amount to approximate the cost of supplying services to Medicare beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1610-12\">The share of total allowable costs to be borne by the Medicare program is \u201cdetermined in accordance with principles relat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1545\">*1545</page-number>ing to apportionment of cost.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.403(a) (1985). In furtherance of the statutory mandate against cross-subsidization, the regulations endeavor to use methods of apportioning costs that \u201cto the extent reasonably possible, result in the program\u2019s share of a provider\u2019s total allowable costs being the same as the program\u2019s share of the provider\u2019s total services.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.403(b) (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1611-4\">In this case, the \u201cdepartmental method\u201d was used to apportion allowable costs. The departmental method requires two separate calculations depending upon whether the particular allowable costs are characterized as \u201croutine services\u201d or \u201cancillary services.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.452(a)(l)(i) (1985). \u201cRoutine services\u201d are the \u201cregular room, dietary, and nursing services, minor medical and surgical supplies, and the use of equipment and facilities for which a separate charge is not customarily made.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.452(b) (1985). \u201cAncillary services\u201d are \u201cservices for which charges are customarily made in addition to routine services.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1611-5\">The amount of reimbursement for routine services is calculated by multiplying the average cost of a day of general routine care (the \u201caverage per diem\u201d cost) by the number of Medicare beneficiary inpatient days. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.452(a)(l)(i), (b), (e)(1) (1985).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The average per diem cost is determined by dividing the total inpatient general routine service costs (net of the private room cost differential) by the total number of inpatient general routine days. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.452(b) (1985). This method may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1611-6\">Total Routine Service Costs \u2014 Average Per Diem Cost Total Inpatient Days</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1611-8\">Average Per Medicare _ Provider</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1611-9\">Diem Cost Inpatient Days Reimbursement</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1611-10\">This procedure thus employs an averaging principle which distributes routine costs without regard to whether a particular routine cost is associated with a Medicare beneficiary or whether the Medicare beneficiary\u2019s use of routine services is above or below average.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1611-14\">The calculation of a routine average cost per diem assumes that all patients receive roughly the same services per day at roughly the same cost per patient. Everyone knows that this is not true in individual cases, but for reasons of administrative simplicity it is assumed that the extreme divergences from the mean balance out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1611-15\"><em>Saint Mary of Nazareth Hospital Center v. Schweiker, </em>718 F.2d 459, 471 (D.C.Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1611-16\">The costs for ancillary services, on the other hand, are apportioned between Medicare and non-Medicare patients based on the percentage of the total charges for a particular ancillary department that is attributable to usage by Medicare beneficiaries. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.452(a)(l)(i), (b), (e)(1) (1985). This formula may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1611-17\">Beneficiary Charges Department Provider -x - Total Patient Charges Cost Reimbursement</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1611-20\">This formula assumes a correlation between charges and costs and determines the Medicare share based on actual, rather than average, usage of a particular service.</p>\n<p id=\"b1611-21\">IV. CHARTER PEACHFORD\u2019S EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM</p>\n<p id=\"b1611-22\">Using the departmental method, outlined above, Charter Peachford is entitled to a percentage of the costs of its educational program if they are allowable costs for routine services.</p>\n<p id=\"b1611-23\">A. <em>Teacher-Therapist Salaries as Allowable Costs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1611-24\">Costs are \u201callowable\u201d under the Secretary\u2019s regulations, if they are necessary and proper for patient care as well as common and accepted occurrences in the provider\u2019s field. Charter Peachford presented uncontradicted evidence that the school program is an essential and integral part of its treatment plan for children and adolescents. In particular, Charter Peach-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1546\">*1546</page-number>ford\u2019s expert witnesses testified that school programs are necessary for psychiatric hospitals to provide adequate clinical care for their young patients and that the teachers are actively involved in the therapeutic treatment of the patients' psychological and emotional problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b1612-4\">The expert and lay witnesses described the educational program\u2019s importance as a framework for therapy and some of the differences between Charter Peachford\u2019s program and other schools: For example, the teacher-therapists are housed in the unit with the children, class work is secondary to therapeutic progress and a student\u2019s time in Charter Peachford\u2019s program is not necessarily credited as full-time public school attendance. Moreover, Dr. Palomki testified that educational programs, such as Charter Peachford\u2019s, are required for accreditation by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals (\u201cJCAH\u201d), and that the Medicare program requires psychiatric hospital providers to be JCAH accredited. <em>See </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.1036 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1612-5\">The Secretary did not present any evidence to the contrary and, it seems, implicitly concedes that Charter Peachford\u2019s educational program is related to patient care. Instead, the Secretary claims these costs are not allowable because they are not related to the care of Medicare program beneficiaries. The Secretary argues that his position is supported by the principle against cross-subsidization. Specifically, the Secretary claims these costs are excluded by 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.451(c)(3) (1985) which states that \u201cwhere the provider\u2019s operating costs include amounts ... specifically not reimbursable under the program ... such amounts are not allowable costs.\u201d Because the statute prohibits cross-subsidization, the Secretary argues that costs for services which are not applicable to program beneficiaries are specifically not reimbursable under the Medicare program. The quoted restriction, however, is also contained in sections concerning services provided to Medicare beneficiaries. <em>See, e.g., </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.440(d)(2) (1985). Therefore, the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of this language is not consistent with its use in the regulations. More significantly, the Medicare regulations contain a list of specific exclusions. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 405.308, 405.311-315 (1985). None of the listed exclusions applies to Charter Peachford\u2019s educational program. Thus, the regulations do not specifically exclude these services from allowable costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1612-9\">The Secretary primarily relies on section 2104.5 of the Provider Reimbursement Manual (HIM-15) which was also the basis for the PRRB decision. Section 2104.5 provides that: \u201cThe costs attributable to vocational, scholastic, or similarly oriented training activities conducted by providers on behalf of patients are not allowable costs. For example, costs incurred by a psychiatric facility in operating an elementary or secondary school for patients are unallowable costs.\u201d The Secretary claims that section 2104.5, which disallows costs related to patient care, is a valid interpretation of the statutory and regulatory prohibition against cross-subsidization.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1612-10\">The Provider Reimbursement Manual is a compilation of interpretive rules which have not been promulgated as regulations pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act. As such, it is not controlling. <em>See, e.g., Daughters of Miriam Center for the Aged v. Mathews, </em>590 F.2d 1250, 1258 (3d Cir.1978). An agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations is entitled to defer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1547\">*1547</page-number>ence, but the interpretation must comply with the regulations the agency has promulgated. <em>See e.g., North Georgia Building and Construction Trades Council v. Goldschmidt, </em>621 F.2d 697, 710 (5th Cir. 1980). Thus, if Manual section 2104.5 is inconsistent with the regulatory method for calculating reasonable cost, the Secretary\u2019s interpretation must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-5\">Despite the Secretary\u2019s reliance on the principle against cross-subsidization, the Medicare regulations do not confine allowable costs to those services applicable to Medicare beneficiaries. Likewise, the regulations do not permit \u201cdirect costing\u201d of services that are used exclusively by Medicare beneficiaries. <em>See e.g., Psychiatric Institute of Washington, D.C., Inc. v. Schweiker, </em>669 F.2d 812 (D.C.Cir.1981) (Gerontological Treatment Center Classified as routine care area). As the Ninth Circuit noted in response to the Secretary\u2019s Medicare usage argument in a similar case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajt0\">For the exclusion of these services from \u201croutine costs\u201d to be consistent with the Medicare Act\u2019s prohibition on cost-shifting between Medicare and non-Medicare patients, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(v)(l)(A) (1982), the costs of analogous services used primarily by Medicare patients and infrequently, if at all, by the hospitalized children would also have to be excluded, and allocated on a usage basis. During the time that the children received educational services, elderly patients may be involved in attendant-supervised occupational or recreational therapy, including playing checkers or chess, sewing, weaving, or attending movies. Medicare Health Insurance Manual No. 10 \u00a7 210.-9(D) (Rev. 260 July 1981 &amp; Rev. 310 Aug. 1982) expressly provides reimbursement for these activities, and their costs are reimbursed as \u201croutine costs.\u201d The Secretary does not agree that these occupational or recreational therapy services\u2014 or any other services used heavily by Medicare patient \u2014 should be apportioned on a usage basis. Accordingly, the Secretary\u2019s argument constitutes an attempt to rely on her regulations and apportionment system when they reduce her reimbursement liability, and to ignore the procedures mandated by her apportionment system when they increase her reimbursement liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1613-7\"><em>Vista Hill Foundation, Inc. v. Heckler, </em>767 F.2d 556, 565 (9th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-8\">Although it appears inappropriate for Medicare funds to be used to pay for a part of classroom education for Charter Peach-ford\u2019s juvenile patients, the determination of allowable costs is for all practical purposes, unrelated to the specific services actually provided to Medicare patients. Rather than identifying the specific treatment and services provided to program beneficiaries and basing reimbursement on the costs associated therewith, the Secretary chose to calculate reasonable cost by presuming an average use of the entire \u201cpot\u201d of routine services. The Secretary willingly admits that, in a typical hospital situation, pediatric services are poured into the pot along with all other routine services to determine the average per diem cost. Conversely, it is understood that a hospital may provide a number of routine services that could not be expected to be used by children. In other words, when the pot is filled, it may contain, in addition to services used by all ages, the costs of some services provided only to older patients and some services provided only to juveniles. The averaging technique is meant to work out fairly for the individual providers. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.402(b)(3) (1985). Individual exclusion of the cost of services not used by Medicare beneficiaries but inclusion of services used only by Medicare beneficiaries, would destroy the balance upon which the regulatory averaging principle depends and result in cross-subsidization to the provider\u2019s detriment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1613-9\">The Secretary established the apportionment system and is free to designate another method of calculating costs if the current system appears to shift costs disproportionately to or from the Medicare program. For the present, we hold that Charter Peachford\u2019s teacher-therapists\u2019 salaries are allowable costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1548\">*1548</page-number>B. <em>Routine or Ancillary Costs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1614-4\">Alternatively, the Secretary claims that even if some of the teachers\u2019 time was spent in therapeutic activities, this cost should be treated as ancillary because of the educational program\u2019s \u201cunique nature\u201d and lack of Medicare utilization. Since ancillary costs are apportioned on the basis of actual Medicare utilization, not the averaging technique, none of the cost of Charter Peachford\u2019s educational program would be reimbursable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-5\">Medicare utilization is not the proper test: without elaborating, the PRRB found that the \u201cschool program services did not meet the definition of routine services in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.452(d)(2) [sic].\u201d Costs are ancillary if they are billed separately from routine services. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.452(b) (1985). The Secretary argues that he is not limited to that definition, but may consider other factors to prevent \u201can inequitable apportionment of costs to the program.\u201d Provider Reimbursement Manual (HIM-15) \u00a7 2203. In addition, the Secretary claims that Provider Reimbursement Manual (HIM-15) \u00a7 2202.8 classifies all therapy services as ancillary, not merely those that are specifically enumerated. Section 2203, however, states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_7\">\u201c[a] separate ancillary charge for a particular item or service other than those listed as ancillary in \u00a7 2202.8 is not recognized,\u201d and the cost of the item or service is not included in an ancillary cost center, where the common or established practice of providers of the same class (hospital or SNF) in the same state is to include the item or service in the routine service charge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1614-6\">The Milieu therapy services in Charter Peachford\u2019s educational program are not listed in section 2202.8. The evidence shows that Charter Peachford and other hospitals do not customarily make a separate charge for educational services. Thus, under the Secretary\u2019s own regulations, the cost of the teacher-therapists\u2019 salaries is routine rather than ancillary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-7\">We do not agree that, under the evidence in this case, costs will be inequitably apportioned to the Medicare program if the costs in this case are considered routine rather than ancillary. Patients, both young and old, are admitted to Charter Peachford for treatment of mental or emotional disturbances. Younger patients may receive much of their therapy in an educational setting while older patients receive therapy in other settings. Thus, treating the teacher-therapists\u2019 salaries as routine costs will not result in an inequitable apportionment of these costs to the Medicare program.</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-9\">The decision of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-10\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1609-7\">. Charter Peachford claimed these costs as allowable costs for routine services. Of the $157,-976 total cost for these services for the 1980 fiscal year, Medicare\u2019s share would be approximately $3,100.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1610-7\">. The cost reimbursement mechanism and procedures described above were in effect during the period at issue in this litigation. Effective October 1, 1983, Congress provided for phase-in of a new prospective payment system. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ww <em>etseq. </em>(Supp. II 1984).

In a similar case, the Secretary used Manual section 2104.5 to support the claim that the educational services at issue were not a necessary part of therapy. In response, the Ninth Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1612-7\">As the Secretary concedes, the manual provision is not evidence. Moreover, we see no reason why we should accept her opinion, as expressed in the manual provision, rather than that of the medical expert.
