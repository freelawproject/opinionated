ROBINSON, III.</p>\n<author id=\"b1273-18\">SPOTTSWOOD W. ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1273-19\">This case is before us on appeal from a summary judgment in favor of the United States Postal Service immunizing from mandatory disclosure -parts of records sought by W. Lee Birch under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The records in question were compiled during an investigation uncovering mailings under a third-class permit of materials not encompassed thereby. The District Court ruled<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that the portions withheld were intercepted by FOIA Exemption 7(D) as \u201cinvestigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes\u201d whose production would \u201cdisclose the identity of a confidential source.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-20\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-21\">Birch is executive director of the National Taxidermists Association (NTA). In 1980, the Postal Service denied his application for a permit enabling NTA to mail its materials at special third-class postage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>rates.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, however, the National Taxidermists Hall of Fame and Museum, on Birch\u2019sapplication once again, was granted such a permit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1274-4\">About two years later, the Postal Service received a letter from a United States Attorney suggesting that Birch was mailing NTA materials under the Hall of Fame permit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The letter stated that a complaint had been received from an NTA member alleging this misuse of the permit,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that the informant had furnished specimens supporting the accusation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1274-5\">Surveillance of subsequent mailings under the permit revealed that the charge was true and that the practice was continuing. Thereafter, the Postal Service informed Birch and the Hall of Fame that postage for all improper mailings had been recalculated and that some $2,200 was owed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This amount represented the difference between postage at the permit rate and postage that should have been paid.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1274-6\">Birch then submitted a FOIA request for all records pertaining to the permit, the organizations and himself.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Postal Service eventually released 124 pages of documents, but deleted data from some of these pages and retained five additional pages in their entirety.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The bases advanced for this action were FOIA Exemptions 7(C) and 7(D),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which safeguard from mandatory disclosure, under specified conditions, investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes. Exemption 7(C) does so when public release of the records would \u201cconstitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Exemption 7(D) is triggered into operation when disclosure would reveal the \u201cidentity of a confidential source.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Uncontested Postal Service affidavits avowed that the portions withheld consisted solely of information that could be used to identify the NTA member who had reported the mailing abuse, including his name, the name of his agent<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and their addresses.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1274-18\">Birch endeavored to upset the agency\u2019s disposition in the District Court, which deemed the withholding appropriate under Exemption 7(D).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The court held that the agency activity generating the records was an \u201cinvestigation,\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and that the records were \u201ccompiled for law enforcement purposes\u201d because the investigation \u201c \u2018focus[ed] directly on specifically alleged illegal acts ... which could, if proved, result in civil or criminal sanctions.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Thus, the court concluded, the parts withheld were exempt because their production would divulge the identity of a confidential source.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1274-19\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-20\">FOIA pursues a policy of broad disclosure of governmental records to \u201censure an informed citizenry, vital to the function<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>ing of a democratic society.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Recognizing, however, that harm could result from a sweeping disclosure requirement in some areas, Congress incorporated into FOIA a series of exemptions enabling agencies to refuse requests for public access to specified types of information.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The agency bears the burden of setting forth \u201ca relatively detailed justification\u201d for assertion of an exemption,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and must demonstrate to a reviewing court that records withheld are clearly exempt.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1275-4\">In this court, the Postal Service relies solely upon Exemption 7(D), which shields \u201cinvestigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such records would ... disclose the identity of a confidential source____\u201d <footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The litigants present several issues, and the course we must steer in resolving them is well-charted. The Supreme Court has instructed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAD\">[t]he language of ... Exemption [7] indicates that judicial review of an asserted Exemption 7 privilege requires a two-part inquiry. First, a requested document must be shown to have been an investigatory record \u201ccompiled for law enforcement purposes.\u201d If so, the agency must demonstrate that release of the material would have one of the six results specified in the Act.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1275-6\">We turn, then, to consider whether the Postal Service\u2019s retention of portions of the records requested survives that examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-9\">The threshold requirement of Exemption 7 \u2014 that the data sought are \u201cinvestigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes\u201d \u2014 demands careful analysis of the authorized activities of the agency involved, both generally \"and with particular reference to the matter to which the records relate. At the outset, it is important to distinguish an agency serving principally the cause of criminal law enforcement from one having an admixture of law enforcement and administrative functions.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> While this distinction is not drawn explicitly in the text of Exemption 7 or its legislative history, this court and others have recognized the need to differentiate the criteria guiding the threshold decision on Exemption 7 claims on the basis of the primary mission the agency pursues.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1275-10\">In <em>Rural Housing Alliance v. United States Department of Agriculture, </em><footnotemark>30</footnotemark> we articulated the standard for evaluating contentions that records of a mixed-function agency are \u201cinvestigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes.\u201d We realized that application of a broad or imprecise construction of this provision to such an agency could \u201cswallow[ ] up\u201d FOIA and undercut its central goal of public access,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> since any routine monitoring \u201cconceivably could result\u201d in imposition of penalties.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>We held that in the context of a mixed-function agency Exemption 7 embraces only \u201cinvestigations which focus directly on specifically alleged illegal acts, illegal acts of particular identified officials, acts which could, if proved, result in civil or criminal sanctions.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> We emphasized that the purpose of the investigation was \u201cthe crucial factor;\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> \u2014 that, to cross Exemption 7\u2019s threshold, the information at issue must have been gathered in the course of \u201can inquiry as to an identifiable possible violation of law.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1276-4\">In <em>Pratt v. </em>Webster,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> on the other hand, we held that claims of satisfaction of Exemption 7's threshold requirement call for less rigorous judicial scrutiny when the principal function of the involved agency is criminal law enforcement.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> We reiterated the <em>Rural Housing Alliance </em>standard and, for its application to such agencies, reformulated it to take into account their special features. \u201cIn order to pass the FOIA Exemption 7 threshold,\u201d we said, a criminal law enforcement agency</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5Rp\">must establish that its investigatory activities are realistically based on a legitimate concern that federal laws have been or may be violated or that national security may be breached[,] [and] [e]ither of these concerns must have some plausible basis and have a rational connection to the object of the agency\u2019s investigation.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1276-12\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-13\">Since the Postal Service obviously is a mixed-function agency, <em>Rural Housing Alliance </em>informs our consideration of the question whether the Postal Service\u2019s withholding of parts of the sought-after records has navigated successfully across the threshold of Exemption 7.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> We think that beyond peradventure it has.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-14\">The Postal Service\u2019s surveillance begetting the requested records was prompted by and based upon information transmitted to it by a United States Attorney after receipt from a member of NTA. From the beginning, the Postal Service concentrated its vigil exclusively upon mailings utilizing the Hall of Fame permit to see whether there was any misuse. It therefore is clear that the records accumulated were products of an \u201cinvestigation\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> focused directly on specific activities by specific participants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-15\">It seems equally clear that these records were \u201ccompiled for law enforcement purposes.\u201d We are mindful that the investigation conducted by the Postal Service resulted only in an assessment of slightly more than $2,000, representing the difference between the aggregate amount actually paid for mailings of NTA materials under the Hall of Fame permit and the aggregate amount that should have been paid as postage for those mailings at the proper rate. We are also advertent to Birch\u2019s argument that this assessment had no punitive aspect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>and involved no more than satisfaction of a debt owed to the Postal Service, with the consequence that no law-enforcement purposes can be attributed to the investigation.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Even assuming that the assessment was not a sanction imparting a law enforcement element \u2014 a question we do not decide \u2014 we find Birch\u2019s position untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-5\">An NTA member reported that Birch was improperly mailing NTA materials, concealed in envelopes bearing only a reproduction of the Hall of Fame\u2019s letterhead, under the Hall of Fame\u2019s third-class mailing permit.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The Postal Service investigator assigned to the case felt that misuse of the Hall of Fame permit so soon after its issuance raised a suspicion that the permit was obtained for the purpose of avoiding the higher postal rates applicable to NTA.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The activities under investigation, then, if they actually occurred, would not only violate postal regulations,<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> but would also implicate criminal statutes penalizing any inclusion of higher-class mail matter in that of a lower class,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> and any concealment of material information from the Postal Service.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> The Second Circuit has held that each of these two provisions was violated by placement in the mails of packages labeled \u201cbooks\u201d but actually containing nylon stockings.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> We would agree, and are unable to exonerate the mailings in the case at bar. The Postal Service has statutory authority to investigate and enforce laws regarding use of mails and other postal matters,<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> and, given that Birch\u2019s conduct could have led to imposition of criminal sanctions, Exemption 7 applies regardless of the actual outcome of the investigation.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1212\">*1212</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-4\">Remaining for consideration is the question whether the Postal Service met the second prong of the <em>Abramson </em>test: whether, with \u201cinvestigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes,\u201d their release would produce one or more of the consequences specified in Exemption 7.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Since the Postal Service endeavors to justify withholding of parts of those records on the basis of Exemption 7(D), the relevant inquiry is whether divulgence of those parts would \u201cdisclose the identity of a confidential source.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1278-5\">Exemption 7(D) was intended to protect the identity of a person supplying information during the course of an investigation pursuant to an express or implied assurance of confidentiality.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Through submission of affidavits and production of records for <em>in camera </em>review, the Postal Service demonstrated that release of the information withheld would reveal the identity of the NTA member who exposed Birch's abuse of the Hall of Fame\u2019s mailing privilege. Since the informant requested and received express assurances of confidentiality prior to assisting the investigation,<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> he or she was a \u201cconfidential source.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AelQ\">Birch makes' two arguments in an attempt to avoid these conclusions. He first contends that revelation of the informant\u2019s identity would result in mere embarrassment rather than physical harm, and from this Birch deduces that the informant was not a \u201cconfidential source\u201d within the contemplation of Exemption 7(D).<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> This position has glaring weaknesses, not the least of which is that it misinterprets the paramount objective of Exemption 7(D), which is to keep open the Government\u2019s channels of confidential information.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Potential embarrassment, as well as apprehension of physical harm, may discourage a confidential source from communicating information, and thus result in loss of the benefit of that information to the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-11\">Birch further contends that the identity of the informant\u2019s \u201cagent\u201d is unprotected because the agent, unlike the informant, received no assurance of confidentiality.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> That argument misses the point. As the Postal Service has shown, information identifying the agent was withheld, not because the agent was himself or herself a confidential source, but because the agent\u2019s identity could be used to identify the informant.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Information serving to identify the agent was therefore properly withheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-12\">The judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-13\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1273-11\">. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1273-12\">. <em>Birch </em>v. <em>United States Postal Serv., </em>Civ.
