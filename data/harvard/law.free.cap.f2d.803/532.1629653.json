We hold that such extra-contractual damages cannot be recovered, and hence we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"AAj\">I</p>\n<p id=\"AQZ\">Plaintiff-Appellee, Bernice Sokol, is the widow of Defendant-Appellant Jacob Bernstein\u2019s partner in medical practice. She is the sole beneficiary of her husband\u2019s pension plan, which Bernstein administered. Sometime in early 1982, Bernstein ordered the plan\u2019s trustee to distribute to Sokol the benefits in her account. The district court found that this disbursement violated an express written agreement dated December 6, 1979, to the effect that the funds would be distributed to Sokol only upon her request.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Realizing that the disbursement would create adverse tax consequences for her, Sokol requested on or about May 21, 1982, that Bernstein redeposit the funds. Bernstein refused to redeposit the funds unless Sokol agreed to waive her claims for breach of fiduciary duty against him, and agreed to pay administrative fees attributable to her portion of the plan. On July 25, 1982, Bernstein redeposited the funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Sokol then brought this action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California under ERISA, and after a two-day bench trial, the district court awarded Sokol $1,996.29 for loss of interest stemming from the wrongful failure to redeposit funds, $4,000 in medical expenses and damages for emotional distress, and $5,150 in attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Preliminarily, we must determine whether the district court erred when it held that Bernstein breached his fiduciary duty toward Sokol. We have held that a trustee\u2019s actions may be reversed when they are arbitrary, capricious, or made in bad faith, not supported by substantial evidence, or erroneous on a question of law. <em>Elser v. I.A.M. National Pension Fund, </em>684 F.2d 648, 654 (9th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 813, 104 S.Ct. 67, 78 L.Ed.2d 82 (1983); <em>Fentron Industries, Inc. v. National Shopmen Pension Fund, </em>674 F.2d 1300, 1307 (9th Cir.1982). Here, the trustee\u2019s violation of an express contract requiring beneficiary approval of disbursements, along with his failure to redeposit the funds promptly upon the plaintiff/beneficiary\u2019s request, constitute sufficient evidence for the district court to make a finding of fact and thus conclude that Bernstein acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner, and on this point we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b610-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-13\">We turn now to the core question of whether a beneficiary to a pension plan can recover damages for emotional distress under ERISA. In <em>Russell v. Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co., </em>722 F.2d 482, 490 (9th Cir.1983), we held that a beneficiary of a pension plan could recover damages for mental or emotional distress under \u00a7 409 of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1109. The Supreme Court reversed, stating that \u201cwe do not find in \u00a7 409 express authority for an award of extra-contractual damages to a beneficiary.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Russell, </em>473 U.S. 134, 105 S.Ct. 3085, 3092, 87 L.Ed.2d 96 (1985) (hereinafter cited as <em>\u201cRussell </em>\u201d). It is important to note that, mechanically applied to the present case, <em>Russell </em>is not dispositive; the district court herein relied on \u00a7 502(a)(3) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(3), rather than on \u00a7 409.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, a textual exegesis of the <em>Russell </em>opinion, combined with careful examination of the statute\u2019s structure and legislative history, compels the conclusion that damages for emotional distress are unavailable under \u00a7 502(a)(3) as well as under \u00a7 409.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-15\">Section 409, which the <em>Russell </em>Court construed and relied upon, states in pertinent part:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>(a) Any person who is a fiduciary with respect to a plan who breaches any of the responsibilities, obligations, or duties imposed upon fiduciaries by this sub-chapter shall be personally liable to make good to such plan any losses to the plan resulting from each such breach, and to restore to such plan any profits of such fiduciary which have been made through use of assets of the plan by the fiduciary, and shall be subject to such other <em>equitable or remedial relief as the court may deem appropriate, </em>including removal of such fiduciary____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">(Emphasis added.) Section 502, relied upon by the district court in the present case, states in pertinent part:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aut\">(a) <em>Persons empowered to bring a civil action</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-6\">A civil action may be brought\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-7\">(3) by a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary (A) to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this subchapter or the terms of the plan, or (B) <em>to obtain other appropriate equitable relief </em>(i) to redress such violations or (ii) to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">The <em>Russell </em>majority held squarely that a beneficiary may not recover extra-contractual damages, including damages for emotional distress, under \u00a7 409(a)\u2019s provision for appropriate \u201cequitable\u201d relief. However, as Sokol stresses, Justice Stevens\u2019 majority opinion (joined by Justices Powell, Rehnquist, and O\u2019Connor, and Chief Justice Burger), expressly disclaimed any determination of whether \u00a7 502(a)(3)\u2019s similar provision for \u201cappropriate equitable relief\u201d authorizes recovery of extra-contractual damages. <em>Russell, </em>105 S.Ct. at 3089, n. 5. Justice Brennan\u2019s separate opinion concurring in the judgment, joined by Justices Marshall, White and Blackmun, also emphasized that the majority opinion did not expressly decide the availability <em>vel non </em>of damages for emotional distress under \u00a7 502(a)(3). <em>Id. </em>at 3095. Urging this Court to discount footnote 5 of the majority opinion and the admonitions of Justice Brennan\u2019s separate opinion, Bernstein argues that the rationale of the majority opinion in <em>Russell </em>requires the conclusion that damages for emotional distress cannot be recovered by a beneficiary under \u00a7 502(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-19\">There is considerable support in <em>Russell </em>for the proposition that <em>no </em>provision in ERISA authorizes the award of. extra-contractual damages. First, <em>Russell </em>held that the fiduciary duties set forth in \u00a7 409 run only to the plan, and not to individual beneficiaries. <em>Id. </em>at 3091-92. In so holding, the <em>Russell </em>Court used language implying that <em>all </em>of the statute\u2019s provisions relating to fiduciary duties run only to plans, and not to beneficiaries as individuals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-20\">It is of course true that the fiduciary obligations of plan administrators are to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>serve the interest of participants and beneficiaries and, specifically, to provide them with the benefits authorized by the plan. But the principal statutory duties imposed on the trustees relate to the proper management, administration, and investment of fund assets, the maintenance of proper records, the disclosure of specified information, and the avoidance of conflicts of interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 3091 (footnote omitted). This language observes that the statute focuses not on the direct protection of a beneficiary\u2019s interests, but on the protection of the integrity of the plan in which the beneficiary is enrolled. Put another way, ERISA grants no private right of action by a beneficiary <em>qua </em>beneficiary; rather, it accords beneficiaries the right to sue on behalf of the entire plan if a fiduciary breaches the plan\u2019s terms. It should be noted that nothing in the above-quoted passage limits the rationale of <em>Russell </em>to \u00a7 409.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\"><em>Russell </em>sheds light on another major reason to disallow recovery of extra-contractual damages under \u00a7 502(a)(3) \u2014 Congress\u2019 glaring omission of any mention of extra-contractual damages in general, or emotional distress damages in particular:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-6\">Significantly, the statutory provision explicitly authorizing a beneficiary to bring an action to enforce his rights under the plan \u2014 \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) * * * \u2014 says nothing about the recovery of extra-contractual damages, or about the possible consequences of delay in the plan administrators\u2019 processing of a disputed claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AkR\"><em>Id. </em>at 3091. Again, there is nothing in this excerpt to indicate that the underlying reasoning does not apply to \u00a7 502(a). On the contrary, the passage explicitly considers the remedies laid out in \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B). Although we presume the district court herein relied on \u00a7 502(a)(3), it must be noted that \u00a7 502(a)(3) also \u201csays nothing about the recovery of extra-contractual damages,\u201d <em>Russell, </em>105 S.Ct. at 3091, and emphasizes protection of the <em>plan, </em>not the direct protection of beneficiaries. So viewed, the catch-all phrase of \u201cother appropriate equitable relief\u201d in \u00a7 502(a)(3) provides no more foundation for an award of emotional distress damages than does the same catchall phrase in \u00a7 409(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">The <em>Russell </em>Court also rejected the argument that Congress meant to authorize damages for emotional distress, but simply forgot to mention them. The Court examined the six \u201ccarefully-integrated civil enforcement provisions\u201d of \u00a7 502(a) and characterized those provisions as an \u201cinterlocking, interrelated, and interdependent remedial scheme, which is in turn part of a \u2018comprehensive and reticulated statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Russell, </em>105 S.Ct. at 3093 (citation omitted). The Court noted that if a plan\u2019s administrator refuses to disburse benefits, a beneficiary may file an action to recover accrued benefits; to get a judicial declaration of entitlement to benefits; and/or to enjoin the administrator from improperly refusing to pay such benefits in the future. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, a beneficiary may be entitled to have the fiduciary removed and to recover attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Id. </em>Justice Stevens\u2019 majority opinion then stated that where a statute \u201cexpressly provides a particular remedy or remedies, a court must be chary of reading others into it.\u201d <em>Russell, </em>105 S.Ct. at 3091, quoting <em>Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis (TAMA), </em>444 U.S. 11, 19, 100 S.Ct. 242, 247, 62 L.Ed.2d 146 (1979). Finally, Justice Stevens stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-9\">In contrast to the repeatedly emphasized purpose to protect contractually defined benefits, there is a stark absence\u2014 in the statute itself and in its legislative history \u2014 of any reference to an intention to authorize the recovery of extra-contractual damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-10\"><em>Russell, </em>105 S.Ct. at 3093 (footnote omitted). Yet again, the logic in these observations applies as much to \u00a7 502(a)(3) as it does to \u00a7 409.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-11\">We recently recognized that the logic of <em>Russell </em>forecloses the availability of extra-contractual damages under \u00a7 502(a)(3) in <em>Hancock v. Montgomery Ward Long Term Disability Trust, </em>787 F.2d 1302, 1306-07 (9th Cir.1986). There, the district court had denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion for addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>tional discovery that would have been aimed at gathering evidence to support a claim for extra-contractual damages. Citing the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Russell, </em>we held that extra-contractual damages should be unavailable under \u00a7 502(a)(3) as well as under \u00a7 502(a)(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although our opinion in <em>Hancock </em>did not discuss the rationale for this holding at great length, it is clear that <em>Hancock </em>controls the disposition here and mandates reversal of the district court\u2019s award of damages for emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">From the preceding analysis of <em>Russell, </em>we think it clear that the Court\u2019s reasons for disallowing extra-contractual damages extend to \u00a7 502(a)(3), footnote 5 notwithstanding. However, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Russell\u2019s rationale does not extend to \u00a7 502(a)(3), a conscientious examination of the statute\u2019s legislative history compels the conclusion that extra-contractual damages are unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">The legislative history of ERISA supports the proposition that the entire statute was aimed at the protection of the integrity of pension plans, rather than at direct protection of beneficiaries. For example, the Senate Finance Committee described the remedies against a breaching fiduciary as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-8\">The bill specifically makes a fiduciary who breaches any of the specified duties personally liable; the fiduciary must make good any losses <em>which the plan sustained </em>from the breach and must restore <em>to the plan </em>any profits which he made using plan assets.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-15\">S.Rep. No. 383, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1974 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 4639, 4890, 4988 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Without question, this language indicates a legislative focus on the direct protection of plans, which in turn would provide protection to beneficiaries, participants, and the public in general. The same focus manifests itself in the House Conference Report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-16\">[A] fiduciary who breaches the fiduciary requirements of the bill is to be personally liable for any losses <em>to the plan </em>resulting from this breach. Such a fiduciary is also to be liable for restoring <em>to the plan </em>any profits which he has made through use of any plan asset. In addition, such a fiduciary is to be subject to other appropriate relief (including removal) as ordered by a court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-17\">H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 1280, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1974 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5038, 5100 (emphasis added). The last sentence of the above-quoted excerpt is not to be taken as <em>carte blanche </em>for the creation of new extra-contractual and compensatory remedies. The parenthetical material clearly indicates that Congress contemplated \u201cother appropriate relief\u201d to mean injunctive or declaratory relief, such as removal of the fiduciary. As a whole, the excerpted language shows a clear emphasis on warding off raids and other misuses of plan assets amounting to breaches of fiduciary duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-18\">Perhaps the most telling indication of what Congress meant by \u201cappropriate equitable relief\u201d appears in the Senate Finance Committee report on ERISA. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Committee\u2019s definition of such relief is worth reviewing at length:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-4\">Appropriate equitable relief may be granted in a civil action. For example, injunctions may be granted to prevent a violation of fiduciary duty, and a constructive trust may be imposed on the plan assets, if needed to protect the participants and beneficiaries. Also, the bill specifically provides that a fiduciary may be removed through civil action brought by the Secretary or participants or beneficiaries if he has violated any of the specified fiduciary obligations____ It is expected that a fiduciary ... may be removed for repeated or substantial violations of his responsibilities, and that upon removal the court may, in its discretion, appoint someone to serve until a fiduciary is properly chosen in accordance with the plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">S. Rep. No. 383, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1974 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 4890, 4989. Despite Justice Brennan\u2019s reservations, <em>see Russell, </em>105 S.Ct. at 3097 n. 10 (Brennan, J., concurring in the judgment), it appears that Congress used the word \u201cequitable\u201d to mean what it usually means \u2014 injunctive or declaratory relief.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The above-quoted definition of \u201cappropriate equitable relief\u201d lists three distinct remedies (injunction, constructive trust, and removal), all of which are closely tied to the plan. For us to add an extra-contractual remedy to a list of remedies so strongly contractual in nature would be to step beyond the province of the judiciary and into that of the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">We hold that because of the rationale of <em>Russell, </em>and because of ERISA\u2019s structure and legislative history, \u00a7 502(a)(3) makes no provision for extra-contractual damages, including damages for emotional distress.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment must be reversed and remanded for a determination of the amount of emotional distress damages that were awarded Sokol.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-12\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b614-13\">We now address the question of attorney\u2019s fees. Because ERISA commits the award of fees to the district court\u2019s discretion, its determination should be reversed only for abuse of that discretion. <em>See Hummel v. S.E. Rykoff &amp; Co., </em>634 F.2d 446, 452 (9th Cir.1980). The district court should take at least five factors into account in deciding whether to award fees: (1) the degree of the opposing parties\u2019 culpability or bad faith; (2) the ability of the opposing party to satisfy an award of fees; (3) whether an award of fees against the opposing party would deter others from acting under similar circumstances; (4) whether the parties requesting fees sought to benefit all participants and beneficiaries of an ERISA plan or to resolve a significant legal question regarding ERISA; and (5) the relative merits of the parties\u2019 positions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b614-14\">Here, the factors weigh in Sokol\u2019s favor. The district court found that Bernstein had acted arbitrarily and capriciously. Bernstein does not argue that he is unable to satisfy the modest award. On appeal, Sokol sought to resolve a significant legal question regarding ERISA, i.e., the availability <em>vel non </em>of damages for emotional distress under \u00a7 502(a)(3). Finally, there is no question but that the equities in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>litigation lie with Sokol. We affirm the district court\u2019s award of fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed in all respects except the award of damages for emotional distress, which is reversed. The case is remanded for a determination of what portion of the $4,000 award was for medical expenses and what portion was for emotional distress damages, and for further proceedings not inconsistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b610-7\">. The district court did not specify in its findings of fact and conclusions of law upon which statutory provision it based the emotional distress award. However, because the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Russell </em>opinion was cited to the court by Bernstein in the course of arguing his motion to amend the judgment, it must be presumed that the district court based its award on \u00a7 502(a)(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b610-8\">. Section 409(a) states: .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-9\">Any person who is a fiduciary with respect to a plan who breaches any of the responsibilities, obligations, or duties imposed upon fiduciaries by this subchapter shall be personally liable to make good to such plan any losses to the plan resulting from each such breach, and to restore to such plan any profits of such fiduciary which may have been made through use of assets of the plan by the fiduciary, and shall be subject to such other equitable or remedial relief as the court may deem appropriate, including removal of such fiduciary.
