Grant argues the court\u2019s actions during voir dire prevented him from obtaining an impartial jury, and seeks reversal of his conviction. We consider the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"Avb\">\u00b62 Whether the District Court prevented Grant from obtaining an impartial jury, thereby violating his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">\u00b63 Grant was arrested after his then-girlfriend, Loretta Fitzhugh, called police to report that he had assaulted her. Fitzhugh suffered a broken jaw in the incident. Grant admitted causing Fitzhugh\u2019s injuries, but claimed he had acted in self-defense. Since the facts of the incident are not relevant to the limited issue presented on appeal, we need not address them in further detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">\u00b64 A key issue in the State\u2019s case for aggravated assault was whether Fitzhugh\u2019s injuries could be considered \u201cprotracted.\u201d \u2018Protracted\u201d is part of the definition of \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d applicable in this case, which was required to prove felony aggravated assault. Section 45-2-101(66)(a)(ii), MCA. The State planned on calling two doctors as expert witnesses to testify to the \u201cprotracted impairment\u201d caused by Fitzhugh\u2019s injuries. During voir dire, Grant\u2019s counsel sought to explore jurors\u2019 concepts of the word \u201cprotracted,\u201d which he alleges was necessary to evaluate potential juror bias as to the doctors\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"AGf\">\u00b65 Defense counsel made clear his intention to question each juror about his or her understanding of \u201cprotracted,\u201d and did question six jurors in succession. After the sixth juror, the court interjected, \u2018Mr. White, excuse me, I think your point is made ... [tjhis is the sort of thing the jury can discuss in deliberations. The instruction they will receive. They\u2019ll have to define lots of words. I think you made your point. So please move on.\u201d White objected, stating that he still had plenty of time left in voir dire, but the court did not modify its directive. White then inquired whether the remainder of the jury, by show of hands, disagreed with the definition of protracted injury as one that is \u201clong-term\u201d and has \u201ccomplications that are unexpected,\u201d as opposed to one that \u2018is addressed normally\u201d and \u2018heals as expected.\u201d When no hands were raised, White stated, \u201cOkay. Thank you. With that, Judge, I believe my voir dire is complete and I pass the jury for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">\u00b66 The parties then exercised their peremptory challenges and agreed upon the jury pool. Before the selected jurors were readmitted into the courtroom, White again objected that his voir dire was cut short. He argued it was unfair that the State had taken more than an hour for voir dire, while he was \u201ccut short at 45\u201d and was thereby not allowed \u201cto voir dire the final 20 or so panel members on the point that I wanted to voir dire them on.\u201d The court explained the reason it had cut off that line of questioning was \u201cbecause I looked at the definition of serious bodily injury ... [a]nd the definition proposed by the State appears to be the definition of the statute.\u201d The court continued, T didn\u2019t believe it was a good use of time to ask each juror what they thought protracted meant and then go out as a jury, have to define that and then perhaps many other words and then there were a number of different options for the definition of serious bodily injury for them to find.\u201d White responded, T understand, Judge.\u201d The court then continued, \u201c[b]ut you could have continued with other things and you chose to stop.\u201d White reasserted that he \u2018felt what each of them had to say about protracted is directly relevant to their view, you know, of this case.\u201d The court responded, \u201c[a]nd I didn\u2019t and you will argue it... [t]hat is for argument and not voir dire.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">\u00b67 The jury subsequently convicted Grant of aggravated assault, and he timely appealed. His sole argument on appeal is that the court\u2019s actions in cutting short his counsel\u2019s juror-by-juror inquiry of their understanding of \u201cprotracted\u201d deprived him of the right to an impartial jury-</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">\u00b68 A district judge has \u201cgreat latitude in controlling voir dire.\u201d <em>State v. LaMere, </em>190 Mont. 332, 339, 621 P.2d 462, 466 (1980). We review a court\u2019s control of voir dire for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Michaud, </em>2008 MT 88, \u00b6 13, 342 Mont. 244, 180 P.3d 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">\u00b69 <em>Whether the District Court prevented Grant from, obtaining an impartial jury, thereby violating his constitutional rights.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">\u00b610 The right to an impartial jury is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution. Grant cites <em>LaMere, </em>190 Mont, at 338, 621 P.2d at 465, for the proposition that this right is exercised through the voir dire process: \u2018tt]he defendant is entitled to an impartial jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>and the purpose of voir dire is to expose any possible biases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 337-38, 621 P.2d at 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">\u00b611 The specific question before us is whether the District Court\u2019s direction to Grant\u2019s counsel to cease his juror-by-juror inquiry as to interpretations of the word \u201cprotracted\u201d constituted an abuse of discretion. We must balance Grant\u2019s essential right to an impartial jury with the broad discretion a trial court has to oversee the administration of trial. A trial judge must \u2018be able to set reasonable limits on voir dire.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 338, 621 P.2d at 465. The court must balance the need for thorough investigation of possible juror bias with the \u201cduty to conduct the trial in a speedy and fair manner,\u201d and \u2018has wide latitude in so doing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 339, 621 P.2d at 466. The reasonable limits to be set must have due regard for fairness to both parties. <em>Borkoski v. Yost, </em>182 Mont. 28, 32, 594 P.2d 688, 690 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">\u00b612 Grant argues the District Court prevented him from adequately exploring juror biases on a key issue to the case: whether Fitzhugh\u2019s injuries met the applicable definition of \u201cserious bodily injury.\u201d The State intended to call two doctors to testify that Fitzhugh\u2019s injuries resulted in protracted impairment. Grant contends the line of questioning halted by the District Court was necessary to determine whether jurors would listen to the doctors\u2019 testimony impartially. His opening brief contends, Tpjerhaps a juror had a medical issue that was not properly diagnosed or strong feelings about the medical professionals and their expertise in diagnosing medical issues. In order to expose these types of impartiality [sic], defense counsel needed to probe beyond the surface level and question jurors regarding the doctors\u2019 expected testimony.\u201dHe continues, \u201c[c]ounsel was not allowed to question jurors beyond the surface level. The judge stopped counsel from questioning jurors regarding the doctors\u2019 expected testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A2e\">\u00b613 We cannot agree that prohibiting individual questioning on the meaning of \u201cprotracted\u201d foreclosed Grant\u2019s ability to explore possible biases relating to testimony of medical professionals. While Grant complains he was cut off from explaining the reasons behind his focus on \u201cprotracted,\u201d the simple fact remains he did not attempt to remedy the issue. The court did not prevent Grant from inquiring into jurors\u2019 attitudes and biases toward the testimony of medical professionals, or the jurors\u2019 previous medical history and experiences with doctors. Alternative questions would have been more likely to reveal such experiences and prejudice resulting therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">\u00b614  It was within the District Court\u2019s discretion to limit counsel\u2019s insistent focus on one word in the statutory elements of the offense. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>we have previously noted, \u201cprotracted\u201d is a term \u201cof common usage capable of ready understanding.\u201d <em>State v. Trull, </em>2006 MT 119, \u00b6 34, 332 Mont. 233, 136 P.3d 551 (citing <em>State v. Nye, </em>283 Mont. 505, 513, 943 P.2d 96, 102 (1997)). While Grant argues that \u201cprotracted\u201d may mean different things to different people despite its ready understandability, counsel\u2019s repetitive questioning as to jurors\u2019 understanding of the word justifiably struck the District Court as taking on elements of argument that the victim\u2019s injury was not of a protracted nature, rather than inquiry into juror bias. A district court has the duty to ensure orderly, fair proceedings, and is entrusted with discretion to set reasonable limits on the exercise of voir dire to that end. <em>LaMere, </em>190 Mont. at 338, 621 P.2d at 465. The District Court\u2019s actions in curtailing examination of jurors\u2019 understanding of a readily-understandable word after considerable time spent doing so were not outside the bounds of the court\u2019s discretion. The court therefore did not violate Grant\u2019s constitutional right to an impartial jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">\u00b615 Because we conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion in controlling voir dire, we do not reach Grant\u2019s argument that errors in the jury selection process require automatic reversal of his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">\u00b616 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b161-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
