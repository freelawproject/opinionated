Fick (Fick) appeals from the order of the Sixth Judicial District Court granting the Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. We affirm the District Court and remand for imposition of sanctions. We consider the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">\u00b62 <em>Whether \u00a7 3-10-302, MCA, confers concurrent jurisdiction on justices\u2019 and district courts for actions arising under the Montana Residential Landlord and Tenant Act of 1977 (the \u2018Landlord and Tenant Act\u2019).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">\u00b63 This case arises out of a previous landlord/tenant action filed in the Sixth Judicial District Court. <em>Martyn v. Fick, </em>No. DV 07-134 (Mont. Sixth Jud. Dist. Ct. Aug. 25, 2008). Defendant Kevin S. Brown (Brown) is an attorney in Livingston, where plaintiff Fick also resides. Fick is a landlord for several properties in the area. Brown filed the previous suit in September 2007 on behalf of two tenants who alleged that Fick had unlawfully evicted them from a unit he manages. The tenants claimed Fick changed the locks on their unit without obtaining a valid eviction order, thereby depriving them of personal property still in the unit. Fick retained an attorney, contested the allegations in the complaint, and filed a counterclaim. After a bench trial, the District Court found for Fick and entered judgment in his favor on September 26, 2008, in an amount representing one month\u2019s lost rent, transfer and storage fees for the personal property, and attorney\u2019s fees. The tenants did not appeal. Fick assigned the judgment to a collection service in June 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">\u00b64 Fick filed the present action in August 2010. Fick\u2019s chief contention in District Court, which he now reasserts on appeal, was that Brown had fraudulently brought the prior landlord/tenant action in District Court, rather than in Justice\u2019s Court. He asserts a number of other contentions which we do not reach on appeal as a result of our resolution of Fick\u2019s primary claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b544-12\">\u00b65 We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of a statute for correctness. <em>Stevens v. Novartis Pharms. Corp., </em>2010 MT 282, \u00b6 24, 358 Mont. 474, 247 P.3d 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">\u00b66 <em>Whether \u00a7 3-10-302, MCA, confers concurrent jurisdiction on justices\u2019 and district courts for actions arising under the Landlord and Tenant Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">\u00b67 It is abundantly clear from Fick\u2019s appellate briefs that he is convinced Brown\u2019s filing of the landlord/tenant action in District Court was designed to harass, intimidate, and force Fick to incur unnecessary expenses. Fick\u2019s briefs contain all manner of vituperation directed at Brown and Judge Swandal, who presided over the case, which need not be repeated here. Suffice it to say that Fick believes Montana law requires all landlord/tenant actions to be brought in justices\u2019 courts. Fick\u2019s claim in the present case was dismissed with prejudice by the District Court for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted. The court observed that \u00a73-10-302, MCA, is \u201cclear and unambiguous,\u201d and provides for concurrent jurisdiction in the justices\u2019 and district courts over actions arising under the Landlord and Tenant Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">\u00b68  Section 3-10-302, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-7\">The justices\u2019 courts have concurrent jurisdiction with the district courts within their respective counties in actions of forcible entry and unlawful detainer and in actions brought under Title 70, chapter 24 [the Landlord and Tenant Act].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">Fick is either unable to comprehend the statutory language in \u00a73-10-302, MCA, or so desirous of an opposite result that he willfully ignores it. Regardless of Fick\u2019s personal feelings on whether justices\u2019 courts should have exclusive, original jurisdiction over landlord/tenant actions, the clear terms of Montana law provide that they share concurrent jurisdiction with district courts. Concurrent jurisdiction means that the action may be brought in <em>either </em>justice\u2019s court or district court, at the option of the party bringing the suit. <em>State v. Brockway, </em>2005 MT 179, \u00b6\u00b6 11-13, 328 Mont. 5, 116 P.3d 788; <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>928 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 9th ed., West 2009) (defining concurrent jurisdiction as \u201c^jurisdiction that might be exercised simultaneously by more than one court over the same subject matter and within the same territory, a litigant having the right to choose the court in which to file the action.\u201d). Whatever the motive may be, a litigant is thus within his or her rights to bring a landlord/tenant action directly in district court pursuant to the unambiguous statutory language of \u00a73-10-302, MCA, as the District Court correctly concluded. <em>E.g. Summers v. Crestview Apts., </em>2010 MT 164, 357 Mont. 123, 236 P.3d 586 (appeal of Landlord and Tenant Act case brought directly in district court).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>\u00b69 The reasoning behind awarding concurrent jurisdiction is sound: in complex or highly contested landlord/tenant litigation, neither time nor expense is saved by going through a justice\u2019s court proceeding, only to appeal the result in a district court trial <em>de novo. </em>The opposite is true. In the initial landlord/tenant action, it is entirely possible that Brown saved Fick time and expense by bypassing the Justice\u2019s Court, if he intended to appeal a negative result to District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">\u00b610 Furthermore, we cannot help but observe that if either party is guilty of harassment and putting the other through unnecessary time, expense, and anguish, it is undoubtedly Fick. After failing to mention his present contentions even once during the prior suit, Fick has now dragged Brown through both District Court <em>and </em>Supreme Court proceedings on an entirely baseless claim. Moreover, the tone and content of his briefs are outside the realm of acceptable language in court documents. In Fick\u2019s desire to prevail on his claims, he has refused to accept the plain language of the law. \u2018Sometimes the truth just ain\u2019t enough/ Or is it too much in times like this.\u201d Bruce Springsteen, <em>Worlds Apart, </em>on <em>The Rising </em>(Columbia Rees. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">\u00b611  Lastly, we consider Brown\u2019s request to impose sanctions on Fick pursuant to M. R. App. P. 19(5). The rule empowers this Court to \u201caward sanctions to the prevailing party in an appeal... determined to be frivolous, vexatious, filed for purposes of harassment or delay, or taken without substantial or reasonable grounds.\u201dThe District Court noted Fick\u2019s claims appeared frivolous, explicitly warned Fick that further filings on his part could result in sanctions, and clearly explained to Fick why his claims were without substantial grounds. Fick nonetheless persisted in pursuing a clearly meritless claim and used the opportunity to make unsupported accusations of wrongdoing against those involved in the court process. We conclude his arguments are not made in good faith and sanctions are warranted. <em>Hilten v. Bragg, </em>2010 MT 273, \u00b6 30, 358 Mont. 407, 248 P.3d 282. Fick\u2019s appeal is frivolous and vexatious, and was filed for purposes of harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"AB3\">\u00b612 We affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Fick\u2019s complaint and remand for a determination and assessment of costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred on appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b546-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
