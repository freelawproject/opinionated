We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-9\">1. Whether the District Court followed this Court\u2019s instructions on remand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-10\">2. Whether the District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to award damages for the period between January and July, 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-11\">3. Whether West was denied due process of law because she lacked notice that Watson sought damages for his work on Millennia Mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-12\">4. Whether the District Court awarded reasonable compensatory damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b40-14\">\u00b63 This protracted litigation began in 2003. Watson is a former business consultant who moved to Victor, Montana in 2001. Shortly thereafter, he began to attend a spirit-mind-body group run by West. At the time, West primarily ran the Circle of Divine Unity, a non-profit that was in need of organizational structure. West learned of Watson\u2019s skills, and sought his assistance with her business.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-15\">\u00b64 In January of 2002, Watson began performing two contemporaneous but distinct projects for West. One consisted of Watson sorting out the Circle of Divine Unity and spinning off a number of non-profit charities. For this service, Watson and West agreed to a salary of $3,000 per month. As a result of subsequent disagreements, Watson received only partial payment for his six months of work on West\u2019s non-profits. In late 2002, the parties resolved this dispute with an accord and satisfaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>\u00b65 Watson\u2019s second task was the development of Millennia Mind, Inc., a for-profit corporation. The organizational literature explained, \u2018Millennia Mind was bom and is now a divine creation of the highest order. The purpose of this enterprise is to bring the sacred laws and principles of creation into an active restructuring of global economics.... The goal is to create business and financial paradigms that are grounded in the principles of good-will and global guardianship.\u201d Functionally, the purpose of Millennia Mind was to host seminars for high-net-worth individuals. The top one-percent of the wealthiest Americans would attend one-million dollar seminars to learn about building legacies with their wealth. There were a number of conditions precedent to success, including convincing the ultra-rich to actually attend the seminars and securing $1 million in financing from a Brazilian heiress named Corrin Coffin (Tanmayo).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">\u00b66 With regard to compensation, the parties agreed that Watson would receive a salary and a 22% ownership in Millennia Mind. By April 2002, it was agreed that Watson\u2019s first-year salary would be either $50,000 or $60,000. They further resolved that in the second year, Watson\u2019s salary would increase to approximately $120,000. West was aware that Watson had accepted the lower initial salary because he expected his ownership interests to pay off \u201cdown the road.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">\u00b67 Over the first six months of2002, Watson laid the groundwork for Millennia Mind. West controlled Watson\u2019s actions and he followed her instructions. He set up the corporation, worked to develop an image and logo, and created both the business plan and future strategy.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">\u00b68 Towards the middle of 2002, West and Watson\u2019s relationship deteriorated. Watson discovered that West had not earned an accredited PhD in divinity, as she claimed. Rather, the PhD had been conferred by one of her own organizations, the Sacred Arts Institute. Furthermore, West informed Watson that he would not be getting paid for some of his services. She asserted that Watson had agreed to provide some of his work for \u2018Seva,\u201d a euphemism for free service to the \u201cguru,\u201d Devra West. In July, West announced that the Masters\u201d had advised her that corporate shareholding was a thing of the past, and she would not be issuing shares for Millennia Mind. She refused to discuss alternative ownership structures, and did not compensate Watson for any of his work on Millennia Mind. At that time, Watson also discovered that West had not secured any funding from Tanmayo and had no intention of funding Millennia Mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">\u00b69 Watson immediately stopped working with West and subsequently sued her. His complaint alleged five counts: (1) breach of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>contract, (2) fraud, (3) unjust enrichment, (4) constructive fraud, and (5) constructive termination. West\u2019s answer asserted sixteen affirmative defenses. The proceedings were delayed repeatedly over the next five years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finally, a trial date was set for July, 2008. West however, failed to comply with any pretrial deadlines. As a result, the District Court imposed sanctions pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 16(f), struck West\u2019s answer and entered default judgment for Watson.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">\u00b610 On October 2, 2008, the District Court held a damages hearing. West neither attended nor submitted a brief. On October 20, the District Court concluded that West\u2019s actions constituted breach of contract, fraud and unjust enrichment. Watson was awarded $730,000 in compensatory damages and $6,209.27 in attorney fees. West appealed the sanctions, award of attorney fees and award of compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">\u00b611 This Court upheld the sanctions and attorney fees award. However, the District Court failed to properly assess whether Watson\u2019s alleged compensatory damages were reasonable and clearly ascertainable. The case was remanded to the District Court for a determination of reasonable and non-speculative compensatory damages. On remand, the Honorable James Haynes assumed jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">\u00b612 On August 11, 2010, the District Court found that West had received and retained the benefit of Watson\u2019s work on Millennia Mind, without ever compensating him. Watson was awarded $42,000 in damages for the period between January and July, 2002. The District Court found that West made intentionally false representations in order to secure free labor from Watson, and her actions constituted breach of contract, unjust enrichment and fraud. The District Court rejected Watson\u2019s other alleged damages for future salary, lost stock value, lost profits or other prospective gain. West appealed the District Court\u2019s award of compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">\u00b613 Whether a district court has complied with remand instructions is a question of law we review for correctness. <em>In re Marriage of Pfeifer, </em>1998 MT 228, \u00b6 9, 291 Mont. 23, 965 P.2d 895.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">\u00b614 We review de novo, whether lack of notice and opportunity for a meaningful hearing deprived a party of due process of law. <em>Steab v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number><em>Luna, </em>2010 MT 125, \u00b6\u00b6 24-25, 356 Mont. 372, 233 P.3d 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">\u00b615 Whether a court possesses subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law, which we review de novo. <em>In re Fair Hearing of Hanna, </em>2010 MT 38, \u00b6 13, 355 Mont. 236, 227 P.3d 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">\u00b616 \u201cA district court\u2019s damage determination is a factual finding which must be upheld if it is supported by substantial evidence; we will not overturn a district court\u2019s damages determination unless it is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Watson I, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">\u00b617 <em>Whether the District Court followed this Court\u2019s instructions on remand.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">\u00b618 On remand, a district court must proceed in conformity with the views expressed by the appellate court. <em>Haines Pipeline Constr. v. Montana Power Co., </em>265 Mont. 282, 290, 876 P.2d 632, 637 (1994). West asserts that the District Court\u2019s judgment went beyond this Court\u2019s instructions on remand. She asserts that the District Court was restricted to two inquiries: (1) whether Millennia Mind was ever capitalized, and (2) whether Watson mitigated his alleged damages.</p>\n<p id=\"AoN\">\u00b619 West\u2019s reading of the remand order is overly narrow. She correctly points out that the original District Court failed to inquire into capitalization and mitigation. <em>Watson I, </em>\u00b6 36. However, this Court\u2019s remand instruction asked for more than mere resolution of those two issues. In <em>Watson I, </em>the district court failed to ensure that Watson\u2019s alleged damages were reasonable and clearly ascertainable. <em>Watson I, </em>\u00b6 37; <em>Johnson v. Murray, </em>201 Mont. 495, 506, 509, 656 P.2d 170, 175, 177 (1982). On remand, the district court was required to determine the \u201cnature and extent\u201d of Watson\u2019s alleged damages, and award damages that were reasonable and non-speculative. <em>Watson I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 37-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">\u00b620 The record reflects that the District Court obeyed this Court\u2019s remand instruction. Not only did the District Court answer the questions of mitigation and capitalization, it assessed and rejected, as speculative, much of Watson\u2019s alleged damages. Moreover, the District Court found that Watson had been injured to the extent that he had developed Millennia Mind for six months without compensation and concluded that $42,000 represented reasonable and non-speculative damages. Finally, none of the District Court\u2019s findings or conclusions is in conflict with the decision of this Court in <em>Watson I. Muri v. Frank, </em>2003 MT 316, \u00b6 14, 318 Mont. 269, 80 P.3d 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">\u00b621 <em>Whether the District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number><em>award damages for the period between January and July, 2002.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">\u00b622 West argues that the District Court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to award damages because Watson\u2019s complaint did not seek damages for the six-month period that Watson worked on Millennia Mind. West\u2019s argument is misplaced. \u2018Subject-matter jurisdiction is a court\u2019s fundamental authority to hear and adjudicate a particular class of cases or proceedings.\u201d <em>Lorang v. Fortis Ins. Co., </em>2008 MT 252, \u00b6 57, 345 Mont. 12, 192 P.3d 186. Article VII, Section 4(1) of the Montana Constitution provides that, \u2018ft]he district court has original jurisdiction in all ... civil matters and cases at law and in equity.\u201d The District Court possessed subject matter jurisdiction over the civil dispute between Watson and West.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">\u00b623 West\u2019s citation to <em>Steab, </em>\u00b6 24, does not support her position. In <em>Steab, </em>the Court clarified that when a party asserts lack of proper notice and opportunity for a meaningful hearing, the question is one of constitutional due process of law not \u2018jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Steab, </em>\u00b6 24. Like <em>Steab, </em>West asserts lack of proper notice, and her argument is properly framed as a question of due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">\u00b624 <em>Whether West was denied due process of law because she lacked notice that Watson sought damages for his work on Millennia Mind. </em>\u00b625 West argues that she had no notice that Watson sought damages for the time period between January and July, 2002. Due process of law requires reasonable notice so as to give every interested party the opportunity to be heard. <em>Baston v. Baston, </em>2010 MT 207, \u00b6 18, 357 Mont. 470, 240 P.3d 643. A plaintiff generally cannot recover beyond the case stated in his or her or complaint, because fair notice to the other party is essential. <em>Baston, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">\u00b626 Watson\u2019s reliance on <em>Baston </em>is misplaced. In <em>Baston, </em>the district court awarded monetary damages, despite the fact that the only issue listed in the pretrial order was ownership of a house. <em>Baston, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19-20. This Court held that the district court erred by sua sponte awarding monetary damages based on an unlitigated theory. <em>Baston, </em>\u00b6 21. <em>Baston </em>is inapplicable to the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">\u00b627 The record reflects that West was aware that Watson sought monetary damages, beginning in January 2002, for the value of his services she had wrongfully retained without compensation. Watson\u2019s complaint alleged the creation of an agreement \u201con or about January 2002.\u201d He further alleged that West \u201cknew her representations of pursuing the business with Plaintiff was false, her subversive purpose being to extract Plaintiffs services for Defendant\u2019s charity with minimal compensation.\u201d Additionally, the complaint stated, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>\u2018Defendant intended that the Plaintiff rely on the representations in order to receive his valuable services for both her charity and Millennia Mind, Inc.\u201d Moreover, Watson alleged that West, \u201creceived the benefit of the Plaintiffs business consulting services in the creation of Millennia Mind, Inc., for which she has not paid.\u201d Finally, Watson prayed for damages based upon theories of fraud and unjust enrichment. The complaint gave West notice that Watson sought compensation for the six months he developed Millennia Mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">\u00b628  Finally, West\u2019s purported lack of notice is undercut by her own motion for summary judgment in 2006. West moved for summary judgment on the grounds that Watson\u2019s claims for compensation between January and July 2002, had all been resolved by accord and satisfaction. The District Court denied the motion, concluding that there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether the accord and satisfaction had resolved Watson\u2019s unpaid development of Millennia Mind. West\u2019s articulation of this argument establishes she knew the full extent of Watson\u2019s alleged damages. The District Court did not deprive West of due process of law by awarding Watson damages for his six months of unpaid labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">\u00b629 <em>Whether the District Court\u2019s award of $42,000 in compensatory damages was reasonable.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">\u00b630 West argues that the District Court lacked any credible evidence to award compensatory damages to Watson. In all cases, damages must be reasonable. Section 27-1-302, MCA. A district court\u2019s determination of damages is a finding of fact which must be supported by substantial credible evidence. <em>Harding v. Savoy, </em>2004 MT 280, \u00b6 45, 323 Mont. 261, 100 P.3d 976. The district court is best situated to determine proper damages, and its decision will remain undisturbed unless the amount awarded reflects an abuse of discretion. <em>Harding, </em>\u00b6 45. \u201cA district court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or so exceeds the bounds of reason as to work a substantial injustice.\u201d <em>McCormack v. Andres, </em>2008 MT 182, \u00b6 22, 343 Mont. 424, 185 P.3d 973.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">\u00b631  We conclude the award of $42,000 in compensatory damages was supported by substantial credible evidence. West testified that she hired two other business consultants at a monthly rate of $10,000. Although she asserted that neither consultant worked on Millennia Mind, one of the consulting agreements explicitly referenced Millennia Mind. The District Court found that $10,000 represented a non-speculative, fair market salary for Watson\u2019s business services. It multiplied the $10,000 by the six months that Watson had provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>unpaid work for Millennia Mind and concluded his damages were $60,000. The District Court then reduced the $60,000 by $18,000, the amount of money Watson earned in his separate work on West\u2019s nonprofits. Furthermore, nothing in the District Court\u2019s decision reflects that the award of damages was arbitrary or substantially unjust. The damages were derived directly from West\u2019s testimony, reasonably confined to the period that Watson actually worked on Millennia Mind, and were properly reduced by the amount of his other earnings. The District Court awarded reasonable damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">\u00b632 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b46-5\">JUSTICES NELSON, WHEAT, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b42-10\"> A detailed recitation of the procedural history between 2003 and 2008 is set forth in <em>Watson v.
