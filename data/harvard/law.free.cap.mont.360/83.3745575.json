He appeals his sentences. We affirm in part, reverse in part and remand to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">\u00b62 McDowell raises two issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-11\">1. Whether the prosecutor breached the plea agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-12\">2. Whether the District Court erred by not crediting McDowell for time served.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-14\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b114-15\">\u00b63 On October 15, 2008, McDowell broke into the house of Amy Peters, his ex-girlfriend. He brought a gun and fired it while on the premises. Peters managed to flee unhurt and called the police from a neighbor\u2019s residence. McDowell was subsequently arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-16\">\u00b64 The State initially charged McDowell with attempted deliberate homicide and aggravated burglary. On April 29, 2009, McDowell and the State entered into a plea agreement. McDowell agreed to plead no contest to assault with a weapon, \u00a7 45-5-213, MCA, and felony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>burglary, \u00a745-6-204, MCA. In exchange, the prosecutor agreed to make a sentencing recommendation. For assault with a weapon, the prosecutor agreed to recommend 20 years, with 10 suspended. With regard to burglary, the prosecutor agreed to recommend 10 years, all suspended. The sentences were to run consecutively. McDowell was permitted to argue for any sentence he deemed appropriate. He explicitly acknowledged that the prosecutor\u2019s recommendation was not binding on the District Court, and his plea could result in the maximum punishment for each offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">\u00b65 On June 4, 2009, Probation Officer Darrell Vanderhoef prepared a Pre-Sentence Investigation report (PSI). It included the details of the offense and McDowell\u2019s criminal history, including four prior felonies and previous failures at supervised release. Vanderhoef recommended sentences of 20 years, with 5 suspended, for assault with a weapon, and 20 years, with 5 suspended, for the burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">\u00b66 On the day of sentencing, Peters decided she wanted to testify. The prosecutor called her to the stand and asked her to give a statement with regard to McDowell\u2019s sentence. Peters proceeded to explain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-7\">I had to give up my home here that I was buying. And I had to move my son completely away because of all of this. It\u2019s been really nerve-racking. I can\u2019t sleep at night still. I have panic attacks. I check my doors and my windows like five, six times a night before I even go to bed. It\u2019s very hard.... And I don\u2019t think that he should get off on a minimal sentence. I mean, I got a phone call saying that he could be going away for 2 years, and I have to deal with this for the rest of my life for what he\u2019s done.... I can\u2019t come back to Townsend and visit my family because I get confronted by people, I get harassed by people. It\u2019s hard. And I don't think he should get off on this.... I think he should be punished for what he\u2019s done to me and he\u2019s done to my son.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">\u00b67 The State\u2019s only other witness was Vanderhoef. He testified that he had prepared the PSI, which included a sentence recommendation. The State did not ask for, and Vanderhoef did not offer, the specifics of the PSI\u2019s recommended sentence. The prosecutor then asked Vanderhoef if there was anything, not in the PSI, that he would like to add. Vanderhoef answered affirmatively and recommended a fine of $5,000. He explained that McDowell had self-reported a monthly income of $2,000 from Workers\u2019 Compensation Benefits, which had accumulated to nearly $10,000 while he was incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">\u00b68 McDowell called three character witnesses, on his behalf. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>prosecutor declined to cross-examine two of them. The third, he asked two brief questions with regard to how McDowell came to possess a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">\u00b69 At summation, the prosecutor recommended the sentence set forth in the plea agreement. He emphasized that the crimes were premeditated, serious and that McDowell had a prior criminal history. He pointed to the PSI as confirmation of these assertions. Finally, he recommended both prison time, and supervised release, subject to conditions set forth in the PSI. In response, McDowell argued that the PSI only told one side of the story, and recommended a total sentence of five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">\u00b610 The District Court generally agreed with the PSI\u2019s recommendations. The sentencing judge explained his concern with McDowell\u2019s prior felonies and inability to comply with supervised release. The District Court further noted that during the course of the current action, McDowell\u2019s pre-trial release had been revoked. For the charge of burglary, McDowell received 20 years, with 10 suspended. For assault with a weapon, McDowell received 20 years, with 5 suspended. The sentences were to run consecutively. Additionally, the District Court imposed a $5,000 fine, for assault with a weapon, and subjected McDowell to all of the recommended conditions contained in the PSI. After a failed attempt to withdraw his guilty plea, McDowell appealed, arguing that the State had breached the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">\u00b611 \u2018Where a defendant was sentenced to more than one year of actual incarceration, and therefore is eligible for sentence review, we review the sentence for legality only.\u201d <em>State v. Bullplume, </em>2011 MT 40, \u00b6 10, 359 Mont. 289, 251 P.3d 1114.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">\u00b612 Whether the State has breached a plea agreement is a question of law this Court reviews de novo. <em>Bullplume, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b116-11\">\u00b613 <em>Whether the prosecutor breached the plea agreement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b116-12\">\u00b614  A plea agreement is essentially a contract and is subject to contract law standards. <em>State v. Manywhitehorses, </em>2010 MT 225, \u00b6 10, 358 Mont. 46, 243 P.3d 412. In order to retain the benefit derived from a defendant\u2019s plea, the State must fulfill its contractual obligations strictly and meticulously. <em>State v. Rardon, </em>2005 MT 129, \u00b6 18, 327 Mont. 228, 115 P.3d 182 <em>(Rardon III). </em>When the State agrees to recommend a specific sentence, a prosecutor becomes obligated to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>approach sentencing in a manner that will not undermine the agreement. <em>Bullplume, </em>\u00b6 13. Prosecutorial violation of the agreement is unacceptable, even if done inadvertently, in a good faith pursuit of justice. <em>Rardon III, </em>\u00b6 18. There are no hard and fast criteria for determining when a plea agreement has been breached, because each case turns on its own unique facts. Manywhitehorses, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">\u00b615 McDowell asserts two theories regarding the State\u2019s alleged breach. He argues that the prosecutor\u2019s presentation at sentencing undermined the State\u2019s sentencing recommendation. Additionally, he asserts that the prosecutor breached the agreement by recommending the PSI\u2019s sentence conditions. We address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">\u00b616 McDowell first asserts that the prosecutor merely paid \u201clip service\u201d to the plea agreement\u2019s sentencing recommendation, while actively eliciting testimony undermining that recommendation. A prosecutor enjoys wide latitude in submitting evidence at sentencing, but must temper his or her case by adhering to obligations or restrictions contained in a plea agreement. <em>Rardon III, </em>\u00b6 19. Here, the plea agreement did not limit the prosecutor\u2019s ability to call or cross-examine witnesses. It required that he recommend an agreed-to sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">\u00b617 This Court has previously addressed circumstances where a prosecutor was accused of undercutting a sentencing recommendation. In <em>State v. Rardon, 2002 MT 345, </em>\u00b619, 313 Mont. <em>321, 61 P.3d 132 (.Rardon II), </em>the prosecutor expressly recommended the agreed-to sentence in the plea agreement. <em>Id. </em>However, the State\u2019s presentation entirely undercut that recommendation. <em>Id. </em>The prosecutor informed witnesses of the potential brevity of Rardon\u2019s prison time, asked them whether they agreed with that sentence, and elicited suggestions for longer periods of imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>During cross-examination, the prosecutor attempted to get Rardon to agree that he should be imprisoned until his grandchildren were grown. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, the prosecutor emphasized negative aspects of Rardon\u2019s sexual offender evaluation and suggested that a long-term prison sentence would be good motivation. <em>Rardon II, </em>\u00b6 20. This Court concluded \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s fervor in soliciting and offering evidence that would almost undoubtedly cause the court to question the appropriateness of the recommended sentence effectively undercut the plea agreement.\u201d <em>Rardon II, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">\u00b618 Conversely, in <em>Rardon III, </em>this Court concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s presentation did not undermine the plea-bargained sentence despite the State\u2019s elicitation of evidence similar to <em>Rardon </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number><em>II. Rardon III, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20-22. The State\u2019s witnesses offered testimony regarding Rardon\u2019s abusive history and support for a lengthy sentence. <em>Rardon III, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-17, 22. However, the mere fact that such testimony emerged did not establish a breach of the plea agreement. <em>Rardon III, </em>\u00b6 22. Rather, the Court examined the manner and circumstances by which that testimony was elicited. <em>Rardon III, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 21-22. Ultimately, the Court concluded that the improprieties evidenced in <em>Rardon II </em>were not present. <em>Rardon III, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 21-22. Thus, despite eliciting testimony detrimental to Rardon, the prosecutor\u2019s presentation appropriately encouraged relevant testimony that properly informed the sentencing judge. <em>Rardon III, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">\u00b619 In the case at hand, the prosecutor\u2019s conduct at sentencing did not undercut the plea agreement. Peters, the State\u2019s first witness, was the victim of McDowell\u2019s offenses. Montana law provides that a victim may \u201cpresent a statement concerning the effects of the crime on the victim, the circumstances surrounding the crime, the manner in which the crime was perpetrated, and <em>the victim\u2019s opinion regarding appropriate </em>sentence.\u201dSection 46-18-115(4)(a), MCA (emphasis added). Peters was entitled to testify regardless of whether or not the prosecutor called her. Unlike <em>Rardon II, </em>the prosecutor did not ask her to compare sentences, or attempt to elicit inflammatory testimony. Rather, he simply offered her the opportunity to state her opinion, as provided for by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">\u00b620 Furthermore, Vanderhoef s recommendation of the $5,000 fine did not undermine the plea agreement. The parties were aware that the District Court had ordered a PSI. As the author of that report, Vanderhoef was an appropriate witness to call at sentencing. Although there is no legal requirement that the State present testimony from the person who prepared the PSI, this Court has recognized that failure to do so can result in a weak or incomplete presentation to the sentencing judge. <em>State v. LeMere, </em>272 Mont. 355, 359, 900 P.2d 926 (1995). Here, the prosecutor\u2019s inquiry, whether there was anything else the District Court should know, was an appropriate question, relevant to the sentencing judge. <em>Rardon III, </em>\u00b6 20. In the absence of any offensive conduct similar to <em>Rardon II, </em>McDowell essentially asks the Court to presume prosecutorial impropriety because a dispassionate question resulted in a detrimental response from Vanderhoef. This is the type of result-proves-the-breach argument that the Court rejected in <em>Rardon III. Rardon III, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">\u00b621  Finally, the prosecutor\u2019s summation did not undermine the plea agreement\u2019s recommended sentence. McDowell argues that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>prosecutor \u2018telegraphed\u201d support for the PSI\u2019s recommended sentence because he relied on facts contained in the PSI. This argument is without merit. The State recommended that McDowell receive a total sentence of 30 years, with 20 suspended. McDowell argued for a total of five years. In other words, the prosecutor had to both advocate against McDowell\u2019s recommended sentence and argue for the sentence in the plea agreement. To do so, the prosecutor appropriately pointed out that McDowell had pled no contest to two felonies and had a prior criminal history. These facts were set forth in the PSI, as required by law. Section 46-18-112, MCA. It is unreasonable to argue that a prosecutor must disown pertinent facts simply because they happen to be contained in a PSI that recommends a different sentence. We conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s presentation and argument before the District Court did not undermine the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">\u00b622 McDowell\u2019s second argument is that the State expressly breached the plea agreement when the prosecutor recommended that the District Court impose conditions on the suspended portion of McDowell\u2019s sentence. He contends that this recommendation was contrary to the plea agreement and constituted breach. The State responds that this argument was not raised below and was waived. On appeal, parties are permitted to bolster preserved issues with new legal authority or make further arguments within the scope of the legal theory advanced in the district court. <em>State v. Montgomery, </em>2010 MT 193, \u00b6 12, 357 Mont. 348, 239 P.3d 929. In District Court, McDowell argued that the State had conducted itself in a manner that constituted a breach of the plea agreement. On appeal, McDowell has not raised a new legal theory, but rather refined his argument presented below.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">\u00b623  Prosecutors are held to strict and meticulous standards because, \u201cwhen a plea rests in any significant degree on a promise or agreement of the prosecutor, so that it can be said to be part of the inducement or consideration, such promise must be fulfilled.\u201d <em>State v. Rardon, </em>1999 MT 220, \u00b6 14, 296 Mont. 19, 986 P.2d 424 <em>(Rardon I); see State v. Allen, </em>199 Mont. 204, 209, 645 P.2d 380, 382 (1981) (citing <em>Correale v. United States, </em>479 F.2d 944 (1st Cir. 1973)). In order to ensure that the plea bargain process is fair to the defendant, there must be \u201csafeguards to insure the defendant what is reasonably due in the circumstances.\u201d <em>Rardon I, </em>\u00b6 14. McDowell fails to establish that his plea was based on a belief that the State had promised to not recommend any conditions for the suspended portion of his sentence. \u00b624 The explicit terms of the agreement establish that McDowell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>received what was reasonably due in the circumstances: a reduction in charges, and the recommendation of a specific reduced sentence. McDowell was originally charged with attempted deliberate homicide and aggravated burglary. Attempted deliberate homicide carries potential penalties of death, a prison-term for life, or 100 years imprisonment. Sections 45-4-103, and 45-5-102, MCA. Aggravated burglary has the potential of a 40-year term of imprisonment. Section 45-6-204, MCA. Upon entering into the plea agreement, McDowell immediately benefitted by avoiding those potential sentences. At sentencing, the prosecutor fulfilled his additional promise and recommended a 30-year term, with 20 years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">\u00b625  Moreover, we agree with the State that it is unreasonable for McDowell to argue that he expected no conditions would be placed on a 20-year suspended sentence. Conditions on suspended sentences are commonplace, especially for prior felons like McDowell, who have proven themselves poor candidates for unsupervised release. McDowell received the benefits he bargained for. He cannot now argue that his plea was based \u201cto a significant degree\u201d on any unfulfilled promise. Based upon the facts of this case, the prosecutor did not breach the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">\u00b626 <em>Whether the District Court erred by failing to credit McDowell for time served.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">\u00b627  Each day of incarceration prior to or after a conviction must be credited against a defendant\u2019s sentence. Section 46-18-403(1), MCA; <em>State v. Dewitt, </em>2006 MT 302, \u00b6 10, 334 Mont. 474, 149 P.3d 549. McDowell was incarcerated in 2008, released, and subsequently re-incarcerated until sentencing. However, the District Court did not give McDowell any credit for this time served. We conclude this was error.</p>\n<p id=\"AjU\">\u00b628 We remand this case to the District Court for a determination of the correct amount of credit to be given for time served.</p>\n<judges id=\"b120-8\">JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER, BAKER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
