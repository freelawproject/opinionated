We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">\u00b62 This case involves the State of Montana\u2019s broadband pay system, which establishes employee classification and compensation. Sections 2-18-201 to -306, MCA. The pay plan must be administered \u201con the basis of competency, internal equity, and competitiveness to external labor markets when fiscally able.\u201d Section 2-18-301(4), MCA. Essentially, all positions are classified into \u201coccupations\u201d and are then assigned to one of nine \u201cpay bands.\u201d Sections 2-18-201 to -306, MCA. There are many different occupations and salaries within each pay band. Section 2-18-101(16), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">\u00b63 Nearly ten years ago, Appellants, all Civil Engineering Technician IV employees (\u2018Technician IVs\u201d) sought reclassification of their positions. They sought the same classification and pay as Civil Engineering Specialist III employees (\u2018Specialist Ills\u201d). Technician IVs were in pay band five, while Specialist Ills were in pay band six. The State Human Resources Division (\u2018SHRD\u201d) determined the Technician IVs were correctly classified as pay band five. DOT also requested an independent classification of the Specialist Ills, which resulted in Specialist Ills being moved from pay band six to pay band five. Technician TVs and Specialist Ills have the same predominant duties, meaning they do the same work more than 50 percent of the time. However, when Specialist Ills were moved to pay band five, DOT did not change the Specialist Ill\u2019s rate of pay, which is higher than Technician IV\u2019s. The Technician IVs objected, saying they should be paid the same as Specialist Ills because they have the same predominant duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">\u00b64 A hearing was held before a Board of Personnel Appeals (\u2018BOPA\u201d) Hearing Officer on May 7 and 8, 2009. The Hearing Officer issued a proposed order, finding that the difference in pay between Technician IVs and Specialist Ills was \u2018justified by the differing qualifications and earning power of the two occupations involved\u201d and was \u201cwell within the scope of [DOT\u2019s] authority to make pay decisions.\u201d The Technician IVs appealed to the full board of the BOPA. A hearing was held by the full board, and it issued its final order on January 27, 2010, adopting the proposed order of the hearings officer. The Technician IVs then appealed to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>\u00b65 The District Court found that the Technician IVs and Specialist Ills were not required to receive equal pay. It found, pursuant to \u00a72-18-301(4), MCA, the State\u2019s pay plan \u201cmust be administered \u2018on the basis of competency, internal equity, and competitiveness to external labor markets.\u2019\u201dThe District Court found that, because civil engineers (such as Specialist Ills) have more extensive formal education and greater advancement opportunities than engineering technicians (such as Technician IVs), and the civil engineers are more competitive in external labor markets, the wage disparity was permissible. The District Court rejected the Technician IVs\u2019 argument that the Davis<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> decision applied to this case because of the reenactment doctrine. <em>See Hovey v. Department of Revenue, Liquor Division, </em>203 Mont. 27, 33, 659 P.2d 280, 283-84 (1983) (discussing the reenactment doctrine). It is from this order that the Technician IVs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">\u00b66 The district courts review administrative decisions to determine whether the findings are clearly erroneous and whether the agency correctly interpreted the law. <em>O\u2019Neill v. Department of Revenue, </em>2002 MT 130, \u00b6 10, 310 Mont. 148, 49 P.3d 43. We employ the same standard when reviewing the district court\u2019s order. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">\u00b67 The Montana Administrative Procedures Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-7\">(2) The court may not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact. The court may affirm the decision of the agency or remand the case for further proceedings. The court may reverse or modify the decision if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-8\">(a) the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-9\">(i) in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-10\">(ii) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-11\">(iii) made upon unlawful procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-12\">(iv) affected by other error of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-13\">(v) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-15\">(vi) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>discretion clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANb\">(b) findings of fact, upon issues essential to the decision, were not made although requested.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Section 2-4-704(2), MCA; <em>Weitz v. Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation, </em>284 Mont. 130, 133, 943 P.2d 990, 992 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">\u00b68 When reviewing the findings of a district court sitting without a jury, we apply the following three part test to determine whether the district court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous: 1) the record is reviewed to see if the findings are supported by substantial evidence; 2) if the findings are supported by substantial evidence, we determine if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence; and 3) if substantial evidence exists and the effect of the evidence was not misapprehended, we may still decide a finding is clearly erroneous when, although there is evidence to support it, a review of the record leaves us with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake was made. <em>Weitz, </em>284 Mont, at 133-34, 943 P.2d at 992. We review conclusions of law to determine whether the agency\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">\u00b69 The Technician IVs argue that they \u201care paid considerably less money for doing the same work in the same place for the same employer\u201d as the Specialist Ills, and thus should be paid the same as Specialist Ills. They also argue that the <em>Davis </em>decision applies here, and that the District Court erred by refusing to apply the \u201creenactment doctrine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">\u00b610 The Appellees argue they have correctly applied the enabling statutes and regulations regarding classification and pay, and that Specialist Ills earn more because their position requires different knowledge, skills, and abilities. Further, they argue the <em>Davis </em>decision has been complied with and that the \u201creenactment doctrine\u201d does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">\u00b611 After reviewing the record, we find that substantial evidence supports the District Court\u2019s decision, the District Court did not misapprehend the effect of the evidence and did not make a mistake. All parties agree that Technician IVs and Specialist Ills have the same predominant duties-work done more than 50 percent of the time. However, the non-predominant duties are different. Specialist Ills\u2019 most complex aspect involves advanced analysis of interrelated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>engineering issues, site features, engineering standards and specifications, and applicable regulations and requirements to ensure professional standards. Technician IVs\u2019 most complex aspect is independently directing multiple aspects of small and large construction projects at different locations.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">\u00b612 The educational requirements for the two positions are also different. Specialist Ills must have a bachelor\u2019s degree in civil engineering or a related engineering degree. Technician IVs require a high school diploma or GED with course work in algebra, geometry, or trigonometry.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">\u00b613 The minimum professional experience for the two positions is different as well. To become a Specialist III, the employee must, at minimum, be certified as an engineer intern, which requires an engineering degree, or related science degree with four or more years of progressive experience on engineering projects satisfactory to the Board of Professional Engineer and Professional Land Surveyors, among several other requirements. To become a Technician IV, the employee must have at least eight years of engineering technician experience, two of which must be attained at the Technician III position. Certain amounts of education can substitute for some or all of the eight years.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\u00b614 There are also differing market demands for each position. Specialist Ills are in higher demand. In national markets, Specialist Ills are paid more. DOT also has a retention problem with Specialist Ills, whereas Technician IVs experience little turnover. Finally, there are different career advancement opportunities for each position, with Specialist Ills having more options within DOT and the private sector. \u00b615 We agree with the District Court that these differences allow for differing pay. We also note that the pay of Technician IVs cannot exclusively be determined by DOT, but is subject to collective bargaining, whereas the pay of Specialist Ills is not and may be determined by DOT. <em>See </em>\u00a739-31-103(9), MCA (engineer interns, which Specialist Ills must be, are not public employees for collective bargaining purposes). Because of this, it is not clear from the record whether the change in pay sought by Technician IVs would comply with their collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">\u00b616 The District Court also correctly concluded that the <em>Davis </em>decision was followed, therefore the reenactment doctrine was not invoked. The <em>Davis </em>decision did not mandate equal pay for the employees in that case-Civil Engineering Specialist V and Engineering Project <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Coordinator V. It required the same market rate starting point, but specifically allowed for \u201cuse of other factors\u201d to adjust pay for positions or groups of positions. That is precisely what happened in the present case-ether factors, such as education, professional experience, and market demand, were used to determine pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\u00b617  The District Court\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence, it did not misapprehend the effect of the evidence, and we are not convinced a mistake was made. The District Court\u2019s conclusions of law are correct. Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b202-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b199-16\"> <em>Walter Davis, et al., </em>Step Two Wage Appeal Response, CA5-2003 (G-197)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
