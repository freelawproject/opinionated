Heavygun appeals, raising two issues: 1) was his right to be present at all critical stages of his criminal proceeding violated, and 2) did he receive ineffective assistance of counsel? We affirm on the first issue and find the second appropriate for postconviction proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">\u00b62 Heavygun was charged with deliberate homicide and various other offenses after the stabbing death of his friend, Justin Wells, on January 25, 2009. Because Heavygun appeals two limited issues, we do not discuss the events of January 25, 2009. For clarity\u2019s sake, we note that Heavygun does not challenge the factual basis of his convictions, but rather urges that the alleged errors require reversal of his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">\u00b63 Heavygun sought to be present at his omnibus hearing, held on August 5, 2009. On July 29, 2009, Heavygun filed a Motion to Transport Defendant to Omnibus Hearing, saying \u2018Defendant would like to be present for his Omnibus Hearing.\u201d That motion was denied, and the omnibus hearing proceeded as scheduled, without Heavygun\u2019s presence and without a record being made, other than the statutorily required memorandum. On August 10, 2009, several days after the omnibus hearing, Heavygun filed Defendant\u2019s Objection to Denial of Defendant\u2019s Motion to be Present at the Omnibus Hearing, in which he renewed his request to be present, arguing he had the right to be present and that his omnibus hearing should have been on the record. His motion was denied. The District Court\u2019s order stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-9\">This Court has addressed this issue on motion of this counsel a number of times before. Nothing has changed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-10\">The omnibus hearing is a creature of statute. It is not a critical stage of the proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-11\">Section 46-13-110 MCA providing for the omnibus hearing specifically provides that \u2018[T]he presence of the Defendant is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>required, unless ordered by the Court.\u2019 This statute has never been held to be unconstitutional nor has the Supreme Court of the State of Montana otherwise ruled that the Defendant has a right to be present, or a record kept.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-4\">It is the practice in this Court that no substantive issues are determined at the omnibus hearing. The hearing is conducted as a procedural conference and, as contemplated in subsection (4) of the statute a detailed memorandum of the matters covered is prepared subsequent thereto. That is the case here. A record is not necessary nor required. The proceeding basically covers disclosure. The procedure for substantive motions is clearly laid out in the memorandum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-5\">This method of conducting omnibus hearings is a longstanding practice in this jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-6\">As a practical matter, requiring the presence of defendants at omnibus hearings would create a substantial logistical problem.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqbr\">\u00b64 A second omnibus hearing was held on March 3, 2010, after the State filed an Amended Information. Heavygun was not present, and it does not appear that any objection was raised by defense counsel. \u00b65 Heavygun was represented by six different attorneys from the Office of the State Public Defender. Three were attorneys-of-record, while the other three appeared sporadically on behalf of the attorneys-of-record. Heavygun raised concerns about his representation before the District Court, saying during a March 30, 2010, status hearing, at which his attorney failed to appear, Tm going to need somebody that\u2019s going to represent me.\u201dThe District Court noted Heavygun\u2019s concerns and rescheduled the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">\u00b66 At the rescheduled status hearing, held April 5, 2010, Heavygun again raised concerns about his representation by his current and former counsel. Heavygun, through his attorney, informed the court that his prior counsel postponed trial dates on several occasions without his consent and as a remedy sought to have all charges dismissed for lack of speedy trial based on ineffective assistance. Heavygun\u2019s motion was denied, with the District Court noting Tmjaybe there\u2019s an ineffective assistance of counsel claim there that might be urged at some later date.\u201d Heavygun himself stated at the close of the hearing that there were <em>\u201ca </em>lot of motions that didn\u2019t get filed\u201d and that he was unable to \u201ccommunicate with my defender\u201d but was ready to go to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">\u00b67 Whether a district court has violated a criminal defendant\u2019s right to be present at all critical stages of the defendant\u2019s trial is a constitutional matter and our review is plenary. <em>State v. Charlie, </em>2010 MT 195, \u00b6 21, 357 Mont. 355, 239 P.3d 934 (citing <em>State v. Berosik, </em>2009 MT 260, \u00b6 27, 352 Mont. 16, 214 P.3d 776.).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">\u00b68 Ineffective assistance of counsel claims raise mixed questions of fact and law which we review de novo. <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6 9, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 861; <em>State v. Rovin, </em>2009 MT 16, \u00b6 24, 349 Mont. 57, 201 P.3d 780. We will review ineffective assistance claims on direct review when the claims are based solely on the record. <em>Rovin, </em>\u00b6 24. However, if the record does not demonstrate \u201cwhy\u201d counsel did or did not take an action which is the basis of the claim, the claim is more suitable for a petition for postconviction relief where a record can be more fully developed. <em>State v. Sartain, </em>2010 MT 213, \u00b6 30, 357 Mont. 483, 241 P.3d 1032.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">\u00b69 <em>Was Heavygun\u2019s right to be present at all critical stages of his criminal proceeding violated when he was not allowed to be present at his omnibus hearing?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">\u00b610 Heavygun argues that the District Court violated his constitutional and statutory rights to be present at all critical stages of his trial when it refused his request to be present at an omnibus hearing, and thus his convictions should be reversed. Heavygun urges this Court to hold the omnibus hearing a critical stage of the proceedings. The State counters that we should decline to review Heavygun\u2019s argument because he does not challenge the constitutionality of \u00a746-13-110, MCA. Alternatively, the State argues that the omnibus hearing is not a critical stage, and even if it was, Heavygun was not prejudiced by his absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">\u00b611  Both the United States Constitution and the Montana Constitution guarantee the defendant\u2019s right to be present at the criminal proceedings against him. U.S. Const. amend. VI; Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a724; <em>Charlie, </em>\u00b6 40. A defendant also has a due process right to be present in person whenever his presence has a reasonably substantial relation to the fullness of his opportunity to defend against the charge. <em>Charlie, </em>\u00b6 40; <em>State v. Price, </em>2009 MT 129, \u00b6 21, 350 Mont. 272, 207 P.3d 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">\u00b612 The fundamental right to be present applies, without exception, at all \u201ccritical stages\u201d of the proceedings. <em>Price, </em>\u00b6 22. A \u201ccritical stage\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>is any step of the proceeding where there is potential for substantial prejudice to the defendant. <em>Charlie, </em>\u00b6 40; <em>State v. Matt, </em>2008 MT 444, \u00b6 17, 347 Mont. 530, 199 P.3d 244 (overruled on other grounds by <em>Charlie, </em>\u00b6 45<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>); <em>Ranta v. State, </em>1998 MT 95, \u00b6 17, 288 Mont. 391, 958 P.2d 670. \u201cCritical stages\u201d include, but are not limited to: a telephone conference discussing the impact of newly discovered evidence on the defendant\u2019s trial, <em>Charlie, </em>\u00b6 41; an in-chambers conference discussing evidentiary issues and a motion to dismiss, <em>Matt, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19-20; individual, in-chambers voir dire of jurors, <em>Berosik, </em>\u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">\u00b613 When considering whether a district court has violated a defendant\u2019s right tobe present, we generally first consider whether the defendant was excluded from a \u201ccritical stage\u201d of the proceeding. <em>Price, </em>\u00b6 23. Where a district court has violated a defendant\u2019s right to be present, that violation alone does not constitute automatic reversible error. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 24. When the record shows the defendant was not prejudiced, we have affirmed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">\u00b614 Section 46-13-110, MCA, governs omnibus hearings. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-6\">(1) Within a reasonable time following the entry of a not guilty plea but not less than 30 days before trial, the court shall hold an omnibus hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-7\">(2) The purpose of the hearing is to expedite the procedures leading up to the trial of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-8\">(3) The presence of the defendant is not required, unless ordered by the court. The prosecutor and the defendant's counsel shall attend the hearing and must be prepared to discuss any pretrial matter appropriate to the case, including but not limited to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-9\">(a) joinder and severance of offenses or defendants, 46-11-404, 46-13-210, and 46-13-211;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-10\">(b) double jeopardy, 46-11-410, 46-11-503, and 46-11-504;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-11\">(c) the need for exclusion of the public and for sealing records of any pretrial proceedings, 46-11-701;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-12\">(d) notification of the existence of aplea agreement, 46-12-211;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-13\">(e) disclosure and discovery motions, Title 46, chapter 15, part 3;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-15\">(f) notice of reliance on certain defenses, 46-15-323;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-16\">(g) notice of seeking persistent felony offender status, 46-13-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>108;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-4\">(h) notice of other crimes, wrongs, or acts, 46-13-109;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-5\">(i) motion to suppress, 46-13-301 and 46-13-302;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">(j) motion to dismiss, 46-13-401 and 46-13-402;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\">(k) motion for change of place of trial, 46-13-203 through 46-13-205;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-8\">(l) reasonableness of bail, Title 46, chapter 9; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-9\">(m) stipulations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-10\">(4) At the conclusion of the hearing, a court-approved memorandum of the matters settled must be signed by the court and counsel and filed with the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-11\">(5) Any motions made pursuant to subsections (1) through (3) may be ruled on by the court at the time of the hearing, where appropriate, or may be scheduled for briefing and further hearing as the court considers necessary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-12\">\u00b615 The parties are statutorily mandated to bring any defense, objection, or request capable of determination without trial of the general issue, including motions to suppress, at or before the omnibus hearing, or at the latest, by the subsequent date ordered by the district court. <em>State v. VonBergen, </em>2003 MT 265, \u00b6 11, 317 Mont. 445, 77 P.3d 537; <em>but see State v. Passmore, </em>2010 MT 34, \u00b6 31, 355 Mont. 187, 225 P.3d 1229 (rejecting the argument that a motion to dismiss for preaccusation delay cannot be raised after the deadlines set by the trial court for filing other pretrial motions). A party\u2019s failure to do so constitutes a waiver. <em>VonBergen, </em>\u00b6 11; <em>State v. Griffing, </em>1998 MT 75, \u00b6 10, 288 Mont. 213, 955 P.2d 1388; \u00a746-13-101(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-13\">\u00b616  In Heavygun\u2019s case, he was not prejudiced by his absence from the omnibus hearing, so we decline to consider whether an omnibus hearing is a \u201ccritical stage.\u201d <em>See Price, </em>\u00b6 25. Our analysis will proceed assuming that the omnibus hearing was a critical stage, and it is clear from the record that Heavygun did not waive his right to be present. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b448-14\">\u00b617 Heavygun\u2019s absence from the omnibus hearing was not a structural defect. \u2018Structural defects are constitutional violations which so infect and contaminate the framework of a trial so as to render it fundamentally unfair, requiring automatic reversal.\u201d <em>Charlie, </em>\u00b6 40. Based on the record, as explained below, we cannot say that the omnibus hearing held August 5, 2009, rendered the trial, ultimately held in April 2010, so fundamentally unfair that reversal is required. Therefore, we proceed under the harmless error analysis. <em>See Charlie, </em>\u00b6 41. It is the State\u2019s burden to persuade the Court that the violation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Heavygun\u2019s absence from the omnibus hearing, was harmless. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">\u00b618 From the record, we can find no prejudice suffered by Heavygun. Here, the District Court met with counsel for Heavygun and the State at the omnibus hearing. No verbatim record was made, but a memorandum covering the discovery process, statutory notices, defenses, anticipated motions and a motion schedule, trial date, and jury instructions was completed by both counsel and filed. While it is true that failure to raise defenses, objections, or certain other matters constitutes waiver, none of these issues were waived in Heavygun\u2019s case. Heavygun\u2019s affirmative defense of justifiable use of force was disclosed. His intent to make numerous pre-trial motions was disclosed, including discovery motions, motions to dismiss for lack of speedy trial and on double jeopardy grounds, motions to suppress certain evidence, a motion to add witnesses, a motion in limine, and several additional motions relating to \u2018improper omnibus, venue, indiv. Voir dire, lack of P.C.\u201dNo substantive rulings on any statutorily listed motion could have been made, as the memorandum contains a briefing schedule for such motions. It appears that, after the omnibus hearing, only one motion in limine was made by Heavygun. Heavygun did not attempt to make any motion that was barred by failure to disclose it at the omnibus hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">\u00b619 Based on these facts, we find Heavygun suffered no prejudice as a result of his absence from the omnibus hearing. The District Court did not commit reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">\u00b620 <em>Was Heavygun\u2019s counsel ineffective?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">\u00b621 Heavygun argues his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel was violated because he did not have continuous representation by one attorney, but rather was \u201csubjected to a revolving door of three different attorneys of record\u201d along with others who appeared sporadically, and because his counsel failed to communicate with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">\u00b622 Criminal defendants are guaranteed the right to effective assistance of counsel. U.S. Const. amend. VI; Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a724; <em>Sartain, </em>\u00b6 29. We review claims of ineffective assistance of counsel under the two-pronged test articulated in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668 (1984). <em>Sartain, </em>\u00b6 29. However, when ineffective assistance of counsel claims are raised on direct appeal, we will first consider whether the claims are more appropriately addressed in a post-conviction proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 30. Because our review of ineffective assistance of counsel claims is subject to the \u201cstrong <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>presumption\u201d that counsel\u2019s actions fell \u201cwithin the wide range of reasonable professional assistance,\u201d a record which is silent about the reasons for counsel\u2019s actions or omissions seldom provides sufficient evidence to rebut this presumption. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, if the record does not demonstrate \u201cwhy\u201d counsel did or did not take an action which is the basis of the claim, the claim is more suitable for a petition for postconviction relief where a record can be more fully developed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"ACr\">\u00b623  Here, the record does not demonstrate the reasoning (the \u201cwhy\u201d) behind any of the alleged errors committed by Heavygun\u2019s counsel. His claims are better addressed in postconviction proceedings, where a record can be fully developed.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">\u00b624 For the reasons stated above, we affirm the District Court on the first issue, and dismiss Heavygun\u2019s ineffective assistance claims without prejudice to raising them in a postconviction proceeding.</p>\n<judges id=\"b450-6\">CHIEF JUSTICES McGRATH, JUSTICES MORRIS, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b447-17\"> <em>Matt </em>was overruled \u201cto the limited extent that <em>Matt </em>imposed a presumption of prejudice where the defendant is excluded from a critical stage of the proceedings in matters of non-structural error.\u201d <em>Charlie, </em>\u00b6 45.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
