Margot also appeals the March 2010 order of the District Court concluding that her ex-spouse, Scott L. Hart (Scott), did not owe her for back child support. Scott cross-appeals the District Court\u2019s 2010 order arguing it failed to award his attorney fees pursuant to the terms of the Marital and Property Settlement Agreement. Both Margot and Scott pray for attorney fees on appeal. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">\u00b62 A restatement of Margot\u2019s issues on appeal is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-11\">1. Did the District Court err when it concluded Margot\u2019s statements filed with the court indicating that Scott was current on his child support obligations as of September 2001 constitute judicial admissions and thus preclude an award of back child support?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-12\">2. Did the District Court err when it determined that Margot had filed inconsistent pleadings and imposed sanctions against her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-13\">3. Did the District Court err when it held that Scott did not owe Margot for back child support?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-14\">\u00b63 Scott raises the following issue on cross-appeal: did the District Court err by failing to award Scott his attorney fees pursuant to a \u201cprevailing party\u201d contractual provision, when the sanctions imposed on Margot covered only a portion of Scott\u2019s attorney fees?</p>\n<p id=\"b339-15\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b339-16\">\u00b64 Scott and Margot divorced in May 1993 and entered into a Marital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>and Property Settlement Agreement (hereinafter \u2018Settlement Agreement\u201d) before the District Court. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, Margot and Scott\u2019s two children would live primarily with Margot and Scott would pay Margot child support payments of $150 (later $200) per month plus half the cost of the children\u2019s uninsured medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">\u00b65 In October 2000, Scott filed a Motion to Amend the Parenting Plan to reflect changes in the children\u2019s residency arrangements. In her response brief to Scott\u2019s motion, Margot set forth the statutory criteria to determine the best interests of the child and, in doing so, made the statement that \u2018ft]here is no issue of Scott\u2019s having failed to pay child support.\u201d Following a contested hearing, each party submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Margot again made the statement in Proposed Finding No. 40 that Scott was current with his child support obligations, but the court did not ultimately adopt this finding. In December 2001, the District Court granted Scott\u2019s motion as to the residency arrangement of the children; it did not modify child or medical support obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">\u00b66 In March 2003, Scott suffered a catastrophic injury for which he received social security disability benefits. In February 2008, as a result of Scott\u2019s injury, Margot received a lump-sum social security payment of $8,097 for each child, and she began receiving dependent\u2019s benefits of $274 per month for each child.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">\u00b67 On June 9,2008, Margot filed a Motion for Determination of Back Child and Medical Support Amount Due, in which she requested a determination of the child and medical support amounts due to her from Scott. Margot claimed Scott owed her over $34,000 in back child and medical support dating back to 1993. On July 31, 2008, Scott filed his response, disputing Margot\u2019s claims and arguing that Margot\u2019s statements regarding back child support were contradictory to earlier statements made under oath and otherwise. On October 1, 2009, the court held a hearing in which it received testimony from Margot and Nicholas L. Bordeau, an expert in child support determination hired by Scott. Mr. Bordeau opined that Margot was overpaid by at least $3,230.12 for the child support, accrued interest, and medical expenses obligations of Scott for the period of September 25,2001, to March 26, 2003, regardless of whether the payments were applied first to principal and then to interest, or vice versa. The parties agreed that the lump-sum payment should be applied to Scott\u2019s outstanding child and medical support obligations; however, the parties disagreed as to whether the lump-sum should be applied first to principal or to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>interest. At that hearing, the court ordered that the lump-sum social security payment be applied first to principal and then to interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">\u00b68 Ultimately, the District Court found that Scott was current on child support obligations through September 25,2001, because Margot admitted as much in what the District Court concluded were judicial admissions. Further, the court found that the lump-sum social security payment was an overpayment, regardless of whether it was applied first to principal or to interest, and therefore concluded that Scott was not in arrearage for past due child or medical support. Finally, the court awarded Scott attorney fees and costs as a sanction, because it concluded Margot\u2019s pleadings were inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">\u00b69 Margot timely appeals these orders and prays for attorney fees. Scott cross-appeals the District Court\u2019s March 23, 2010 order and prays for attorney fees. Additional facts are included below as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">\u00b610 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>In re Szafryk, </em>2010 MT 90, \u00b6 18, 356 Mont. 141, 232 P.3d 361 (internal citations omitted). A finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the trial court has misapprehends the evidence, or if a review of the record leaves us with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>Id. </em>We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law for correctness. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">\u00b611 We review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of attorney fees for abuse of discretion. <em>In re Marriage of Gorton, </em>2008 MT 123, \u00b6 45, 342 Mont. 537, 182 P.3d 746 (citing <em>In re Marriage of Mease, </em>2004 MT 59, \u00b6 57, 320 Mont. 229, 92 P.3d 1148).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">\u00b612 <em>Issue One: Did the District Court err when it concluded Margot\u2019s statements filed with the court indicating that Scott was current on his child support obligations as of September 2001 constitute judicial admissions and thus preclude an award of back child support ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">\u00b613 Margot acknowledges that she stated \u201c[t]here is no issue of Scott\u2019s having failed to pay child support\u201d in her November 2000 response to Scott\u2019s Motion to Amend Parenting Plan, and again asserted that \u2018Scott is current with his child support obligations\u201d in her September 2001 Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law filed with the District Court. She argues, however, that these statements do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>constitute judicial admissions for two reasons. First, she asserts the statements are not judicial admissions because the issue of the children\u2019s residential arrangements, not child and medical support, were before the court when she made these statements. Second, she argues that her proposed finding cannot be a judicial admission because it was not ultimately adopted by the District Court in its December 21, 2001 order. However, Margot does not dispute either that she made these statements during the litigation surrounding interpretation of the Settlement Agreement or that they are statements of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">\u00b614 A judicial admission is \u201can express waiver made in court by a party or its counsel conceding the truth of an alleged fact,\u201d <em>Bitterroot Intl. Sys. v. Western Star Trucks, </em>Inc., 2007 MT 48, \u00b6 41, 336 Mont. 145, 153 P.3d 627. \u201cA judicial admission has a conclusive effect upon the party who makes it, and prevents that party from introducing further evidence to prove, disprove, or contradict the admitted fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citation omitted). To be binding, a judicial admission must be \u201can unequivocal statement of fact.\u201d <em>Denke v. Shoemaker, </em>2008 MT 418, \u00b6 84, 347 Mont. 322, 198 P.3d 284 (internal citation omitted). A judicial admission \u201cmay occur at any point in the litigation process.\u201d <em>Kohne v. Yost, </em>250 Mont. 109, 112, 818 P.2d 360, 362 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">\u00b615 Margot asserts that our review of judicial admissions must be guided by the five-part test set forth in <em>Conagra, Inc. v. Neirenberg, </em>2000 MT 213, \u00b6 45, 301 Mont. 55, 7 P.3d 369. However, <em>Conagra </em>is inapposite because the plain language of the five-part test and our analysis in that case clearly applies to testimonial declarations, not to pleadings and other documents filed with the court. <em>See Conagra, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 44-45. Here, we are not concerned with testimonial declarations, but instead with the two separate occasions on which Margot filed written statements with the district court unequivocally stating that Scott was current with his child support obligations through at least September 2001. We have not extended-and do not extend today-the five-part test set forth in <em>Conagra </em>to pleadings and documents filed with the district court. The policy concerns surrounding testimonial declarations-that declarants may be easily swayed by aggressive cross-examination-simply do not exist when statements are written.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">\u00b616 A written document, filed with a district court and signed by either the party or the party\u2019s attorney, is assumed to be, \u2018to the best of the signer\u2019s knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry ... well-grounded in fact and is warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>or reversal of existing law,\u201d as required by M. R. Civ. P. 11 (Rule 11). Both documents that contained Margot\u2019s statements above were signed by her attorney at the time and neither were superseded or withdrawn at any point. Thus, it was not error for the District Court to assume Margot\u2019s written statements were true and to conclude that the statements were judicial admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">\u00b617 Margot\u2019s alternative argumentAhat her September 2001 proposed finding of fact is not a judicial admission because the District Court did not adopt that finding-is likewise unsupported in law. On appeal Margot states that \u201cthe Montana Supreme Court has never examined whether judicial admissions may occur in proposed findings of fact and there is a split between how judicial admissions are treated at the Federal and State levels.\u201d She then cites two federal cases for the proposition that \u201cproposed findings of fact cannot constitute judicial admissions as they are \u2018no more than informal suggestions for the assistance of the court.\u2019 \u201d However, even a cursory reading of the federal cases cited by Margot reveals that neither stands for such a bold proposition. Moreover, both cases are factually inapposite: <em>City of Cleveland v. Cleveland Elec. Illuminating </em>Co., 538 F. Supp. 1257, 1280 (N.D. Ohio 1980), which is a pretrial order on numerous issues presented prior to a retrial, refers to the evidentiary admissibility of proposed findings that had been withdrawn by the party; and <em>Parker v. Stern Bros. &amp; Co., </em>499 S.W.2d 397, 411 (Mo. 1973), is a Missouri Supreme Court case that discusses proposed findings of fact from a related federal court case that were submitted as a basis for a pretrial order that was never signed. Margot cites no authority, nor do we find any, prohibiting district courtswvhich exercise independent judgment in reviewing proposed findings of fact-from ruling that statements made in proposed findings may constitute judicial admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">\u00b618  It is undisputed that Margot\u2019s statements were statements of fact. It is also undisputed that Margot made these unambiguous statements in filings with the District Court during the course of this case. We therefore conclude that these statements constitute judicial admissions and the District Court did not err in concluding that Scott was current with his child support payments through September 2001. We further conclude that the District Court did not err in concluding that these judicial admissions precluded Margot from now arguing the diametrically opposite position-that Scott owes her back child support from May 1993 until November 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">\u00b619 <em>Issue Two: Did the District Court err when it determined that Margot had filed inconsistent pleadings and imposed sanctions against </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number><em>her?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">\u00b620 In its June 2009 order, the District Court granted Scott\u2019s motion for attorney fees \u2018to the extent that any time [Scott\u2019s] attorney spent on the question of back child support... [shall be] awarded as sanctions for inconsistent pleadings of [Margot] as described [in this Order].\u201d In its March 2010 order, the District Court awarded Scott partial attorney fees \u201cattributable to the child support dispute in the amount of $18,962.75 as of July 13, 2009.\u201d The court order indicates that the amount of fees and costs is not contested, but the awarding of fees and costs is contested.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">\u00b621 Though the parties presume in their arguments on appeal that the District Court awarded fees as sanctions pursuant to Rule 11, nowhere in its orders does the court clearly state under what authority it did so-Rule 11, M. R. Civ. P. 26(g) (discovery sanctions), \u00a737-61-421, MCA, its inherent authority, or otherwise. Without knowing the legal basis for the sanction, it is impossible to ascertain whether the award constituted an abuse of discretion. However, we conclude it is unnecessary to remand for a determination of the legal authority supporting the imposition of fees as sanctions, in light of our disposition of Issue Four (\u00b6\u00b6 26-29), which resolves all outstanding questions regarding attorney fees. We therefore vacate the order of fees as a sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">\u00b622 <em>Issue Three: Did the District Court err when it held that Scott did not owe Margot for back child support?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">\u00b623 Margot argues, without citation to the record or much in the way of legal authority, that the District Court erred by relying on the testimony of Scott\u2019s expert witness, Nicholas Bordeau, at the hearing. She complains that Bordeau\u2019s analysis was erroneous because it presumed that Scott\u2019s excess social security disability payments should be applied first to the principal balance of child support arrearage and then to interest. Margot\u2019s cursory argument seems to be that such an application of social security payments misapplies Montana law because unpaid child support becomes a judgment debt similar to any other money judgment, and that payments thereon must first be applied to interest, rather than principal. Scott argues that the court did not err, and even if it did, the error was harmless because the bottom line was that regardless of whether the social security payment was applied first to principal or interest, the end result was that Margot was overpaid by roughly $3,230.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">\u00b624 Margot again cites to inapplicable case law as authority for her position in her opening brief. \u2018We have consistently held that, absent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>contrary provisions in a dissolution decree, interest on child support arrearage is automatically collectable by [the] judgment creditor spouse,\u201d and interpreted this to mean that district courts have latitude to calculate an award of child support payments and determine whether or not interest is available. <em>In re Marriage of Gingerich, </em>269 Mont. 161, 167, 887 P.2d 714, 717-18 (1994). Further, we have held that a lump-sum social security payment should be applied to a parent\u2019s arrearage from the time the parent was eligible for social security until the children\u2019s monthly benefits commence. <em>In re Marriage of Cowan, </em>279 Mont. 491, 503-04, 928 P.2d 214, 222 (1996) (relying on the plain language of Admin. R. M. 46.30.1542(1)(d), which was repealed in 1998 and transferred to Admin. R. M. 37.62.144(1)(d)).</p>\n<p id=\"AUm\">\u00b625  Here, the District Court heard testimony from Bordeau, a CPA and expert witness on child support calculations. The record is replete with testimony, explanations, and exhibits of how Bordeau calculated the amount of child support owed to Margot and how he applied the lump-sum social security payment to the arrearage from the date Scott was eligible for social security benefits until the date the children began receiving monthly social security payments. The record also establishes that Bordeau offered numerous different methods for calculating Scott\u2019s child support obligations (including payment of interest first then principal), and concluded that in every scenario Margot was overpaid. Based on the record, we hold that the District Court did not err in concluding that Scott did not owe Margot for back child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">\u00b626 <em>Issue Four: Did the District Court err by failing to award Scott his attorney fees pursuant to a \u2018\u2018prevailing party\u201d contractual provision when the sanctions imposed on Margot covered only a portion of Scott\u2019s attorney fees?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">\u00b627 Scott argues on cross-appeal that he is clearly the prevailing party and is entitled to recover all his attorney fees and costs, including those on appeal, pursuant to the attorney fees provision in the Settlement Agreement. Margot argues that Scott is not clearly the prevailing party because a reversal of any of the issues has a profound effect on the parties and their obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">\u00b628 Attorney fees provisions contained in marital settlement agreements are enforceable agreements and the district court is bound by the agreement\u2019s terms if they are clear. <em>In re Marriage of Caras, </em>263 Mont. 377, 385, 868 P.2d 615, 619-20 (1994). In determining who is the prevailing party for purposes of attorney fees, no one factor is dispositive. <em>Doig v. Cascaddan, </em>282 Mont. 105, 112-13, 935 P.2d 268, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>272 (1997) (citing <em>E.C.A. Env. Mgt., Inc. v. Toenyes, </em>208 Mont. 336, 345, 679 P.2d 213, 217-18 (1984)). The party who is awarded a money judgment is not necessarily the successful or prevailing party; however, it is an important item to consider when deciding who, in fact, prevails. <em>Doig, </em>282 Mont. at 112-13, 935 P.2d at 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">\u00b629  The language of the Settlement Agreement is clear-Section VII states \"in any action to enforce or interpret any provision of this agreement, the prevailing party shall receive costs and attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d Scott is clearly the prevailing party since the District Court determined not only that he was not in arrears on his child support obligation, but also that he had overpaid. Therefore, we conclude the District Court erred when it granted Scott only a portion of his attorney fees and costs as sanctions against Margot. By the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Scott should have been awarded all of his costs and attorney fees expended in defense of Margot\u2019s claims, as the prevailing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">\u00b630 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm in part and reverse in part and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion. We affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusions that Margot\u2019s statements constituted judicial admissions and that Scott did not owe Margot back child support. We vacate the District Court\u2019s imposition of fees as sanctions. We deny Margot\u2019s request for fees and grant Scott\u2019s cross-appeal. We reverse and remand for a hearing to determine all fees incurred by Scott in response to Margot\u2019s June 9, 2008 motion to determine back child and medical support both in the District Court and on appeal. Scott shall not, however, recover those fees incurred in connection with his cross-motion to revise child support and for a new parenting plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">\u00b631 Reversed and Remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b346-8\">JUSTICES NELSON, BAKER, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
