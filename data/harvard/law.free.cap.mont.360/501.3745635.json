We consider the following issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">\u00b62 <em>Did the District Court err in denying Kopp\u2019s motion to dismiss pursuant to \u00a7\u00a746-11-503 and -504, </em>MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">\u00b63 The parties stipulated to the facts relevant to Kopp\u2019s motion to dismiss. On January 5, 2009, Kopp was cited with misdemeanor possession of drug paraphernalia, namely a spoon and baggies, found by Jefferson County Deputy Sheriff Shaun Gardner in a small blue bag in Kopp\u2019s possession. The next day, Kopp appeared before the Jefferson County Justice Court and pled guilty to the charge. Later that day, preliminary testing was performed in which residue in one of the baggies tested presumptively positive for methamphetamine. No testing was done on the liquid substance found in a syringe in the blue bag at that time. Deputy Gardner prepared an inventory report of the blue bag\u2019s contents indicating the syringe contained insulin. All of this evidence was sent to the state crime lab for testing, except for the syringe, which was mistakenly not sent.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">\u00b64 In March 2009, the state crime lab reported that the residue on the spoon contained methamphetamine. The State charged Kopp in the District Court with criminal possession of dangerous drugs (methamphetamine), a felony, in violation of \u00a745-9-102, MCA, based on the residue found on the spoon. Kopp filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to \u00a7\u00a746-11-503 and - 504, MCA, due to her prior conviction on the paraphernalia charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">\u00b65 Deputy Gardner discovered the syringe had not been sent. He forwarded it to the crime lab for testing and, in May 2009, the lab reported the substance in the syringe tested positive for methadone.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The State moved for leave to amend the information from possession of dangerous drugs (methamphetamine) to possession of dangerous drugs (methadone), a felony, in violation of \u00a745-9-102, MCA. After leave was granted and the State filed an amended information, Kopp renewed her motion to dismiss under \u00a7\u00a746-11-503 and - 504, MCA, asserting possession of the blue bag and the entirety of its contents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>constituted a single transaction for which she had already been convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">\u00b66 The District Court conducted a hearing and denied the motion in a ruling from the bench. Kopp then entered an <em>Alford </em>plea to the charge, reserving the right to appeal the denial of her motion to dismiss. The District Court imposed a three-year deferred sentence to the Department of Corrections. Kopp appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">\u00b67 We review de novo a district court\u2019s decision on a motion to dismiss in a criminal case. <em>State v. James, </em>2010 MT 175, \u00b6 12, 357 Mont. 193, 237 P.3d 672 (citing <em>State v. Gazda, </em>2003 MT 350, \u00b6 10, 318 Mont. 516, 82 P.3d 20).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">\u00b68 <em>Did the District Court err in denying Kopp\u2019s motion to dismiss pursuant to \u00a7\u00a746-11-503 and -504, MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">\u00b69 Kopp claims that the District Court erred by denying her motion to dismiss under \u00a746-11-504, MCA,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> arguing that her conviction \u201cwas based on the same transaction as her prior conviction injustice court.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We have applied a three-part test to determine when a subsequent prosecution is barred under this provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-10\">\u201c(1) a defendant\u2019s conduct constitutes an offense within the jurisdiction of the court where the first prosecution occurred and within the jurisdiction of the court where the subsequent prosecution is pursued;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-11\">(2) the first prosecution resulted in an acquittal or a conviction; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-12\">(3) the subsequent prosecution is based on an offense arising out of the same transaction [as that term is defined in \u00a746-1-202(23), MCA].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number><em>State v. Cech, </em>2007 MT 184, \u00b6 13, 338 Mont. 330, 167 P.3d 389 (quoting <em>State v. Tadewaldt, </em>277 Mont. 261, 264, 922 P.2d 463, 465 (1996)). For a subsequent prosecution to be barred under \u00a746-11-504(1), MCA, all three factors must be met. <em>State v. Neufeld, </em>2009 MT 235, \u00b6 12, 351 Mont. 389, 212 P.3d 1063 (citing <em>Gazda, </em>\u00b6 12). The statute \u201cprovides criminal defendants with greater protection against double jeopardy than the traditional double jeopardy \u2018elements\u2019 test set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Blockburger v. United States </em>(1932), 284 U.S. 299, 52 S. Ct. 180, 76 L. Ed. 306.\u201d <em>Gazda, </em>\u00b6 12 (citing <em>Tadewaldt, </em>277 Mont. at 268, 922 P.2d at 467). The District Court denied Kopp\u2019s motion on the basis of factor three, concluding that the offenses here did not arise from the same transaction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AHpL\">\u00b610 \u2018Same transaction\u201d is defined, in relevant part, as \u201cconduct consisting of a series of acts or omissions that are motivated by: (a) a purpose to accomplish a criminal objective and that are necessary or incidental to the accomplishment of that objective.\u201d Section 46-1-202(23), MCA. We have explained that \u201coffenses arise from the same transaction when a defendant\u2019s underlying conduct of each prosecution is motivated by a purpose to accomplish the same criminal objective\u201d and that the same transaction factor is not satisfied \u201cwhen conduct charged in a subsequent prosecution is distinct from conduct charged in the initial prosecution.\u201d <em>Gazda, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20, 21 (citing <em>State v. Sword, </em>229 Mont. 370, 374, 747 P.2d 206, 208-09 (1987); <em>see also Tadewaldt, </em>277 Mont. at 266-67, 922 P.2d at 466).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">\u00b611 Kopp argues that her offenses of possession of drug paraphernalia and possession of dangerous drugs arose out of the same transaction because they share the purpose, motivation, and criminal objective of possessing and using drugs. She argues that the contents of the blue bag formed the basis of both offenses and that her possession of paraphernalia was necessary and incidental to the criminal objective of ingesting a dangerous drug. She urges we reach the same result as in <em>Sword. </em>The State replies the charges are not part of the same transaction because Kopp\u2019s possession of paraphernalia was separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>and distinct from her possession of dangerous drugs, arguing the paraphernalia had previously been used to ingest methamphetamine, while the syringe contained methadone to be used in the future by Kopp or another person. The State likens this case to our decision in <em>Tadewaldt.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">\u00b612 In <em>Sword, </em>we concluded that a Montana prosecution for making a false statement on a grizzly bear trophy license application arose out of the same transaction as the defendant\u2019s federal conviction for violating the Endangered Species Act of 1973. <em>Sword, </em>229 Mont. at 371-72, 374, 747 P.2d at 207, 209. The defendant killed a grizzly bear in a wilderness area where grizzly bear hunting was prohibited and lied on his bear trophy license application about where he killed the bear. <em>Sword, </em>229 Mont. at 371, 747 P.2d at 207. He pled guilty in federal court to violating the Endangered Species Act and was later charged in state justice court for subscribing to a materially false statement on the trophy license application. <em>Sword, </em>229 Mont. at 371-72, 747 P.2d at 207. We considered the conduct underlying each offense and reasoned that the \u201cfalse statements on his trophy license application.... as well as his other acts were motivated and necessary or at least incidental to the accomplishment of the criminal objective of possessing, carrying, and transporting of a grizzly bear taken unlawfully.\u201d <em>Sword, </em>229 Mont. at 374, 747 P.2d at 208-09; <em>see also James, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 6-9, 15 (concluding the charges of fleeing from or eluding a police officer and criminal endangerment, involving the same high-speed car chase, arose out of the same transaction because the \u201ccriminal objective-driving at high speed to elude capturewvas the same as to each charge\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">\u00b613 In <em>Tadewaldt </em>we concluded that the charge of criminal possession of dangerous drugs did not arise from the same transaction as the defendant\u2019s charge of driving under the influence (DUI). <em>Tadewaldt, </em>277 Mont. at 267, 922 P.2d at 466. Upon defendant\u2019s arrest for DUI, several pills were found in his possession which were later identified as dangerous drugs, leading to a possession charge. <em>Tadewaldt, </em>277 Mont. at 263, 922 P.2d at 464. After judgment was entered on the misdemeanor DUI charge, defendant moved to dismiss the possession charge. <em>Tadewaldt, </em>277 Mont. at 264, 922 P.2d at 464. We distinguished <em>Sword, </em>reasoning the defendant\u2019s criminal objective for DUI was unrelated to his possession of dangerous drugs. <em>Tadewaldt, </em>277 Mont. at 266-67, 922 P.2d at 466. We noted the defendant had completed his \u201ccriminal objective\u201d of DUI before the drugs were found in his possession, and that the drugs \u2018had not been ingested and did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>not contribute to Tadewaldt\u2019s impairment.\u201d <em>Tadewaldt, </em>277 Mont. at 267, 922 P.2d at 466. We concluded that \"in statutory terms, Tadewaldt\u2019s conduct in possessing the dangerous drugs was not motivated by a purpose to accomplish the \u2018criminal objective\u2019 of DUI, nor was it necessary or incidental to that \u2018objective,\u2019\u201d and thus the defendant\u2019s conduct did not meet the definition of \u201csame transaction\u201d under the statute. <em>Tadewaldt, </em>277 Mont. at 267, 922 P.2d at 466<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">\u00b614 Here, the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-5\">I\u2019m prepared to accept Defendant\u2019s argument that possession of paraphernalia ... and possession of a syringe loaded with some unknown liquid ... arguably could have had, the same criminal objective; but I do not believe that it is so perfectly apparent that it must have had the same criminal objective, that it will fall within the same transaction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-6\">I don\u2019t think there is anything in the evidencemotwithstanding the proximity of the items within this blue container-that show that Defendant must have had the same state of mind, must have had the same intent, must have had the same purpose, must have had the same knowing conduct, to create the same criminal objective for a spoon and a baggie, that is, paraphernalia, as the syringe loaded with an unknown substance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">The court reasoned that \u201cspatial proximity\u201d was not \u201csufficient to ascertain whether there is the same criminal objective,\u201d and observed distinctions between the paraphernalia having \u201cresidue involving methamphetamine, and [] this previously unknown liquid now is ascertained to be methadone,\u2019\u2019further noting that \u201cthere is no evidence here that there was any needle, so that would suggest that this perhaps is not paraphernalia for purposes of ingesting.\u201d The court concluded \u201cwe\u2019re not dealing with the same transaction ... notwithstanding that there was a previous conviction in connection with drug paraphernalia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">\u00b615  We conclude the District Court did not err. The spoon and baggies which served as the basis for the paraphernalia charge had been used at the time of seizure, with residue thereon testing positive for methamphetamine. The syringe was full of a different drug, revealed upon testing to be methadone. The District Court noted there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>was no evidence of the presence of a needle to suggest the syringe itself was \u201cparaphernalia for purposes of ingesting.\u201d Absent a connection between the paraphernalia with meth residue and the syringe full of methadone, these items supported separate charges that were not \u201cnecessary or incidental\u201dto a single criminal objective. <em>Tadewaldt, </em>277 Mont. at 267, 922 P.2d at 466. In the stipulated facts, Kopp summarized her motion as one \u201casserting possession of the blue bag and its contents constituted a single transaction for which she has already been convicted.\u201d However, as the District Court reasoned, the \u201cspatial proximity\u201d of these items within the blue bag is not sufficient, by itself, to connect these items in a single objective. Based on this record, we must conclude Kopp\u2019s possession of these items constituted separate criminal objectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">\u00b616 We conclude that the charges do not fall within the meaning of \u201csame transaction\u201d under \u00a746-1-202(23)(a), MCA. Because all of the factors under the three-part test must be satisfied, we decline to address the parties\u2019 arguments relating to factor one, as factor three is dispositive of Kopp\u2019s argument under this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">\u00b617 Kopp also argues that her prosecution for possession of methadone is barred by \u00a746-ll-503(l)(b), MCA. That section provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-6\">(1) When two or more offenses are known to the prosecutor, are supported by probable cause, and are consummated prior to the original charge and jurisdiction and venue of the offenses lie in a single court, a prosecution is barred if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-7\">(b) the former prosecution resulted in a conviction that has not been set aside, reversed, or vacated[.]<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKx\">Section 46-11-503(1)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">\u00b618 The District Court denied Kopp\u2019s motion to dismiss under this provision on the grounds that neither the knowledge nor the probable cause elements had been satisfied. The court concluded that probable cause for possession of a dangerous drug in the syringe had not been established as of the first conviction because \u201cnobody knew until the test was undertaken sometime later.\u201d The court further reasoned that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>the consideration of whether two or more offenses were known to the prosecutor was a subjective test and that \u2018there isn\u2019t anything in the statute that refers to the officer\u2019s knowledge being transferred to the prosecutor, or officer\u2019s knowledge being charged to the State,\u201d concluding Kopp\u2019s arguments under this element were insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"Asr\">\u00b619 Kopp argues the elements of the statute were satisfied because the record indicates that Deputy Gardner believed he was investigating both offenses when he inventoried the contents of the blue bag and that this knowledge should be imputed to the prosecutor. The State argues that the statute does not bar the subsequent prosecution as the prosecutor did not know that Kopp had committed the offense of possessing dangerous drugs before she pled guilty to the misdemeanor, pointing out that Deputy Gardner\u2019s report listed that the syringe contained insulin. The State further argues that, in any event, the statute does not provide that an officer\u2019s knowledge is imputed to the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">\u00b620  Kopp pled guilty to misdemeanor possession of drug paraphernalia one day after she was cited for the misdemeanor, prior to any testing. Deputy Gardner inventoried the contents of the blue bag in a -written report dated as delivered by the deputy on January 6, 2009, the same day that Kopp entered her plea to the misdemeanor charge. His report noted a \u201csyringe of insulin,\u201d and the notations for type of offense included \u201cPODP\u201d (shorthand for possession of drug paraphernalia) and TODD\u201d (shorthand for possession of dangerous drugs). Kopp\u2019s argument is premised upon inferring that Deputy Gardner\u2019s knowledge that the substance in the syringe could have been dangerous drugs, presumably demonstrated by the notation in the report and prior to actual testing, should be imputed to the prosecutor, thus eliminating the prosecutor\u2019s ability to rely upon the report\u2019s statement that the substance in the syringe was insulin. However, this would defeat the plain meaning of the statute, which requires that \u201ctwo or more offenses are known to the prosecutor ....\u2019\u2019Section 46-11-503(1), MCA. The prosecutor did not know what the substances were until testing was conducted later. We conclude the District Court did not err in denying Kopp\u2019s motion under \u00a746-11-503(1)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">\u00b621 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b538-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b532-10\"> Methadone is defined as an opiate, a Schedule II drug. <em>See </em>\u00a7 50-32-224(2)(o), MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b533-13\"> Section 46-11-504, MCA, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-14\">When conduct constitutes an offense within the jurisdiction of any state or federal court, a prosecution in any jurisdiction is a bar to a subsequent prosecution in this state if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-15\">(1) the first prosecution resulted in an acquittal or in a conviction and the subsequent prosecution is based on an offense arising out of the same transaction!.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b533-16\"> As she did in the District Court, Kopp briefly references the Montana Constitution but does not develop constitutional arguments.
