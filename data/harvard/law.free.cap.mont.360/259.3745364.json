PaeifiCorp cross-appeals the District Court\u2019s conclusion that sufficient evidence existed in the record to support STAB\u2019s conclusion that additional obsolescence did not exist to merit further adjustments to the Department\u2019s original-cost-less-depreciation indicator of value.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">\u00b62 We review the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">\u00b63 <em>Does substantial evidence demonstrate common acceptance of the Department\u2019s direct capitalization method that derives earnings-to-price ratios from an industry-wide analysis?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">\u00b64 <em>Does substantial evidence support STAB\u2019s conclusion that additional obsolescence did not exist to warrant consideration of further adjustments to PacifiCorp\u2019s taxable </em>value?</p>\n<p id=\"b290-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b290-14\">\u00b65 The Department centrally assesses about 130 companies every year. The Department issued its final 2005 ad valorem assessment of PaeifiCorp\u2019s Montana operating properties on May 26,2005. PaeifiCorp appealed the 2005 assessment to STAB. STAB upheld the Department\u2019s assessment after a six-day hearing. PaeifiCorp appealed. The District Court rejected the Department\u2019s earnings-to-price ratios method for appraising PacifiCorp\u2019s property and upheld the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Department\u2019s conclusion that additional obsolescence did not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"ARk\">\u00b66 PacifiCorp, a regulated electric utility company, owns electric generation property in Montana and nine western states. PacifiCorp provides electricity to 1.6 million consumers. PacifiCorp Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, wholly owned PacifiCorp as of January 1, 2005. At that time, ScottishPower, a Scotland corporation, owned PacifiCorp Holdings, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">\u00b67 ScottishPower announced on May 24, 2005, that it would sell all of the common stock that it owned in PacifiCorp to MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company (MidAmerican). MidAmerican agreed to purchase ScottishPower\u2019s common stock in PacifiCorp for $5.1 billion and assume approximately $4.3 billion of PacifiCorp\u2019s debt for a total sales price of $9.4 billion. The transaction closed on March 21, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"AYq\">\u00b68 The Department centrally assessed PacifiCorp\u2019s operating property in 2005 according to the unit method of valuation. The Department used four methods to calculate a correlated unit value for PacifiCorp\u2019s properties: (1) original cost less depreciation, (2) direct capitalization of net operating income, (3) direct capitalization of gross cash flow, and (4) yield capitalization. PacifiCorp takes no issue with the Department\u2019s calculations under the direct-capitalization-of-gross-cash-flow method or the yield-capitalization method.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\u00b69 The Department assessed PacifiCorp\u2019s value to be $8,581,317,664 according to the original-cost-less-depreciation method. The Department weighted the original-cost-less-depreciation indicator at 50%. The Department\u2019s assessment based on the direct-capitalization-of-net-operating-income indicator yielded a value of $7,359,184,623. The Department weighted the direct-capitalization-of-net-operating-income indicator at 40%. The Department weighted the other two uncontested indicators at 5% each. The Department reached a $7,837,244,000 correlated unit value for PacifiCorp\u2019s properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">\u00b610 The Department reduced the correlated unit value by 10% for non-taxable intangibles. Section 15-6-218, MCA; Admin. R. M. 42.22.110. The Department multiplied PacifiCorp\u2019s taxable value of $7,053,520,000 by a 1.5757 allocation percentage. The allocation percentage represents the value of PacifiCorp\u2019s Montana properties in relation to PacifiCorp\u2019s total value. The Department made other deductions and additions and concluded that PacifiCorp\u2019s Montana market value equaled $117,286,836. PacifiCorp does not challenge these other deductions and additions, the default 10% intangible deduction, or the 1.5757 allocation percentage.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">\u00b611 PacifiCorp raised several issues before STAB regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Department\u2019s assessment. PacifiCorp challenged the Department\u2019s use of earnings-to-price ratios to calculate a direct-capitalization-of-net-operating-income indicator of value. PacifiCorp also argued that the Department\u2019s use of the original-cost-less-depreciation method did not comply with Montana law because the Department\u2019s method failed to adjust for obsolescence.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">\u00b612 STAB heard lay and expert testimony from both parties during the six-day hearing. STAB decided that the Department had not overvalued PacifiCorp\u2019s properties. STAB upheld the Department\u2019s use of earnings-to-price ratios. STAB agreed that no additional obsolescence existed, even though STAB concluded that the Department had not separately analyzed obsolescence. STAB noted that PacifiCorp\u2019s $9.4 billion sale to MidAmerican supported the Department\u2019s conclusion that no obsolescence existed to warrant additional deductions to the Department\u2019s appraised value of $7.8 billion.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\u00b613 PacifiCorp appealed to the District Court. The court reversed STAB\u2019s decision regarding the earnings-to-price ratios method based on the court\u2019s conclusion that substantial evidence did not show common acceptance of the method. The court further determined that STAB wrongly had relied on the sales price of PacifiCorp to MidAmerican. The court concluded nonetheless that substantial, credible evidence in the record otherwise supported STAB\u2019s decision that no economic obsolescence existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">\u00b614 The Department now appeals the court\u2019s conclusion regarding its use of earnings-to-price ratios. PacifiCorp cross-appeals the conclusion that no additional obsolescence existed to merit an additional deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">\u00b615 We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law for correctness. <em>State v. PPL Mont., LLC, </em>2007 MT 310, \u00b6 19, 340 Mont. 124, 172 P.3d 1241. We review a district court\u2019s order affirming or reversing an administrative decision of STAB to determine whether the findings are clearly erroneous and to determine whether STAB correctly has interpreted the law. <em>Id. </em>We defer to STAB\u2019s findings unless they are clearly erroneous, because STAB is particularly suited for settling disputes over the appropriate valuation of property. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 45. A decision of STAB may be reversed or modified if STAB\u2019s findings, inferences, or conclusions are clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record. <em>Dept. of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number><em>Revenue v. Grouse Mt. Dev., </em>218 Mont. 353, 355, 707 P.2d 1113, 1115 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">\u00b616 <em>Does substantial evidence demonstrate common acceptance of the Department\u2019s direct capitalization method that derives earnings-to-price ratios from an industry-wide analysis?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">\u00b617 The Department must assess all of a company\u2019s taxable property at 100% of its market value. Section 15-8-111(1), MCA. For the 2005 tax year, the Department centrally assessed PacifiCorp\u2019s value according to the unit method of valuation. Section 15-23-101, MCA; Admin. R. M. 42.22.102 to 42.22.111. The unit method of valuation calculates the value of a business\u2019s entire operating system as a going concern and as a single entity, including all tangible and intangible operating assets of the company. Admin. R. M. 42.22.101(30)-(31). The unit method authorizes the appraiser to consider cost, income, and market approaches to determine a business\u2019s market value. Admin. R. M. 42.22.111(1). The appraiser then applies correlation percentages to the different approaches to establish an overall system market value. Admin. R. M. 42.22.111(2)-(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">\u00b618 The Department must make its tax assessment according to commonly accepted methods and techniques for determining market value. Admin. R. M. 42.22.111(1). The Department used the direct-capitalization-of-net-operating-income method as one of its four appraisal methods. This method calculates a company\u2019s value by dividing the company\u2019s annual income by a \u201ccapitalization rate.\u201d PacifiCorp does not dispute that the direct-capitalization-of-net-operating-income method has been commonly accepted as a valuation method. PacifiCorp disputes the Department\u2019s use of earnings-to-price ratios in determining the capitalization rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">\u00b619 The Department typically derives a capitalization rate from comparable sales of similar properties. The unavailability of comparable sales information required the Department to use earnings-to-price ratios to calculate the capitalization rate for PacifiCorp\u2019s assessment. The Department followed the band of investment theory to derive a weighted average direct capitalization rate. Admin. R. M. 42.22.114(2). The band of investment theory compares the capital structure of businesses in the same industry with the capital structure of the assessed company, including comparisons of common equity, preferred stock, and debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">\u00b620 The Department separately had conducted its 2005 industry-wide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Capitalization Rate Study for Electric Utilities. The Department relied on the study for PacifiCorp\u2019s assessment. The Department first selected comparable companies from the electric utility industry group in the Value Line Investment Survey. The Department then collected data related to those companies\u2019 earnings and stock prices. The Department gathered its \u201cearnings\u201d data from the Value Line Investment Survey and its \u201cprice\u201d data from Yahoo Finance. The Department used this information to derive earnings-to-price ratios. Earnings-to-price ratios represent the annual earnings per share of common stock divided by the average market price per share for common stock. The Department\u2019s earnings-to-price ratios represent, in its estimation, the calculations that would be used by willing buyers and sellers of electric utilities in the market. The Department used the earnings-to-price ratios to derive a capitalization rate of 6.5% that would be used in PacifiCorp\u2019s assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">\u00b621 The Department must rely on information derived from industry-wide analyses in part because the Department has no other way to obtain more relevant information for its tax assessment. The Department obtained some information from PacifiCorp\u2019s property tax manager, Norman Ross, at an informal hearing. Otherwise the Department had to rely on information from PacifiCorp\u2019s public filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">\u00b622 Sections 15-23-103 and 15-23-301, MCA, required PacifiCorp to file its return with the Department by March 31,2005, and to provide the Department with the information needed to prepare the assessment. Admin. R. M. 42.22.105. PacifiCorp filed its return on March 30, 2005, but did not provide all the information requested by the Department for the preparation of its assessment. STAB catalogued the missing items in one of its findings. These missing items included a finalized FERC Form 1, the Montana Form E-47, information on PacifiCorp\u2019s projected cashflows, and other documents. The Department, as a result of the missing items, turned to its industry-wide capitalization rate study and the income method to derive an estimate of PacifiCorp\u2019s value on the information otherwise available.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">\u00b623 As a regulated electric utility, PacifiCorp must file financial information with FERC. PacifiCorp provides audited statements of its financial status in a public filing called FERC Form 1. The Department used information from PacifiCorp\u2019s 2003 and 2004 FERC Form 1 filings to calculate PacifiCorp\u2019s average net operating income of $462 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>million. The Department divided PacifiCorp\u2019s average net operating income by the 6.5% capitalization rate to reach an estimated value for PacifiCorp of $7.1 billion. The Department made additional adjustments and reached a direct-capitalization-of-net-operating-income indicator of $7.3 billion.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">\u00b624 PacifiCorp argues on appeal that other jurisdictions and appraisal textbooks generally have not accepted the use of an industry-wide analysis to derive a capitalization rate for appraising centrally assessed utility properties. The Department counters that expert testimony, textbook authority, and the Department\u2019s long-standing practice support its use of earnings-to-price ratios in calculating value. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">\u00b625 Department employees and expert witnesses testified in support of the Department\u2019s use of earnings-to-price ratios. Department employees testified that the earnings-to-price ratios represent a standard methodology that the Department has used for several industries over several years. The Department\u2019s witnesses identified the Unit Valuation Standards of the National Conference of Unit Value States (NCUVS) as the Department\u2019s authority for use of the earnings-to-price ratios method. The Department admitted NCUVS\u2019s Unit Valuation Standards as a trial exhibit.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">\u00b626 The Department presented the expert testimony of Brent Eyre, an Accredited Senior Appraiser with the American Society of Appraisers. Eyre testified that the earnings-to-price ratios method has been used widely to appraise centrally-assessed companies. He testified that 36 or 37 states conduct unit valuations of centrally assessed properties. Eyre confirmed that the NCUVS standards provide the basis for using earnings-to-price ratios in appraising property owned by centrally assessed companies. Eyre provided that the Department performed the \u201ccorrect analysis\u201d when it analyzed earnings-to-price ratios to derive a capitalization rate in light of the fact that complete sales of electric companies rarely occur. Eyre cited three appraisal textbooks that support use of the earnings-to-price ratios method under these circumstances, including one textbook described as \u201cone of the most widely read textbooks on corporate valuation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">\u00b627 Eyre also authored an expert report that evaluated the Department\u2019s appraisal. Eyre\u2019s report validated the Department\u2019s use of earnings-to-price ratios. Eyre conducted an independent appraisal of PacifiCorp. Eyre analyzed thirteen selected guideline companies and derived a capitalization rate of 6.3%. The Department had derived a rate of 6.5%. The similarity in rates, as well as Eyre\u2019s expert testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>and report, supports the reasonableness and validity of the Department\u2019s appraisal method.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">\u00b628 The Department\u2019s expert, James Ifflander, also testified that the Department appropriately calculated value according to the directcapitahzation-of-net-operating-income method. Ifflander provided that sound financial theory supported the Department\u2019s method. Ifflander explained that financial analysts and investment banks routinely use earnings-to-price ratios to derive values of complex, integrated units, such as PacifiCorp. Both sophisticated buyers and sellers of electric utility assets, according to Ifflander, widely use the method employed by the Department. Ifflander provided three examples of mergers of electric utility companies where the parties had calculated value according to an earnings-to-price ratios method. Ifflander testified that even MidAmerican had used an earnings-to-price ratios method similar to the Department\u2019s when it sought to determine a value for its 2006 purchase of PacifiCorp.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">\u00b629 PacifiCorp challenged the Department\u2019s earnings-to-price ratios method. PacifiCorp\u2019s tax manager, Norman Ross, testified that none of the other states in which PacifiCorp operates used an earnings-to-price ratios method like that used by the Department in 2005. PacifiCorp\u2019s experts Hal B. Heaton and Thomas Tegarden testified that the general appraisal literature did not support the Department\u2019s use of earnings-to-price ratios in the direct capitalization method.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">\u00b630 The District Court concluded that the NCUVS standards provided weak authority for upholding the Department\u2019s use of earnings-to-price ratios as a commonly accepted methodology. The court specifically expressed concern with an \u201cadmission\u201d made by the Department\u2019s expert, Wilson, that he had not heard of NCUVS. Our review of the record reveals, however, that Wilson\u2019s \u201cadmission\u201d arose randomly in the middle of unrelated testimony regarding depreciation and obsolescence. PacifiCorp\u2019s counsel stated immediately after Wilson\u2019s \u201cadmission\u201d that he would follow-up on \u201cthat in just one moment then.\u201d PacifiCorp failed to follow-up or ask Wilson about the \u201cacceptance\u201d of using earnings-to-price ratios by the appraisal community.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">\u00b631 Wilson\u2019s expertise included public utility company issues, especially those issues relating to rate regulation. Wilson testified for the Department regarding whether the Department should have included obsolescence in its assessment of PacifiCorp. We disagree with the District Court that Wilson made an \u201cadmission\u201d on the separate issue of the appropriateness of earnings-to-price ratios in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>Department\u2019s assessment of PacifiCorp that requires reversal of STAB\u2019s conclusion. The remaining evidence in the trial record supports STAB\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">\u00b632 For example, the Department\u2019s expert on earnings-to-price ratios, Brent Eyre, testified that the NCUVS standards promoted the use of earnings-to-price ratios. Further, the Department admitted the NCUVS standards into evidence as a trial exhibit. The NCUVS standards explicitly advocate for the use of earnings-to-price ratios in a direct capitalization model. Other Department witnesses testified regarding their familiarity with NCUVS, including Kory Holland, who currently served as the vice chair of NCUVS, and Department expert, James Ifflander, who had presented at NCUVS conferences. We disagree with the District Court that the isolated, out-of-context \u201cadmission\u201d by Wilson, who testified primarily on obsolescence, provides grounds to reverse STAB\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">\u00b633 The District Court also relied on testimony from PacifiCorp\u2019s expert, Hal Heaton, that four other states disfavored use of the earnings-to-price ratios in the direct capitalization method. Heaton\u2019s testimony and his accompanying trial exhibit demonstrate that these states disfavored use of the method based on their concern that it too effectively captures the value of non-taxable intangible property and overestimates the taxable value of a company. The District Court misapprehended the record when it assumed that these other states disfavored the method because it caused inaccurate assessments altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">\u00b634 Montana appraisers initially must assess a business\u2019s entire operating system, including intangibles, at 100% market value and then deduct and adjust for exempt properties like intangibles. Sections 15-8-111, 15-6-218, MCA. Montana\u2019s mandate to appraise at 100% market value makes an approach that effectively captures intangible value all the more favorable. As the Department\u2019s expert, Brent Eyre, explained, these other states\u2019 concern that the earnings-to-price method too effectively accounts for non-taxable intangible value <em>further supports </em>the Department\u2019s use of the method in fulfilling its statutory mandate to appraise initially at 100% market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">\u00b635 The court also failed to recognize Eyre\u2019s explanation that the states identified by Heaton may have statutory schemes that adjust for intangible value differently than Montana\u2019s. Eyre compared Montana and Utah as an example. Both Utah and Montana exempt intangible property from taxation. Unlike Montana\u2019s requirement to initially value at 100% market value, however, Utah\u2019s statutory scheme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>requires the appraiser to exclude the value of exempt intangible property throughout its initial assessment. Eyre\u2019s explanation of the statutory distinction illustrates why some states may disfavor the direct capitalization approach that relies on earnings-to-price ratios. We also point out that neither Heaton, nor PacifiCorp\u2019s other experts, offered a counter argument to Eyre\u2019s explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">\u00b636  STAB sat in the best position to draw a conclusion from conflicting evidence. <em>PPL Mont., LLC, </em>\u00b6 45. The District Court exceeded its scope of review and second-guessed STAB\u2019s decision. Section 2-4-704(2), MCA. The Department\u2019s lay and expert witness testimony, expert reports, and trial exhibits comprise substantial evidence to uphold STAB\u2019s conclusion that the Department\u2019s earnings-to-price ratios method of valuation has been commonly accepted in the appraisal community.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">\u00b637 <em>Does substantial evidence support STAB\u2019s conclusion that additional obsolescence did not exist to warrant consideration of further adjustments to PacifiCorp\u2019s taxable value?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">\u00b638 Section 15-8-111(2)(b), MCA, requires that the Department \u201cshall fully consider reduction in value caused by depreciation, whether through physical depreciation, functional obsolescence, or economic obsolescence.\u201d PacifiCorp argued during the STAB hearing that the Department had failed to \u2018fully consider\u201d and adjust for obsolescence. PacifiCorp specifically faulted the Department for not conducting a separate study on obsolescence that might have unveiled additional deductible obsolescence not accounted for under the Department\u2019s original-cost-less-depreciation method of appraisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">\u00b639 STAB concluded that the Department had failed its statutory duty to \u2018fully consider reduction\u201d in value for obsolescence. Nonetheless, STAB concluded that the Department\u2019s $7.1 billion appraisal reasonably reflected PacifiCorp\u2019s taxable value as shown by substantial evidence in the record and the $9.4 billion sales price. The District Court reversed in part and affirmed in part. The court reversed STAB\u2019s conclusion that STAB could consider the $9.4 billion sales price to verify the reasonableness of the $7.1 billion appraisal. The court affirmed STAB\u2019s decision to uphold the Department\u2019s $7.1 billion appraisal, however, based on substantial evidence in the record that otherwise supported the Department\u2019s conclusion that additional obsolescence deductions were not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">\u00b640 PacifiCorp now raises three challenges to the Department\u2019s treatment of obsolescence. PacifiCorp first argues that the Department neglected its affirmative duty under \u00a715-8-lll(2)(b), MCA, to measure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>for obsolescence and make additional deductions. Second, although PacifiCorp did not appeal STAB\u2019s rejection of the income shortfall method-bhe method advanced by PacifiCorp to demonstrate that about $2.6 billion worth of additional obsolescence existe d4t argues that rejection of that method cannot be used as affirmative evidence that obsolescence did not exist. PacifiCorp finally argues that STAB placed too much reliance on the $9.4 billion sales price to verify the reasonableness of the $7.1 billion tax appraisal. PacifiCorp bears the burden of showing that the Department\u2019s method resulted in an overstated value of its properties. <em>Farmers Union C. Exch. v. Dept. of Revenue, </em>272 Mont. 471, 474, 901 P.2d 561, 564 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">\u00b641 PacifiCorp bases its first argument that the Department neglected its affirmative duty under \u00a715-8-1 ll(2)(b), MCA, on its theory that the Department should have separately conducted a depreciation study to consider whether additional obsolescence existed. STAB found that Angie Haller, the Department\u2019s utility assessor, deducted $5.81 billion for depreciation as reported in PacifiCorp\u2019s FERC Form 1 filing. STAB found that Haller did not have any evidence of additional depreciation and did not conduct any additional studies. STAB found that Haller believed that the depreciation deduction that she had made in accordance with PacifiCorp\u2019s FERC Form 1 reporting accounted for all forms of depreciation, including obsolescence. Haller did not believe that the statute charged the Department \u201cto go out and perform\u201d additional depreciation studies.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">\u00b642 Haller used information reported by PacifiCorp on FERC Form 1 to complete the original-cost-less-depreciation method of appraisal. She took the \u201coriginal cost\u201d value of $13.6 billion from PacifiCorp\u2019s FERC Form 1. She relied on PacifiCorp\u2019s reported depreciation value of $5.81 billion from PacifiCorp\u2019s FERC Form 1. Haller subtracted the reported depreciation value from the reported original cost value, made other adjustments, and reached a value indicator of $7.7 billion. PacifiCorp does not dispute the propriety of Haller\u2019s reliance on these figures from FERC Form 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">\u00b643 Haller\u2019s supervisor, Kory Hofland, testified that the federal definition of depreciation that PacifiCorp used in its FERC Form 1 reporting included both functional and economic obsolescence. The federal definition of depreciation for the FERC filings includes \u201cwear and tear, decay, action of the elements, inadequacy, <em>obsolescence, </em>changes in the art, <em>changes in demand </em>and <em>requirements of public authorities.\u201d </em>18 C.F.R. pt. 101, def. 12 (2010) (emphasis added). Hofland testified that Haller\u2019s depreciation deduction in reliance on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>PacifiCorp\u2019s FERC filings accounted for all depreciation, including obsolescence, under the Department\u2019s original-cost-less-depreciation method. Holland further testified that an appraiser\u2019s adjustment both for depreciation as deducted by Haller and for obsolescence as proposed by PacifiCorp would have resulted in obsolescence having been deducted twice.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">\u00b644 Depreciation studies by PacifiCorp\u2019s accountants as part of the FERC Form 1 filing reported that PacifiCorp\u2019s properties had depreciated $5.81 billion. As the Department observes, the $5.81 billion of depreciation reported by PacifiCorp would have included the types of economic forces that PacifiCorp claims could result in a loss of value, such as \u201cchanges in demand and requirements of public authorities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>PacifiCorp would have the Department undertake a similar depreciation study to determine whether additional obsolescence existed that PacifiCorp\u2019s accountants had failed to account.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">\u00b645 The Department employed three appraisers to assess annually the roughly 130 companies subject to central assessment. Haller and Holland testified that they have never conducted or ordered a full depreciation study like the analysis that PacifiCorp would have them do. Haller and Holland rely on the taxpayers\u2019 public filings. They further testified that taxpayers have an opportunity to provide information regarding additional depreciation. Haller and Hofland testified that they would make further reductions or adjustments if a taxpayer could show that additional depreciable value existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">\u00b646 Haller released her initial appraisal for PacifiCorp on April 29, 2005. PacifiCorp had an opportunity to respond to the initial appraisal and provide additional information. PacifiCorp responded with written submissions, participated in an informal hearing with the Department, and exchanged several emails with Haller. PacifiCorp asserted at these opportunities that the Department had failed to capture physical, functional, and economic obsolescence. PacifiCorp did not provide the Department, however, with a figure for how much obsolescence had not been captured. PacifiCorp likewise does not suggest on appeal that any additional obsolescence would have been found had further study been undertaken. PacifiCorp only provided the Department with an estimate of what PacifiCorp believed its taxable value should be.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">\u00b647 PacifiCorp argued to STAB that about $2.6 billion of additional obsolescence existed. PacifiCorp based its argument on the testimony and report of its expert, Thomas Tegarden. Tegarden calculated obsolescence according to the income shortfall method. STAB rejected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Tegarden\u2019s income shortfall approach because, among other reasons, it failed to account for income from properties that PacifiCorp had purchased with deferred income taxes. PacifiCorp has not challenged that decision. It contends on appeal, however, that STAB\u2019s rejection of the income shortfall method cannot be used as affirmative evidence that obsolescence did not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">\u00b648  Nothing in the record indicates that STAB used the rejection of the income shortfall method as affi rmative evidence. STAB rejected the income shortfall method for its inaccuracies. Absent the evidence based on the rejected income shortfall method, STAB had no evidence before it that suggested that unaccounted-for obsolescence existed. Though PacifiCorp suggests that other methods remained available to measure obsolescence, it failed to present evidence of such alternative methods or any other evidence of additional obsolescence. PacifiCorp failed its burden of showing that the Department\u2019s original-cost-less-depreciation method resulted in an overstated value of its properties. <em>Farmers Union C. Exch., </em>272 Mont. at 474, 901 P.2d at 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">\u00b649 Given the absence of evidence that any alternative methods available to measure for obsolescence would have produced a different result once STAB rejected the income shortfall method, and given STAB\u2019s further finding that no economic obsolescence existed, we disagree with STAB\u2019s conclusion that the Department failed to fully consider all forms of depreciation in this case. STAB\u2019s sole finding of fact that \u2018Haller did not do any additional study or analysis to determine if there was additional depreciation\u201d does not support STAB\u2019s conclusion that the Department abrogated its obligation to \u201cfully consider reduction in value caused by depreciation.\u201d We also point out that STAB prefaced this finding of fact with the explanation that \u2018Ms. Haller did not have any evidence of additional functional depreciation,\u201d which resonates with Haller\u2019s testimony that she did not order an additional study because nothing indicated that unaccounted-for depreciation existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">\u00b650 STAB nonetheless concluded that \u2018Tt]he Department\u2019s appraiser testified that she did not specifically analyze whether all forms of obsolescence, including economic obsolescence, existed.\u201d STAB\u2019s conclusion that Haller did not \u201cspecifically analyze\u201d does not follow from its finding that Haller \u201cdid not do any additional study or analysis.\u201d We have searched the record to understand the basis for STAB\u2019s determination on this issue. The record contains no factual evidence or legal argument to support STAB\u2019s conclusion that the Department must \u201cspecifically analyze\u201d obsolescence and failed to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>so in this case. To the contrary, Haller testified that she did not believe the statute \u201ccharged [the Department] to go out and perform\u201d additional obsolescence studies to fulfill its obligation to \u201cfully consider reduction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">\u00b651 The Concurrence correctly notes that this Court often gives deference to STAB\u2019s expertise on taxation matters.See <em>e.g. </em>Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 15, 36. Such deference does not allow STAB, however, to make legal determinations unmoored from its own findings and the evidence in the record. PacifiCorp urged STAB to adopt the income shortfall method to measure possible obsolescence. STAB rejected this method. PacifiCorp bore the burden of proving the Department\u2019s method inadequate. PacifiCorp came forward with no evidence of additional obsolescence that the Department had failed to analyze.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">\u00b652 The Concurrence believes it \u201cunwise\u201d to determine whether the Department satisfied its statutory duty to \u2018fully consider reduction\u201d because the Department has not appealed STAB\u2019s erroneous conclusion on this point. We disagree. PacifiCorp raised the obsolescence issue before STAB, the District Court, and this Court. STAB and the District Court concluded that the Department failed to analyze obsolescence adequately, but both ruled in the Department\u2019s favor anyway. The Department\u2019s decision not to appeal the erroneous conclusions makes sense in light of the fact that it prevailed on this issue before STAB and the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">\u00b653 PacifiCorp specifically asserted as its first argument in its cross-appeal to this Court that \u2018the Department ignored its affirmative, statutory duty to fully consider obsolescence in the cost approach.\u201d PacifiCorp\u2019s Opening Br. 33. The Department argued in response that it had considered the effects of obsolescence when it calculated value under its original-cost-less-depreciation approach. The parties have raised, argued, and briefed the issue of whether the Department fulfilled its statutory obligation to \u2018fully consider reduction in value\u201d before STAB, the District Court, and this Court. The record and the briefs do not support the Concurrence\u2019s assertion that they have not. The Concurrence focuses solely on PacifiCorp\u2019s statement of the issue at the start of its brief. Concurrence, \u00b6 66. PacifiCorp\u2019s three-part argument set out at pages 33-40 of its brief specifically argues that the Department ignored its statutory duty to consider obsolescence. The Concurrence fails to explain why the Court should refuse to address PacifiCorp\u2019s argument that \u2018the Department ignored its affirmative, statutory duty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">\u00b654 The Department only has requested that this Court affirm the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>District Court. We may affirm a district court decision that is correct regardless of the district court's reasoning in reaching its decision. <em>Conagra, Inc. v. Nierenberg, </em>2000 MT 213, \u00b6 33, 301 Mont. 55, 7 P.3d 369. We affirm the District Court, but we will not affirm its adoption of STAB\u2019s incorrect determination that the Department had failed to analyze all forms of depreciation.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">\u00b655 PacifiCorp finally argues that STAB placed too much reliance on the May 24, 2005, sales price. STAB concluded that PacifiCorp\u2019s $9.4 billion sales price provided a good indication that additional obsolescence did not exist to merit additional deductions to the Department\u2019s tax assessment of $7.1 billion. STAB found that the $9.4 billion sales price reflected the market value as defined in \u00a715-8-111, MCA, that the sale constituted an arm\u2019s length transaction, and that no evidence suggested that PacifiCorp\u2019s value materially had changed between the tax lien date and the closing of the transaction. STAB concluded that it could rely on PacifiCorp\u2019s $9.4 billion sales price \u201cto verify the essential reasonableness of the Department\u2019s final estimate of value\u201d of $7.1 billion.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">\u00b656 The District Court rejected STAB\u2019s conclusion that STAB could consider the sales price of PacifiCorp. The court relied on Thomas Tegarden\u2019s statement that an appraiser generally may consider only information known or knowable as of the assessment lien date. The court concluded that this known or knowable principle applied to STAB. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">\u00b657 Section 15-7-102(6), MCA, expressly authorizes STAB to \u201cconsider the actual selling price of the property, independent appraisals of the property, and other relevant information\u201d in determining the market value of the property. The court disregarded this statute because PacifiCorp had announced the sale on May 24,2005, about five months after the tax lien date of January 1, 2005. The court incorrectly interpreted \u00a7 15-7-102(6), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">\u00b658  PacifiCorp\u2019s appeal of the Department\u2019s appraisal required that STAB hear the appeal and render a final, binding decision. Sections 15-2-201(d), -302(5), MCA. STAB had the authority to issue summonses to witnesses, to administer oaths, and to compel testimony and the production of records, books, and other documents. Section 15-2-201(2), MCA. STAB must hear the appeal in accordance with the contested case provisions of the Montana Administrative Procedure Act. Section 15-2-302(4), MCA. This Court has concluded that STAB must be able to receive additional testimony and evidence to perform its duty to hear the appeal and issue a final decision. <em>Dept. of Revenue </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number><em>v. Burlington N. Inc., </em>169 Mont. 202, 213, 545 P.2d 1083, 1089 (1976). STAB properly considered the $9.4 billion sales price of PacifiCorp to MidAmerican in evaluating the reasonableness of the Department\u2019s $7.1 billion assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">\u00b659 We affirm in part and reverse in part. Substantial evidence supports the Department\u2019s use of earnings-to-price ratios in its direct capitalization approach. We affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusions that additional depreciation deductions were not warranted and that the Department did not overvalue PacifiCorp\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">\u00b660 We hold that \u00a7 15-8-lll(2)(b), MCA, does not require the Department to conduct a separate, additional obsolescence study when no evidence suggests that obsolescence exists that has not been accounted for in the taxpayer\u2019s FERC Form 1 filing. We further hold that STAB correctly determined that the actual $9.4 billion sales price of PacifiCorp verified that the Department\u2019s $7.1 billion assessment had not overvalued PacifiCorp\u2019s properties.</p>\n<judges id=\"b304-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER and BAKER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b304-8\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"AyV\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">\u00b661 The Department challenges the District Court\u2019s reversal of STAB\u2019s finding that earnings-to-price ratios may be used within the \u201cdirect capitalization of net operating income\u201d method of valuation under Admin. R. M. 42.22.111. This regulation requires the Department to employ \u201ccommonly accepted methods and techniques of appraisal to determine market value.\u201d Admin. R. M. 42.22.111(1). PacifiCorp defends the District Court\u2019s determination and argues that STAB\u2019s finding was not supported by substantial evidence. Neither a definition nor standards which further explain the term \u201ccommonly accepted method\u201d are provided within the regulations, but an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation is entitled to deference. <em>See Roy v. Blackfoot Tel. Coop., </em>2004 MT 316, \u00b6 26, 324 Mont. 30, 101 P.3d 301 (citing <em>Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, </em>512 U.S. 504, 512, 114 S. Ct. 2381, 2386 (1994) (\u201cWe must give substantial deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations.\u2019)). In light of the deference to be given to the Department\u2019s application of its regulation and the evidence discussed by the Court, I concur that STAB\u2019s finding was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">\u00b662 In the cross appeal, PacifiCorp challenges the District Court\u2019s affirming of STAB\u2019s obsolescence determination, arguing that the Department\u2019s approach failed to satisfy the requirement in \u00a7 15-8-111(2)(b), MCA, to \u2018fully consider\u201d both functional and economic obsolescence. The Court delineates testimony which was offered by the Department in support of its treatment of obsolescence, Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 41-46, and then reverses both STAB and the District Court\u2019s legal conclusion that the Department failed to properly consider obsolescence. Opinion, \u00b6 49. I have concerns about the Court\u2019s approach and cannot agree with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">\u00b663 The evidence cited by the Court was considered by STAB during the proceedings before it. STAB concluded that the Department \u2018fail[ed] to consider economic obsolescence in its cost indicator as specifically required by statute. Section 15-8-lll(2)(b), MCA.... \u2018[T]he Board does not condone this failure on the part of the Department. There is a clear statutory duty for the Department to consider all forms of depreciation ....\u2019 \u2019\u2019STAB Order, 35 (internal citation omitted); <em>see also </em>STAB Order, 33. The District Court affirmed this conclusion, stating that \u2018the Department\u2019s cost approach calculation did <em>not </em>include a separate consideration of any reduction in value for obsolescence.\u201d District Court Order, 10 (emphasis added). Then, the Department <em>did not appeal </em>this determination. The obsolescence issue undertaken by the Court-en which it reverses STAB and the District Court-has not been challenged on appeal and is not the focus of the parties\u2019 briefing.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">\u00b664 STAB ultimately concluded that the error in the Department\u2019s valuation method was essentially harmless under the circumstances, because post-lien date sale information demonstrated that no additional obsolescence existed. Nonetheless, STAB warned that \u201c[i]n other cases, the Department\u2019s failure to consider economic obsolescence in its cost approach could prove seriously detrimental to the Department\u2019s valuation.\u201d STAB Order, 35. I believe that the Court\u2019s wading into this issue is unwise. The Court is reversing complex evidentiary determinations which were not the focus of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>appeal, were not briefed, and which fall within the expertise of the taxing authorities. I would not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">\u00b665 In response, the Court offers the vague assertion that the parties \u2018have raised, argued, and briefed the issue of whether the Department fulfilled its statutory obligation to \u2018fully consider reduction in value\u2019 before STAB.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 53. A careful search of the briefing would be a vain attempt to locate where this issue was \u201craised, argued and briefed\u201d in this case. The \u201cobsolescence\u201d issue which the Court reaches and decides today-the proper interpretation of \u00a715-8-111(2)(b), MCA, and the requirements it imposes upon the Department regarding obsolescence-was certainly not raised or briefed on appeal. There is no analysis whatsoever, in any of the briefing, from either party, about the text, history, or meaning of \u00a7 15-8- 111(2)(b), MCA, or the obligations imposed by that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\u00b666 The Department\u2019s opening brief made only a passing reference to \u00a715-8-111(2)(b), MCA, and its reply and response brief did not make a single reference to the provision. While referencing obsolescence in the context of the issue it did raise, PacifiCorp offers no argument about obligations imposed by the statute regarding obsolescence. To obscure this fact and support its desire to interpret the statute, the Court resorts to restating the parties\u2019 actual issues. The Court states that \u2018PacifiCorp specifically asserted as its first argument in its cross-appeal to this Court that \u2018the Department ignored its affirmative, statutory duty to fully consider obsolescence in the cost approach.\u2019\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 53. This is an incomplete statement of PacifiCorp\u2019s position. Its actual issue is \u201cwhether the district court erred when it affirmed the Department\u2019s cost indicator <em>even though </em>the Department willfully failed to consider obsolescence.\u201d PacifiCorp\u2019s Opening Brief, 1 (emphasis added). Because the Department had failed to appeal the interpretation of \u00a7 15-8-lll(2)(b), MCA, rendered by STAB and the District Court, PacifiCorp based its arguments solely on the assumption that this statutory interpretation was correct. To top it off with the appropriate irony, the Court criticizes this Concurrence for failing to acknowledge \u2018PacifiCorp\u2019s three-part argument set out at pages 33-40 of its brief\u2019which \u201cspecifically argues that the Department ignored its statutory duty to consider obsolescence.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 53. However, there is no such discussion in the cited pages of PacifiCorp\u2019s brief. There is such a discussion in those numbered pages of the District Court\u2019s order-and that is precisely the point: the Department did not appeal from that discussion and thus no briefing has been offered here by the parties on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>\u00b667 The Court\u2019s decision today blindsides the parties, but prejudices PacifiCorp, which loses on the basis of an issue it never briefed. PacifiCorp did not brief the statutory interpretation issue because, under the statutes and rules governing the appeal process, it was unnecessary to do so. Today, PacifiCorp has learned the hard way that it cannot place its trust in the rules governing the appellate process in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">\u00b668 Finally, the Court approves STAB\u2019s consideration of the post-lien date sale information, citing \u00a715-7-102(6), MCA, which permits STAB to consider \u2018the actual selling price of the property.\u201d As the statute does not differentiate between pre- and post-lien date sale information, I concur that STAB could properly consider this evidence, despite the fact that consideration of post-lien date sale information apparently contradicts what the District Court described as \u201ca well accepted rule\u201d in the appraisal industry. If the statute does not reflect best industry practices, it may need to be revised. However, it serves today to render any flaw in the Department\u2019s cost approach as harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">\u00b669 I concur in the result reached by the Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b307-6\">JUSTICE NELSON joins in the concurring Opinion of JUSTICE RICE.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b307-7\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"AFK\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">\u00b670 I join Justice Rice\u2019s Concurrence. His comments at \u00b6\u00b6 65 to 67 are correct. Unfortunately, this is not the first time in recent experience that this Court has taken a case and reframed the issues, arguments, and theories on appeal to achieve a particular disposition-in the process, blindsiding the losing party with an issue it never raised or briefed. This is exactly what happened in <em>Western Sec. Bank and Glacier Bancorp, Inc. v. Eide Bailly LLP, </em>2010 MT 291, 359 Mont. 34, 249 P.3d 35. In that case, appellant Glacier Bancorp alleged, litigated, and argued a professional negligence claim, not the negligent misrepresentation claim this Court decided on appeal. <em>Western Sec.

As I observed there, \u201cti]t will surely come as a surprise to Glacier . . . when it learns that it has lost this case because it failed to adequately support a claim that it never even raised!\u201d <em>Western Sec.
