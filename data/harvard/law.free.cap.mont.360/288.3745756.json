We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">\u00b62 We review the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">\u00b63 <em>Whether the District Court wrongly named Hilliard as the primary residential parent of N.E.S.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">\u00b64 <em>Whether the District Court properly calculated Smith\u2019s child support obligation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-12\">\u00b65 <em>Whether the District Court afforded Smith a fair trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b319-14\">\u00b66 Smith and Hilliard had one child together, N.E.S. Smith and Hilliard never married and the couple split up shortly after Smith became pregnant with N.E.S. in 2000. Hilliard knew Smith was pregnant when they separated, but he did not spend any time with N.E.S. until 2005 or 2006. Hilliard apparently spent N.E.S.\u2019s early years incarcerated for reasons not disclosed in the record. Hilliard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>began paying child support to Smith in 2003 at Smith\u2019s request and he had regularly made payments up until August 2009 when N.E.S. lived with him full time. N.E.S. spent his early childhood in Red Lodge, Montana, with Smith where he attended pre-school through second grade.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">\u00b67 Hilliard began seeing N.E.S. in the summers from the time that N.E.S. was five or six years old. Hilliard lives in Sidney, Montana, with his wife and three young children. The record does not demonstrate definitively the extent of each of the summer visits between Hilliard and N.E.S. The District Court concluded that Hilliard had parented N.E.S. during the summers from 2006-2009, but Smith argues that Hilliard parented N.E.S. only during the summers of2008-2009. Smith testified that she allowed Hilliard to take N.E.S. for the summers of 2008 and 2009 as long as he returned N.E.S. in time to start school in the fall. Hilliard did not return N.E.S. to Smith after the summer of 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">\u00b68 Hilliard instead petitioned the District Court <em>pro se </em>to establish a permanent parenting plan for N.E.S. Smith did not respond to Hilliard\u2019s court proceeding because she could not afford counsel. The court entered a default judgment in Hilliard\u2019s favor in September 2009. Smith hired an attorney in February of 2010 and filed a motion to set aside the default judgment. The court granted Smith\u2019s motion and set a new trial for August 2010 to establish a permanent parenting plan for N.E.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">\u00b69 The District Court heard evidence regarding N.E.S.\u2019s relationship and family life with both parents. The court interviewed N.E.S. in chambers. N.E.S. testified that he had a great relationship with both parents and the record demonstrates that he has succeeded in school in both Sidney and Red Lodge. N.E.S. told the court about his daily life with each parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">\u00b610 Smith has seven other children. She has two adult daughters living in Red Lodge. She also has three children under the age of eighteen who live with their respective fathers in Red Lodge. Smith\u2019s eighteen-year-old son, Teddy, and her fourteen-year-old daughter, Brandi, both live with her full-time. At the time of the trial Smith recently had moved to Billings and had planned for N.E.S. to attend school there. Smith previously had worked at the Red Lodge Caf\u00e9 as a waitress, but Smith did not yet have employment in Billings. Smith planned to waitress full-time in Billings. Smith lives in a three bedroom apartment in Billings. N.E.S. shares a room with Brandi when he lives with Smith. N.E.S. spent most of his afternoons after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>school at the Boys\u2019 and Girls\u2019 Club in Red Lodge. None of the testimony indicated how N.E.S. would spend afternoons in Billings.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">\u00b611 Hilliard has three children with his wife Heather, all who live with him in Sidney. The family shares a three bedroom house. Hilliard, Heather, and N.E.S.\u2019s six-month-old half-brother share one room, N.E.S.\u2019s seven-year-old half-sister, Erin, has her own room, and N.E.S. shares a room with his three-year-old half-brother, Taylor. N.E.S. rides the bus home and Hilliard\u2019s wife, Heather, supervises him after school in Sidney. Heather cooks for the family and N.E.S. plays outside with neighborhood children. Hilliard works full-time at Agri-Industries and testified that he would be able to obtain health insurance for N.E.S. through his employer. Smith did not provide any evidence of available health insurance for N.E.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">\u00b612 N.E.S. testified that he got along great with both parents, but he decided a week before trial, in the middle of two weeks he spent with Smith, that he preferred to live with Smith. N.E.S. testified that he preferred to live with Smith because he was tired of his younger half-sister, Erin, bothering him at Hilliard\u2019s house. N.E.S. also testified that Smith is a better cook than Heather because she makes Hot Pockets, steak, and leftovers, whereas Heather makes something different every night including Hamburger Helper, casseroles, and tacos.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">\u00b613 The evidence presented establishes that neither parent abuses any substances. Neither parent physically abuses N.E.S. or one another. Hilliard presented evidence of Smith\u2019s then seventeen-year-old son Teddy, who lives with Smith, drinking alcohol with Smith\u2019s purported ex-boyfriend. Hilliard fears that N.E.S. does not receive proper discipline or supervision while living with Smith. Both parents agree that N.E.S. should not be around people who abuse alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">\u00b614 The District Court entered a final parenting plan for N.E.S. that placed N.E.S.\u2019s primary residence with Hilliard. The court concluded that it was in N.E.S.\u2019s best interest to live primarily with Hilliard in Sidney during the school year and with Smith during the summer, despite N.E.S.\u2019s wishes to live primarily with Smith. The court reasoned that Hilliard provided a more stable home life and provided N.E.S. continuity and stability of care. The court also ordered both parties to submit the appropriate child support documentation. The court imputed income to Smith based on a forty hour work week and calculated child support pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-204, MCA. The court ordered Smith to pay Hilliard $197 per month in child support. Smith appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">\u00b615 We review for clear error a district court\u2019s findings in a child custody decision. <em>In re Marriage of Dennison, </em>2006 MT 56, \u00b6 13, 331 Mont. 315, 132 P.3d 535. We may reverse the district court\u2019s findings of facts if they are not supported by substantial evidence, if the court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if a review of the record leaves this Court with a definite and firm conviction that the trial court made a mistake. <em>Id. </em>We review for correctness the district court\u2019s application of statutes and regulations. <em>Kulstad v. Maniaci, </em>2009 MT 326, \u00b6 50, 352 Mont. 513, 220 P.3d 595.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">\u00b616 <em>Whether the District Court wrongly named Hilliard as the primary residential parent of N.E.S.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">\u00b617 Smith cites the fact that she parented N.E.S. from his birth in 2000 through the court\u2019s order in 2010 to support her claim that N.E.S. belongs with her. Smith points out that she provided N.E.S. with a safe home, that she never abused N.E.S. in any way, and that she never abused drugs or alcohol in any way. No one disputes any of Smith\u2019s claims. We must take issue, however, with her effort to liken the proceeding in the District Court to a parental termination proceeding pursuant to a dependent and neglect claim. The District Court did not evaluate Smith\u2019s fitness as a parent in determining that N.E.S. should live primarily with Hilliard. The court instead applied the best interest of the child standard used in custody proceedings. Section 40-4-212, MCA. We too must apply this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">\u00b618 The District Court sits in the best position to evaluate the best interest of the child. <em>In re Marriage of Toavs, </em>2006 MT 68, \u00b6 8, 331 Mont. 437, 133 P.3d 202. Child custody cases often present the court with difficult decisions. We must presume that the court carefully considered the evidence and made the correct decision. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"Avo\">\u00b619 Smith argues that the District Court failed to state the reason that it chose not to follow N.E.S.\u2019s wishes to live with Smith. <em>In re Custody of J.H., </em>231 Mont. 301, 304, 752 P.2d 194, 195 (1988). The court interviewed N.E.S. in chambers in accordance with \u00a740-4-214, MCA. The court recorded the interview and made it part of the record in this case. Section 40-4-214, MCA. The court also made a specific finding of fact regarding N.E.S.\u2019s wishes. <em>In re Custody of J.H., </em>231 Mont. at 304, 752 P.2d at 195. N.E.S. stated that he would prefer to live in Billings with Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>\u00b620 We do not require the district court to follow the child\u2019s wishes.In re <em>Marriage of Kovash, </em>260 Mont. 44, 51, 858 P.2d 351, 355-56 (1993). The court must give a reason, however, as to why it did not follow the child\u2019s wishes.In <em>re Custody </em>of J.H., 231 Mont. at 304, 752 P.2d at 195. The District Court concluded that N.E.S. should live primarily with Hilliard because Hilliard provided a \u201cmore stable home life and can provide N.E.S. continuity and stability of care.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">\u00b621 The district court assesses the ability of a child to formulate and articulate his custody wishes and must weigh that preference in light of the other evidence and factors enumerated in \u00a740-4-212, MCA. <em>In re Marriage of Murphy, </em>205 Mont. 162, 165, 666 P.2d 755, 757 (1983). The court questioned N.E.S. in chambers. N.E.S. testified that he liked living with both parents. The court concluded that N.E.S.\u2019s primary reason for choosing Smith related to his annoyance with his younger sister in Sidney, The court did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that it was in N.E.S.\u2019s best interest to reside primarily with Hilliard despite N.E.S.\u2019s wishes to live with Smith. In <em>re Custody of J.H., </em>231 Mont. at 304, 752 P.2d at 195. The court properly stated its reasonAhe court concluded Hilliard provided more continuity and stability of care for N.E.S. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">\u00b622 Smith also argues that the record lacks evidence to support the court\u2019s following findings: (1) that N.E.S. lives with three younger siblings in Sidney, Montana, (2) that Hilliard parented N.E.S. during the summers of 2006 and 2007, (3) that N.E.S. earned mostly A\u2019s during the school year in Sidney, (4) that Hilliard had any telephone contact with N.E.S. before 2006, and (5) that Hilliard is better able to provide more continuous or stable care of N.E.S. in Sidney.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">\u00b623 The parties presented contrary evidence as to the extent of Hilliard\u2019s previous relationship with N.E.S. Hilliard testified in 2009 that he had spent the past two or three summers with N.E.S., that he had seen N.E.S. every summer since 2006, and that he had first spent time with N.E.S. in October 2005. Hilliard also maintained that he had called Smith before 2005 and that his family\u2019s first contact with N.E.S. went back to before 2005 when his mother had visited N.E.S. in Red Lodge.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">\u00b624 Smith testified that N.E.S. spent the summers of 2008 and 2009 with Hilliard and that Hilliard\u2019s first contact with N.E.S. took place in 2006. Smith confirmed that Hilliard\u2019s mother had visited N.E.S. The District Court stated in its findings that Hilliard had \u201cparented N.E.S. during the summer of 2006, the summer of 2007, the summer of 2008 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>and since June 2009.\u201d The court did not describe the extent of Hilliard\u2019s parenting over the course of each summer.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">\u00b625 Smith argues that insufficient evidence supports the court\u2019s finding that Hilliard had parented N.E.S. during the summers of2006 and 2007. Smith bases her argument on Hilliard\u2019s testimony that he had only spent a few hours at Smith\u2019s house in both 2006 and 2007. Smith asked Hilliard on cross-examination how he had concluded that Smith did not discipline N.E.S. Hilliard admitted that he had spent only a few hours at Smith\u2019s house during the summers of 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. Hilliard\u2019s admission that he had spent only a few hours at Smith\u2019s house does not necessarily establish, however, that Hilliard spent only a few hours with N.E.S. each summer. The court could have deduced that Hilliard only spent a few hours at Smith\u2019s house when he picked up and dropped off N.E.S. after longer visits. The parties presented contradictory testimony. The district court determines the credibility of the witnesses and the weight assigned to their respective testimony. <em>Kulstad, </em>\u00b6 52; <em>In re Marriage of McKenna, </em>2000 MT 58, \u00b6 17, 299 Mont. 13, 996 P.2d 386. Substantial credible evidence in the record supports the District Court\u2019s finding. <em>Kulstad, </em>\u00b6 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">\u00b626 Smith challenges whether Hilliard presented any substantial credible evidence that he had any children other than N.E.S. or that N.E.S. received mostly A\u2019s in Sidney. Hilliard represented himselfpro <em>se </em>in the District Court proceedings. Hilliard did not mention his three younger children at any point during the proceedings. Hilliard also did not submit evidence of N.E.S.\u2019s grades. The court interviewed N.E.S. in chambers, however, and that interview became part of the record. Section 40-4-214, MCA. N.E.S. testified in the interview that he had received mostly A\u2019s during the school year in Sidney. N.E.S. also provided the court a detailed description of his home life with Hilliard, including the names and ages of his younger siblings and his relationship with them. Substantial credible evidence in the record supports the court\u2019s findings on these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">\u00b627  Smith suggests that the record lacks substantial credible evidence to support the court\u2019s finding that Hilliard\u2019s home situation provides more continuous and stable care for N.E.S. Hilliard testified that N.E.S. has continual adult supervision, more discipline, and a more stable environment in Sidney. Smith recently had moved to Billings. Smith did not explain whether she would provide adult supervision for N.E.S. after school in Billings. N.E.S. usually went to the Boys\u2019 and Girls\u2019 Club after school in Red Lodge. The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>bears the difficult responsibility of determining the best interest of the child in accordance with \u00a740-4-212, MCA. Hilliard\u2019s testimony and N.E.S.\u2019s testimony support the court\u2019s decision. Substantial credible evidence in the record supports the District Court\u2019s finding. <em>In re Marriage of Dennison, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">\u00b628 <em>Whether the District Court properly calculated Smith\u2019s child support obligation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">\u00b629 Smith argues that the District Court improperly imputed income, wrongfully added her federal earned income credits (EIC) to her income, and failed to require Hilliard to swear to the accuracy of his financial documents. Section 40-4-204, MCA, governs a district court\u2019s resolution of child support issues. Section 40-5-209, MCA, provides that the district court must follow child support guidelines in all cases unless the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that applying the guidelines would be unjust to the child or the parties. Section 40-4-204(3)(a), MCA; <em>In re Marriage of Williams, 2009 </em>MT 282, \u00b6 27, 352 Mont. 198, 217 P.3d 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">\u00b630 The District Court ordered the parties to submit (1) a Montana Child Support Guidelines Financial Affidavit and (2) a Montana Child Support Worksheet in order to calculate child support for N.E.S. in accordance with \u00a740-4-204, MCA. The court considered the factors outlined in \u00a740-4-204, MCA, including the financial resources of each parent. Smith recently had quit a waitressing job in Red Lodge and had moved to Billings. She testified that she would work full-time in Billings. The court determined that it should impute income to Smith for a forty hour work week as a result of her unemployed status.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">\u00b631 The administrative rules provide additional requirements the court must follow when calculating child support. Admin. R. M. 37.62.106(7) provides that the court should impute income whenever a parent is unemployed or underemployed. A court may impute income to a parent who is voluntarily unemployed or underemployed based upon the parent\u2019s capacity and ability to earn. <em>In re Marriage of Dennison, </em>\u00b6 18; <em>In re Marriage of Bee, </em>2002 MT 49, \u00b6 22, 309 Mont. 34, 43 P.3d 903. A parent testified in <em>Dennison </em>that she worked part-time and that she could obtain full-time work if she wished. <em>In re Marriage of Dennison, </em>\u00b6 19. The Court concluded that the district court abused its discretion when it did not impute income to the parent under these circumstances. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">\u00b632  Hilliard asked Smith how she planned to support N.E.S. given that she did not have full-time employment. Smith testified that she planned to get full-time work once school started for N.E.S. and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>she would be working day shifts in Billings. It appears from the record that Smith voluntarily quit her job to move to Billings. The court reasonably relied upon Smith\u2019s own testimony that she would be employed full-time in the near future. The court did not abuse its discretion when it imputed income to Smith in order to calculate child support. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">\u00b633  Admin. R. M. 37.62.106(8) provides that the court should not add a parent\u2019s EIC to the parent\u2019s income when the court imputes income. The court issued its order setting child support in this matter according to the Montana Child Support Guidelines Worksheet A. The court attached Worksheet A to its order. The court made several errors in calculating Smith\u2019s income on the Montana Child Support Guidelines Worksheet A. The court improperly added Smith\u2019s EIC to her total income. Admin. R. M. 37.62.106(8). Smith\u2019s EIC equals one-third of her imputed income and increases her total income substantially. The court also wrongly characterized Smith\u2019s imputed income as actual income on Worksheet A. The court violated Admin. R. M. 37.62.106(8) when it incorrectly calculated Smith\u2019s income. <em>Kulstad, </em>\u00b6 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">\u00b634 <em>Whether the District Court afforded Smith a fair trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">\u00b635 Smith argues that the District Court did not afford her a fair trial. Smith cites to the court\u2019s failure to provide Smith with Hilliard\u2019s financial information. Smith claims that this omission prevented her from cross examining Hilliard regarding his financial statements. Smith claims that the court exceeded the scope of \u00a740-4-214, MCA, when it asked N.E.S. questions about matters other than N.E.S.\u2019s wishes as to residential and parental contact. Smith also contends that the court should have allowed her to cross-examine N.E.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">\u00b636 The record lacks any evidence that Smith argued to the District Court that it must allow her to examine Hilliard\u2019s Financial Affidavit and Worksheet and must afford her the opportunity to cross-examine Hilliard about the financial statements. Smith makes this argument for the first time on appeal. We will not review arguments that a petitioner presents for the first time on appeal. <em>Foston v. State, </em>2010 MT 281, \u00b6 10, 358 Mont. 469, 245 P.3d 1103.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">\u00b637 The court interviewed N.E.S. in chambers in order to determine N.E.S.\u2019s preference for the primary residential parent. The court did not ask N.E.S. simply where he wished to live. The court instead asked N.E.S. a series of questions about his life with each parent and what he liked or disliked about each parent\u2019s home. The court\u2019s questions related to its determination of N.E.S.\u2019s wishes as to residential and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>parental contact. Smith does not direct this Court to any authority, and we are aware of none, to support her argument that the court may not ask a child about the child\u2019s life with each parent in order to evaluate more accurately a child\u2019s wishes in accordance with \u00a740-4-212, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">\u00b638 [4] In fact, this Court has stated that \u2018it is often important for the judge to discover the attitudes and wishes of the child.\u201d <em>In re M.L.H., </em>220 Mont. 288, 292-93, 715 P.2d 32, 34-35 (1986). The Court in <em>In re M.L.H. </em>further determined that no reason exists \u201cto subject the child to the formality of the courtroom and the unpleasantness of cross-examination,\u201d during the course of the interview process pursuant to \u00a740-4-214, MCA. <em>Id. </em>We agree. Nothing in \u00a740-4-214, MCA, requires the court to give the parties an opportunity to cross-examine the child. The court must make a record of the interview available to the parties. <em>In re M.L.H., </em>220 Mont. at 292-93, 715 P.2d at 35. The District Court complied. The court did not abuse its discretion when it interviewed N. E.S. in chambers. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">\u00b639 We affirm the District Court\u2019s Final Parenting Plan. We remand the child support award to the District Court for recalculation in accordance with this opinion. Smith can challenge the validity of Hilliard\u2019s financial statements, through cross-examination or other means, during any proceedings conducted by the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b327-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
