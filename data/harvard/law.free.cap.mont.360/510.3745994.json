We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">\u00b62 On July 19, 2010, MATL filed a Verified Complaint for Condemnation against Salois. Salois subsequently moved for summary judgment. The parties briefed the issues, attended a hearing in District Court, and filed post-hearing briefs. On December 12, 2010, the District Court issued an order concluding \u2018MATL does not possess the power of eminent domain, either express or implied, and it has no authority to take the private property of a nonconsenting landowner.\u201d MATL appeals from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">\u00b63 By motion filed with this Court, MATL directs the Court\u2019s attention to House Bill 198, \u201cAn Act Clarifying a Public Utility s Power of Eminent Domain; Clarifying that a Person Issued a Certificate Under the Major Facility Siting Act has the Power of Eminent Domain; and Providing an Immediate Effective Date and Retroactive Applicability Date\u201d(HB 198). HB 198 was passed by both houses of the 2011 Montana Legislature and became law without the Governor\u2019s signature. Mont. Ch. 321 L. 2011 (enacted and effective May 9, 2011). The legislation provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">Section 1. Power of eminent domain. A public utility as defined in 69-3-101 may acquire by eminent domain any interest in property, as provided in Title 70, chapter 30, for a public use authorized by law to provide service to the customers of its regulated service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-8\">Section 2. Power to exercise eminent domain. A person issued a certificate pursuant to this chapter may acquire by eminent domain any interest in property, as provided in Title 70, chapter 30, for a public use authorized by law to construct a facility in accordance with the certificate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-9\">Section 3. Codification instruction. (1) [Section 1] is intended to be codified as an integral part of Title 69, chapter 3, part 1, and the provisions of Title 69, chapter 3, part 1, apply to [section 1].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-10\">(2) [Section 2] is intended to be codified as an integral part of Title 75, chapter 20, part 1, and the provisions of Title 75, chapter 20, part 1, apply to [section 2].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Section 4. Contingent voidness. If a repeal of the provisions of Title 75, chapter 1, parts 1 through 3, or a repeal of the provisions of Title 75, chapter 20, parts 1 through 4, is passed and approved during the 62nd legislative session, then [this act] is void.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-4\">Section 5. Effective date. [This act] is effective on passage and approval.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-5\">Section 6. Retroactive applicability. [Section 2] applies retroactively, within the, meaning of 1-2-109, to certificates issued after September 30, 2008.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">\u00b64 Montana Rule of Evidence 202(b)(3) allows this Court to take judicial notice of\u2018[Regulations and legislative enactments issued by or under authority of the United States and of this and any state of the United States by or for their agencies or administrations.\u201d HB 198 is a legislative enactment issued under the authority of the State of Montana, and we take judicial notice of it. <em>See West v. Club at Spanish Peaks L.L.C., </em>2008 MT 183, \u00b6 63, 343 Mont. 434, 186 P.3d 1228.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">\u00b65 A law contained in the statutes of Montana is retroactive only if expressly so declared by the legislature. Section 1-2-109, MCA; <em>United States v. Juvenile Male, </em>2011 MT 104, \u00b6 7, 360 Mont. 317, 255 P.3d. 110. The Legislature explicitly provided for HB 198 to apply retroactively \u201cto certificates issued after September 30, 2008.\u201d MATL received a Major Facility Siting Act certificate on October 22, 2008. Thus, HB 198 applies to MATL\u2019s certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">\u00b66  The explicit language of HB 198 conflicts with the District Court\u2019s order. The District Court concluded that there was no support for MATL\u2019s contention that a \u201cprivate merchant transmission line, without express or implied authority for condemnation, may pursue eminent domain proceedings by virtue of its establishing an enumerated use set forth in 70-30-102, MCA.\u201d As MATL correctly points out, HB 198 now expressly provides such authority. Furthermore, the District Court noted that the Major Facility Siting Act, Title 75, chapter 20, did not include \u201cany provision granting eminent domain authority.\u201d However, HB 198 now explicitly codifies eminent domain authority into the Major Facility Siting Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">\u00b67  HB 198 applies retroactively to MATL\u2019s certificate issued pursuant to the Major Facility Siting Act. Furthermore, the explicit language of HB 198 is in conflict with the District Court\u2019s order. We reverse the order of the District Court dismissing MATL\u2019s complaint for condemnation and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b542-10\">JUSTICES WHEAT, NELSON, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
