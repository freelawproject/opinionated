The Fourth Judicial District Court, Missoula County, denied Moore\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">\u00b62 Moore raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">\u00b63 Issue 1: <em>Did the District Court correctly determine that Moore was raising for the first time on appeal an objection to the 911 transcripts?</em></p>\n<p id=\"AnC\">\u00b64 Issue 2: <em>Does substantial evidence support the District Court\u2019s finding that Officer Arianna Adams (Officer Adams) had particularized suspicion to conduct an investigatory stop of Moore\u2019s vehicle?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">\u00b65 On the afternoon of September 21, 2009, Moore, with her two children, drove to her friend Laurie Banks\u2019 (Laurie) home. Moore was upset and smelled of alcohol when she arrived, leading Laurie to believe Moore was intoxicated. After staying at Laurie\u2019s for approximately one hour, Moore left her children with Laurie and drove away. Laurie called 911, reporting that she \u2018just had a friend of [hers] jump in a vehicle, very upset and she\u2019s had a lot to drink.\u201d Laurie informed dispatch that Moore was driving a red Blazer and was heading toward Reserve Street, but was probably not out of her neighborhood yet. Laurie gave dispatch her full name, address, and telephone number.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">\u00b66 Moore\u2019s husband, Kurt Moore (Kurt), telephoned 911 to report Moore had been drinking and was driving. Kurt, who was following Moore, provided a description of her vehicle and the direction she was traveling. Kurt informed dispatch that Moore had told him she had consumed one beer earlier, but he did not know if\u2018it\u2019s one beer or six beers or thirty-seven beers.\u201d Although Moore was not driving badly, Kurt was scared because she had a previous DUI and he did not want anyone getting hurt. Kurt gave dispatch his full name, telephone number, and home address.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">\u00b67 As Kurt was speaking with 911, Missoula Police Department Officer Adams stopped Kurt for speeding. When Officer Adams approached the truck, Kurt told her, \u201c[m]y wife has been drinking in that Blazer and I\u2019m with 911 right now. Yes, yes, it\u2019s over the inter ... it\u2019s over the pass, [police, unintelligible] Yes! Yes!\u201d Simultaneously, dispatch was advising units of an intoxicated driver who matched Moore\u2019s description. Officer Adams terminated the stop, caught up to Moore\u2019s vehicle, and initiated a traffic stop. Moore was arrested for DUI.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>\u00b68 In Municipal Court, Moore filed a motion to suppress and dismiss, claiming Officer Adams lacked particularized suspicion to stop her vehicle. Moore argued the information available to Officer Adams fell short of the requirements set forth in <em>State v. Pratt, </em>286 Mont. 156, 951 P.2d 37 (1997). At a hearing on Moore\u2019s motion, Moore, before any testimony was heard, objected to \u201cany evidence that exceeds what was available to the officer at the time of the stop that was initiated ... because it would be beyond the scope of the evidence that should be admitted for the purposes of determining whether the officer had probable cause to initiate the traffic stop.\u201d The Municipal Court took the objection under advisement and heard testimony from Laurie, Kurt, and Officer Adams. During the hearing, Moore stipulated to the admission of the 911 transcripts from Laurie\u2019s and Kurt\u2019s calls. At the close of the hearing, the Municipal Court stated that it would consider the 911 transcripts, among other things, before reaching an opinion. Moore did not object.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">\u00b69 The Municipal Court denied Moore\u2019s motion to suppress and dismiss. Moore pled no contest to DUI per se, reserving her right to appeal the denial of her motion. On appeal, Moore argued no particularized suspicion existed to justify the stop, and the Municipal Court erred when it considered the 911 transcripts in determining whether particularized suspicion existed. The District Court rejected Moore\u2019s argument regarding the 911 transcripts, finding that her argument had not been preserved for appeal. The District Court determined the Municipal Court properly denied Moore\u2019s motion to suppress and dismiss and denied her appeal. Moore appeals the District Court\u2019s consideration of the 911 transcripts and conclusion that particularized suspicion existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">\u00b610 We review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of amotion to suppress to determine whether the court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous and whether those findings were applied correctly as a matter of law. <em>State v. Clawson, </em>2009 MT 228, \u00b6 9, 351 Mont. 354, 212 P.3d 1056. A district court\u2019s finding that particularized suspicion exists is a question of fact, which we review for clear error. <em>Id. </em>A finding is clearly erroneous if it is \u2018hot supported by substantial evidence, if the court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if this Court\u2019s review of the record leaves us with the firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d <em>State v. Roberts, </em>1999 MT 59, \u00b6 11, 293 Mont. 476, 977 P.2d 974.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">\u00b611 Issue 1: <em>Did the District Court correctly determine that Moore was raising for the first time on appeal an objection to the 911 transcripts?</em></p>\n<p id=\"AfY\">\u00b612 Moore argues that her broad, general objection to \u201cany evidence that exceeds what was available to the officer at the time of the stop\u201d preserved for appeal her challenge to the Municipal Court\u2019s consideration of the 911 transcripts. Because she objected before the introduction of any evidence, Moore contends her objection should be treated as a motion in limine, which, therefore, relieved her of any obligation to contemporaneously object to the 911 transcripts during the hearing. <em>See State v. Ankeny, </em>2010 MT 224, \u00b6\u00b6 38-39, 358 Mont. 32, 243 P.3d 391 (noting a motion in limine avoids objecting to improper arguments in front of the jury, <em>Cooper v. Hanson, </em>2010 MT 113, \u00b6 38, 356 Mont. 309, 234 P.3d 59, and may relieve a party of the obligation to contemporaneously object). Moore asserts she tactically did not object to the 911 transcripts during the hearing because she did not want the Municipal Court or the prosecution to question Officer Adams regarding Moore\u2019s theory that Officer Adams was unaware of the 911 calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">\u00b613 We generally refuse to consider arguments raised for the first time on appeal because \u2018it is fundamentally unfair to fault the trial court for failing to rule on an issue it was never given the opportunity to consider.\u201d <em>State v. LaFreniere, </em>2008 MT 99, \u00b6 11, 342 Mont. 309, 180 P.3d 1161 (internal quotation omitted). An objection that is \u2018Very general in nature\u201d does not preserve an issue for appeal. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 12 (internal quotation omitted). Similarly, a motion in limine, while relieving a party of its duty to contemporaneously object at trial, <em>must be specific and articulate the grounds for the objection. Ankeny, </em>\u00b6 39 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">\u00b614  Moore did not object to the 911 transcripts in Municipal Court. In fact, she stipulated to their admission during the evidentiary hearing. Comments made by both parties and the Municipal Court during the hearing demonstrate a common, shared belief that the 911 transcripts were admitted into the record. At one point in the hearing, the prosecution questioned Kurt concerning what he knew when he called 911. Moore objected, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">Your Honor, we stipulated to the transcript to the 911 call. And the transcript is available to the court, filed with the court, and it\u2019s very clear what he said to 911. Now he\u2019s being asked how he knew that his wife had been drinking. <em>If we exceed what he said in the transcript we are exceeding the ruling or the previous ruling of the court on this matter. '</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">(Emphasis added.) Moore assented to and relied upon the 911 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>transcripts during the hearing. Her general, global objection at the beginning of the hearing did not preserve for appeal her current objection to the 911 transcripts. <em>See LaFreniere, </em>\u00b6 12. Further, treating Moore\u2019s global objection as a motion in limine does not change the result. Her objection was not specific enough to relieve her of her duty to contemporaneously object during the hearing. <em>See </em>Ankeny, \u00b6 39. The District Court correctly determined Moore did not preserve her objection for appeal and properly considered the 911 transcripts in analyzing whether particularized suspicion existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">\u00b615 Issue 2: <em>Does substantial evidence support the District Court\u2019s finding that Officer Adams had particularized suspicion to conduct an investigatory stop of Moore\u2019s vehicle?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">\u00b616 The United States Constitution and the Montana Constitution prohibit unreasonable searches and seizures. U.S. Const. amend. IV; Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a7 11. These constitutional protections apply to investigatory stops of vehicles. <em>State v. Rutherford, </em>2009 MT 154, \u00b6 11, 350 Mont. 403, 208 P.3d 389; <em>State v. Gopher, </em>193 Mont. 189, 194, 631 P.2d 293, 296 (1981). An investigatory stop is valid where an officer possesses particularized suspicion that the occupant of the vehicle \u201c \u2018has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rutherford, </em>\u00b6 11 (quoting \u00a7 46-5-401(1), MCA). Particularized suspicion exists when an officer has (1) objective data and articulable facts from which he or she can make certain inferences and (2) a resulting suspicion that the vehicle\u2019s occupant is, or has been, engaged in wrongdoing. <em>Brown v. State, </em>2009 MT 64, \u00b6 20, 349 Mont. 408, 203 P.3d 842. Whether particularized suspicion exists is evaluated under the totality of the circumstances and requires consideration of the quantity or content of the information available to the officer and the quality or degree of reliability of that information. <em>Rutherford, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"AzP\">\u00b617 When an officer\u2019s particularized suspicion is based upon a citizen informant\u2019s report, the report must contain some indicia of reliability. <em>Pratt, </em>286 Mont, at 164, 951 P.2d at 42. We assess the reliability of the informant\u2019s report under the three-part test we adopted in <em>Pratt. </em>Under <em>Pratt, </em>we consider (1) whether the informant identified himself or herself to the authorities; (2) whether the informant\u2019s report is based on personal observations; and, (3) whether the officer\u2019s observations corroborated the informant\u2019s <em>information.Id. </em>at 165, 951 P.2d at 42-43. We consider each <em>Pratt </em>factor separately below.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">1. Whether the informant identified himself or herself to the authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>\u00b618 \u201cA citizen informant who is motivated by good citizenship<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and [is] willing to disclose the circumstances by which the incriminating information became known is presumed to be telling the truth.\u201d <em>State v. Martinez, </em>2003 MT 65, \u00b6 34, 314 Mont. 434, 67 P.3d 207 (internal quotations omitted). Information provided by the citizen informant, such as the citizen informant\u2019s name, address, and telephone number, lends a \u2018high indicia of reliability\u201d to his or her report. <em>State v. Myhre, </em>2005 MT 278, \u00b6 18, 329 Mont. 210, 124 P.3d 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">\u00b619 Moore concedes Laurie provided sufficient information to meet this first prong, but argues Kurt did not. Moore argues Kurt was not acting out of good citizenship, but was motivated by his argument with Moore and desire to avoid a speeding ticket. The Municipal Court and District Court rejected this argument, finding Kurt was acting out of concern for the safety of Moore and society. The record does not support Moore\u2019s argument. Laurie and Kurt provided sufficient information to satisfy this first <em>Pratt </em>factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">2. Whether the informant\u2019s report is based on personal observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">\u00b620 As an initial matter, we note that \u2018Ta]ll information that the citizen informant gives to the dispatcher is relevant when evaluating the justification for an investigative stop, whether or not it is specifically relayed to the officer in the field.\u201d <em>Clawson, </em>\u00b6 12. Contrary to Moore\u2019s assertion, this Court has never required evidence to be presented demonstrating 911 dispatchers are capable of making particularized suspicion determinations. Rather, our precedent provides that courts should Took beyond the information given to the investigating officer to include the information known to the dispatching officer.\u201d <em>Rutherford, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">\u00b621 The second significant factor under <em>Pratt </em>is whether the informant\u2019s report is based on personal observations. <em>Pratt, </em>286 Mont. at 165, 951 P.2d at 42. An officer is allowed to infer that a report is based on a citizen informant\u2019s personal observations if the report contains sufficient detail that \u201c\u2018it is apparent that the informant ha[s] not been fabricating [the] report out of whole cloth ... [and] the report [is] of the sort which in common experience may be recognized as having been obtained in a reliable way ....\u2019 <em>\u201dId. </em>at 165, 951 P.2d at 42-43 (citing <em>State v. Villegas-Varela, </em>887 P.2d 809, 811 (Or. 1994) (quoting <em>Spinelli v. U.S., </em>393 U.S. 410, 417-18, 89 S. Ct. 584, 589-90 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>(1969) (overruled on other grounds))). An informant\u2019s belief that a person is DUI must be based, in part, on his or her personal observations. <em>Clawson, </em>\u00b6 13. Innocent details that were personally observed by the informant are also relevant in assessing the reliability of the report. <em>Pratt, </em>286 Mont. at 165-66, 951 P.2d at 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">\u00b622 Moore argues that Laurie\u2019s and Kurt\u2019s reports do not satisfy the second prong of <em>Pratt </em>because they do not provide objective or articulable facts that indicate they personally observed Moore driving under the influence of alcohol. Specifically, Moore argues Kurt did not personally observe Moore drinking and only reported innocent and secondhand details to 911.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moore attacks Laurie\u2019s report on the basis that it is lay opinion, and that, therefore, pursuant to our holdings in <em>State v. Reiner, </em>2003 MT 243, 317 Mont. 304, 77 P.3d 210, and <em>State v. Lee, </em>282 Mont. 391, 938 P.2d 637 (1997), her mere opinion is insufficient to justify an investigative stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">\u00b623 Here, both informants provided information based on their personal observations. Laurie personally witnessed Moore\u2019s intoxication and driving minutes before she called 911. Based on her interaction with Moore, Laurie was able to conclude and report to 911 that Moore had drank \u201ca lot\u201d and should not be driving. Laurie\u2019s report is not \u201cmere opinion\u201d like Moore asserts, and the cases Moore relies on are distinguishable. Both <em>Reiner </em>and <em>Lee </em>involved anonymous informants who reported possible intoxicated drivers, but neither informant provided dispatch with any bases indicating he/she had personally observed Reiner or Lee drinking. <em>Reiner, </em>\u00b6 3; <em>Lee, </em>282 Mont. at 395, 938 P.2d at 640. Unlike the informants in <em>Reiner </em>and <em>Lee, </em>Laurie identified herself and indicated she had personally observed Moore (Moore was at Laurie\u2019s home), leading to her conclusion that Moore had \u201ca lot\u201d to drink.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">\u00b624 Kurt reported Moore had admitted to him over the telephone that she had been drinking; that Laurie had informed him Moore had been drinking; and that he was following Moore\u2019s vehicle as he spoke to 911. Citing State <em>v. Williamson, </em>1998 MT 199, 290 Mont. 321, 965 P.2d 231, Moore incorrectly faults Kurt\u2019s report for being based, in part, on what Laurie told him. <em>Williamson </em>dealt with whether, based on a citizen informant\u2019s report, probable cause (a higher standard than particularized suspicion) existed. We concluded the officer did not have probable cause, but we noted the report created a particularized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>suspicion. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 33. We have acknowledged that an informant\u2019s report may be based, in part, on what a reliable third party told him or her. <em>See Clawson, </em>\u00b6 13 (informant based her report upon her own personal observations and her husband\u2019s interactions with the defendant and subsequent conclusion the defendant was intoxicated). Substantial evidence supports the District Court\u2019s conclusion here that the second <em>Pratt </em>factor was met, as both reports were based upon personal observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">3. Whether the officer\u2019s observations corroborated the informant\u2019s information.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">\u00b625 An officer corroborates an informant\u2019s report by observing illegal activity <em>or </em>by finding \u201cthe person, the vehicle, and the vehicle\u2019s location substantially as described by the informant.\u201d <em>Pratt, </em>286 Mont. at 165, 951 P.2d at 43 (emphasis added). If the first and second <em>Pratt </em>factors are met, an officer may corroborate an informant\u2019s tip by observing wholly innocent behavior. <em>Id. </em>at 168, 951 P.2d at 44. This Court has determined an officer corroborated an informant\u2019s report when the officer observed such innocent information as the vehicle\u2019s make, model, and color and found it heading in the direction reported. <em>Rutherford, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">\u00b626 Moore concedes Officer Adams corroborated innocent details. We agree. Officer Adams corroborated Kurt\u2019s and Laurie\u2019s reports when she observed a female driver in a red and silver Blazer, traveling on the street and direction that Kurt described. Because the first and second <em>Pratt </em>factors were met, Officer Adams satisfied the third <em>Pratt </em>factor by observing Moore, in her vehicle, heading in the direction Kurt described.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">\u00b627  The District Court correctly determined Moore did not preserve for appeal her objection to the 911 transcripts. Substantial evidence supports the District Court\u2019s findings that all three <em>Pratt </em>factors were satisfied and that particularized suspicion existed justifying the investigatory stop of Moore\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">\u00b628 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b59-10\">JUSTICES COTTER, RICE, NELSON and MORRIS.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b57-8\"> \u2018This Court distinguishes the concerned citizen who reports a chance encounter with crime as a civic duty from the confidential informant who works with police by reporting on the illegal activities of others.\u201d <em>Martinez, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b58-7\"> Moore admitted to Kurt to having consumed one beer; Kurt witnessed Moore driving in a normal manner; and, Kurt had learned from Laurie that Moore had been drinking.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
