We affirm the District Court and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">\u00b62 We consider the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">\u00b63 <em>1. Whether the District Court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Harmon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">\u00b64 <em>2. Whether the District Court erred in denying Waitt\u2019s motion to vacate, alter or amend.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">\u00b65 <em>3. Whether the District Court erred in denying Waitt\u2019s Rule 56(f) motion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-13\">\u00b66 <em>4. Whether Harmon is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b181-15\">\u00b67 This case concerns two competing wills made slightly over one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>month apart near the end of the decedent\u2019s life. The District Court granted Harmon\u2019s motion for summary judgment in favor of the probate of a will executed by the decedent, Cecelia Harmon (Cecelia), on January 31,2009 (the \u201cJanuary Will\u201d). The court dismissed Waitt\u2019s formal petition to probate a handwritten document Waitt claims is a valid holographic will executed by Cecelia in December 2008, and denied Waitt\u2019s motion to vacate, alter or amend the order granting summary judgment in favor of Harmon.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">\u00b68 Cecelia\u2019s first will was executed in 1976. This initial will left the entirety of her estate to her then-husband should he survive her, and to her adopted son Harmon should her husband predecease her. In 2008, Cecelia suffered a stroke and Waitt became her caregiver some time thereafter. On December 23, 2008, Cecelia hand wrote the document that Waitt contends is a valid holographic will (the \u2018Holographic Will\u201d). The document did not explicitly revoke the 1976 will, but left several pieces of property to Waitt and provided that Cecelia\u2019s tenant Kermit Knudson (Knudson) would have the option to purchase the property he had long rented at a fraction of its appraised value.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">\u00b69 In January 2009, Cecelia was hospitalized with an illness that was later determined to be pancreatic cancer. She was released several weeks later. On January 31, Cecelia executed a self-proved will at her home, in the presence of her attorney, Joseph Sullivan (Sullivan), two witnesses from Sullivan\u2019s office, Harmon, and Harmon\u2019s family. This will explicitly revoked all prior wills, including the 1976 Will and the Holographic Will, and left all property to Harmon.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">\u00b610 Cecelia made both Harmon and Sullivan aware of her desires with respect to Waitt and Knudson. Sullivan\u2019s affidavit stated he discussed with Cecelia the January Will\u2019s omission of explicit bequests to Waitt and specifically offered to reinstate those bequests, but Cecelia confirmed her desire that Harmon simply carry out her wishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">\u00b611 Cecelia died on March 29,2009. The January Will was informally admitted to probate on April 8. Harmon was appointed Personal Representative of the Estate. On September 2, 2009, Harmon filed a motion seeking court approval of his proposed partial distribution of the estate and sale of real property. The District Court entered an order approving the proposed distributions shortly thereafter. With that approval, Harmon facilitated the transfer of a home and two vehicles to Waitt and the discounted purchase of the rental home by Knudson. Waitt received less property than the Holographic Will had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>left him, however, and Knudson purchased the home at a substantially lesser discount than was provided for in the Holographic Will.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">\u00b612 On November 20, 2009, Waitt filed a motion seeking his own appointment as Personal Representative and formal probate of the Holographic Will. Harmon filed a motion for summary judgment on November 27, 2009, seeking confirmation of the January Will. The District Court held a hearing on Harmon\u2019s motion on March 23, 2010. Waitt filed a motion and supporting documents on the day of trial seeking a continuance for additional discovery pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 56(f). After oral argument, the court denied Waitt\u2019s Rule 56(f) motion and granted summary judgment to Harmon in open court. The court subsequently issued a written order on March 26 incorporating its oral decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">\u00b613 Waitt filed a motion to vacate, alter or amend on April 16, 2010. The District Court took no action within 60 days, and the motion was deemed denied pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 52(d). Waitt timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">\u00b614 We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, using the same standards applied by the district court under M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>Rich v. Ellingson, </em>2007 MT 346, \u00b6 12, 340 Mont. 285, 174 P.3d 491. The moving party has the burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>Once the moving party has met this burden, the non-moving party must present substantial evidence essential to one or more elements of the case to raise a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Apple Park, L.L.C. v. Apple Park Condos., L.L.C., </em>2008 MT 284, \u00b6 11, 345 Mont. 359, 192 P.3d 232. Reliance upon \u201cconclusory statements\u201d lacking specific factual support is not sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact. <em>PPL Mont., L.L.C. v. State, </em>2010 MT 64, \u00b6 84, 355 Mont. 402, 229 P.3d 421 (citing <em>Smith v. Burlington N. and Santa Fe Ry. Co., </em>2008 MT 225, \u00b6 10, 344 Mont. 278, 187 P.3d 639). We review evidentiary rulings made in the context of a summary judgment proceeding de novo, in order to determine whether the evidentiary requirements for summary judgment have been satisfied. <em>PPL Mont., </em>\u00b6 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">\u00b615 We review the denial of a motion to vacate, alter or amend for an abuse of discretion. <em>Essex Ins. Co. v. Moose\u2019s Saloon, Inc., </em>2007 MT 202, \u00b6 16, 338 Mont. 423, 166 P.3d 451. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Stanton v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number><em>Wells Fargo Bank Mont., </em>N.A., 2007 MT 22, \u00b6 17, 335 Mont. 384, 152 P.3d 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">\u00b616 <em>1. Whether the District Court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Harmon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">\u00b617 Waitt raises numerous assertions of error regarding the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. He argues that Harmon\u2019s motion was improperly granted due to the existence of genuine issues of material fact, the erroneous exclusion of portions of affidavit testimony submitted by Waitt, and the court\u2019s failure to analyze the elements of undue influence under \u00a728-2-407, MCA. Because the correctness of the District Court\u2019s ruling on summary judgment depends on the resolution of these sub-issues, we will address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">\u00b618 <em>Existence of genuine issues of material fact.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">\u00b619 Under \u00a772-3-310, MCA, the proponent of a will has the burden of establishing that it has been duly executed under the criteria set out in \u00a772-2-522(1), MCA. Where a will has been simultaneously executed, attested and acknowledged by the testator and witnesses, in the manner set out in \u00a7 72-2-524, MCA, it is self-proved and may be admitted to probate without testimony of the attesting witnesses. Section 72-3-309(2), MCA. Where a duly executed will is admitted to probate, a further presumption exists that the testator was competent and of sound mind. <em>In re Est. of Brooks, </em>279 Mont. 516, 521, 927 P.2d 1024, 1027 (1996). Furthermore, the party contesting a will bears the burden of establishing lack of testamentary intent or capacity, undue influence, fraud, duress, mistake, or revocation, and bears the ultimate burden of persuasion on these elements. Section 72-3-310, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">\u00b620 Waitt\u2019s sole contention is that the January Will was a result of undue influence. Section 28-2-407, MCA, defines undue influence as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-10\">(1) the use by one in whom a confidence is reposed by another person or who holds a real or apparent authority over the other person of the confidence or authority for the purpose of obtaining an unfair advantage over the other person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-11\">(2) taking an unfair advantage of another person\u2019s weakness of mind; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-12\">(3) taking a grossly oppressive and unfair advantage of another person\u2019s necessities or distress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-13\">To determine whether the statutory requirements have been met, a court may consider: (1) any confidential relationship between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>person alleged to be exercising undue influence and the donor; (2) the physical condition of the donor as it may affect his or her ability to withstand influence; (3) the mental condition of the donor as it may affect his or her ability to withstand influence; (4) the unnaturalness of the disposition as it relates to showing an imbalanced mind or a mind easily susceptible to influence; and (5) the demands and importunities as they may affect the donor, taking into account the time, place and surrounding circumstances. <em>In re Est. of Harms, </em>2006 MT 320, \u00b6 21, 335 Mont. 66, 149 P.3d 557 (citations omitted). These criteria are nonexclusive considerations available to guide the court in its application of statutory requirements, and may or may not be present in any given undue influence case. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 21 (citing <em>In re Est. of Bradshaw, </em>2001 MT 92, \u00b6 16, 305 Mont. 178, 24 P.3d 211; <em>Mowrer v. Eddie, </em>1999 MT 73, \u00b6 31, 294 Mont. 35, 979 P.2d 156).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">\u00b621 We also have explained that the mere opportunity to exercise undue influence on the testator is not sufficient to prove undue influence. We consider opportunity together with the alleged acts of influence to determine if the acts amount to undue influence. <em>In re Est. of Lien, </em>270 Mont. 295, 304, 892 P.2d 530, 535 (1995). To meet his burden and defeat summary judgment, therefore, Waitt was required to present admissible evidence of specific acts of undue influence sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\u00b622  General allegations of poor health are not sufficient to show undue influence. Rather, evidence must be presented that proves undue influence actually was \u201cexercised upon the mind of the testator directly to procure the execution of the will. Mere suspicion that undue influence may have or could have been brought to bear is not sufficient.\u201d <em>In re Est. of Lightfield, </em>2009 MT 244, \u00b6 33, 351 Mont. 426, 213 P.3d 468 (quoting <em>In re Est. of Wittman, </em>2001 MT 109, \u00b6 21, 305 Mont. 290, 27 P.3d 35).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">\u00b623 <em>Exclusion of affidavit testimony.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">\u00b624 As a threshold matter, whether Waitt raised a genuine issue of material fact is largely dependent on the admissibility of testimony he submitted by affidavit. Waitt contends the court erred in excluding portions of the affidavits critical to his claims. These affidavits, purporting to be declarations of the decedent evidencing testamentary intent, constitute the primary evidence offered by Waitt as to the presence of undue influence, the gravamen of his claim that the January Will is invalid. Waitt\u2019s affidavit states, \u2018Cecelia told me that her adopted son Roger was very greedy, that I should hide the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>[Holographic Will] from him, because he would go through all of her papers at the house, and that I would need to bring [the Holographic Will] out because of Roger\u2019s greed,\u201d and that Cecelia \u201csaid that she had been \u2018hoodwinked\u2019\u201d after the execution of the January Will. Knudson\u2019s affidavit states that Cecelia \u2018told me that she was going to change this \u2018damned\u2019 Will to the way she wanted it-not the way Roger Harmon wanted it,\u201d and that \u201cshe told me that Dennis Waitt had been more of a son to her than Roger Harmon had been.\u201d Similarly, Emma White\u2019s (White) affidavit states that \u2018Cecelia said she wanted Dennis Waitt to have the house he was living in and the home next door.\u201d In sum, the affidavits contain purported statements of the decedent, Cecelia, to show her intent to give property to Waitt and to allow Knudson to purchase his rental home at discount, and about Harmon\u2019s allegedly heavy-handed and self-interested treatment of Cecelia.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">\u00b625 Supporting and opposing affidavits in the summary judgment context are to \u201cbe made on personal knowledge,\u201d and \u201cshall set forth facts as would be admissible in evidence ,...\u201dM. R. Civ. P. 56(e). Rules 801 and 802 of the Montana Rules of Evidence provide that statements, other than those made by the declarant while testifying at trial, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted, are inadmissible unless an exception to the hearsay rule applies. Thus, Rule 56(e) makes clear that statements in affidavits made without personal knowledge, or based on hearsay, are not admissible and cannot be considered on summary judgment. <em>PPL Mont., </em>\u00b6 92. The statements in the affidavits in the present case are those of an out-of-court declarant (Cecelia) offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted therein (that the statements reflected Cecelia\u2019s true testamentary intent). As such, the statements are not admissible under the prohibition against hearsay evidence, and properly were disregarded by the District Court, unless they fit into an exception to the rule. Waitt advances several such exceptions in defense of the excluded statements. Harmon disagrees that any of these exceptions applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">\u00b626  After careful consideration of each of Waitt\u2019s contentions, we affirm the District Court\u2019s exclusion of the affidavit testimony. None of the exceptions to the hearsay rule advanced by Waitt compels a conclusion that the District Court erred in excluding the testimony. \u00b627 Waitt first asserts the \u201ctransaction rule\u201d codified in \u00a726-1-103, MCA, as support for admissibility of the excluded statements in his own affidavit (Aff. Waitt \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6, 8 (Feb. 8, 2010)). The statute provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>that \u201c[w]here the declaration, act, or omission forms part of a transaction which is itself the fact in dispute or evidence of that fact, such declaration, act, or omission is evidence as part of the transaction.\u201d He further argues that Cecelia\u2019s alleged statement that she was \u2018hoodwinked\u201d (Aff. Waitt at \u00b6 8) is admissible as an excited utterance, under M. R. Evid. 803(2); is admissible to show Cecelia\u2019s state of mind, under M. R. Evid. 803(3), and is admissible under the \u201ccatch-all\u201d provision of M. R. Evid. 803(24). Waitt cites <em>In re Est. of Silver, </em>2000 MT 127, \u00b6 20, 299 Mont. 506, 1 P.3d 358, <em>Thompson v. Steinkamp, </em>120 Mont. 475, 481, 187 P.2d 1018, 1021 (1947), and <em>Anderson v. Baker, </em>196 Mont. 494, 500-01, 641 P.2d 1035, 1038 (1982), in support of the statements\u2019 admissibility under Rule 803(3) and (24). Lastly, Waitt argues that the excluded statements in his affidavit are admissible pursuant to M. R. Evid. 804(b)(5), citing <em>Hobbs v. Pac. Hide &amp; Fur Depot, </em>236 Mont. 503, 513, 771 P.2d 125, 131 (1989). Waitt makes similar arguments as to the admissibility of testimony in Knudson\u2019s and White\u2019s affidavits (Aff. Knudson \u00b6\u00b6 3-5 (Mar. 11, 2010); Aff. White \u00b6\u00b6 6-7 (Mar. 23, 2010)): that the statements therein are admissible as evidencing a then-existing mental state under 803(3) and the rules set out in <em>Silver, Thompson, </em>and <em>Anderson; </em>and under M. R. Evid. 804(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">\u00b628 Waitt cites no supporting authority for his position that the \u2018transaction rule\u201din \u00a726-1-103, MCA, applies in the present context, and offers no legal analysis placing the statements within the ambit of the rule. It is unclear how the statements could be considered part of the \u2018transaction\u201d of the January Will signing. Cecelia\u2019s purported explanations some time after the signing of the January Will were not part of the transaction of the will\u2019s execution. It is not our obligation to conduct legal research or develop legal analysis supporting a party\u2019s position. M. R. App. P. 12(f); <em>In re Est. of Bayers, </em>1999 MT 154, \u00b6 19, 295 Mont. 89, 983 P.2d 339. In the absence of authority to the contrary, we decline to farther consider the merits of Waitt\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\u00b629 Second, Waitt claims Cecelia\u2019s statement that she was \u2018hoodwinked\u201d by the January Will signing is admissible as an excited utterance under M. R. Evid. 803(2). Waitt\u2019s affidavit recounts his observation that on the night after the January Will signing, Cecelia was \u201cvery upset,\u201d and that she said \u201cshe had been hoodwinked.\u201d Harmon disputes the existence of any \u201cstartling event or condition\u201d as required by the rule. While Waitt suggests the signing of the January Will could constitute such an event, he had no personal knowledge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>the event and Harmon and Sullivan vigorously disputed that Cecelia appeared to be under any undue stress.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">\u00b630 Furthermore, the signing occurred numerous hours prior to the alleged statement. Case law suggests a more demanding standard under the rule for excitement and closeness in time. <em>See e.g. State v. Norgaard, </em>201 Mont. 165, 176, 653 P.2d 483, 488 (1982) (upholding a district court\u2019s conclusion that the excited utterance rule should not apply to a statement made one hour after a verbal argument); <em>State v. Swazio, </em>173 Mont. 440, 443-44, 568 P.2d 124, 126 (1977) (holding that a statement made by a witness to a shooting \u201can hour or two\u201d after the incident was not an excited utterance, as it was not made \u201cwhile the speaker was laboring under excitement and before he had to time to reflect\u2019]); <em>Sullivan v. Metro. Life Ins. </em>Co., 96 Mont. 254, 268-69, 29 P.2d 1046, 1049-50 (1934) (citing cases denying the admissibility of statements made \u201cten to thirty minutes,\u201d\u201cthirty to forty minutes,\u201d and \u201cfifteen to thirty minutes\u201d after the exciting events). Cases admitting statements made longer than a few minutes after the incident have involved severe personal trauma, such as domestic abuse or rape. <em>See e.g. State v. Mizenko, </em>2006 MT 11, \u00b6 33, 330 Mont. 299, 127 P.3d 458; <em>State v. </em>Cameron, 2005 MT 32, \u00b6 36, 326 Mont. 51, 106 P.3d 1189. We therefore conclude the District Court did not err in refusing to admit the statement as an excited utterance.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">\u00b631 Waitt also contends that Cecelia\u2019s \u2018hoodwinked\u201d statement is admissible under M. R. Evid. 803(3) as reflecting her then-existing state of mind shortly after she signed the January Will. Waitt provides no supporting analysis besides his conclusory statement that the rule applies. The rule specifically excludes any \u201cstatement of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed,\u201d lest the exception swallow the rule. As Waitt offers the statement to prove the fact believed-that Cecelia was \u201choodwinked\u201d-fehe rule is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">\u00b632 The federal version of Rule 803(3) prohibits statements of memory or belief made to prove the fact remembered or believed <em>unless </em>the statement relates to the \u201cexecution, revocation, identification, or terms of [the] declarant\u2019s will.\u201d F. R. Evid. 803(3). The Commission Comments to the rule make clear that Montana\u2019s rejection of the federal exception was intentional and based on its inconsistency with Montana law. The Comments explain, \u2018Montana case law holds the declarations of the testator are not admissible as to the existence or revocation of the will and the testator\u2019s attitude toward the contestee of the will.\u201d Commn. Comments, M. R. Evid. 803(3) (citing <em>In re </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number><em>Miller\u2019s Est., </em>71 Mont. 330, 341, 229 P. 851 (1924); <em>In re Colbert\u2019s Est., </em>31 Mont. 461, 471, 78 P. 971 (1904)). The District Court properly refused admission of the statement under M. R. Evid. 803(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">\u00b633 Waitt next argues that all of the excluded statements are admissible because they are reflective of Cecelia\u2019s intent with respect to her will, citing <em>Silver, Thompson, </em>and <em>Anderson. </em>Following the rule of these cases, Waitt assumes Cecelia\u2019s intent is a material element of the dispute over whether the will was signed under undue influence, and therefore, declarations she made indicating the intent with which she performed the acts relating to the wills are admissible. Waitt also cites M. R. Evid. 803(24), the \u201ccatch-all\u201d hearsay exception allowing statements \u2018having comparable circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d to the listed exceptions in Rule 803, in support of this contention. We conclude for the reasons that follow that the cases cited by Waitt do not compel the resolution he suggests.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">\u00b634 In both <em>Anderson </em>and <em>Silver, </em>the Court explicitly pinned its holding on the fact the agreements in question were standard form documents governing ownership of a joint bank account and safety deposit box, respectively. <em>Anderson, </em>196 Mont. at 500-01, 641 P.2d at 1038-39; <em>Silver, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19-21 (quoting <em>Anderson). </em>We held in each case that it was appropriate to consider extrinsic evidence, given that the bank\u2019s form document was drafted largely to protect the institution and was not likely to represent the true understanding of the parties. <em>Anderson </em>at 500, 641 P.2d at 1038; <em>Silver, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19-21. In contrast, a duly executed will admitted to probate presumptively reflects the true intentions of the testator, since in such circumstances the testator is presumed competent and of sound mind and a contestant of the will bears the burden of proving that the will does not reflect the testator\u2019s intent. Section 72-3-310, MCA; <em>Est. of Brooks, </em>279 Mont. at 521, 927 P.2d at 1027. It is logical that the law treats wills differently from instruments designed by banks: conceptually, a will is designed with the sole purpose of expressing and carrying out the testator\u2019s intent, whereas a deposit account agreement is drafted with numerous unrelated purposes in mind, as noted in <em>Anderson </em>and <em>Silver.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">\u00b635 Nor does <em>Thompson </em>compel the resolution Waitt suggests. The plaintiff in <em>Thompson </em>gave the defendant a large sum of money with which to purchase a home. The parties disputed whether the plaintiff intended to make an outright gift of the money, or whether he gave the money so that the defendant could purchase and hold the house on his behalf. We allowed evidence of statements made by the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>regarding his intent in giving the money to the defendant, reasoning that \u201c[w]hen intent is a material element of a disputed fact, declarations of a decedent made after as well as before an alleged act that indicate the intent with which he performed the act are admissible in evidence as an exception to the hearsay rule, and it is immaterial that such declarations are self-serving.\u201d <em>Thompson, </em>120 Mont. at 481, 187 P.2d at 1021 (quoting <em>Whitlow v. Durst, </em>127 P.2d 530, 531 (Cal. 1942)).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">\u00b636 <em>Thompson </em>was decided before adoption of the Montana Rules of Evidence, and is distinguishable in any event because intent is not a material element of a disputed fact in the case before us. As noted above, the only ground specified in \u00a772-3-310, MCA, upon which Waitt contests Cecelia\u2019s will is undue influence. Thus, the \u201cdisputed facts\u201d here are those that would demonstrate a genuine issue of fact as to specific acts of undue influence. In light of this framework, it is clear that <em>Thompson </em>does not render the excluded statements admissible. Cecelia\u2019s intentions when she signed the January Will, or her alleged feelings about Harmon\u2019s greed, do not tend to prove or disprove any of the elements of undue influence. Therefore, we cannot conclude the District Court erred in declining to apply the holding in <em>Thompson </em>to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">\u00b637  Finally, Waitt claims the statements are admissible under M. R. Evid. 804(b)(5). This rule is a \u201ccatch-all\u201d provision when the declarant is unavailable, and allows admission of a statement that has \u201ccomparable circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d to the four enumerated exceptions in Rule 804(b): former testimony, statements made under belief of impending death, statements against interest, and statements of personal or family history. There are no such circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness associated with the statements in the affidavits submitted by Waitt. Given the often highly contentious nature of estate distribution, the opposite is true. Montana law has historically been hostile to the admissibility of out-of-court statements made by the testator regarding his or her testamentary intentions when a valid will exists and the testator\u2019s mental capacity is not at issue. <em>In re Colbert\u2019s Est., </em>31 Mont. at 472-73, 78 P. at 974-75 (quoting <em>Throckmorton v. Holt, </em>180 U.S. 552, 573-74, 21 S. Ct. 474, 482-83 (1901)). The District Court did not err in concluding that Rule 804(b)(5) was inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">\u00b638 For the above reasons, we conclude the District Court did not err in excluding the above-referenced portions of the affidavit testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>of Waitt, Knudson, and White.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">\u00b639 <em>Application of admissible evidence to the summary judgment standard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">\u00b640 In its summary judgment ruling, the District Court considered the following admitted evidence: Waitt\u2019s affidavit testimony that, in his estimation as a medical technician, Cecelia was in poor physical condition and unable to withstand influence on the date of the January Will signing (Aff. Waitt at \u00b6\u00b6 7, 9), and Knudson\u2019s affidavit testimony that Cecelia was in poor physical condition (Aff. Knudson at \u00b6 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">\u00b641 The District Court concluded that this evidence was insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact. The court noted that no assertions of reduced mental capacity were made and that statements relating to her poor health in general did not in any way demonstrate that Cecelia was deprived of her ability to withstand undue influence.</p>\n<p id=\"A26\">\u00b642 The court also concluded that no unnatural disposition had occurred as Cecelia had left her estate to her only son, consistent with her long-standing testamentary plan. The court noted it would be far <em>more </em>unnatural to give a substantial portion of an estate to a non-relative caretaker, regardless of the disposition in the Holographic Will.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">\u00b643 The court finally concluded that Waitt failed to rebut any of the facts establishing the voluntary, knowing, and willing execution of the January Will. The court also noted, as further evidence of this interpretation, that Sullivan discussed with Cecelia that she could change the terms of the will at any time, but that she elected not to do so in the weeks preceding her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">\u00b644 We agree with the District Court that in the absence of the excluded testimony, Waitt did not present sufficient evidence to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact on any element of undue influence, even when considered in the light most favorable to Waitt. Montana law does not consider illness alone as evidence of reduced ability to withstand influence, or the existence of a confidential relationship, without more, as proof of undue influence. <em>Stanton v. Wells Fargo Bank Mont., N.A., </em>2007 MT 22, \u00b6\u00b6 25-26, 335 Mont. 384, 152 P.3d 115 (concluding that a confidential relationship existed, but stating Tt]he mere opportunity to exercise undue influence on the testator is not sufficient, however, to prove undue influence,\u201d and distinguishing between weakened physical or mental condition and the ability to withstand influence). Evidence of specific acts of undue influence is required, and Waitt offered no such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>evidence. <em>Est. of Lien, </em>270 Mont. at 304, 892 P.2d at 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">\u00b645 <em>Analysis of undue influence under \u00a728-2-407, MCA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">\u00b646 Waitt\u2019s final contention regarding the motion for summary judgment is that the District Court erred in not analyzing each of the statutory elements and non-statutory factors for determining undue influence. We conclude that the District Court correctly analyzed the evidence presented to it, and any alleged failure to consider particular elements was the logical result of a lack of admissible evidence being presented on that element. As we have noted, the unique factual circumstances of each case give the court discretion to determine which of the non-statutory factors bears relevance to its determination. <em>Harms, </em>\u00b6 21; <em>Bradshaw, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">\u00b647 Waitt argues the District Court failed to analyze \u00a728-2-407(1), MCA, which provides that undue influence consists of\u2018the use by one in whom a confidence is reposed by another person or who holds a real or apparent authority over the other person of the confidence or authority for the purpose of obtaining an unfair advantage over the other person.\u201d As the District Court observed, and as the statute reflects, the mere existence of a confidential relationship is insufficient to show that the relationship was <em>used </em>for the purpose of obtaining an unfair advantage. Implicit in the District Court\u2019s statement is the conclusion that Waitt failed to present evidence sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact showing Harmon used his allegedly confidential relationship with Cecelia for the purpose of obtaining an unfair advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">\u00b648  Because the District Court\u2019s evidentiary rulings were correct, Waitt failed to present any genuine issues of fact, and the court correctly analyzed Waitt\u2019s claim of undue influence, we conclude that summary judgment was properly granted to Harmon.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">\u00b649 <em>2. Whether the District Court erred in denying Waitt\u2019s motion to vacate, alter or amend.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">\u00b650 Waitt filed a motion to vacate, alter or amend on two distinct bases: Harmon\u2019s failure to comply with discovery requests and the District Court\u2019s consideration of Harmon\u2019s affidavits. We address these bases in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">\u00b651 First, <em>citing Richardson v. State, </em>2006 MT 43, \u00b6\u00b6 56, 63, 331 Mont. 231,130 P.3d 634, Waitt argues the court\u2019s summary judgment order should be vacated for Harmon\u2019s failure to comply with discovery requests. He recounts a litany of alleged abuses. In <em>Richardson, </em>we reversed a district court\u2019s order denying a motion to amend a final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>judgment because of numerous discovery violations. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 69. <em>Richardson </em>involved abuses of the discovery process we characterized as \u2018blatant and systematic\u201d and concluded were sufficiently egregious to warrant a default judgment. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">\u00b652 No comparable facts are present here. Waitt took no action on Harmon\u2019s discovery responses for months until a flurry of activity immediately before trial, and first raised objections to Harmon\u2019s discovery responses in his Rule 56(f) motion to continue discovery on the morning of trial. Objections with any specificity were first included in Waitt\u2019s motion to vacate, alter or amend. While Waitt alleges on appeal that Harmon avoided producing relevant information in response to discovery requests, information provided was incomplete, and responses were not properly amended to reflect information in the affidavits, these points strike us as plausible grounds for requesting trial court involvement during the discovery process, not grounds for this Court to vacate the District Court\u2019s order as in <em>Richardson. </em>The trial court is \u201cin the best position to determine both whether the party in question has disregarded the opponent\u2019s rights, and which sanctions are most appropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 21. We review a district court\u2019s decisions regarding the discovery process for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Est. of Nielsen v. Pardis, </em>265 Mont. 470, 478, 878 P.2d 234, 238 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">\u00b653 We conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Waitt\u2019s motion based on alleged discovery abuses. The court took a dim view of Waitt\u2019s contentions that Harmon\u2019s responses to discovery were inadequate in light of the absence of any request to involve the court in the discovery process in the four months after Harmon\u2019s motion for summary judgment was filed. Waitt\u2019s inactivity further distinguishes <em>Richardson, </em>where the plaintiff diligently pursued the sought discovery responses and the court was heavily involved in the discovery process at the plaintiffs request.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">\u00b654 We next consider Waitt\u2019s argument that the court erred in denying his motion on the ground that it erroneously considered Harmon\u2019s improperly served affidavits. Waitt cites M. R. Civ. P. 6(d), which provides that affidavits must be served with motions they support, as the basis for this contention. He argues that Harmon failed to serve the affidavits before the hearing, and thus they could not have been considered by the District Court in connection with Harmon\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Because Harmon\u2019s affidavits could not be considered in conjunction with his motion for summary judgment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Waitt argues, Harmon failed to meet his initial burden and the motion should have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">\u00b655 Clearly, Harmon\u2019s initial attempt to mail the affidavits to Waitt constituted insufficient service of process, as they were sent to the wrong address. It appears Waitt\u2019s counsel recently had changed addresses and Harmon either misplaced or was misinformed as to the correct new address. Two critical weaknesses are present in Waitt\u2019s claim, however. First, Harmon need not have filed <em>any </em>affidavits in support of his motion for summary judgment, and a failure to do so does not render the District Court\u2019s granting of the motion reversible error. M. R. Civ. P. 56(b). Second, Harmon relied on statutory protections afforded to self-proved wills such as the January Will, and the sworn statements contained within it, to support his motion and shift the burden to Waitt to demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. The burden thus shifted to Waitt without any consideration of statements in the affidavits, and the court\u2019s opinion reflects as much. The court\u2019s conclusion that Waitt failed to present any evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact was therefore based on the inadmissibility of statements in Waitt\u2019s affidavits and his failure to present evidence overcoming the protections afforded duly executed wills admitted to probate. It was not based on statements in Harmon\u2019s affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">\u00b656 While the District Court did mention some information in the affidavits that rebutted Waitt\u2019s contentions, Waitt cites no relevant authority for the proposition that the District Court\u2019s consideration of the affidavits constitutes reversible error. We are unpersuaded by Waitt\u2019s citation of <em>Ihonvbere v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins., </em>2009 Tex. App. LEXIS 3870 (Tx. Ct. App. 2009), where the court found reversible error as a result of insufficient service. <em>Ihonvbere </em>involved drastically more prejudicial circumstances than the present case, as the insufficient service rendered the defendant unaware of a motion for summary judgment and hearing on the motion at which a default judgment against him was entered. <em>Id. </em>at ** 9-13. In contrast, here Waitt knew of the existence of information contained in the affidavits, and the affidavits were not relied on by the court in finding Harmon was entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">\u00b657 The court\u2019s ruling was made irrespective of any information contained in Harmon\u2019s affidavits that Waitt supposedly would have been better prepared to rebut. We affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>\u00b658 <em>3. Whether the District Court erred in denying Waitt\u2019s Rule 56(f) motion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">\u00b659 A district court may continue a motion for summary judgment on the basis that an opposing party needs additional discovery. M. R. Civ. P. 56(f); <em>Hinderman v. Krivor, </em>2010 MT 230, \u00b6 12, 358 Mont. 111, 244 P.3d 306. Rule 56(f) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-5\">Should it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing the motion that the party cannot for reasons stated present by affidavit facts essential to justify the party\u2019s opposition, the court may refuse the application for judgment or may order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or depositions to be taken or discovery to be had or may make such other order as is just.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">\u00b660 A district court does not abuse its discretion in denying a Rule 56(f) motion if the party moving for additional discovery fails to establish how the proposed discovery will prevent summary judgment. <em>Hinderman, </em>\u00b6 16 (citing <em>Rosenthal v. Co. of Madison, </em>2007 MT 277, \u00b6 38, 339 Mont. 419, 170 P.3d 493). A court need not force a party to undergo more discovery when \u201c[t]he only reason to believe that additional, relevant evidence would materialize ... is the [plaintiffs] apparent hope of finding a proverbial \u2018smoking <em>gun.\u2019\u201dRosenthal, </em>\u00b6 42 <em>(quoting Davis v. G.N. Mortg. Corp., </em>396 F.3d 869, 885 (7th Cir. 2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"AAD\">\u00b661 We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Waitt\u2019s motion. Nothing in counsel\u2019s affidavit explained what additional facts Waitt would obtain through additional discovery that would effectively oppose the motion for summary judgment. Nor did the affidavit explain why Waitt could not present these facts, beyond the general argument that Harmon was evasive in his discovery requests. Waitt thus failed to establish how any additional discovery permitted by the court would have prevented summary judgment. <em>Hinderman, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">\u00b662 <em>4. Whether Harmon is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">\u00b663 Lastly, we consider whether Harmon is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees and costs. After the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, Harmon moved to recover his attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to \u00a7 72-12-206, MCA, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-9\">Fees and expenses-by whom paid. When the validity or probate of a will is contested through court action, the attorney fees and costs, as provided in 25-10-201, incurred in defending the validity or probate of the will must be paid by the party contesting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>the validity or probate of the will if the will in probate is confirmed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Harmon argues he is entitled to fees and costs pursuant to the statutory criteria: he defended the probate of a contested will, and the will was confirmed. Harmon\u2019s brief explains that the District Court did not rule on the motion prior to this appeal being filed. Waitt does not respond to Harmon\u2019s arguments in his reply brief, implicitly conceding that if he loses this appeal, the statute will operate as Harmon asserts. Before the District Court, Waitt filed a memorandum in opposition to Harmon\u2019s motion for fees and costs, argiiing the motion was premature pending resolution of the appeal, disputing the amount of fees and costs claimed by Harmon, and arguing that a hearing should be set at which to present evidence of reasonable fees and costs should his appeal not be successful.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">\u00b664 We agree with both parties. Waitt\u2019s appeal is now no longer pending, and Harmon has defended a contested will that was later confirmed, entitling him to fees and costs as provided in \u00a7 72-12-206, MCA. We will leave the determination of the proper amount of fees and costs to the discretion of the District Court on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">\u00b665 We affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and denial of Waitt\u2019s post-trial motion to vacate, alter or amend, and remand the issue of attorney\u2019s fees and costs under \u00a772-12-206, MCA, for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b196-7\">JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
