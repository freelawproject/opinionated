Schindlers appeal from the District Court\u2019s orders denying their motion for summary judgment and motions in limine and granting USAA\u2019s motion that Schindlers order and pay for additional transcripts on appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">\u00b62 After securing a loan from Provident Financial (Provident), Greg bought a house located at 307 West Granite Street, Butte, Montana (\u2018House\u201d), in November 2006. Provident required Greg to insure the House, and, if he did not, Provident could force-place insurance at his expense. The initial insurance policy Greg secured was cancelled in October 2007, and Provident subsequently force-placed insurance. Greg was unable to afford the force-placed policy and sought other insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">\u00b63 On November 13, 2007, Greg, a retired Marine captain, telephoned USAA, a members-only association that provides insurance to current and former members of the United States military and their dependents. Greg\u2019s call was randomly routed to USAA customer service representative Leeann Williams (Williams). Williams asked Greg a series of questions and, based upon his answers, provided Greg with a quote for a homeowner\u2019s policy. The call was not recorded. Greg subsequently paid the required premium and received a written policy in the mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">\u00b64 The House was destroyed by fire on July 29, 2008, after a tenant left a smoldering cigarette on a couch. Greg notified USAA, and general adjuster Rick Aufrecht (Aufrecht) was assigned to adjust Schindlers\u2019 loss. During his investigation, Aufrecht determined that the policy limit of $502,000 was not sufficient to cover the cost of rebuilding the House. Aufrecht also discovered that the description of the House\u2019s structure in the policy differed significantly from the description given to USAA by Greg and upon which USAA had based its policy valuation. For example, the policy described the House as having a single kitchen and four bathrooms, when, in fact, the House <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>had six kitchens and sixbathrooms. Although these discrepancies were apparent to Aufrecht, he proceeded with his investigation and submitted Schindlers\u2019 claim for payment approval. While the investigation was pending, USAA advanced $104,000 to Provident to discharge Schindlers\u2019 mortgage and paid Greg $15,000 to help with his losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">\u00b65 In December 2008, after concluding its claim investigation, including examining Greg under oath, USAA denied coverage on the basis that Greg had committed fraud during his application conversation with Williams. Specifically, USAA determined that Greg had misrepresented that the House was his primary residence and was a single family dwelling with one kitchen and four bathrooms, when, in fact, it was not his primary residence and had been divided into eight apartment units, which were inhabited by approximately ten tenants at the time of the fire. Greg testified under oath that he had told Williams the House had been divided into apartments; it contained six kitchens and six bathrooms; tenants were living at the House; and, that Greg intended to remodel the House to restore it to a single family residence. USAA asserted that had Greg divulged this information in his application conversation with Williams, as he claimed, he would not have met underwriting criteria, and the policy would not have been issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">\u00b66 Schindlers filed suit against USAA in December 2008, asserting USAA breached the insurance contract and the implied obligation of good faith and fair dealing. Schindlers subsequently amended their complaint to include equitable estoppel. USAA defended on the basis that Greg committed fraud in the application process and sought reimbursement of the money it had advanced to Schindlers.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">\u00b67 Before trial, Schindlers moved for summary judgment on their equitable estoppel claim, arguing that because USAA violated \u00a733-1-501, MCA, by not filing its application form with the Montana Insurance Commissioner (Commissioner), USAA should be estopped from defending with the application information. The District Court denied Schindlers\u2019 motion. USAA subsequently disclosed a physical copy of the computer entries made during the application conversation, which contained the prompts and/or questions that Williams had asked Greg and his answers (\u201cscreen shots\u201d). Schindlers moved in limine to exclude any evidence of the screen shots. The District Court excluded the physical copy of the screen shots from evidence, but permitted Williams to testify about Greg\u2019s answers during the application conversation. Schindlers filed another motion in limine to preclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>USAA from introducing any evidence of fraud on the basis that USAA could not produce an application in support of its fraud defense. The District Court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\">\u00b68 The case was tried before a jury in June 2010. Greg testified that he bought the House with the intention of residing there with his family after he remodeled the apartments. Greg admitted that he told Williams the House was his primary residence, although he had not slept there since approximately June 2007; he had been residing in a rental home since September 2007; and, six weeks after he spoke with Williams, he placed the House on the market, advertising it as having been converted to apartments. Greg testified he told Williams the House contained six kitchens and six bathrooms. Greg\u2019s explanation for the discrepancies between the description of the House as contained in the USAApolicy/as recollected by Williams and the actual structure of the House was that Williams had somehow changed his answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">\u00b69 Williams testified that she remembered Greg because his profile contained a warning note indicating that he was in the business \u201cflipping\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> homes, and a previous homeowner\u2019s insurance application of his had been declined in April 2006. Due to the warning note and Greg\u2019s request for a home insurance quote, Williams asked Greg additional questions, including whether he was going to be living in the House. Greg told her he intended to live there for three to five years. Williams relayed this information to underwriting and received permission to proceed with a quote.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">\u00b610 Williams, based on prompts generated by USAA\u2019s electronic application system, continued to ask Greg a series of questions and entered each of his answers into USAA\u2019s computerized system. Williams testified that Greg told her the House was a single family dwelling (as opposed to an apartment); that it was his year-round primary residence; and that he did not have boarders. Greg told her the House had one kitchen and four bathrooms. Williams testified that had Greg told her the House had six bathrooms and six kitchens, it \u201cwould have put a red flag up to [her]\u201d because six kitchens was not typical for a single family home. More questions would have been asked, and, had Williams discovered the House had been broken up into apartments, the application would have been declined because it was not a single family dwelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>\u00b611 Based on Greg\u2019s answers, USAA\u2019s computerized system calculated the cost of rebuilding the House at approximately $502,000. Greg accepted that liability amount and was quoted an annual premium of $1,836.40. Williams testified that she never changed the information Greg had given her.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">\u00b612 The jury unanimously found that USAA did not breach the insurance contract or the obligation of good faith and fair dealing and that Greg had committed fraud in the application process and awarded USAA the monies it had advanced to Schindlers. Schindlers appealed following the entry of judgment and ordered transcripts from oral arguments on their motion for summary judgment and motion in limine and the District Court\u2019s oral ruling on their motion in limine to preclude evidence of fraud. USAA moved the District Court to require Schindlers to order and pay for additional transcripts on appeal, including opening and closing statements, all evidentiary rulings and motions made during trial, jury polling, and testimony of all the witnesses. The District Court granted USAA\u2019s motion, and, as a result, Schindlers paid $2,382.75 for the additional transcripts.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">\u00b613 Schindlers raise several issues on appeal, which we have restated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">\u00b614 Issue One: Did the District Court err in denying Schindlers\u2019 motion for summary judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">\u00b615 Issue Two: Did the District Court abuse its discretion in excluding the physical copy of the screen shots, but in allowing Williams to testify about the statements Greg made to her?</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">\u00b616 Issue Three: Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Schindlers\u2019 motion in limine to preclude USAA from introducing evidence of Greg\u2019s fraud?</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">\u00b6 17 Issue Four: Did the District Court abuse its discretion in requiring Schindlers to order and pay for additional transcripts?</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">\u00b618 We review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard as the district court pursuant to Montana Rule of Civil Procedure 56. <em>Williams v. Union Fid. Life Ins. </em>Co., 2005 MT 273, \u00b6 18, 329 Mont. 158, 123 P.3d 213. The party moving for summary judgment must establish that no genuine issues of material fact exist and that the party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Once this burden is met, the party opposing summary judgment must present material and substantial evidence that raises a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>\u00b619 A district court\u2019s ruling on a motion in limine is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Jacobsen v. Allstate Ins. </em>Co., 2009 MT 248, \u00b6 50, 351 Mont. 464, 215 P.3d 649. An abuse of discretion occurs where the district court acted \u201carbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceed[ed] the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-3\">\u00b620 We review a district court\u2019s order requiring additional transcripts pursuant to M. R. App. P. 8(3)(b) for an abuse of discretion, and we retain plenary power to determine whether the transcripts actually ordered on appeal provide a sufficient basis for ruling on the issues raised. <em>Heidt v. Argani, </em>2009 MT 267, \u00b6 11, 352 Mont. 86, 214 P.3d 1255.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">\u00b621 <em>Issue One: Did the District Court err in denying Schindlers\u2019 motion for summary judgment?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">\u00b622 Schindlers filed a motion for summary judgment on their equitable estoppel claim, arguing USAA should be estopped from claiming Greg misrepresented material facts during the oral application process because USAA, in violation of \u00a733-1-501, MCA, used an application form that had not been approved by the Commissioner. The District Court declined to invoke the doctrine of equitable estoppel as a matter of law or fact, concluding (1) that USAA\u2019s oral application process did not have to be approved by the Commissioner and, further, (2) that summary judgment was not appropriate because issues of material fact existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">\u00b623  We conclude the District Court appropriately denied Schindlers\u2019 motion for summary judgment on their equitable estoppel claim on the basis that issues of material fact existed, which precluded summary judgment. Accordingly, we need not address the District Court\u2019s determinations regarding Schindlers\u2019 \u00a7 33-1-501, MCA, arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">\u00b624 Equitable estoppel, although generally not favored, is a doctrine based upon principles of equity and good faith and serves to prevent a party from suffering gross injustice at the hands of another party who created the situation or condition. <em>Avanta Fed. Credit Union v. Shupak, </em>2009 MT 458, \u00b6 41, 354 Mont. 372, 223 P.3d 863. A court sitting in equity is empowered to fashion just results. <em>KauffmanHarmon v. Kauffman, </em>2001 MT 238, \u00b6 11, 307 Mont. 45, 36 P.3d 408. This Court has consistently recognized that \u201cone who seeks equity must do equity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 13. A party may not expect equitable relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>unless he or she comes into court with clean hands. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">\u00b625 Here, issues of material fact existed regarding whether Greg possessed \u201cclean hands\u201d when applying for the policy, as evinced in the documents USAA attached to its brief in opposition to summary judgment: (1) Greg\u2019s statement taken under oath and (2) Schindlers\u2019 insurance policy. While Greg stated under oath that he described the House as a six kitchen and six bathroom single family dwelling that had been converted to apartments, the insurance policy indicates Greg represented otherwise. Furthermore, Greg, for whatever reason, failed to notify USAA of the alleged errors in the policy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because genuine issues of material fact existed regarding whether Greg applied for the policy in good faith, Schindlers were not entitled to estop USAA from defending itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">\u00b626 <em>Issue Two: Did the District Court abuse its discretion in excluding the physical copy of the screen shots, but in allowing Williams to testify about the statements Greg made to her?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">\u00b627 Schindlers filed a motion in limine to prevent USAA from presenting any evidence of the screen shots because (1) USAA failed to disclose a copy of the screen shots to Greg within thirty days of his request, pursuant to \u00a733-15-402(3), MCA, and (2) USAA failed to have the screen shots approved by the Commissioner, pursuant to \u00a733-1-501, MCA. The District Court excluded the physical copy of the screen shots from evidence on the basis that USAA did not comply with \u00a733-15-402(3), MCA. However, the District Court permitted Williams to testify \u201cas to her ... recollection of [Greg\u2019s] statements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">\u00b628 On appeal, Schindlers assert the District Court erred in not excluding all evidence of the screen shots, written or oral, pursuant to \u00a7 33-1-501, MCA. Because the physical copy of the screen shots was excluded, we only address whether the District Court erred in permitting Williams to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">\u00b629 A district court retains broad discretion in determining whether evidence is relevant and admissible, and we will not overturn its evidentiary determinations absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Rice v. C.I. </em>Canning, 2004 MT 237, \u00b6 23, 322 Mont. 487, 97 P.3d 580. All relevant evidence is admissible, subject to other rules of evidence, including hearsay. M. R. Evid. 402, 802; <em>State v. Brasda, </em>2003 MT 374, \u00b6 20, 319 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Mont. 146, 82 P.3d 922. Out of court statements that are admissions of a party opponent are admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule. M. R. Evid. 801(d)(2); <em>Heltborg v. Modern </em>Mach., 244 Mont. 24, 39, 795 P.2d 954, 963 (1990). Applicable here, Montana Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2) provides, in relevant part, that a statement is not hearsay if Tt]he statement is offered against a party and is (A) the party\u2019s own statement, in either an individual or representative capacity, or (B) a statement of which the party has manifested an adoption or belief in its truth ....\u2019\u2019Greg\u2019s statements to Williams meet both subsections (A) and (B) of Rule 801(d)(2), as he made the statements to Williams over the telephone and subsequently received the written policy containing such statements and failed to notify USAA of any errors contained in the policy. The District Court appropriately permitted Williams to testify as to her recollection of Greg\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-3\">\u00b630 <em>Issue Three: Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Schindlers\u2019 motion in limine to preclude USAA from introducing evidence of Greg\u2019s fraud?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">\u00b631 Schindlers moved in limine that USAA be prevented from defending itself pursuant to \u00a7 33-15-403, MCA, which precludes an insured\u2019s recovery if he or she committed fraud in the application process, because (1) the District Court had concluded the screen shots did not constitute an application within \u00a7 33-1-501, MCA, and (2) USAA could not produce an application due to the District Court\u2019s exclusion of the screen shots. The District Court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"AIP\">\u00b632  On appeal, Schindlers argue that the District Court erred in interpreting \u00a7 33-1-501, MCA, and, therefore, this Court should overturn the District Court\u2019s ruling. We decline to do so. Entirely depriving USAA of its \u00a7 33-15-403, MCA, fraud defense is not the appropriate remedy because Greg\u2019s statements relating to the description and character of the House provided the basis for the type of policy USAA issued. The District Court acted within its discretion in permitting USAA to defend itself via \u00a733-15-403, MCA, by allowing Williams to testify about Greg\u2019s alleged fraudulent statements. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Schindlers\u2019 motion in limine.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">\u00b633 <em>Issue Four: Did the District Court abuse its discretion in requiring Schindlers to order and pay for additional transcripts?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">\u00b634 Schindlers, as the appellants, had a duty to provide this Court with \u201c\u2018a record sufficient to enable it to rule upon the issues raised.\u2019 \u201d <em>Heidt, </em>\u00b6 19 (quoting M. R. App. P. 8(2)). Pursuant to Montana Rule of Appellate Procedure 8(3)(b), USAA, as appellee, was permitted to move <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>the District Court for an order requiring Schindlers to order additional transcripts. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">\u00b635 Our consideration of the trial transcript was necessary in order to rule upon the issues Schindlers raised. Accordingly, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in ordering additional transcripts.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">\u00b636 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b566-7\">JUSTICES NELSON, BAKER, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b561-6\"> The business of buying, fixing, and selling homes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b564-9\"> For example, the front page of the insurance policy states, \u2018IMPORTANT MESSAGES!:] Refer to your Declarations Page and endorsements to verify that ... policy details are correct and meet your insurance needs.\u201d A subsequent page, entitled \u2018Home Features,\u201d described the House as having one standard kitchen and four standard bathrooms.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
