We affirm. We address the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">\u00b62 <em>I. Did the District Court err by denying Main\u2019s motion to suppress?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">\u00b63 <em>II. Did the District Court err by denying Main\u2019s motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence at the close of the State\u2019s casein-chief?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-12\">\u00b64 <em>III. Was Main denied effective assistance of counsel?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b501-14\">\u00b65 On November 25, 2006, around 1:20 a.m., police officers were dispatched to Mellissa Snow\u2019s (Snow) residence in Havre, Montana in response to a report of a possible deceased male. At the scene, emergency personnel advised law enforcement that the victim, Lloyd or \u2018Lucky\u201d Kvelstad (\u2018Lucky\u201d or \u2018Kvelstad\u2019), was dead. Officer testimony indicated that Kvelstad\u2019s face was severely beaten and covered in blood, his pants were down around his ankles, and a ligature made from a hooded sweatshirt (hoodie) string was around his neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-15\">\u00b66 Trial testimony provided the following sequence of events. Kim Norquay, Jr. (Norquay) arrived at Snow\u2019s residence in the morning on November 24, and Main arrived \u201ctowards evening.\u201d Joseph Red Elk (Red Elk) and Jason Skidmore (Skidmore) arrived around 9 or 10 p.m. When Red Elk and Skidmore arrived, Billy the Boy (Billy), Snow, Norquay, Kvelstad, and Main were all at Snow\u2019s residence \u201cdrinking and visiting.\u201d Snow testified that everyone was drunk. After a discussion about Pilgrims and Thanksgiving, Kvelstad, a non-Native <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>American, was verbally and physically assaulted. Main and Skidmore \u201cchoked out\u201d Kvelstad several times until he lost consciousness, but Kvelstad regained consciousness each time. Norquay slapped Kvelstad\u2019s face a few times, and simulated a sexual assault on Kvelstad. Red Elk overheard Main and Norquay discuss killing Kvelstad. Eventually, Kvelstad \u201cpassed out sleeping\u201d and Snow and Skidmore carried Kvelstad to the bedroom. Red Elk and Skidmore left Snow\u2019s house around 11 p.m. Red Elk testified that, when he left the house, Kvelstad was alive and not bloody.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">\u00b67 Nathan Oats (Oats), Georgetta Oats (Georgetta), and Ivy Snow (Ivy) arrived at Snow\u2019s residence a few hours later. Upon entering the living room, Oats saw Kvelstad lying on the couch. When trying to rouse Kvelstad, Oats discovered Kvelstad was unresponsive and severely beaten. Oats told Georgetta to call the police. When Georgetta announced that police were coming, Norquay fled and Main attempted to leave. Oats restrained Main from leaving, and they scuffled. Upon their arrival, Officers Jason Barkus (Barkus), Dan Waldron (Waldron), Larry Virts (Virts) and Sergeant Bill Wilkinson, Jr. (Wilkinson) noticed that Ivy, Georgetta, Oats, Billy, Snow, and Main were in the residence. Wilkinson directed that witnesses be separated and detained for questioning. The officers also located and detained Norquay, Red Elk, and Skidmore for questioning. Waldron transported Main to the police department and conversed with him until Main was interviewed by Assistant Chief of Police George Tate (Tate). Tate interviewed Main three times over the next day and a half.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">\u00b68 Main was charged with Deliberate Homicide in violation of \u00a745-5-102(l)(a), MCA(2005)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or, alternatively, Deliberate Homicide by felony murder in violation of \u00a745-5-102(1)(b), MCA. The State subsequently moved to dismiss the primary charge, leaving deliberate homicide by felony murder as the remaining charge, which the District Court granted. Norquay was also charged and convicted of deliberate homicide, felony murder, in Kvelstad\u2019s death, and of tampering with physical evidence. His convictions were affirmed by this Court. <em>State v. Norquay, </em>2011 MT 34, 359 Mont. 257, 248 P.3d 817. Snow testified that she was charged with, and pled guilty to, tampering with physical evidence for her role in cleaning up blood at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">\u00b69 Main moved to suppress statements he made to Waldron and Tate. The District Court granted the motion with respect to Main\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>statements to Waldron, but denied the motion as to the statements made to Tate.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">\u00b610 Trial by jury was conducted in February 2009. The witnesses included Snow and Norquay, who testified under grants of judicial immunity. Prior to opening statements, the parties executed a stipulation, which was read to the jury, indicating that Norquay had been \u2018found guilty of being accountable for the deliberate homicide of Lloyd Kvelstad.\u201d At the conclusion of the State\u2019s case-in-chief, Main moved for a judgment of acquittal<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on the ground of insufficient evidence, which was denied. Main was found guilty of Deliberate Homicide, felony murder, and was subsequently sentenced to the Montana State Prison for sixty years. Main appeals. Additional facts as necessary will be discussed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">\u00b611 <em>I. Did the District Court err by denying Main\u2019s motion to suppress?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">\u00b612 \u2018We review a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a motion to suppress to determine whether the court\u2019s underlying findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether the court correctly interpreted and applied the law to those findings.\u201d <em>State v. Gittens, </em>2008 MT 55, \u00b6 9, 341 Mont. 450, 178 P.3d 91 (citing <em>State v. Lewis, </em>2007 MT 295, \u00b6 17, 340 Mont. 10, 171 P.3d 731).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">\u00b613 After Waldron took Main to the police department, they had what the District Court described as a \u201cconversation\u201d lasting about eighty minutes while waiting for Tate to speak with Main. At around 3:00 or 4:00 a.m., Tate interviewed Main after obtaining Main\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>waiver. Main denied having any involvement in Kvelstad\u2019s death. Later that day, Tate conducted a second interview with Main after Main again waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Main continued to deny that he fought with Kvelstad or had any involvement with Kvelstad\u2019s death. Later in the interview, Main invoked his right to an attorney. Tate ended the interview, and arrested Main. The next afternoon, Main initiated contact with Tate. Tate again obtained Main\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>waiver and conducted a third interview. During this third interview, Main acknowledged he had fought with Kvelstad, but said that Kvelstad did not die as a result of the altercation.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>\u00b614 Main moved to suppress his statements to Tate, arguing in part, that his <em>Miranda </em>waivers were involuntary due to his intoxicated state. He also moved for suppression of his statements to Waldron, arguing that Waldron conducted a custodial interrogation without <em>Miranda </em>warnings and that Main had made an unequivocal request for an attorney. The State responded that it would not use Main\u2019s statements to Waldron at trial, but that Main\u2019s statements to Tate should not be suppressed because Main did not unequivocally request a lawyer, Waldron did not interrogate Main, and Main voluntarily waived his right to counsel during the Tate interviews. The District Court granted Main\u2019s motion to suppress statements made to Waldron because the State did not contest the motion, but denied Main\u2019s motion as to statements made to Tate.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">\u00b615 The 5th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution provide the right against self-incrimination. <em>Gittens, </em>\u00b6 12; <em>see also Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602 (1966). \u2018The <em>Miranda </em>Court held that the prosecution may not use statements that stem from a custodial interrogation of a defendant unless the defendant is warned, prior to questioning, that he has a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney.\u201d <em>State v. Olson, </em>2003 MT 61, \u00b6 13, 314 Mont. 402, 66 P.3d 297 (citing <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 444, 86 S. Ct. at 1612). Once a person has invoked the right to have counsel present during custodial interrogation, the interrogation must end. <em>State v. Scheffer, </em>2010 MT 73, \u00b6 17, 355 Mont. 523, 230 P.3d 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">\u00b616 Whether a suspect invokes a clear and unambiguous right to counsel is an objective inquiry. <em>Scheffer, </em>\u00b6 26 (citing <em>Davis v. United States, </em>512 U.S. 452, 458-59, 114 S. Ct. 2350, 2355 (1994)); <em>see also State v. Morrisey, </em>2009 MT 201, \u00b6 40, 351 Mont. 144, 214 P.3d 708. A suspect \u201cmust articulate his desire to have counsel present sufficiently clearly that a reasonable police officer in the circumstances would understand the statement to be a request for an attorney.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 459, 114 S. Ct. at 2355; <em>Scheffer, </em>\u00b6 26. Invocation of a suspect\u2019s right to counsel \u201c \u2018requires, at a minimum, some statement that can reasonably be construed to be an expression of a desire for the assistance of an attorney.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 459, 114 S. Ct. at 2355 (quoting <em>McNeil v. Wisconsin, </em>501 U.S. 171, 178, 111 S. Ct. 2204, 2209 (1991)). A request for counsel should be broadly construed and does not depend upon the use of any specific words. <em>State v. Lacey, </em>2009 MT 62, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>\u00b6 68, 349 Mont. 371, 204 P.3d 1192<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">\u00b617  If a suspect\u2019s reference to counsel is ambiguous or equivocal so that, in light of the circumstances, a reasonable officer understands only that the suspect <em>might </em>be invoking his right, questioning need not cease. <em>Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 459, 114 S. Ct. at 2355; <em>Scheffer, </em>\u00b6 26. In <em>Davis, </em>the suspect\u2019s statement that \u2018Maybe I should talk to a lawyer\u201d was not an unambiguous request for counsel. <em>Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 462, 114 S. Ct. at 2357; <em>see also Scheffer, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 29, 31-32 (suspect\u2019s statements \u2018let\u2019s get my lawyer here\u201d with other references to lawyers did not constitute an unambiguous request for counsel when viewed in light of the circumstances of the interview); <em>State v. Reavley, </em>2003 MT 298, \u00b6 33, 318 Mont. 150, 79 P.3d 270 (suspect\u2019s asking the interrogating officer if the officer thought the suspect needed an attorney was not a clear or unequivocal request for an attorney); <em>State v. Jones, </em>2006 MT 209, \u00b6 27, 333 Mont. 294, 142 P.3d 851 (suspect\u2019s statements that he was \u201cthrough talking\u201d were not an unequivocal invocation of the right to counsel). However, suspect statements that \u201cShit, I need a lawyer, man\u201d and T would like to talk to somebody\u2019 have been found sufficient to constitute requests for counsel. <em>Lacey, </em>\u00b6 68; <em>Reavley, </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">\u00b618 Main contends he unequivocally and anticipatorily requested counsel during his conversation with Waldron, and that all subsequent statements he made should have been suppressed as \u2018fruit of the poisonous tree,\u201d citing <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 488, 83 S. Ct. 407, 417 (1963). The focus of Main\u2019s argument is on the following segment of the dialogue between Waldron (\u2018DW\u201d) and Main (\u201cJM\u201d):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">JM: Yea, I do would like to go to sleep, go back to sleep or throw me in jail or whatever you do to me, do it</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALb\">DW: Well I got, why would I throw you in jail,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-7\">JM: I don\u2019t think you should myself, questioning me for, I\u2019m giving you the best answers I could</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-8\">DW: Yea well I\u2019m not questioning you yet, we\u2019re just talking,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>JM: Yea</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-4\">DW: Just B-S\u2019ing, you know before they question you they gotta read you your rights, read your Miranda,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-5\">JM: Oh, so they are gunna throw me in jail</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ8\">DW: I don\u2019t know why,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\">JM: I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s what you\u2019re talking about,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-7\">DW: I said if they do question you, to throw you in jail yea they gotta read you your rights</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-9\">JM: How long are you gunna keep me here then,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-10\">DW: Well until my assistant chief tells me I can let you go, cuz it\u2019s we got a dead guy in an apartment,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-11\">DW: No, I\u2019m just here to trying to keep you company,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-12\">JM: Yup</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-13\">DW: Everybody in that house is</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-14\">JM: Would you let me make a phone call, it\u2019s local, it has to be local</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-15\">DW: Nope, who you gunna call at 2 in the morning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-16\">JM: <em>Call my mother to call my lawyer</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-17\">DW: Call your mom, well you\u2019ll have a chance to contact your lawyer</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-19\">JM: Yup</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-20\">DW: Right now we\u2019re just sittin here, just standin by, waiting, always waiting</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-21\">(Emphasis added.) The District Court determined that Main\u2019s request to \u201ccall [his] mother to call [his] lawyer\u201d was not an unequivocal request for an attorney, citing <em>State v. Buck, </em>2006 MT 81, 331 Mont. 517, 134 P.3d 53, for its analysis of a suspect\u2019s \u201cevident purpose.\u201d <em>See Buck, </em>\u00b6 48 (\u201cwe still adhere to the rule that invocation of that right [to counsel] does not depend on the use of any particular words; rather, it depends on the evident purpose of the suspect\u2019s statement, as viewed in light of the circumstances and in light of the rule that requests for counsel must be construed broadly\u2019]). The court found that the timing of Main\u2019s request (between 2-3 a.m.) to call his mother to call his lawyer was for the evident purpose of \u201cget[ting] a hold of his mother so that, at an appropriate time of the business day, his mother can reach an attorney on his behalf.\u201d The court noted that Waldron emphasized that Main would have the opportunity to request an attorney when formally interviewed by Tate, and that Main acquiesced to this understanding by saying \u201cYup.\u201dThe court regarded as significant that Main did not invoke his <em>Miranda </em>rights during his first interview with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>Tate.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">\u00b619 Main\u2019s conversation with Waldron was a free-flowing exchange covering a variety of topics. Following his comment about calling his mother, Main immediately launched into a discussion with Waldron about international affairs. It was not reasonable for the officer to believe that Main was then requesting an attorney and that questioning should immediately cease. Main acknowledged Waldron\u2019s explanation that Main would be given his <em>Miranda </em>advisory when Tate became available and that he could then exercise his right to contact his lawyer. Tate so advised Main, but Main did not request a lawyer. We affirm the District Court\u2019s determination that Main did not clearly or unequivocally request a lawyer. <em>See United States v. Ervin, </em>2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26391 at *41 (W.D. N.C. Mar. 23, 2006) (suspect\u2019s statement that he had earlier asked another officer \u201cto call my dad or lawyers\u201d was found to be an insufficient request).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A2P\">\u00b620 Main then argues that his intoxication and the officers\u2019 failure to give him a breathalyzer test invalidated his waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights. He notes that intoxication has been considered by other jurisdictions in determining whether to invalidate a <em>Miranda </em>waiver. <em>See e.g. United States v. Korn, </em>138 F.3d 1239, 1240 (8th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">\u00b621 A suspect may waive his 5th Amendment rights if such a waiver is made voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently. <em>Gittens, </em>\u00b6 14; <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 444, 86 S. Ct. at 1612. The United States Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">The inquiry has two distinct dimensions. <em>Edwards v. Arizona, supra, </em>at 482; <em>Brewer v. Williams, </em>430 U.S. 387, 404 (1977). First, the relinquishment of the right must have been voluntary in the sense that it was the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion, or deception. Second, the waiver must have been made with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it. Only if the \u201ctotality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation\u201d reveals both an uncoerced choice and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>requisite level of comprehension may a court properly conclude that the <em>Miranda </em>rights have been waived. <em>Fare v. Michael C., </em>442 U.S. 707, 725 [99 S. Ct. 2560, 2572] (1979). See also <em>North Carolina v. Butler, </em>441 U.S. 369, 374-375 [99 S. Ct. 1755, 1758] (1979).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-4\"><em>Moran v. Burbine, </em>475 U.S. 412, 421, 106 S. Ct. 1135, 1141 (1986); <em>see also Berghuis v. </em>Thompkins, _ U.S ._, 130 S. Ct. 2250, 2260 (2010). We have likewise stated that \u201ca valid waiver must include not merely a comprehension of the benefits being abandoned, but also an actual relinquishment of those benefits, as evidenced by the actions or statements of the accused.\u201d <em>State v. Blakney, </em>197 Mont. 131, 138, 641 P.2d 1045, 1049-50 (1982). The \u201cexistence of a valid waiver \u2018must depend, in each case, upon the particular facts and circumstances surrounding that case, including the background, experience, and conduct of the accused.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019Blakney, </em>197 Mont. at 138, 641 P.2d at 1049 (citation omitted). Other valid considerations include \u201cthe age, education, and intelligence of the accused, and his capacity to understand the warnings given him, the nature of his Fifth Amendment rights, and the consequences of waiving those rights.\u201d <em>Blakney, </em>197 Mont. at 138, 641 P.2d at 1049 (citing <em>e.g. Fare, </em>442 U.S. at 725, 99 S. Ct. at 2572; <em>Butler, </em>441 U.S. at 373, 99 S. Ct. at 1758). We have considered a defendant\u2019s responses to questions while supposedly intoxicated as one factor to consider in the totality of the circumstances as to whether a waiver was made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. <em>State v. Cassell, </em>280 Mont. 397, 403, 932 P.2d 478, 481-82 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">\u00b622 In <em>State v. Gleed, </em>220 Mont. 56, 59, 713 P.2d 543, 544-45 (1986), we affirmed a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress as to waiver when the defendant was 21 years old, familiar with the criminal justice system due to prior felony convictions, had earned his GED, was of \u201cat least\u201d average intelligence, gave no indication to being under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and stated he understood the <em>Miranda </em>advisory. Similarly, we affirmed a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress and determined that a waiver was made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily despite the defendant\u2019s claim to be intoxicated. <em>Cassell, </em>280 Mont. at 403, 932 P.2d at 481-82. Cassell was 43 years old, had a lengthy criminal record and was familiar with the criminal justice system and police interrogation methods, and appropriately responded to police questions, thereby refuting his intoxication claim. <em>Cassell, </em>280 Mont. at 403, 932 P.2d at 481-82. In <em>Gittens, </em>we determined the district court did not err in concluding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>State met its burden in proving the defendant voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Gittens, \u00b6 29. Although there was no audio recording of the <em>Miranda </em>advisory or of the defendant\u2019s waiver, a deputy testified that he read the <em>Miranda </em>advisory from a pre-printed card, and the defendant responded that he understood those rights, voluntarily followed the deputy out to the patrol car, did not indicate he did not want to talk, and did not avail himself of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>Gittens, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 23-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">\u00b623 Here, the District Court found that Main was 46 years old, had graduate school experience, was well-traveled, was articulate, and \u201cshowed an ability to make full use of his faculties,\u201d as he discussed world politics, racism, the OJ Simpson trial, and raising children in today\u2019s world. The Court found that Main had familiarity with the legal system, previous experience with police, attorneys in Los Angeles and Connecticut, had once contacted an attorney on behalf of his nephew for assistance with criminal charges, and demonstrated a clear understanding that he was not obligated to say anything to police until he spoke to an attorney. In determining Main gave a voluntary and knowing waiver of his rights, the District Court found that a <em>Miranda </em>rights advisory was given by Tate; that, according to Main, six hours had passed since he last drank alcohol; that Main showed engagement, intelligence, clear thought and speech; and that Main orally, and in writing, waived his right to counsel and voluntarily carried on a conversation with Tate. We note that Tate testified during the suppression hearing that, while Main smelled of alcohol and occasionally slurred his words, \u201c[h]e wasn\u2019t stumbling. He answered questions in an articulate manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">\u00b624  Main argues that other jurisdictions \u2018have held that alcohol intoxication may invalidate a Miranda waiver,\u201d but the cases he cites analyze intoxication as we do: as one factor in the totality of the circumstances. <em>See e.g. Korn, </em>138 F.3d at 1240. We conclude that the District Court\u2019s findings of fact were not clearly erroneous, and its conclusions of law were correct. It is clear that Main\u2019s waiver \u201cwas the product of a free and deliberate choice\u201d and that it was \u201cmade with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it\u201d so as to be voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently given. <em>Moran, </em>475 U.S. at 421, 106 S.

A motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence \u2018is appropriate in a criminal trial if, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, \u2018no evidence exists upon which a rational trier of fact could find the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019\u201d <em>City of Billings v. Albert, </em>2009 MT 63, \u00b6 13, 349 Mont. 400, 203 P.3d 828 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">\u00b627 Main was charged with deliberate homicide under \u00a7 45-5-102(1)(b), MCA, which codifies the \u201cfelony murder rule.\u201d <em>State v. Kills on Top, </em>241 Mont. 378, 386, 787 P.2d 336, 341 (1990). That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">(1) A person commits the offense of deliberate homicide if ... (b) the person attempts to commit, commits, or is legally accountable for the attempt or commission of ... aggravated assault, or any other forcible felony and in the course of the forcible felony or flight thereafter, the person or any person legally accountable for the crime causes the death of another human being.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Section 45-5-102(1)(b), MCA. \u201c[T]he purpose of the felony-murder rule is to ensure that people who engage in dangerous acts likely to result in death are held responsible for any resulting deaths, whether or not the acts were planned or premeditated. The felony-murder rule creates an alternate means of holding one responsible for reckless actions likely to result in death.\u201d <em>State v. Burkhart, </em>2004 MT 372, \u00b6 36, 325 Mont. 27, 103 P.3d 1037 (internal citation omitted). Under the felony murder rule, the prosecution does not need to prove the \"purposely or knowingly\u2019 element of the crime of deliberate homicide.\u201d <em>Kills on Top, </em>241 Mont. at 387, 787 P.2d at 341 (citations omitted). Instead, the defendant\u2019s intent to commit the underlying felony supplies the intent for all subsequent consequences, including homicide. <em>State v. Nichols, </em>225 Mont. 438, 449, 734 P.2d 170, 176 (1987).

The underlying forcible felony charged against Main was aggravated assault. A person commits aggravated assault, \u201cif the person purposely or knowingly causes serious bodily injury to another.\u201d Section 45-5-202(1), MCA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u2018Serious bodily injury\u201d is defined as \u201cbodily injury that: (i) creates a substantial risk of death; (ii) causes serious permanent disfigurement or protracted loss or impairment of the function or process of a bodily member or organ; or (iii) at the time of injury, can reasonably be expected to result in serious permanent disfigurement or protracted loss or impairment of the function or process of a bodily member or organ.\u201d Section 45-2-101(66)(a), MCA. To establish Main was \u2018legally accountable\u201d for aggravated assault under the felony murder statute, the State was required to prove that \u201ceither before or during the commission of an offense with the purpose to promote or facilitate such commission, he solicits, aids, abets, agrees, or attempts to aid such other person in the planning or commission of the offense.\u201d Section 45-2-302(3), MCA. We thus review the evidence which the State introduced to prove these elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">\u00b629 Main\u2019s third interview with Tate was admitted as evidence. In that interview, Main admitted that he had fought with Kvelstad, although he \u201cdid not kill him.\u201dMain said this altercation \u201cstarted as a little pushing argument\u201d between him and Kvelstad and then escalated into a \u2018Tb]ar room brawl.\u201dMain said that \u201ceverything was ok after the scuffle\u201d but admitted that there were \u201ca few little knots and bruises\u201d and blood on Kvelstad. Waldron testified that, on the night of the incident, Main \u2018had blood on his sweatshirt, he had blood on the cuffs of his pants, he had some blood on his hands, and he had blood on his forehead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">\u00b630 Oats testified that when he entered Snow\u2019s residence, Kvelstad\u2019s face was \u201cpretty pummeled, not really distinguishable facial features.\u201d Observing a picture of Kvelstad\u2019s face taken after his death, Barkus testified that he couldn\u2019t recognize Kvelstad in the picture and that police at the scene had to identify him by his tattoos. Waldron testified that Kvelstad\u2019s body \u201cwas just beaten severely. His head was large, swollen, black and blue marks, swollen to the point-er puffy to the point that it was obscuring some of his facial features.\u201d Sheriff and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Coroner Greg Szudera testified that \u201cthe body around the face and the eyes and the nose was severely beaten\u201d which he believed was caused by some form of blunt force trauma. Both Szudera and Waldron testified Kvelstad\u2019s facial injuries looked \u201clife threatening,\u201d though Szudera acknowledged that it was possible to sustain \u201cvery gruesome appearing blunt force injuries ... from which a person can totally recover.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">\u00b631 In his testimony, Red Elk recalled that \u2018Lucky [Kvelstad] was talking, and then Main gets all mean and angry and starts cussing at Lucky because he was speaking Native, I assumed. He got offended by that. And then I was at-after that occurred he still kept picking on him. And he just kept going on and on talking about the AIM [American Indian] Movement and the Pilgrims, Thanksgiving.\u201d Red Elk continued: \u2018Every time Lucky would say he was sorry, or describe that he means no offense then Main comes back up with some other argument toward him, like more aggressively and saying, no, or cursing at him.\u201d Red Elk stated that \u2018ta]fter [Main] verbally assaulted [Kvelstad], after Lucky was going to get up and walk around, Main choked him out... and that was mainly what he did, twice.\u201d Red Elk indicated that Main \u2018had his arm around [Kvelstad\u2019s] neck and he squeezed tightly and had his other arm around his head.\u201d Due to this choke-hold, Kvelstad \u201ccompletely passed out it would seem. He didn\u2019t move at all.\u201d After Kvelstad regained consciousness, Red Elk testified that \u201c[h]e was shocked. He was shaking. He was-I think, he was just scared at the time and confused.\u201d Red Elk testified that Skidmore \u201cchoked him out\u201d the second time. Kvelstad passed out and then \u201cwas more confused and really dazed\u201d and \u201cstumbling as he was trying to get up.\u201d Then, a \u201ccouple seconds after Lucky came through ... Main came and choked him again.\u201d Red Elk said, \u2018it was really fast. He had just-his eyes were closing and he looked like he was going to kill him right there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">\u00b632 Red Elk acknowledged that Kvelstad \u201crecovered\u201d after he had been choked, but that while Kvelstad was passed out, \u2018Main came up with the idea of trying to kill Lucky, as it would seem. I had no idea why he would be saying it. But he came up with the idea of killing him. And then Norquay came butting in and they were just thinking about how they would do this and why they would kill him.\u201d Red Elk reported that Main had told Kvelstad <em>\u201cl </em>could break you in half\u2019 or \u2018I could kill you,\u201d or words to that effect, although Red Elk initially thought those comments were \u201ctypical of drunk talk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">\u00b633 Snow testified that Main put a \u201csleep hold\u201d on Kvelstad twice and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>that Kvelstad lost consciousness when choked. Snow testified that Kvelstad made \u201cgurgling\u201d noises when being choked. Snow testified that Main came from the living room and told her that Kvelstad \u201cwas dead.\u201d Snow testified that, at that point, Main asked her to tell law enforcement that they \u201cwere in the back room making love,\u201d which was not true.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">\u00b634 About the involvement of Norquay, Red Elk acknowledged that Norquay \u201cstart[ed] up with Lucky\u201dafter Main\u2019s verbal assault. Red Elk noted that Norquay \u201cwas sort of like backing Main mostly ....\u2019\u2019Red Elk testified that, after Kvelstad had regained consciousness from a choking, Norquay was \u201cshadow boxing [Kvelstad], slapping him, laughing at him. I think he was cursing at him,\u201d although Norquay did not hit Kvelstad in a manner that would make him bleed. Red Elk testified that Norquay exhibited a desire to sexually assault Kvelstad in that Norquay \u201cpulled down his pants, he unbuckled his belt and he was trying to pull down Lucky\u2019s pants.\u201d According to Red Elk, \u201cI thought [Norquay] was going to rape him right there.\u201d Snow added that Norquay was making \u2018humping motions\u201d on Kvelstad. Snow also testified that Norquay pulled the string from his sweatshirt and placed it on the table. Oats testified that when he arrived at Snow\u2019s residence, Norquay told him that there was nothing wrong with Kvelstad and to \u201c[l]eave him alone. He\u2019s all right,\u201d when actually Kvelstad was then dead or near dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">\u00b635 Norquay reported to Tate shortly after the crime that \u2018he had witnessed James Main beat Lloyd Kvelstad up.\u201d Norquay told Tate that \u2018[Main] had choked [Kvelstad] and that he had kicked him and he was hitting him, as well.\u201dNorquay also told Tate that he believed Main had used his hoodie string to choke Kvelstad.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">\u00b636 Medical Examiner and forensic pathologist Walter Kemp performed Kvelstad\u2019s autopsy. He testified to the ligature around Kvelstad\u2019s neck, bruising to Kvelstad\u2019s ear, eyelids, tongue and back, abrasions to the cheek, chin, nose and left elbow, and lacerations of the forehead, lips, and right forearm. He testified about \u201cpetechia[e]\u201d or \u201cpinpoint hemorrhages\u201d in Kvelstad\u2019s right eye, noting that petechiae hemorrhages are often associated with strangulation and blunt force injuries. Kemp agreed that a choke-hold could cause petechiae. Kemp also testified that Kvelstad sustained internal head bleeding and a fractured rib. Kemp indicated that Kvelstad sustained blunt force injuries consistent with being hit by a fist or being kicked.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">\u00b637 Kemp testified that not all of Kvelstad\u2019s injuries were life-threatening and that the specific mechanism of his death was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>uncertain. Although Kvelstad had \u201cvery impressive injuries of the face,\u201d Kemp did not believe they alone would cause his death and that Kvelstad should have been able to fully recover from these injuries. Likewise, Kemp did not believe Kvelstad\u2019s hemorrhage around the brain or rib fracture would have caused his death. Kemp agreed that \u2018being choked\u201d could \u201ccreate a risk, a medical anatomical risk\u201d due to oxygen deprivation to the brain. If the choke-hold was \u2018hot maintained, blood starts flowing to the brain again, [and] the person would be fine.\u201d However, a choke-hold could result in death \u2018[i]f the blood is pinched off from the brain long enough for the cells to start dying.\u201d Kvelstad\u2019s blood alcohol content was .24, which Kemp described as \u2018high.\u201d Kemp testified that \u2018hon-lethal head injuries, combined with a high alcohol level, can cause somebody\u2019s death,\u201d and that \u2018it\u2019s definitely one possibility that his head injuries and the alcohol caused his death,\u201d although he could not conclude, to a medical certainty, that Kvelstad died in this way.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">\u00b638 Regarding the ligature, Kemp testified that the lack of significant abrasions and bruising to Kvelstad\u2019s neck could indicate the ligature was placed on Kvelstad\u2019s neck after he was already dead or incapacitated, but that he couldn\u2019t \u201csay for sure that [Kvelstad] was not alive at the time the ligature was placed.\u201d If Kvelstad had been alive at the time the ligature was placed around his neck, Kemp said, \u201cthat would have caused his death.\u201d Kemp indicated there could be several possibilities as to the mechanism of death, including that Kvelstad had been manually strangled. He listed Kvelstad\u2019s cause of death as \u201c[hjomicidal violence, including blunt force injuries of the head and probable ligature strangulation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">\u00b639 Blood and other DNA evidence was collected from Snow\u2019s residence, and the suspects\u2019 and witnesses\u2019 clothing. Blood was found in the living room, bathroom, and kitchen and living room ceilings. The blood found on the ceilings matched<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Kvelstad\u2019s DNA. DNA from the bathroom shower door matched that of Kvelstad, and a partial DNA profile from the toilet bowl was consistent with Kvelstad\u2019s DNA. DNA found on the bath tub matched Main. There were 73 blood stains found on Main\u2019s right boot. In particular, the tongue of Main\u2019s boot had \u201ca very large thick stain\u201d which was \u2018hot a stain that you would have just picked up walking around, or having walked through blood that was possibly on the floor,\u201d according to a crime lab serologist. The major <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>DNA profile from this stain matched that of Kvelstad. Main\u2019s overalls had 150 blood stains, and DNA testing was conducted on five stains: three matched Kvelstad\u2019s DNA and two matched Main\u2019s DNA. Two of the DNA tests performed on the blood from Main\u2019s hands matched that of Main. Norquay\u2019s jeans had 104 blood stains, and two were tested: one matched Main\u2019s DNA, and the major DNA profile from the other stain likewise matched Main. Norquay\u2019s sweatshirt had 21 blood stains, two which were tested: the major DNA profile from the stain on the hood matched Main, and the stain on the right sleeve indicated a major DNA profile matching Kvelstad. Norquay\u2019s shoe had 37 blood stains, one of which was tested and was consistent with Kvelstad\u2019s DNA. Norquay\u2019s jacket had 143 blood stains. Of the seven stains tested for DNA, five matched Main. A forensic scientist specializing in impression evidence analyzed the footprint impressions found on Kvelstad\u2019s sweatshirt, and found one which was consistent with the tread on Norquay\u2019s shoe.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">\u00b640 Main argues that the State\u2019s evidence did not establish that he committed the underlying felony, aggravated assault, on Kvelstad. He points to Kemp\u2019s testimony<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to argue that Main\u2019s earlier assaults did not inflict serious injuries and did not cause Kvelstad\u2019s death, citing the holding in <em>State v. Weinberger, </em>206 Mont. 110, 671 P.2d 567 (1983), where we determined that because the underlying felony had not been proven, the felony murder conviction also failed. The State responds that lethality is not a requirement for serious bodily injury and that there was sufficient evidence to permit the case to be decided by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">\u00b641 The State\u2019s evidence showed that Main was in a verbal and physical altercation with Kvelstad. Main was seen \u201cchoking out\u201d Kvelstad twice to the point of unconsciousness and causing concern that Kvelstad was going to be killed. Main told Kvelstad that T could break you in half\u2019 or words to that effect, further evidence from which a jury could infer an intention by Main to assault Kvelstad. Kvelstad suffered a severe enough beating for Coroner Szudera and Waldron to opine that the injuries were life-threatening, for his blood to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>deposited on the ceilings, floors and walls of various rooms of the residence, and to make him unrecognizable to law enforcement. The jury could infer that Main and Norquay were both involved in this beating since Kvelstad\u2019s DNA was found on both of their clothing and Main\u2019s DNA was found on Norquay\u2019s clothing. We conclude the jury could have inferred that Main inflicted or was accountable for a serious physical attack upon Kvelstad, sufficient to \u201ccreate[] a substantial risk of death\u201d or injuries which \u201cat the time of injury, can reasonably be expected to result in serious permanent disfigurement or protracted loss or impairment ....\u2019\u2019Section 45-2-101(66)(a)(i),(iii), MCA. The jury was instructed on the lesser-included offense of assault and could have found Main guilty of this lesser charge, but determined that the evidence presented was sufficient to establish Main\u2019s participation in an aggravated assault upon Kvelstad.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">\u00b642 Main also argues that even if the elements of aggravated assault were satisfied, the State failed to prove the necessary causation between the aggravated assault and Kvelstad\u2019s death. Generally, Tcjonduct is the cause of a result if: (a) without the conduct the result would not have occurred ....\u2019\u2019Section 45-2-201(1)(a), MCA. For purposes of the felony murder statute, we have explained the causal connection required \u201c \u2018is that the death actually occurred during the underlying felony or the flight thereafter.\u2019 \u201d <em>Burkhart, </em>\u00b6 36 (quoting <em>State v. Cox, </em>266 Mont. 110, 119, 879 P.2d 662, 668 (1994)). We have further explained that \u201c \u2018[i]t is necessary ... to show that the conduct causing death was done in furtherance of the design to commit the felony. Death must be a consequence of the felony ... and not merely coincidence.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019Weinberger, </em>206 Mont. at 115, 671 P.2d at 569 (quoting <em>Commonwealth v.

McKinnon, </em>171 Mont. 120, 127, 556 P.2d 906, 910 (1976) (citation omitted) (\u201c \u2018Something more than a mere coincidence of time and place between the wrongful act and the death is necessary.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">\u00b643 The jury received evidence about Main\u2019s assaultive behaviors toward Kvelstad and his admission of having a \u201c[b]ar room brawl\u201d with Kvelstad. The evidence included Main telling Kvelstad \u20181 could break you in half\u2019 and \u20181 could kill you,\u201d or words to that effect, and initiating a conversation with Norquay about killing Kvelstad. There was evidence of Kvelstad\u2019s physical injuries and blood and DNA evidence of Kvelstad\u2019s blood on Main, as outlined above. This evidence permitted the jury to infer that Main committed or was accountable for an attack involving blunt force trauma on Kvelstad. The jury heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>Kemp\u2019s testimony<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that Kvelstad could have died from a combination of blunt force trauma and high alcohol intoxication, or strangulation. Main told Snow that Kvelstad was dead and asked her to lie about Main\u2019s activities at the time of death. This evidence was sufficient to permit a jury to infer that Main inflicted or was accountable for blunt force trauma upon Kvelstad that was causally connected to his death; stated another way, to infer that the conduct causing death was done in furtherance of the aggravated assault which Main committed or was accountable for. Main emphasizes that there was \u201cno credible evidence linking\u201dhim to the ligature but, as in <em>Cox, </em>Tpjroof that [Main] actually committed the physical act that resulted in the death of [the victim] is not required.\u201d <em>Cox, </em>266 Mont. at 119, 879 P.2d at 668. \u201cAll conspirators in a plot to commit a crime are equally guilty of deliberate homicide if during the course of the commission of the crime a death results which is directly attributable to the plot to commit the crime.\u201d <em>Weinberger, </em>206 Mont. at 114, 671 P.2d at 569.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">\u00b644  We view the evidence \u2018in a light most favorable to the prosecution to determine if any trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6 23. This approach \u201crequires that we view the evidence and all inferences to be drawn therefrom in the strongest light possible which supports establishment of the State\u2019s cas <em>e.\u201d LaMere, </em>\u00b6 20. We conclude the evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to find the elements of the crime had been committed beyond a reasonable doubt. The District Court did not err in denying Main\u2019s motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">\u00b645 <em>III. Was Main denied effective assistance of counsel?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">\u00b646 Main argues that we should review three errors committed by trial counsel, Kenneth Olson (Olson).

We review claims of ineffective assistance of counsel under the two-prong test articulated in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). <em>Sartain, </em>\u00b6 29. A defendant must prove that (1) counsel\u2019s performance was deficient or fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and (2) counsel\u2019s performance prejudiced the defense by demonstrating that there was a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>State v.

While the failure to raise an objection is generally record-based, we have also said that \u201cdecisions regarding the timing and number of objections lie within counsel\u2019s tactical discretion and, thus, should not be considered on direct appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Earl, </em>2003 MT 158, \u00b6 41, 316 Mont. 263, 71 P.3d 1201 (citing <em>White, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15-16). Main contests the timing of his counsel\u2019s objection, and we decline to address the issue on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">\u00b650 Main next argues that Olson failed to make an offer of proof regarding possible \u201cgang evidence,\u201d which resulted in a waiver of the issue on appeal. In <em>State v. Olsen, </em>a defendant alleged her counsel was ineffective for failing to make an offer of proof regarding an expert witness. <em>State v. Olsen, </em>2004 MT 158, \u00b6 17, 322 Mont. 1, 92 P.3d 1204. We noted \u201cwhile attorneys will state on the record their reasons for ... making an offer of proof during trial, they do not state their reasons for not doing so.\u201d <em>Olsen, </em>\u00b6 17. Because the record in <em>Olsen </em>was silent, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>held that defendant\u2019s LAC assertions were more appropriate for postconviction relief. <em>Olsen, </em>\u00b6 17. Here, attorney Olson questioned Snow about a particular gang during cross-examination. However, the prosecutor objected on relevancy grounds, and the judge asked Olson if an offer of proof needed to be made. Subsequently, an off-the-record bench conference was held, and the objection was ultimately sustained. Due to this off-record conference, the record is silent as to \u201cwhy\u201d Olson did not make an offer of proof. This claim is more appropriately addressed in a petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">\u00b651 Lastly, Main contends that Olson failed to object to Kemp\u2019s testimony that a combination of blunt force trauma and intoxication may have caused Kvelstad\u2019s death. Main argues this testimony did not meet the minimum standard of reliability for admission. We have noted that \u2018la] defense counsel\u2019s use of objections lies within his or her discretion\u201d and \u201c[i]t is also not beyond the realm of reasonableness that defense counsel would not object during certain times of the trial so as not to confuse the jury or bring undue attention to the prosecution\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Clausell v. State, </em>2005 MT 33, \u00b6 20, 326 Mont. 63, 106 P.3d 1175.</p>\n<p id=\"AJA\">\u00b652 While not objecting to this portion of Kemp\u2019s testimony, Olson vigorously cross-examined Kemp and distinguished Kemp\u2019s testimony from the defense expert\u2019s testimony as to the cause of Kvelstad\u2019s death. He further utilized these differences in his opening and closing arguments. It is possible that Olson, rather than objecting, chose to contrast Kemp\u2019s testimony with the defense expert\u2019s testimony as a matter of trial strategy, but the record is silent as to \u201cwhy\u201d Olson chose to proceed in this manner, if indeed he did. Main fails to demonstrate that no plausible justification exists for his counsel\u2019s alleged failure to object to Kemp\u2019s testimony. <em>See State v. Upshaw, </em>2006 MT 341, \u00b6\u00b6 34, 40, 335 Mont. 162, 153 P.3d 579. \u2018If the record does not fully explain why counsel failed to object to the admission of evidence, the matter is best suited for postconviction proceedings.\u201d <em>State v. St. Germain, </em>2007 MT 28, \u00b6 35, 336 Mont. 17, 153 P.3d 591. We decline to address this issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">\u00b653  As to Olson\u2019s failure to object to Kemp\u2019s testimony, Main also ruges this Court to apply plain error review. Plain error review is invoked sparingly, and \u201conly in situations that implicate a defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights when failing to review the alleged error may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the proceedings, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>State v. Thorp, </em>2010 MT 92, \u00b6 23, 356 Mont. 150, 231 P.3d 1096. To obtain plain error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>review, \u201cthe appealing party must (1) show that the claimed error implicates a fundamental right and (2) \u2018firmly convince\u2019 this Court that failure to review the claimed error would result\u201d in any of the situations outlined above. <em>State v. Norman, </em>2010 MT 253, \u00b6 17, 358 Mont. 252, 244 P.3d 737 (citation omitted). This Court has discretion whether to apply plain error review. <em>State v. Finley, </em>276 Mont. 126, 137, 915 P.2d 208, 215 (1996), <em>overruled on other grounds, State v. Gallagher, </em>2001 MT 39, \u00b6 21, 304 Mont. 215, 19 P.3d 817.

However, Main\u2019s trial counsel did not object to Kemp\u2019s testimony and used portions of Kemp\u2019s testimony, along with Main\u2019s expert witness testimony, to argue for a defense verdict. As such, the jury permissibly considered the evidence. <em>See State v. LaMere, </em>2003 MT 49, \u00b6 22, 314 Mont. 326, 67 P.3d 192 (citation omitted) (If evidence is properly before the jury, then resolving evidence conflicts, judging witness credibility and fact-finding are \"acts uniquely within the province of the jury.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b520-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH,</author>\n<p id=\"AJ9\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">\u00b655 In general, I concur with the majority\u2019s disposition of Main\u2019s appeal. I write separately however, because I disagree that Main\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel (IAC) claim concerning trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to Dr. Kemp\u2019s testimony is better suited for postconviction relief proceedings. Opinion, \u00b6 53. This IAC claim can be resolved on direct appeal; Main has failed to establish that counsel was deficient or that he was prejudiced by the lack of objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">\u00b656 First, Main\u2019s IAC claim is appropriate for direct appeal. An IAC claim that can be decided on the district court record is a record-based claim that must be raised on direct appeal. <em>State v. Lindsey, </em>2011 MT 46, \u00b6 43, 359 Mont. 362, 249 P.3d 491; <em>State v. Meredith, </em>2010 MT 27, \u00b6 51, 355 Mont. 148, 226 P.3d 571 (citin <em>g Petition of Hans, </em>1998 MT 7, \u00b6 42, 288 Mont. 168, 958 P.2d 1175). \u2018The allegation that counsel failed to object to an alleged error in the district court is a record-based claim of ineffective assistance.\u201d <em>Lindsey, </em>\u00b6 43; <em>Hagen v. State, </em>1999 MT 8, \u00b6\u00b6 19-20, 293 Mont. 60, 973 P.2d 233 (holding that IAC claim premised on counsel\u2019s failure to object was procedurally barred in postconviction proceedings because it was record based and should have been brought on direct appeal). Unlike omissions that necessitate consideration of facts outside of the record, an alleged failure to object \u2018is a fact easily documented by reviewing the record, and we have decided claims of this kind on direct appeal on numerous occasions <em>.\u2019\u2019Hagen, </em>\u00b6 20 (citing <em>State v. Campbell, </em>278 Mont. 236, 250, 924 P.2d 1304, 1313, (1996); <em>State v. Bradley, </em>262 Mont. 194, 197-99, 864 P.2d 787, 789 (1993); <em>State v. Schoffner, </em>248 Mont. 260, 268, 811 P.2d 548, 553 (1991); <em>State v. Probert, </em>221 Mont. 476, 481, 719 P.2d 783, 786 (1986)); see <em>Meredith, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 48-59. In the case at hand, Main has raised an IAC claim based on trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to Kemp\u2019s testimony concerning alcohol consumption and blunt force trauma. This omission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>is clearly documented in the record. <em>Meredith, </em>\u00b6 <em>52.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">\u00b657 Second, turning to the substance of Main\u2019s IAC claim, he fails to establish either prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test. As noted, there are two requirements for a defendant to establish an IAC claim: (1) counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced the defendant\u2019s defense. <em>Lindsey, </em>\u00b6 43; <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 2064 (1984). \u201cA defendant must meet both parts of the test to be entitled to relief, and an insufficient showing under one part obviates the need to even address the other.\u201d <em>Lindsey, </em>\u00b6 43 (citing <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6 11, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 861).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">\u00b658 The record reveals that trial counsel clearly chose not to object for tactical reasons. Counsel both knew the substance of Kemp\u2019s testimony and relied upon it to buttress Main\u2019s defense. In his opening statement, Main\u2019s counsel explained that Kemp was going to present a \u201ctheory\u2019 about the effects of a combination of intoxication and blunt force injuries. He contrasted this \u201ctheory\u201dwith Main\u2019s expert, Bennett, who offered a medically-certain opinion that Kvelstad died of strangulation. During cross-examination, Main\u2019s counsel challenged the basis of Kemp\u2019s theory, and forced Kemp to concede that Kvelstad\u2019s blunt force injuries were non-fatal. Subsequently, counsel elicited from Kemp a concession that Kvelstad would have died from ligature strangulation if he had been alive at the time the ligature was applied. In other words, counsel utilized Kemp\u2019s testimony in a clear attempt to weaken the State\u2019s case and strengthen Main\u2019s. Finally, in his closing statement, counsel for Main once again contrasted Kemp\u2019s \u201ctheory\u2019 with Bennett\u2019s medical certainty and pointed out Kemp\u2019s concessions. The record here is sufficient to decide Main\u2019s IAC claim, and there is no need to consult non-record based information to explain trial counsel\u2019s tactics. <em>State v. St. Germain, </em>2007 MT 28, \u00b6 35, 336 Mont. 17, 153 P.3d 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">\u00b659 Main argues that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient because there was no strategic reason to allow Kemp\u2019s testimony about the combination of intoxication and blunt force trauma. \u2018The first prong carries a strong presumption in favor of the State, as counsel possesses a wide latitude in determining what tactics to employ when defending a client.\u201d <em>St. Germain, </em>\u00b6 33 (citing <em>State v. Kougl, </em>2004 MT 243, \u00b6 11, 323 Mont. 6, 97 P.3d 1095). It is the defendant\u2019s burden to overcome that presumption. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 21. As noted above, Main\u2019s counsel did in fact have an obvious tactical purpose in allowing Kemp\u2019s testimony. Without more, Main fails to show that his counsel\u2019s performance \u2018fell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>below an objective standard of reasonableness measured under prevailing professional norms and in light of the surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">\u00b660 Main\u2019s IAC claim also fails <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>prejudice prong. Rather than kicking this issue down the road to postconviction proceedings, the Court could dispose of this IAC claim on the prejudice prong alone. When an alleged deficient performance \u201cdoes not prejudice a defendant to the degree that the outcome of the trial is implicated, the claim may be dismissed without evaluating counsel\u2019s performance.\u201d <em>State v. Harris, </em>2001 MT 231, \u00b6 19, 306 Mont. 525, 36 P.3d 372 (citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S. Ct. at 2069). \u2018If it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice, which we expect will often be so, that course should be followed.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S. Ct. at 2069; <em>accord Becker v. State, </em>2010 MT 93, \u00b6 11, 356 Mont. 161, 232 P.3d 376. Disposal of IAC claims on the prejudice prong \u201censure[s] that ineffectiveness claims not become so burdensome to defense counsel that the entire criminal justice system suffers as a result.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S. Ct. at 2069. We would do well to heed the Supreme Court\u2019s advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">\u00b661 The majority\u2019s focus on \u201cwhy\u201dcounsel failed to object is irrelevant in a prejudice analysis. Opinion, \u00b6 53. Although not required in this case, counsel\u2019s rationale may be procedurally pertinent when addressing <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>first prong. <em>See State v. White, </em>2001 MT 149, \u00b6\u00b6 10-20, 306 Mont. 58, 30 P.3d 340. However, such an inquiry is unnecessary when addressing <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>second prong. <em>See Lindsey, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 43-47; <em>Becker, </em>\u00b6 11; <em>State v. DeMary, </em>2003 MT 307, \u00b6\u00b6 27-30, 318 Mont. 200, 79 P.3d 817. The prejudice prong is unconcerned with \u201cwhy\u201d trial counsel acted or failed to act. Rather, the focus is on the effect of counsel\u2019s action or inaction, i.e. whether \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Becker, </em>\u00b6 11 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S. Ct. at 2069). \u201c <em>\u2018A </em>reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019Becker, </em>\u00b6 11 (quoting, <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S. Ct. at 2068). Such is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">\u00b662 Assuming arguendo that counsel\u2019s failure to object was deficient <em>and </em>the objection would have been sustained, Main still cannot establish a reasonable probability that the trial result would have been different. As the majority aptly points out, there was sufficient evidence in the record for a jury to find Main guilty beyond a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>reasonable doubt. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 26-45. Importantly, there was sufficient evidence to convict Main in the absence of testimony concerning the combination of alcohol and blunt force trauma. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 39-45. In short, Main\u2019s alleged error does not undermine confidence in the jury verdict, and he cannot establish that he was prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">\u00b663 There is no reason to relegate Main\u2019s failure-to-object IAC claim to postconviction proceedings. Main has presented a record-based claim but has failed to show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. Moreover, there is no reason to relegate an IAC issue to postconviction proceedings where <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>prejudice prong is dispositive on direct appeal. This promotes timely resolution of IAC claims while a defendant is still represented by appellate counsel and avoids unnecessary grading of trial counsel\u2019s performance. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S. Ct. at 2069. Sending this IAC claim to postconviction proceedings puts off until tomorrow what should have been resolved today.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
