We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b392-12\">\u00b62 Before addressing the present controversy between the State and BNSF, we must first discuss the lengthy and litigious history between the State and BNSF. In the early 1980s, the State sued BNSF in state court to prevent BNSF from abandoning a section of railroad known as the Geraldine Line. The result of that suit was a 1984 Settlement Agreement (\u201c1984Agreement\u201d) between the State and BNSF,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> wherein BNSF agreed to donate the Geraldine Line to the State and the State agreed to obtain a short line operator to perform rail services on the Geraldine Line. Under the 1984 Agreement, BNSF also agreed to pay the short line operator on a per-car basis. That provision is Section 9 of the 1984 Agreement:</p>\n<p id=\"b392-13\">Section 9. Short Line Arrangement</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-14\">9.1 The parties contemplate that the State will obtain a short line railroad operator to perform rail services on the Spring Creek Junction to Geraldine Line following [BNSF\u2019s] donation of this trackage to the State under Section 8.1 hereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>9.2 The State agrees that it will require its short line operator to enter into an agreement for the interchange of railroad cars with [BNSF] in the form and substance attached hereto as APPENDIX \u201cB.\u201d The APPENDIX \u201cB\u201d agreement provides, and the parties hereto agree, that...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-4\">(b) [BNSF] will pay the short line $275 per loaded car for each car handled in interchange with short line;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-5\">(c) the $275 per car charge will be subject to an annual inflationary adjustment...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">\u00b63 Central Montana Rail, Inc. (\u2018CMR\u201d) was chosen as the short line operator, and on June 30, 1986, CMR entered into an Interchange Agreement with BNSF (\u201c1986 Agreement\u201d). <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The 1986 Agreement followed the \u2018form and substance\u201d of APPENDIX B to the 1984 Agreement. Both APPENDIX B and the 1986 Agreement contain an arbitration clause and a termination provision, however the 1984 Agreement had neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">\u00b64 In 2005, CMR sued BNSF alleging 1) breach of contract, based upon BNSF\u2019s alleged breach of the 1984 Agreement, 2) tortious interference, and 3) negligent misrepresentation <em>(CMR I).</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>CMR sued individually, and as the \u2018full assignee of the STATE OF MONTANA, of all jurisdictional and substantive legal rights the State of Montana possesses against BNSF Railway Company in this case.\u201d (Capitalization in original.) The assignment specifically assigned to CMR \u201call of the State\u2019s rights under paragraph 9 [Section 9]\u201d of the 1984 Agreement. <em>CMR I </em>was removed to federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">\u00b65 In 2007, during the pendency of <em>CMR I, </em>BNSF sought to terminate the 1986 Agreement with CMR, including the per-car payments to CMR under that agreement, and demanded arbitration. CMR, both individually and as the State\u2019s assignee, filed suit in federal court seeking to enjoin arbitration of the 1986 Agreement <em>(CMR </em>II).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> CMR claimed that BNSF could not terminate per-car payments because it would violate the 1984 Agreement, and sought a temporary restraining order (\u2018TRO\u201d) and a preliminary injunction. A TRO was denied and a hearing held on the preliminary injunction application. CMR argued the 1984 Agreement controlled the interpretation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>1986 Agreement. The federal court found that the 1984 and 1986 Agreements were \u201cmultiple contracts relating to the same matters and between the same parties\u201d and, under Montana law, are \u201ctaken together.\u201d That interrelationship did not, however, allow the federal court to eliminate the arbitration clause from the 1986 Agreement, as CMR urged. Arbitration was compelled, and <em>CMR II </em>was concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"AgP\">\u00b66 Arbitration proceeded on the termination of per-car payment issue. CMR argued that BNSF could not terminate the 1986 Agreement because the 1984 Agreement required it, and its per-car payment provisions. On May 15, 2009, the three member arbitration panel issued its decision. It found unanimously that BNSF was entitled to terminate the 1986 Agreement. The majority found that upon termination of the 1986 Agreement, the per-car payment methodology also terminated, and that future payments should be made pursuant to a Rule 11<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> arrangement. The arbitration award was confirmed in <em>CMR I </em>on July 30, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">\u00b67 While arbitration was pending, however, BNSF moved to dismiss Counts II and III of CMR\u2019s complaint in <em>CMR I. </em>On March 12, 2009, the federal court granted BNSF\u2019s motion, finding those counts were preempted by the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995, 49 U.S.C. \u00a710101 <em>etseq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">\u00b68 On August 25, 2009, BNSF moved for summary judgment on Count I of CMR\u2019s complaint in <em>CMR I, </em>the State\u2019s breach of contract claim regarding the 1984 Agreement. CMR did not respond on the merits, but filed 1) a Notice to the Court of Termination of Assignment and Notice that the Issues Currently Pending Before the Court are Moot on October 19, 2009, and 2) a motion for voluntary dismissal pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(2) on November 16, 2009. BNSF opposed dismissal and sought ruling on its summary judgment motion. While these motions were pending in federal court, the State filed the present case in state court in November 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">\u00b69 The federal court granted BNSF\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied CMR\u2019s motion for voluntary dismissal on April 13, 2010, finding that Tt]o do otherwise would be to allow the State of Montana to manipulate the judicial process with its attempt to dismiss its case after it is clearly lost, and defiantly litigate issues in State court which were already fully, fairly, and finally litigated, with the State of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>Montana\u2019s consent, in this Court.\u201d Regarding the Rule 41 motion, it found the State was attempting to re-litigate in State court \u201cpayment on a per-car basis, something that was already litigated and decided in the present case.\u201d It declared its rulings \u2018binding, not only on CMR, but on the State of Montana, who permitted CMR to litigate for nearly four years on its behalf.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) For these reasons, CMR\u2019s motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">\u00b610 Regarding BNSF\u2019s summary judgment motion, the federal court found that CMR could not recover damages individually because the 1984 Agreement prohibits third parties from recovering, and that neither CMR or the State could recover alleged highway damages because the claim they were based upon was dismissed and because damages for breach of contract are expectancy damages, or \u201cwhat the party would receive if the contract were performed.\u201d Final judgment was entered against CMR on April 13, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">\u00b611 CMR appealed three issues from <em>CMR I </em>-1) the confirmation of the arbitration award, 2) denial of its motion to dismiss, and 3) the award of summary judgment to BNSF. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed on all issues in a memorandum decision on March 18, 2011.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">PRESENT CONTROVERSY</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">\u00b612 With that history, we finally return to the present case. The complaint in the present case was brought in November 2009 by the State against BNSF seeking: 1) a declaratory judgment requiring BNSF to abide by the terms of the 1984 Agreement between the State and BNSF and a declaration that BNSF is in violation of that agreement, 2) specific performance by BNSF of the 1984 Agreement, and 3) damages for BNSF\u2019s alleged breach of the 1984 Agreement. \u00b613 On June 2, 2010, the State filed an application for a preliminary injunction to prohibit BNSF \u2018from terminating the payment to the State and its short line operator per loaded car [per-car payments] for each car handled in interchange as required under Section 9 of the 1984 Settlement Agreement.\u201d BNSF opposed the State\u2019s application and also sought judgment on the pleadings, arguing the suit was barred by both claim preclusion (res judicata) and issue preclusion (collateral estoppel). The District Court denied BNSF\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings and granted the State\u2019s application for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">\u00b614 In granting the preliminary injunction, the District Court found \u201cthe State has made out a prima facie case that the 1984 Settlement Agreement has not been terminated and obligations remain thereunder.\u201d The District Court then ordered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">To preserve the status quo, the State\u2019s application for preliminary injunction is GRANTED TO THE FOLLOWING EXTENT: Should the State present another short line operator\u2019s agreement in the form and substance attached as APPENDIX \u201cB\u201d to the 1984 Settlement Agreement, BNSF is enjoined from refusing to enter into that agreement and to perform the same during the pending of this action. Further, during this time, BNSF is enjoined from terminating any such short line operator\u2019s agreement without notice to the State and a subsequent showing of good cause before this Court. (Capitalization in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">\u00b615 BNSF appeals only from the District Court\u2019s order granting the preliminary injunction. Orders granting injunctions are immediately appealable. M. R. App. P. 6(3)(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">\u00b616 A district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a preliminary injunction is \u201cso largely within the discretion of the district court that we will not disturb its decision, barring a manifest abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Yockey v. Kearns Properties, LLC, </em>2005 MT 27, \u00b6 12, 326 Mont. 28, 106 P.3d 1185; <em>City of Great Falls v. Forbes, </em>2011 MT 12, \u00b6 9, 359 Mont. 140, 247 P.3d 1086. A manifest abuse of discretion is \u201cone that is obvious, evident, or unmistakable.\u201d <em>Yockey, </em>\u00b6 12. We review the district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether its interpretation is correct. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">\u00b617  An injunction is an order requiring a person to refrain from a particular act. Section 27-19-101, MCA. An applicant for a preliminary injunction must either establish a prima facie case, or show that it is at least doubtful whether or not he will suffer irreparable injury before his rights can be fully litigated. <em>Benefis Healthcare v. Great Falls Clinic, LLP, </em>2006 MT 254, \u00b6 14, 334 Mont. 86, 146 P.3d 714. If either showing is made, then courts are inclined to issue the preliminary injunction to preserve the status quo pending trial. <em>Id. </em>\u2018Status quo\u201d means the last actual, peaceable, non-contested condition which preceded the pending controversy. <em>Id.; Sweet Grass Farms, Ltd. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number><em>Board of County Commissioners, </em>2000 MT 147, \u00b6 28, 300 Mont. 66, 2 P.3d 825.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">\u00b618 An injunction may be granted in the following cases, among others:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">(1) when it appears that the applicant is entitled to the relief demanded and the relief or any part of the relief consists in restraining the commission or continuance of the act complained of, either for a limited period or perpetually;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">(2) when it appears that the commission or continuance of some act during the litigation would produce a great or irreparable injury to the applicant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-7\">(3) when it appears during the litigation that the adverse party is doing or threatens or is about to do or is procuring or suffering to be done some act in violation of the applicant's rights, respecting the subject of the action, and tending to render the judgment ineffectual;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">Section 27-19-201, MCA. Only one subsection need be met for an injunction to issue. <em>Sweet Grass Farms, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">\u00b619  An injunction will not issue to restrain an act already committed; it is not an appropriate remedy to procure relief for past injuries. <em>Bouma v. Bynum Irrigation District, </em>139 Mont. 360, 364, 364 P.2d 47, 49 (1961); <em>Mustang Holdings, LLC v. Zaveta, </em>2006 MT 234, \u00b6 15, 333 Mont. 471, 143 P.3d 456. Where the entire injury is in the past, an injunction cannot issue. <em>Billings Associated Plumbing, Heating &amp; Cooling Contractors v. State Board of Plumbers, </em>184 Mont. 249, 255, 602 P.2d 597, 601 (1979); <em>Mustang Holdings, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">\u00b620 In granting the preliminary injunction in this case, the District Court limited its analysis to subsections (1) and (3) of \u00a727-19-201, MCA. It did not address irreparable injury, stating that issue was \u2018hotly contested.\u201d Instead, it found that the State had made a prima facie case, and that BNSF\u2019s position that it owed no obligations under the 1984 Agreement would render a final judgment ineffectual. It then found that the \u201cstatus quo is to effectively put the parties in the position they were in on September 6,1984\u201d which is the day after the 1984 Agreement was signed. It then issued an order, quoted above at \u00b6 14, barring BNSF from refusing to sign another, hypothetical interchange agreement and barring BNSF from terminating any such interchange agreement without notice to the State and a good cause showing before the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">\u00b621  The District Court manifestly abused its discretion when it issued the preliminary injunction. The State requested a preliminary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>injunction prohibiting BNSF \u201cfrom terminating the payment to the State and its short line operator per loaded car [per-car payments] for each car handled in interchange as required under Section 9 of the 1984 Settlement Agreement.\u201d The State admits it \u2018is not the direct recipient of the per-car payments at stake in this litigation.\u201dBNSF has never made per-car payments to the State. Thus, the District Court could not enjoin BNSF from terminating per-car payments to the State because none were ever, nor will ever be, due to the State under the 1984 Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">\u00b622 Per-car payments to the State\u2019s short line operator (CMR) had already been terminated in <em>CMR I </em>well before the State sought the preliminary injunction. That issue was the subject of arbitration which CMR lost, and the arbitration award was confirmed by the federal district court on July 30, 2009, and most recently by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on March 18, 2011. At the time the State sought the preliminary injunction, June 2, 2010, the status quo was that per-car payments to CMR could be, and were, lawfully terminated and replaced with a Rule 11 arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\u00b623 Based upon the State\u2019s application and requested relief, this case is not suitable for issuance of a preliminary injunction. The entire injury complained of, the termination of per-car payments, is in the past. Per-car payments were terminated well before the District Court could enter any type of injunctive relief. <em>Mustang Holdings, </em>\u00b6 16. An injunction will not issue to restrain an act already committed; it is not an appropriate remedy to procure relief for past injuries. <em>Bouma, </em>139 Mont. at 364, 364 P.2d at 49; <em>Mustang Holdings, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\u00b624 That is where the District Court should have stopped. Instead, the District Court went beyond the State\u2019s requested relief. It found that the State made a prima facie showing that \u2018the 1984 Settlement Agreement remains an active contract containing rights acquired and obligations owed by each party.\u201d It then required BNSF to enter into another interchange agreement \u201cshould\u201d one be presented. Once a party to such an agreement, BNSF would then be prohibited from terminating it except under certain circumstances. In effect, the District Court ordered specific performance of the 1984 Agreement under new terms substantially different than the prior agreed upon terms. The new terms severely limit termination of the new interchange agreement and were never part of the 1984 or 1986 Agreements. Requiring BNSF to execute this new interchange agreement would also require BNSF to resume per-car payments, apparently to CMR, who the State says \u2018has continued to provide the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>service contemplated by the 1984 Settlement Agreement.\u201d This simply cannot be done and it was a manifest abuse of discretion to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">\u00b625 It is obvious, evident, and unmistakable that the District Court manifestly abused its discretion in issuing the preliminary injunction in this case. Its order goes far beyond the relief requested by the State. We therefore reverse the order of the District Court granting the preliminary injunction with instructions that the District Court dissolve the injunction. We remand this case to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision.</p>\n<judges id=\"b399-6\">JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON, MORRIS and BAKER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b392-15\"> The State and BNSF are the only parties to the 1984 Agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b393-9\"> CMR and BNSF are the only parties to the 1986 Agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b393-10\"> CV-05-116-GF-RKS.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b393-11\"> CV-07-120-GF-RFC.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b394-7\"> Rule 11 refers to an accounting rule published by the Association of American Railroads.
