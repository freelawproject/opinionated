We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">\u00b62 On appeal, the State raises the issue of whether the evidence presented to establish reasonable apprehension of bodily injury was sufficient to support Finley\u2019s conviction for partner or family member assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">\u00b63 Finley raises the issue of whether the State\u2019s appeal is precluded by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b204-12\">\u00b64 At 1:41 a.m., on April 4, 2009, Debbie Finley made a 911 call to the Lewis and Clark County dispatch center. She placed the call from her cellular telephone after she fled her house by sneaking out of the back door. Breathless and audibly crying, Debbie told the dispatcher that her husband, Finley, had come home drunk and was trashing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>place. She claimed that Finley blamed her for the recent arrest of their older son. She expressed fear for her ten-year-old son and mother, who were still asleep at the residence. The dispatcher asked if Finley had hurt anyone. Debbie responded, \u2018He\u2019s trying to hurt me.... He\u2019s telling me he\u2019s going to crush my fucking head in, and stuff like that.\u201d She told the dispatcher that she was cold, because she had fled without shoes and was wearing only a tee-shirt and pajama pants.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">\u00b65 Initially, Debbie ran to a Montana Lil\u2019s Casino, down the street from her house. At one point during the 911 call, she became agitated when she thought she saw Finley walking towards the casino. The dispatcher convinced Debbie to proceed to the nearby Town Pump and wait for the police. Once there, Debbie informed the dispatcher that she had positioned herself away from the windows and refused to look outside. Ultimately, the dispatcher managed to coax Debbie to look outside and confirm that the police had arrived. During the eight-minute 911 call, Debbie repeatedly asked where the officers were and how soon they would reach her.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">\u00b66 Reserve Officer Phil Richards, of the East Helena Police Department, was the first to arrive at the Town Pump. He encountered Debbie as she exited the building. She was shaking, hesitant to speak and exhibited redness around the eyes. Debbie informed Richards that she and her husband had a disagreement. Richards later testified that he was surprised that Debbie lacked shoes and was clad in only pajamas.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">\u00b67 Next to arrive was Lewis and Clark County Sheriffs Deputy Eric Gilbertson. He testified that Debbie was emotionally upset, shaking and nervous. Gilbertson confirmed that Debbie was underdressed for the weather and estimated the temperature was between 20 and 30 degrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">\u00b68 Third to arrive was Lewis and Clark County Sheriff s Deputy Matt Reighard. He too observed that Debbie was underdressed, nervous, afraid, and emotionally distressed. Debbie told Reighard that she probably would not be alive had she not left the house when she did. She further expressed fear that Finley had pursued her after she fled. Additionally, she repeated the story she told to the 911 dispatcher and again expressed concern for her son and mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">\u00b69 Reighard accompanied Debbie back to the residence. She remained in his patrol vehicle while he checked the house for Finley. During his sweep of the premises, Reighard visually confirmed that the damage was consistent with Debbie\u2019s story. After failing to locate Finley, Reighard returned to his vehicle. There, Debbie informed him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>she might have just seen Finley. Out of fear of remaining at her house, Debbie accompanied Reighard as he searched the neighborhood. The search proved unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">\u00b610 Reighard and Debbie returned to her residence, where Debbie provided a written statement of the night\u2019s events. Reighard took photographs of the damaged closet, and the broken floor heater. He also photographed blood on the wall, which Debbie claimed was the result of Finley punching something. Additionally, Reighard found and photographed footprints in the fresh snow outside of the back door, heading towards the Town Pump. The footprints were too large to belong to Debbie and were made by someone wearing shoes. The deputy then left the residence and continued to search for Finley. Out of fear of remaining at home that night, Debbie called a friend to come get her, her son and her mother. Ultimately, the officers were unable to locate Finley, and the case was referred to the Lewis and Clark County Attorney\u2019s Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">\u00b611 Finley was charged with partner or family member assault, second offense. A bench trial was held on October 29, 2009. Debbie, Reighard, Gilbertson and Richards were all called as witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">\u00b612 At trial, Debbie testified that many of her statements on April 4, 2009, were lies. She admitted calling 911, but claimed she fabricated the story so the police would remove Finley from her house. When asked why she would do this, Debbie responded that she disliked when Finley was drunk, because her father had been an alcoholic. She acknowledged that Finley yelled at her and blamed her for the trouble with their older son but denied he used violence or threats. She asserted that the door and heater had been in disrepair prior to April 4, and the blood was from a previous incident. She testified that she took advantage of these pre-existing conditions to strengthen her story to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">\u00b613 Furthermore, Debbie claimed she had never said that Finley wanted to crush her head. Alternatively, she asserted that if she had said something to that effect, it had been a lie. She claimed that she rarely wore shoes, and she had made a voluntary decision to leave her house wearing only pajamas. When the prosecutor asked Debbie about all of the inconsistent statements, Debbie responded that she would rather lie to the police than lie in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">\u00b6 14 Finley was found guilty of partner or family member assault. The Lewis and Clark County Justice Court of record found Debbie\u2019s testimony to be unbelievable. It further found her to be a less than credible witness because her assertions were contradicted by all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>physical evidence and the 911 recording. Pursuant to \u00a746-17-311(1), MCA, Finley appealed to the District Court of Lewis and Clark County. He argued that the State had presented insufficient evidence, and the prosecutor had engaged in misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">\u00b615 On August 11, 2010, the District Court reversed the Justice Court. As provided in \u00a73-10-115(1), MCA, the District Court did not conduct a new trial, but rather confined its review to the record and questions of law. It concluded the evidence was insufficient to support Finley\u2019s conviction. The District Court explained that Debbie was the only witness capable of establishing the element of reasonable apprehension of bodily injury. The District Court then reasoned that the State had failed to establish Debbie\u2019s reasonable apprehension of bodily injury because her testimony \u201cwas found by the trier of fact to be inherently incredible.\u201d Because the District Court reversed the conviction based upon evidentiary insufficiency, it did not address Finley\u2019s allegation of prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">\u00b616 On August 31, 2010, the State filed notice of appeal to this Court. In response, Finley filed a motion to dismiss, arguing the State\u2019s appeal was unauthorized. On January 4, 2011 this Court denied Finley\u2019s motion to dismiss and allowed the State\u2019s appeal to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">\u00b617 When a district court acts in an appellate capacity, we review to determine whether the district court reached the correct conclusions under the appropriate standards of review. <em>Stanley v. Lemire, </em>2006 MT 304, \u00b6 26, 334 Mont. 489, 148 P.3d 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">\u00b618 We review an appeal concerning evidentiary sufficiency to determine whether, when viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a rational finder of fact could have found the required elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Gunderson, </em>2010 MT 166, \u00b6 58, 357 Mont. 142, 237 P.3d 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">\u00b619 Our review of constitutional questions is plenary. <em>State v. Brooks, </em>2010 MT 226, \u00b6 11, 358 Mont. 51, 243 P.3d 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">\u00b620 <em>Whether the State\u2019s appeal is precluded.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b207-12\">\u00b621  As a threshold matter, we address Finley\u2019s contention that the State\u2019s appeal is barred. Generally, the State may not appeal in criminal cases. Section 46-20-103(1), MCA. However, there are exceptions to this rule, including when a lower court\u2019s order or judgment substantively results in the dismissal of a case, or modifies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>or changes a verdict. Section 46-20-103(2), MCA. We conclude that the State\u2019s appeal is authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">\u00b622 First, Supreme Court precedent permits the State\u2019s appeal, without offending the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution. In a bench trial, jeopardy attaches \u201cwhen the judge begins to receive evidence.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Martin Linen Supply Co., </em>430 U.S. 564, 569, 97 S. Ct. 1349, 1354 (1977); <em>accord State v. Barron, </em>2008 MT 69, \u00b6 14, 342 Mont. 100, 179 P.3d 519. When a governmental appeal does not threaten a defendant with successive prosecutions, the Double Jeopardy Clause is not offended. <em>United States v. Difrancesco, </em>449 U.S. 117, 132, 101 S. Ct. 426, 435 (1980). In <em>Smith v. Massachusetts, </em>543 U.S. 462, 125 S. Ct. 1129 (2005), the Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-5\">Our cases have made a single exception to the principle that acquittal by judge precludes reexamination of guilt no less than acquittal by jury: When a jury returns a verdict of guilty and a trial judge (or an appellate court) sets aside that verdict and enters a judgment of acquittal, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not preclude a prosecution appeal to reinstate the jury verdict of guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-6\"><em>Smith, </em>543 U.S. at 467, 125 S. Ct. at 1134. Such an appeal is permitted, because a defendant only faces restoration of a previously-entered guilty verdict, not a new trial. <em>Martin Linen Supply Co., </em>430 U.S. at 569, 97 S. Ct. at 1354. Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution provides, in pertinent part, \u201c[n]o person shall be again put in jeopardy for the same offense previously tried in any jurisdiction.\u201d Although this has been construed to provide greater protection against double jeopardy than its federal counterpart, <em>State v. Guillaume, </em>1999 MT 29, \u00b6 16, 293 Mont. 224, 975 P.2d 312, nothing in the case at hand compels departure from federal guidance. The State seeks to reinstate a guilty verdict set aside by the District Court, acting in an appellate capacity. This appeal fits squarely within the exception recognized in <em>Smith.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">\u00b623 Second, Finley\u2019s cite to <em>Burks v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 1, 98 S. Ct. 2141 (1978), potentially undermines his argument. The question in <em>Burks </em>was \u201cwhether a defendant may be <em>tried </em>a second time when a reviewing court has determined that in a prior trial the evidence was insufficient to sustain the verdict of guilty.\u201d <em>Burks, </em>437 U.S. at 5, 98 S. Ct. at 2144 (emphasis added). The Supreme Court explained why remand for a new trial was impermissible:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-8\">By deciding that the Government had failed to come forward with sufficient proof of petitioner\u2019s capacity to be responsible for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>criminal acts, that court was clearly saying that Burks\u2019 criminal culpability had not been established. If the District Court had so held in the first instance, as the reviewing court said it should have done, a judgment of acquittal would have been entered <em>and, of course, petitioner could not be retried for the same offense.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3K\"><em>Burks, </em>437 U.S. at 10-11, 98 S. Ct. at 2147 (emphasis added). Despite Finley\u2019s attempt to analogize this language to the case at hand, the <em>Burks </em>Court explained that its opinion did not address the government\u2019s ability to appeal from the intermediate appellate court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AW3\">The United States has not cross-petitioned for certiorari on the question of whether the Court of Appeals was correct in holding that the Government had failed to meet its burden of proof with respect to the claim of insanity. Accordingly, that issue is not open for review here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-4\"><em>Burks, </em>437 U.S. at 5, 98 S. Ct. at 2144. Not only does this language foreclose Finley\u2019s reliance on <em>Burks, </em>but it suggests that the <em>Burks </em>Court would have entertained the merits, had the government appealed. Thus, if <em>Burks </em>adds anything to this case, it implicitly supports the State\u2019s ability to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">\u00b624 Finally, <em>State v. Cool, </em>174 Mont. 99, 568 P.2d 567 (1977), and <em>State v. Greenwalt, </em>204 Mont. 196, 663 P.2d 1178 (1983), do not apply. Those cases concerned the State\u2019s ability to appeal from a trial court, after an acquittal for insufficient evidence. <em>Cool, </em>174 Mont. at 100, 568 P.2d at 567; <em>Greenwalt, </em>204 Mont. at 201-02, 663 P.2d at 1180-81. Double jeopardy precludes appellate review of the trial court in such cases, because the State\u2019s appeal essentially attempts to re-try the defendant. <em>Greenwalt, </em>204 Mont. at 202, 663 P.2d at 1181. Here, the State\u2019s appeal does not subject Finley to retrial. Finley has already been found guilty at his original trial. On appeal he faces only potential reinstatement of the previously-entered guilty verdict. The Double Jeopardy concerns present in <em>Greenwalt </em>and <em>Cool, </em>are absent here.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">\u00b625  We conclude that the State is not precluded from appellate review when a district court, acting as an intermediate appellate court, sets aside a guilty verdict entered by a justice court of record. Should the State prevail, the tangible effect is reinstatement of the trier of fact\u2019s guilty verdict. Such circumstances do not subject defendants to impermissible retrial, further prosecution or double punishment for the same offense. Moreover, such an appeal comports with this Court\u2019s power and obligation to provide final appellate review of district court decisions when the district court has functioned as an intermediate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>appellate court. <em>State v. Seaman, </em>2005 MT 307, \u00b6 10, 329 Mont. 429, 124 P.3d 1137.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">\u00b626 <em>Whether the State\u2019s evidence of reasonable apprehension of bodily injury was sufficient to support Finley\u2019s conviction for partner or family member assault.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">\u00b627 The State argues that the District Court proceeded under a mistaken belief that only Debbie\u2019s testimony could establish the element of reasonable apprehension of bodily injury. The State further asserts that this mistake led to a flawed review by the District Court. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">\u00b628 Our proper scope of review in this case is whether the evidence presented in the Justice Court, when viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, could have allowed any rational trier of fact to have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Seaman, </em>\u00b6 10; <em>Gunderson, </em>\u00b6 58. Appellate review by a district court is no broader than this Court\u2019s review of a lower court judgment. <em>Stanley, </em>\u00b6 26. When acting in an appellate capacity, the District Court cannot make findings of fact, but rather must confine review to the record and questions of law. <em>State v. Fender, </em>2007 MT 268, \u00b6 4, n. 1, 339 Mont. 395, 170 P.3d 971. Accordingly, to assess a district court\u2019s appellate conclusions, we must conduct an independent review of the trial court\u2019s record under the appropriate standard of review. <em>Seaman, </em>\u00b6 10; <em>Stanley, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">\u00b629  A person commits the offense of partner or family member assault if the person \u201cpurposely or knowingly causes reasonable apprehension of bodily injury in a partner or family member.\u201d Section 45-5-206(1)(c), MCA. The standard is objective, asking whether a reasonable person under similar circumstances would have reasonably apprehended bodily injury. <em>State v. Vukasin, </em>2003 MT 230, \u00b6 19, 317 Mont. 204, 75 P.3d 1284. The State need not establish fear of bodily injury, but rather must produce evidence that a reasonable person would have realized that bodily injury could result. <em>State v. McMahon, </em>2003 MT 363, \u00b6 22, 319 Mont. 77, 81 P.3d 508. Furthermore, the elements of a criminal offense do not require direct evidence and can be established by circumstantial evidence alone. <em>Vukasin, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">\u00b630 Our review of Finley\u2019s trial reveals that the evidence presented by the prosecution could have allowed a rational trier of fact to conclude that the \u2018Reasonable apprehension of bodily injury\u201d element was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt. The 911 recording was introduced as evidence in the Justice Court trial. It captured more than just words. It clearly demonstrated Debbie\u2019s outright fear that Finley was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>going to harm her. She told the dispatcher that Finley had threatened to crush her head. Furthermore, she was scared enough to flee her home, into a cold night with fresh snow on the ground, wearing only pajamas and socks. Not only did Debbie repeatedly express concern that Finley had followed her, but her fear was great enough that the dispatcher had to coax her out of hiding, once inside of the Town Pump. Additionally, the Justice Court heard from three police officers who testified to Debbie\u2019s distraught appearance. She told Reighard that if she had not left her house, she would probably be dead. Furthermore, Reighard confirmed the damage to the house and blood on the wall. These observations corroborated the story Debbie told on the 911 recording. Debbie\u2019s reluctance to remain in her house without police presence culminated in her decision to remove her entire family from the home that night. Finally, the Justice Court heard Debbie\u2019s trial testimony, which tended to conflict with almost all of the other evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">\u00b631  As the trier of fact, the Justice Court had the ability to observe the witnesses and determine credibility. <em>State v. Pinkerton, </em>270 Mont. 287, 293, 891 P.2d 532, 536 (1995). The Justice Court was free to evaluate Debbie\u2019s credibility on the witness stand separate from her statements made to the 911 operator and the investigating officers, shortly following the described events. Moreover, Debbie\u2019s earlier statements were corroborated by the 911 recording, and the officers\u2019 testimony. Based upon this record, the trier of fact could have found the required elements of partner or family member assault beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">\u00b632 Finley\u2019s cite to <em>State v. White Water, </em>194 Mont. 85, 634 P.2d 636 (1981), is inapplicable to this case. In <em>White Water, </em>this Court stated, \u201ca conviction supported only by a prior inconsistent statement should not be allowed to stand.\u201d <em>White Water, </em>195 Mont. at 89, 634 P.2d at 639. Finley\u2019s conviction was supported by far more: Debbie\u2019s 911 call, the physical evidence, the testimony of three police officers, as well as Debbie\u2019s prior inconsistent statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">\u00b633  We conclude that the District Court erred when it reversed the guilty verdict entered by the Justice Court. However, the District Court made no ruling with regard to Finley\u2019s claim of prosecutorial misconduct. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the District Court and remand for resolution of the prosecutorial misconduct issue.</p>\n<judges id=\"b211-7\">JUSTICES MORRIS, COTTER, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
