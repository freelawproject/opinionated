Juvenile Male, </em>560 U.S._, 130 S. Ct. 2518 (2010). On June 23, 2010, we entered an order accepting the certified question pursuant to M. R. App. P. 15(7), based upon the statement of facts and procedural background provided by the Supreme Court. Following briefing by the parties, oral arguments were entertained January 19, 2011. We address the Supreme Court\u2019s question as posed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-12\">Is respondent\u2019s duty to remain registered as a sex offender under Montana law contingent upon the validity of the conditions of his now-expired federal juvenile-supervision order that required him to register as a sex offender, see Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a746-23-502(6)(b), 41-5A513(1)(c) (2005); <em>State v. Villanueva, </em>328 Mont. 135, 138-140, 118 P. 3d 179, 181-182 (2005); see also \u00a746-23-502(9)(b) (2009), or is the duty an independent requirement of Montana law that is unaffected by the validity or invalidity of the federal juvenile-supervision conditions, see \u00a746-23-502(10) (2009); 2007 Mont. Laws ch. 483, \u00a731, p. 2185?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-13\">\u00b62 Our answer to the certified question is that Respondent\u2019s state law duty to remain registered as a sex offender is not contingent upon the validity of the conditions of his federal supervision order, but is an independent requirement of Montana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>\u00b63 In 2005, Respondent entered a \u201ctrue\u201d plea and was adjudged delinquent in the United States District Court for the District of Montana for knowingly engaging in sexual acts with a person under 12 years of age, which would have been a crime under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241(c) and 1153(a) if committed by an adult. The District Court imposed official detention for two years and supervision until Respondent reached the age of 21, upon conditions. Juveniles adjudicated delinquent for certain serious sex offenses are required to register under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a716901 et seq., enacted by Congress in 2006. In February 2007, the Attorney General issued an interim rule, codified at 28 C.F.R. \u00a772.3 (2010), specifying that the requirement applied to offenders convicted of a requisite offense prior to the enactment of SORNA. 72 Fed. Reg. 8894, 8897 (Feb. 16, 2007). In July 2007, the District Court revoked Respondent\u2019s supervision for violating a condition, committing him to additional detention and imposing conditions requiring him to register as a sex offender and to keep his registration current. Respondent appealed the conditions, and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the registration requirement on federal <em>ex post facto </em>grounds. <em>United States v. Juvenile Male, </em>590 F.3d 924 (9th Cir. 2010). The United States petitioned the Supreme Court for certiorari. Respondent\u2019s term of supervision expired in May 2008, and he is no longer subject to the registration condition of his sentence. In the certification order, the Supreme Court states that, before addressing the question of certiorari, \u201cwe must resolve a threshold issue of mootness\u201d and determine \u201cwhether a favorable decision in this case would make it sufficiently likely that respondent could remove his name and identifying information from the Montana sex offender registry.\u201d <em>Juvenile Male, </em>130 S. Ct. at 2519 (internal quotations and citation omitted). Thus, the Supreme Court has certified the question to \u2018help determine whether this case presents a live case or controversy ....\u201d <em>Juvenile Male, </em>130 S. Ct. at 2520.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">\u00b64 The Montana Sexual or Violent Offender Registration Act (SVORA or the Act) was enacted in 1989 and generally imposes a lifetime requirement, unless relieved by court order, upon sexual offenders to register with a law enforcement agency when present in Montana. Section 46-23-506(1), (3), MCA (2009);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>see generally </em>\u00a7\u00a746-23-501 through -520, MCA. \u2018Sexual offender\u201d is generally defined as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>\u201ca person who has been convicted of or, in youth court, found to have committed or been adjudicated for a sexual... offense.\u201d Section 46-23-502(10), MCA. \u201cSexual offense\u201d is defined as a \u201cviolation of or attempt, solicitation or conspiracy to commit\u201d any of a listing of Montana sexual offenses. Section 46-23-502(9)(a), MCA. A sexual offender who knowingly fails to register or keep registration current is subject to criminal penalties. Section 46-23-507, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">\u00b65 From SVORA\u2019s enactment in 1989, sexual offenders convicted in other jurisdictions have been required to register for offenses that are \u201creasonably equivalent\u201d to any of the listed Montana sexual offenses. <em>State v. Hamilton, </em>2007 MT 167, \u00b6 9, 338 Mont. 142, 164 P.3d 884; Laws of Montana, 1989, ch. 293, \u00a72, at 632; \u00a746-23-502(9)(b), MCA (defining \u201csexual offense\u201d to include \u201cany violation of a law of another state, a tribal government, or the federal government that is reasonably equivalent to a violation listed\u201d). A 2001 amendment to SVORA retroactively applied the registration requirement to offenders who were sentenced, or placed under supervision, in another jurisdiction for a sexual offense since July 1, 1989. Laws of Montana, 2001, ch. 152, \u00a71, at 719; <em>State v. Villanueva, </em>2005 MT 192, \u00b6 15, 328 Mont. 135, 118 P.3d 179. A 2005 amendment applied SVORA to offenders who were required to register as a sex offender after conviction in another jurisdiction. Laws of Montana, 2005, ch. 313, \u00a7 1, at 1010; <em>Hamilton, </em>\u00b6 9. In 2007, the definition of \u201csexual offender\u201d was revised to include a person who \u2018in youth court\u201d was \u2018found to have committed or been adjudicated for\u201d a sexual offense. Laws of Montana, 2007, ch. 483, \u00a7 19, at 2174. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark>Correspondingly, \u201csexual offense\u201d was amended to include an \u201cadjudication\u201d for which registration was required in another jurisdiction. Laws of Montana, 2007, ch. 483, \u00a719, at 2173-74 (defining \u201csexual offense\u201d to include \u201cany violation of a law of another state, a tribal government, or the federal government... after an adjudication or conviction\u201dfor which an offender is required to register). The amendments incorporating juvenile proceedings within SVORA were explicitly made retroactive to offenders \u201cwho are sentenced or who are in the custody or under the supervision of the department of corrections on or after July 1, 1989 ....\u2019\u2019Laws of Montana, 2007, ch. 483, \u00a731(1), at 2185.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\u00b66 Noting that the term \u201csentenced\u201d used within the retroactivity provision is defined in \u00a746-1-202(25), MCA, as \u2018the judicial disposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>of a criminal proceeding,\u201d and that youth proceedings are considered civil in nature, Respondent argues that \u201c[t]he Montana Legislature never intended that the 2007 SVORA amendments were to be retroactively applied against juveniles.\u201dAlthough acknowledging that <em>Villanueva </em>\u201cseems to hold\u201d that \u2018the Montana Legislature always intended that the SVORA provisions would be applied retroactively,\u201d Respondent argues there are distinctions between the retroactivity provisions of the 2001 SVORA amendments at issue in <em>Villanueva </em>and the 2007 SVORA amendments which compel a different outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">\u00b67 Whether legislation is applied retroactively is a question of legislative intent. <em>See Hamilton, </em>\u00b6 10. There is a presumption against applying statutes retroactively, <em>Neel v. First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assoc. of Great Falls, </em>207 Mont. 376, 386, 675 P.2d 96, 102 (1984), and \u00a71-2-109, MCA, provides that statutes are not retroactive unless expressly so declared by the Legislature. \u2018Legislative intent that statutes be applied retroactively must be manifest in the statutes and from no other source.\u201d <em>Hamilton, </em>\u00b6 10 <em>(citingNeel, </em>207 Mont. at 386, 675 P.2d at 102). The controlling principle with regard to retroactivity of legislation has been stated as follows: If an act is \u201cunmistakably \u2018intended to operate retrospectively, that intention is controlling as to the interpretation of the statute, <em>even though it is not expressly so </em>stated.\u2019 <em>\u201dHamilton, </em>\u00b6 10 (emphasis added) <em>(quotingNeel, </em>207 Mont. at 386, 675 P.2d at 102).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">\u00b68 The defendant in <em>Hamilton </em>argued that the 2005 SVORA amendments were not retroactive. <em>Hamilton, </em>\u00b6 10. In taking up the question, we noted that the Legislature had failed to provide an explicit statement of retroactivity for the 2005 amendments. <em>Hamilton, </em>\u00b6 13. In order to determine whether the Legislature unmistakably intended the amendments to operate retroactively, we considered the purposes of SVORA, the purposes of the 2005 amendments, and the Legislature\u2019s previous efforts to make SVORA retroactive. <em>Hamilton, </em>\u00b6 14. We reasoned that \u2018tgjiven the Legislature\u2019s goal of administrative efficiency, it is only logical that the Legislature intended the amendments to apply retroactively. If the amendments were applied only to offenses committed after October 1, 2005, the result would be administrative chaos rather than efficiency.\u201d <em>Hamilton, </em>\u00b6 15. We thus concluded, despite the failure of the Legislature to provide a retroactivity provision, that \u201c[c]learly ... the Legislature intended the Act as a whole to be retroactive.\u201d <em>Hamilton, </em>\u00b6 15. We reached a similarly reasoned conclusion in <em>Neel, </em>where we analyzed the homestead statute and concluded that \u201cthe legislative intent is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>unmistakable\u201d that the statute was to be applied retroactively, \u201c[djespite the absence of an express declaration\u201d of retroactivity. <em>Neel, </em>207 Mont. at 387, 675 P.2d at 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">\u00b69 The pertinent provisions of the retroactivity section of the bill containing the 2007 SVORA amendments state as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">Section 31. Retroactive applicability. [Sections 2,3, and 19 through 24] apply retroactively, within the meaning of 1-2-109, to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlW\">(1) sexual offenders who are sentenced or who are in the custody or under the supervision of the department of corrections on or after July 1, 1989 ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Laws of Montana, 2007, ch. 483, \u00a731(1), at 2185 (brackets in original). This section makes retroactive Section 2 of the bill, which amended the Youth Court Act to exempt from the requirement to seal youth records information disseminated about an offender pursuant to SVORA. Laws of Montana, 2007, ch. 483, \u00a72, at 2155. It likewise makes retroactive Section 3 of the bill, which amended the Youth Court Act to authorize youth courts to impose registration when required by SVORA, and provided that \u201c[t]he duration of registration for a youth who is required to register as a sexual or violent offender shall be as provided in [SVORA]\u201d unless the court would order, upon findings, exemption from or a lesser duration of registration. <em>See </em>Laws of Montana, 2007, ch. 483, \u00a73, at 2157-58. Also made retroactive was Section 19 of the bill, which amended SVORA by revising the definition of \u201csexual or violent offender\u201d to include \u201ca person who has been convicted of <em>or, in youth court, found to have committed or been adjudicated for </em>a sexual or violent offense.\u201d Laws of Montana, 2007, ch. 483, \u00a719, at 2174. This provision clearly included youth court offenders within the registration requirements of SVORA.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">\u00b610 Thus, in addition to stating that Section 19-eontaining the youth registration requirement-was to be retroactive, the Legislature explicitly made retroactive the revisions to the Youth Court Act (Sections 2 and 3) it had enacted to correspond with the youth registration requirement. Laws of Montana, 2007, ch. 483, \u00a731, at 2185. Making retroactive the corresponding revisions to the Youth Court Act would have been completely useless and meaningless if the youth registration requirement had not also been made retroactive. \u201cA presumption exists that the Legislature does not pass meaningless legislation; accordingly, this Court must harmonize statutes relating to the same subject, as much as possible, giving effect to each.\u201d <em>State v. Brown, </em>2009 MT 452, \u00b6 10, 354 Mont. 329, 223 P.3d 874. While it would have been preferable, and would have avoided any question, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>the retroactivity provision to state that the amendments were made retroactive to those \u201csentenced or <em>adjudicated\u201d </em>since July 1,1989, the omission of this word does not disturb the clear and manifest intention of the Legislature to make the youth registration requirement retroactive. The structure and plain meaning of the retroactivity provision clearly evidences this intent. As we have previously declared, \u2018the Legislature intended the Act as a whole to be retroactive.\u201d <em>Hamilton, </em>\u00b6 15. Respondent\u2019s argument that the Legislature \u201cnever intended\u201d the 2007 amendments to be retroactively applied to juveniles is without merit. The amendments apply retroactively to a prior federal court adjudication of a juvenile sexual offender.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A00\">\u00b611 Respondent argues that retroactive application of either the 2005 or 2007 SVORA amendments are <em>ex post facto </em>to him. In <em>State v. Mount, </em>2003 MT 275, \u00b6 37, 317 Mont. 481, 78 P.3d 829, we adopted the \u201cintents-effects\u201d test articulated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Smith v. Doe, </em>538 U.S. 84, 123 S. Ct. 1140 (2003), and concluded that retroactive application of the 2001 version of SVORA did not violate the <em>ex post facto </em>clauses of the United States and Montana Constitutions. <em>Mount, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 89-90; <em>Hamilton, </em>\u00b6 12. We rejected a similar challenge in <em>Hamilton, </em>concluding the 2005 SVORA amendments were not <em>ex post facto </em>based upon our conclusion in <em>Mount </em>that the registration requirement was regulatory, not punitive. <em>Hamilton, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12, 17 (citing <em>Mount, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 89-90). We reach the same conclusion here. \u00b612 Given the applicable statutory provisions and the offense for which Respondent was adjudicated, the United States argues that SVORA imposes a registration requirement upon Respondent in multiple ways. We deem it necessary to analyze only one avenue by which an independent requirement is imposed, considering whether Respondent\u2019s federal violation is \u201creasonably equivalent\u201d under \u00a746-23-502(9)(b), MCA, to the Montana offense of sexual assault on a child. Section 45-5-502(3), MCA (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">\u00b613 Respondent was adjudicated delinquent by the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>District Court for the District of Montana in 2005 for knowingly engaging in sexual acts prohibited by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71153(a) and 2241(c) (2000) , between 2000 and 2002. Section 1153(a) criminalizes any violation of \u00a7 2241(c) which occurs within Indian country. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(a) (2000). Section 2241(c) prohibits persons from \u201cknowingly engaging] in a sexual act with another person who has not attained the age of 12 years ....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a72241(c) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">\u00b614 Under the federal statute, a \u201csexual act\u201dincludes contact between genital areas, genital-oral contact, and penetration of genital openings or genital touching \u2018hot through the clothing\u201d of children under 16 years old committed with \u201can intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2246(2) (2000). Under Montana law, sexual assault is committed when \u201c[a] person ... knowingly subjects another person to any sexual contact without consent ....\u201d Section 45-5-502(1), MCA (2001) . \u2018Sexual contact\u201d includes touching of the genital parts of another \u201cdirectly or through clothing, in order to knowingly or purposely: (a) cause bodily injury to or humiliate, harass, or degrade another; or (b) arouse or gratify the sexual response or desire of either party.\u201d Section 45-2-101(66)(a)-(b), MCA (2001). If the victim is less than 16 years old and the offender is 3 or more years older than the victim, the offender is subject to a heightened punishment, <em>see </em>\u00a745-5-502(3), MCA (2001), and is required to register under SVORA. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-23-502(9)(a), MCA. Consent is ineffective if \u201cthe victim is less than 14 years old and the offender is 3 or more years older than the victim.\u201d Section 45-5-502(5)(b), MCA (2001). The parties do not dispute that Respondent\u2019s victim was less than 12 years of age and at least three years younger than Respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">\u00b615  While not identical, Respondent\u2019s federal offense clearly constitutes a \u201cviolation of a law of ... the federal government that is reasonably equivalent\u201d to the listed state offense of sexual assault on a child. Section 46-23-502(9)(b), MCA. Respondent is a \u201csexual offender\u201d because he was \u2018in youth court, found to have committed or been adjudicated for\u201d such a sexual offense. Section 46-23-502(10), MCA. Thus, SVORA directly applies to Respondent, and he has a continuing duty to register under Montana law which is entirely independent from the registration conditions imposed by his federal supervision order.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">\u00b616 Respondent raises several novel constitutional challenges to SVORA which we conclude are unnecessary to address in order to answer the certified question based upon current Montana law. These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>issues will be considered if and when they are properly raised and developed within the context of cases litigated in Montana courts.</p>\n<judges id=\"b355-4\">CHIEF JUSTICES McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, WHEAT and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b349-5\"> All references to SVORA are to the current 2009 version, unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b350-6\"> The Laws of Montana indicate language added by amendments with the use of italics.

Hastings, </em>2007 MT 294, \u00b6 15, 340 Mont. 1, 171 P.3d 726, because SVORA required a \u201cconviction\u201d whereas juvenile proceedings result in an \u201cadjudication.\u201d <em>Hastings </em>involved an alleged failure to register arising under the 2003 version of SVORA, prior to the 2005 amendments and the 2007 amendments making SVORA applicable to juveniles, and therefore did not interpret the provisions at issue here or retroactivity.

Juvenile Male was adjudicated as a youth in Federal District Court in 2005, pursuant to the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a75031 et seq. In 2006, after Juvenile Male had been adjudicated in federal court, Congress enacted the Sexual Offender Registration and Notification Act (\u201cSORNA\u201d). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 16901 et seq. Although the majority correctly cites the history of the Montana Sexual or Violent Offender Registration Act (\u2018SVORA\u201d) and the current statutory language of the Act, this was not the law at the time that Juvenile Male was adjudicated in federal court. At the time that Juvenile Male was adjudicated in federal court the only persons subject to the SVORA in Montana were those defined as \u201csexual or violent offenders.\u201d Section 46-23-504, MCA (2005). \u2018Sexual or violent offender\u201d was then defined as \u201ca person who has been convicted of a sexual or violent offense.\u201d Section 46-23-502(7), MCA (2005). A \u201csexual offense\u201d was defined as (a) any violation of specified offenses under Title 45 of the Montana Criminal Code, or (b) \u201cany violation of a law of another state or the federal government reasonably equivalent to a violation listed in subsection (6)(a).\u201d Section 46-23-502(6), MCA (2005). Thus, at the time of Juvenile Male\u2019s adjudication in federal court, Montana\u2019s SVORA only required registration of persons \u201cconvicted\u201d of a \u201csexual offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ApH\">\u00b618 \u201c\u2018Conviction\u2019 means a judgment or sentence entered upon a guilty or nolo contendere plea or upon a verdict or finding of guilty rendered by a legally constituted jury or by a court of competent jurisdiction authorized to try the case without a jury.\u201d Section 46-1-202(7), MCA. In direct contrast to criminal proceedings for adults, the Montana Youth Court Act has created an entirely separate \u201ccourt\u201d to govern all proceedings for youths who are alleged to be delinquent. Sections 41-5-101, -103(8), -203, MCA. If a youth is \u201cadjudicated\u201d to be delinquent then the youth faces \u201cdisposition\u201d under the Youth Court Act. Sections 41-5-1502, -1511, MCA.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\">[N]o adjudication upon the status of any youth in the jurisdiction of the court shall operate to impose any of the civil disability imposed upon a person by reason of conviction of a criminal offense, nor shall such adjudication be deemed a criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>conviction, nor shall any youth be charged with or convicted of any crime in any court except as provided in this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ak2\">Section 41-5-106, MCA (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">\u00b619 This Court has previously addressed the issue of whether a youth court \u201cadjudication\u201d constituted a \u201cconviction\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-201(7), MCA (2005), and the SVORA. <em>State v. Hastings, </em>2007 MT 294, \u00b6 15, 340 Mont. 1, 171 P.3d 726. Hastings had been adjudicated in youth court in Montana as a delinquent youth for sexual intercourse without consent in 1998. <em>Hastings, </em>\u00b6 4. After Hastings turned 18, the youth court transferred jurisdiction to the district court and placed him on adult supervision. <em>Id. </em>Later, that suspended sentence was revoked and the district court imposed a sexual offender registration requirement upon Hastings. <em>Id. </em>In 2005, Hastings was arrested and charged by Information with the offense of failure to register as a sexual offender and filed a motion to dismiss, which was denied. <em>Hastings, </em>\u00b6 5. The <em>Hastings </em>Court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">Section 46-18-201(7), MCA, and the SVORA statutes require a \u201cconviction\u201d before SVORA registration requirements may be imposed. The statutes are unambiguous in that regard. Thus, because it is undisputed that Hastings\u2019 youth court adjudication did not constitute a \u2018faonviction\u201d as contemplated in \u00a7 46-23-502(7), MCA, the SVORA registration requirements could not be imposed by a district court under those statutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-6\"><em>Hastings, </em>\u00b6 15 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">\u00b620 The Court noted, \u201cthe problem, of course, is that unless Montana statutes permit the imposition of a SVORA registration requirement, a court may not impose one.\u201d <em>Hastings, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">\u00b621 Thus, under Montana law in effect at the time, had Juvenile Male, like Hastings, been adjudicated under Montana\u2019s Youth Court Act he would not have been \u201cconvicted\u201d and would not have been subjected to SVORA. Additionally, even if this Court were to apply federal law, the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act also creates a distinct process of justice for youths and likewise adjudicates delinquency and imposes judgment as a \u201cdisposition\u201d and does not \u201csentence\u201d youths in youth court proceedings. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a75031 et seq. Thus, even though Juvenile Male was adjudicated in federal court for an offense that meets the definition under Montana law of a \u201csexual offense\u201d under \u00a7 46-23-502(6)(b), MCA (2005), he had no requirement to register as a sexual offender in Montana unless he had also been \u2018fconvicted\u201d of that \u201csexual offense\u201d under federal law. He was not convicted. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>federal judge specifically held that Juvenile Male was adjudicated a delinquent youth and that \u201cdisposition is made under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5037.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">\u00b622 There is no question that Juvenile Male\u2019s \u201cadjudication\u201din federal youth court did not constitute a \u201cconviction\u201d for a \u201csexual or violent offense\u201d under either federal or Montana law. Thus, at the time that he was adjudicated as a delinquent youth in federal court, Juvenile Male had no independent obligation to register as a \u201csexual offender\u201d under Montana law. Accordingly, had the Montana Legislature amended the registration requirement to include Juvenile Male within the definition of those required to register <em>and </em>further impose the amended definition retroactively, that is the only way in which Juvenile Male would subsequently be required to register.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">\u00b623 The majority concedes that it was not until 2007 that the Montana Legislature expanded the definition of \u201csexual offender\u201d to specifically include a person who \u201cin youth court\u201d was \u2018found to have committed or been adjudicated for\u201d a sexual offense. Laws of Montana, 2007, ch. 483, \u00a719, at 2174. \u2018Sexual offense\u201d was likewise amended to include \u201cany violation of a law of another state, a tribal government, or the federal government ... after an adjudication or conviction\u201d for which the offender is required to register. Laws of Montana, 2007, ch. 483, \u00a7 19, at 2173-74. These 2007 amendments made SVORA applicable to adjudicated youths for the first time in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">\u00b624 These amendments were made retroactive to specific sexual offenders \u201cwho are sentenced or who are in the custody or under the supervision of the department of corrections on or after July 1,1989.\u201d Laws of Montana, 2007, ch. 483 \u00a731(1), at 2185 (emphasis added). Although the majority opines that the Legislature <em>intended </em>the 2007 amendments imposing registration upon juvenile offenders to apply retroactively to dispositions on or after July 1, 1989, the Legislature did not in fact do so. The fact that the Legislature may have made other Youth Court Act provisions regarding sexual offenses retroactive is not dispositive. \u2018No law contained in any of the statutes of Montana is retroactive unless expressly so declared.\u201d Section 1-2-109, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AD8\">\u00b625 This Court has previously considered this very issue in determining whether the district court erred when it \u201creflected the Montana Legislature\u2019s intent to extend the scope of SVORA to adjudicated youths\u201d and held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-7\">[I]f [a statute\u2019s language] is clear and unambiguous, no further interpretation is required.... In construing statutes, the function of the court is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted ... we conclude the District Court erred in construing the statutes at issue here by looking beyond their plain, unambiguous language.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-4\"><em>Hastings, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14, 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\u00b626 Thus, the majority likewise cannot attempt to construe the Legislature\u2019s intent by looking beyond their plain, unambiguous language. The clear and unambiguous language used in the retroactive provision for the 2007 amendments specifically limits its application to those \u201cwho are sentenced\u201d after July 1, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">\u00b627 The term \u201csentenced\u201d has been specifically defined under that portion of the criminal procedure code that deals with adults charged with crimes. The definition is not ambiguous or subject to interpretation. Section 46-1-202(25), MCA, defines \u201csentence\u201d as \u201cthe judicial disposition of a <em>criminal proceeding </em>upon a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or upon a verdict or finding of guilty.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 46-1-103, MCA, provides that the scope of the criminal procedure title \u201cgoverns the practice and procedure in all <em>criminal proceedings </em>in courts of Montana.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Youth Court is not a criminal proceeding, and no youth is ever \u201csentenced\u201d in Youth Court. Section 41-5-106, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">\u00b628 This Court\u2019s prior and continued willingness to equate an adult \u201csentence\u201d with a youth court \u201cdisposition\u201d disregards the inherently clear and unambiguous statutory and public policy differences between youth and adult court.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">\u00b629 \u2018Unless Montana statutes permit the imposition of a SVORA registration requirement, the court may not impose one.\u201d <em>Hastings, </em>\u00b6 18. There is no question that Juvenile Male was not in the custody or under the supervision of the Department of Corrections, thus the only method for the amendments to apply retroactively to him is if he was \u201csentenced\u201don or after July 1,1989. Juvenile Male was not \u201csentenced\u201d either in accordance with the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act or Montana law and therefore is not subject to retroactive application of the 2007 registration requirements for adjudicated youths. Thus, I would hold that Juvenile Male has no independent obligation to register as a sexual offender under Montana law.</p>\n<judges id=\"b358-9\">JUSTICE NELSON joins the foregoing dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b358-10\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"ANt\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">\u00b630 I join Judge Macek\u2019s well-reasoned Dissent and add the following observations regarding our approach to retroactivity analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">\u00b631 Like Judge Macek, I cannot agree that we may ignore plain and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>unambiguous statutory language by superimposing on that language our contrary view of what the Legislature presumably \u201cintended\u201d but did not actually say. We dealt with a situation not unlike that hereJ.e., one in which the Legislature\u2019s presumed \u2018intent\u201d was not incorporated into the statutory language actually adopted and enacted by that body-in <em>State v. Goebel, </em>2001 MT 73, 305 Mont. 53, 31 P.3d 335. In that case, the Legislature made what appeared to be a \u201cdrafting error\u201din \u00a746-23-1012, MCA. <em>Goebel, </em>\u00b6 23. Notwithstanding, and in the face of the State\u2019s arguments that the Legislature\u2019s presumed \u2018intent\u201d should control over the language it actually adopted, this Court, unanimously, adhered to the rule of statutory construction that \u201cthere is no reason for us to engage in a discussion of the legislative history to construe [a] statute when we have determined that the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous on its face.\u201d <em>Goebel, </em>\u00b6 21 (citing <em>State v. Hubbard, </em>200 Mont. 106, 111, 649 P.2d 1331, 1333 (1982)); <em>accord Connecticut Natl. Bank v. Germain, </em>503 U.S. 249, 253-54, 112 S. Ct. 1146, 1149 (1992) (\u201cffln interpreting a statute a court should always turn first to one, cardinal canon before all others. We have stated time and again that courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there. When the words of a statute are unambiguous, then, this first canon is also the last: judicial inquiry is complete.\u201d (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)). Furthermore, we adhered to this rule despite the fact that the District Court\u2019s contrary interpretation of the statute was \u201ca common sense interpretation of a statute that, itself, is illogical.\u201d <em>Goebel, </em>\u00b6 22. We closed with the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-4\">Nonetheless, to the extent that there is an error and to the extent that the statute does not accurately reflect the Legislature\u2019s clearly expressed intention, it is appropriate that the Legislature correct the problem, not the courts. <em>See Ingraham v. Champion Intern. </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 42, 49, 793 P.2d 769, 773 (citing <em>State, Dept. of Hwys. v. Public Employees Craft Coun. </em>(1974), 165 Mont. 349, 529 P.2d 785; <em>State ex rel. Grant v. Eaton </em>(1943), 114 Mont. 199, 133 P.2d 588).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-5\"><em>Goebel, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">\u00b632 In the case before us, we should simply follow our rules of statutory construction and our precedent. As Judge Macek states, we should apply the plain language of the statute rather than inferring a presumed legislative intent that was not incorporated into the actual language the Legislature adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>\u00b633 That said, while I disagree with the Court\u2019s approach here of inferring what the Legislature presumably intended but did not actually say, I recognize that this approach finds support in some of our cases. In my view, however, those cases should be rejected to the extent they have created a watered-down standard for retroactivity analysis. The standard is set by statute, not caselaw, and it is plain, simple, and clear: \u2018No law contained in any of the statutes of Montana is retroactive unless <em>expressly so declared.\u201d </em>Section 1-2-109, MCA (emphasis added). To \u201cdeclare\u201dis \u2018to make known formally, officially, or explicitly.\u201d <em>Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary </em>299 (10th ed., Merriam-Webster 1997). \u2018Expressly\u201d means \u2018in an express manner,\u201d i.e., \u201cdirectly, firmly, and explicitly stated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 410. To be \u201cexplicit\u201d means \u201cfully revealed or expressed <em>without vagueness, implication, or ambiguity.\u201d Id. </em>at 409 (emphasis added). Accordingly, unless the Legislature makes known formally, officially, or explicitly, in a manner that is direct, firm, and explicit, <em>without vagueness, implication, or ambiguity, </em>that a statute is retroactive, then the statute is, by default, <em>not </em>retroactive.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">\u00b634 The Court acknowledges the language of \u00a7 1-2-109, MCA (Opinion, \u00b6 7) but then invokes other, more vague and malleable standards-requiring less than an \u201cexpress declaration\u201d-for its analysis. For instance, the Court cites <em>State v. Hamilton, </em>2007 MT 167, \u00b6 10, 338 Mont. 142, 164 P.3d 884, where we said: \u2018Legislative intent that statutes be applied retroactively must be manifest in the statutes ....\u201d The manifest problem with this statement, however, is that \u201cmanifest\u201d simply means \u201creadily perceived by the senses.\u201d <em>Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary </em>707. Obviously, using our senses together with our powers of deduction, inference, and reason, we may \u201creadily perceive\u201d something to be the case even though it is not \u201cexpressly so declared.\u201d Correspondingly, asking whether the Legislature\u2019s intent is \u201cmanifest\u201din the statute allows the Court to do what it has done here: base its decision not on an \u201cexpress declaration\u201d ofretroactivity-which \u00a71-2-109, MCA, specifically requires-but rather on what we \u201creadily perceive\u201d using inference and deduction, as well as a healthy dose of conjecture.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">\u00b635 In support of this deviation from the unambiguous directive of \u00a71-2-109, MCA, the <em>Hamilton </em>Court cited <em>Neel v. First Fed. Sav. and Loan Assn., </em>207 Mont. 376, 386, 675 P.2d 96, 102 (1984), where this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">For a statute to be retroactively applied, such an intent must be clearly expressed by the legislature. Section 1-2-209 [sic], MCA. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>The legislative intent must be gathered from the act itself and no other source. <em>Penrod v. Hoskinson </em>(1976), 170 Mont. 277, 552 P.2d 325. However, \u201cIf it is unmistakable that an act was intended to operate retrospectively, that intention is controlling as to the interpretation of the statute, even though it is not expressly so stated.\u201d <em>Davidson v. Love </em>(1953), 127 Mont. 366 at 370, 264 P.2d 705 at 707.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">The first and third of these statements are patently-not to mention manifestly-eontrary to \u00a7 1-2-109, MCA. Again, the statute requires (and has always required, since its inception in 1895) an \u201cexpress declaration\u201d of retroactivity. The question is not whether we think the intent is \u201cclearly expressed\u201d-however that might be accomplished. Retroactivity must be \u201cexpressly so declared.\u201d Nor is the question whether we think the intent is \u201cunmistakable.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The requirement, once more, is \u201cexpressly so declared.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">\u00b636 If the retroactivity of a statute depends on whether the Legislature has \u201cexpressly declared\u201d it to be so-and that, in fact, is the requirement under \u00a71-2-109, MCA-then we should not be engaging in subjective analyses of what we think is \u201cmanifest,\u201d \u201cclear,\u201d \u201cunmistakable,\u201d or logical\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark>-fehough not \u201cexpressly declared\u201d4n the legislation. The only manifest, clear, and unmistakable thing we need to know is this: \u2018No law contained in any of the statutes of Montana is retroactive unless <em>expressly so declared\u201d </em>Section 1-2-109, MCA (emphasis added). That is the exacting standard the Legislature itself has adopted for determining retroactivity. That is the exacting standard the Legislature requires of itself if it intends for legislation to be retroactive. Unquestionably, it is a simple matter for the Legislature to expressly declare that a statutory amendment is retroactive, if that is what the Legislature intends.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">\u00b637 Using inference and deduction, the Court argues that it would have been \u201cuseless\u201d and \u201cmeaningless\u201d to make certain parts of the Youth Court Act retroactive without also making the youth registration requirement retroactive as well. Opinion, \u00b6 10. My disagreement with the Court is not with this inference. It is, rather, with the fact that the Court is drawing such inferences in the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>place. The Court states that it would have been \u201cpreferable, and would have avoided any question,\u201d if the Legislature had actually stated that the youth registration requirement is retroactive. Opinion, \u00b6 10. With all respect, however, \u00a7 1-2-109, MCA, does not make an \u201cexpress declaration\u201d of retroactivity optional or \"preferable.\u201d To the contrary, an \u201cexpress declaration\u201d-which would avoid the sort of uncertainty and \u201cquestion\u201dthat obviously exists here4s precisely what the statute specifically, expressly, and plainly requires. I respectfully suggest, therefore, that we are flat wrong to engage in the sort of inference and deduction the Court does here in order to remedy a perceived illogicality.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">\u00b638 Unlike other interpretational endeavors, where we must avoid absurdities<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and may look behind the language used in order to resolve ambiguities,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> retroactivity analysis is strictly limited to one question, and one question only: Did the Legislature \u201cexpressly declare\u201d the statute to be retroactive? This question must be resolved on the face of the statutory language. Either there is an express declaration, or there isn\u2019t. It is wrong for the courts to go beyond this question and do more than \u00a7 1-2-109, MCA, tells us to do. The requirement of an express declaration is not merely \u201cpreferable\u201d; it is <em>mandatory. </em>If it seems \u2018illogical\u201d that a certain provision was not made retroactive, or if the lack of retroactivity would leave other legislation seemingly \u201cuseless and meaningless,\u201d then it remains the prerogative of <em>the Legislature, </em>not the courts, to address these presumed flaws and provide the \u201cexpress declaration\u201d of retroactivity which the Legislature itself has said it will provide when it intends for legislation to apply retroactively. Section 1-2-109, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">\u00b639 Hence, while the Court\u2019s approach might be appropriate if we were faced with an ambiguity in a run-of-the-mill case of statutory construction, I conclude that it is not appropriate for resolving the retroactivity question here. We should not be foraging about in the Laws of Montana trying to divine what the Legislature may have intended but did not expressly declare. We likewise should not be inferring intent from what may seem to us \u201cunmistakable\u201d or \u201clogical.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Rather, we should simply apply the rule that the Legislature itself adopted and ask the one question that the Legislature has directed us to ask: Did the Legislature \u201cexpressly declare\u201d that the law in question is retroactive? <em>Davidson, Neel, </em>and their progeny are wrong and should be overruled, not perpetuated.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">\u00b640 The Court concedes that the Legislature did not \u201cexpressly declare\u201d the youth registration requirement to be retroactive. Opinion, \u00b6 10 (fflt would have been preferable, and would have avoided any question, for the retroactivity provision to state that the amendments were made retroactive to those \u2018sentenced or <em>adjudicated\u2019 </em>since July 1, 1989 ....\u201d(emphasis in original)). And Judge Macek ably demonstrates this to be the case. Dissent, \u00b6\u00b6 17-29. Pursuant to \u00a7 1-2-109, MCA, therefore, this should be the end of our analysis.
