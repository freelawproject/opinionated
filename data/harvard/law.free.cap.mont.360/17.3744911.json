A timber company, Timber Tracts, Inc., formerly owned all the property. The deeds from Timber Tracts, Inc. explicitly reserved an easement road, now called Bannock Lane, across Defendants\u2019 property to access Plaintiffs\u2019 properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-13\">\u00b65 Timber Tracts, Inc. reserved \u201ca perpetual easement to a full width of 60 feet across all roads as now constructed and/or as shown in detail on the Certificate of Survey No. 1974-3.\u201d Certificate of Survey No. 1974-3 shows an existing road in substantially the same location as the road now known as Bannock Lane that Plaintiffs consistently have used to access their properties. Defendants placed posts and other obstructions on Bannock Lane, despite the recorded easement, in order to block travel across the Defendants\u2019 property to Plaintiffs\u2019 properties. \u00b66 Plaintiffs brought an action in the District Court to enforce the easement and to prevent Defendants from blocking the road. Plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>alleged that they had suffered damages as a result of Defendants\u2019 conduct and asked the court to award compensatory damages, attorney fees, and punitive damages. The court held a trial and found that Plaintiffs had a right to use the easement based upon the recorded deeds from Timber Tracts, Inc. The court concluded that there were no demonstrable compensatory damages, but awarded punitive damages to Plaintiffs in the amount of their attorney fees to compensate them for the Defendants\u2019 malicious and unreasonable conduct. Defendants appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">\u00b67 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law for correctness. <em>Wilson v. State, </em>2010 MT 278, \u00b6 16, 358 Mont. 438, 249 P.3d 28. The district court may award punitive damages in accordance with \u00a7 27-1-220, and -221, MCA, at its discretion. This Court conducts plenary review of the district court\u2019s application of the statutory requirements. <em>Wilson, </em>\u00b6 16. We will reverse a district court\u2019s award of punitive damages for an abuse of discretion. <em>Emmerson v. Walker, </em>2010 MT 167, \u00b6\u00b6 39-40, 357 Mont. 166, 236 P.3d 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">\u00b68 We must address one preliminary matter. Defendants present several undeveloped arguments. Defendants argue that Plaintiffs lack standing and have no right to use the easement across Defendants\u2019 property. Defendants fail to support their position on these issues with a reasoned argument. Parties must present a reasoned argument to advance their position. M. R. App. P. 12(1)(f). It is not this Court\u2019s job to \u201cconduct legal research on a party\u2019s behalf, to guess as to a party\u2019s precise position, or to develop legal analysis that may lend support to that position.\u201d <em>Griffith v. Butte Sch. Dist. No. 1, </em>2010 MT 246, \u00b6 42, 358 Mont. 193, 244 P.3d 321 (citations omitted). We will not consider unsupported issues or arguments. <em>Id. </em>We affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Plaintiffs possess valid easements across Defendants\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">\u00b69 <em>Whether the District Court properly awarded Plaintiffs punitive damages in the amount of their attorney fees based on Defendants\u2019 alleged malicious conduct.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">\u00b610 Plaintiffs sought punitive damages based on their claim that the Defendants\u2019 actions constituted intentional, unlawful, and malicious conduct. Defendants argue that Plaintiffs failed to prove punitive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>damages with clear and convincing evidence and that the court failed to state clearly the reasons for the punitive damages award pursuant to \u00a727-1-221, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">\u00b611 Section 27-1-221, MCA, provides that a court may award reasonable punitive damages if the court finds the defendant guilty of actual malice. A defendant acts with malice if the defendant \u2018has knowledge of facts or intentionally disregards facts that create a high probability of injury to the plaintiff,\u201d and proceeds to act in disregard or indifference to the high probability of injury. Section 27-1-221(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">\u00b612  The court made the following findings at the conclusion of the trial: (1) Defendant Redhawksfeather Blanks had placed posts and other obstructions on the easement thereby restricting travel on the road, (2) Defendants had no right to interfere with Plaintiffs\u2019 use of the road, (3) Defendants knew, or reasonably should have known, that they had no legal right to obstruct Plaintiffs\u2019 use of the road, (4) Defendants intentionally, unlawfully, and maliciously had obstructed the road, and (5) Defendants\u2019 malicious conduct entitled Plaintiffs to punitive damages. The record submitted for our review supports the court\u2019s findings of facts and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">\u00b613  A plaintiff must prove punitive damages with clear and convincing evidence. Section 27-1-221(5), MCA. Plaintiffs presented numerous exhibits at trial that establish through deeds and maps that an easement exists across Defendants\u2019 property. Plaintiffs also presented photographs that depicted the easement and the Defendants\u2019 obstructions on Bannock Lane. The court minutes summarize the trial proceedings and indicate that Plaintiffs presented five witnesses at trial. The witnesses testified in regards to the easements\u2019 existence and the Defendants\u2019 conduct obstructing the road. The record establishes that Plaintiffs presented clear and convincing evidence to support their claim for both compensatory and punitive damages. <em>See Finstad v. W.R. Grace &amp; </em>Co., 2000 MT 228, \u00b6\u00b6 19-20, 301 Mont. 240, 8 P.3d 778. Defendants have failed to establish otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">\u00b614 This matter did not present complicated legal issues. The fact that Plaintiffs possessed a valid easement over Defendants\u2019 property appeared relatively straightforward in the record. We conclude that the record supports the court\u2019s findings that Defendants knew or should have known: (1) that they had no legal right to obstruct the easement, and (2) that blocking the easement would create a high probability of injury to Plaintiffs. Section 27-l-221(l)-(2), MCA. Clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>and convincing evidence in the record likewise supports the court\u2019s finding that Defendants acted in disregard or indifference to the high probability of injury to Plaintiffs. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">\u00b615 A court may not award punitive damages as a substitute for attorneys\u2019 fees where an award of fees otherwise would not be justified. <em>Estate of Pruyn v. Axmen Propane, Inc., </em>2009 MT 448, \u00b6 72, 354 Mont. 208, 223 P.3d 845. Rather, when a judge awards punitive damages, the judge must state clearly the reasons for making the award pursuant to \u00a727-1-221(7)(b), MCA. <em>Ward v. Vibrasonic Laboratories, Inc., </em>236 Mont. 314, 320-21, 769 P.2d 1229, 1233-34 (1989). The court must show that it considered the nature and extent of the defendant\u2019s wrongdoing, the defendant\u2019s intent, the amount of actual damages awarded, the defendant\u2019s net worth, any previous damage awards based on the same wrongful act, and any other relevant circumstances. Section 27-1-221(7)(b)(i)-(ix), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">\u00b616 Although the court did not state specifically that it made findings pursuant to the above statute, the court made partial findings in accordance with the statute. The court clearly stated the Defendants\u2019 intent-malicious. Section 27-1-221(7)(b)(iii), MCA. The court also discussed the nature and the extent of the Defendants\u2019 wrongdoing. Section 27-1-221(7)(b)(i)-(ii), MCA. The court did not state clearly the other factors listed in \u00a727-l-221(7)(b), MCA, and nothing in the record indicates that the court considered all of the statutory factors. Although not all of the factors may apply to this case, the court at least must demonstrate that it considered all of the factors listed in \u00a727-1-221(7)(b), MCA, and the reasons the factors justify an award of punitive damages. <em>Ward, </em>236 Mont. at 320-21, 769 P.2d at 1233-34.</p>\n<p id=\"A42\">\u00b617  A district court, having heard the evidence and observed the witnesses, sits in the best position to determine whether the facts of a case justify an award of punitive damages. <em>Emmerson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 39-40. Although the court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law presented to this Court might support an award of punitive damages, the District Court must follow the statutory procedures and make the necessary findings pursuant to \u00a7 27-1-221(7)(b), MCA, before this Court can consider such an award. <em>Ward, </em>236 Mont. at 320-21, 769 P.2d at 1233-34. We remand to the District Court to make the appropriate findings in accordance with \u00a7 27-1-221(7)(b), MCA, based on the evidence presented by the parties at trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b51-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
