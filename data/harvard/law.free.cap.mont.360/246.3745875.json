He now appeals, arguing that his right to due process was violated by the false and misleading presentation of DNA evidence, and also that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. We affirm Wright\u2019s conviction but dismiss, without prejudice, his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. He may pursue that claim through a timely petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">\u00b62 The evening of January 11, 2008, Wright picked up Sierra (the victim in this case) for their first or second date. They had known each other for about six months but had just recently begun a dating relationship. That evening, they went to various bars in the Bozeman area and spent time socializing at the home of Wright\u2019s employer. Wright and Sierra consumed several beers and so-called \u201cJagerbombs\u201d-a mixture of J\u00e1germeister and Red Bull. They also smoked some marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">\u00b63 At around midnight or 1:00 a.m., Sierra asked Wright to drive her home. They got into the pickup Wright had borrowed for the evening and headed toward Belgrade, where they both lived. Along the way, Sierra felt lightheaded and laid down with her head on Wright\u2019s lap. They continued to converse, and Sierra told Wright that she was not looking for sex, but was looking for a relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">\u00b64 While Wright\u2019s and Sierra\u2019s stories are consistent as to the foregoing events, they diverge as to what happened next. According to Wright, he took the Interstate 90 frontage road from Bozeman to Belgrade. Along the way, Sierra told him that she needed to go to the bathroom. Thus, Wright stopped at his parents\u2019 house in Belgrade so she could use the restroom there.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">\u00b65 According to Sierra, however, Wright drove to the Cameron Bridge Fishing Access, which is along a different route from Bozeman to Belgrade. When Sierra sat up and saw where they were, she asked Wright, \u201cWhat are you doing? I thought you were going to take me home?\u201dHe responded, \u2018I\u2019m going to give you just what you don\u2019t want.\u201d Wright told Sierra to take her clothes off, and when she refused, he took the keys out of the pickup\u2019s ignition and held them to Sierra\u2019s throat. With his other arm, he took Sierra\u2019s pants and underwear off and forced his penis into her vagina. Sierra pleaded with Wright to stop. She stated, \u2018You don\u2019t want to do this. You don\u2019t want to do this, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Tim. Think about your children and my son.\u201d She tried to push Wright off her, but he was too strong. She reached for her cell phone in her coat pocket to call 911, but Wright realized what she was doing and threw the phone in the back seat of the pickup.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">\u00b66 Eventually, Wright stopped raping Sierra and stated, \u201c1 can\u2019t believe I just did this to you. I care about you and I like you.\u201d Sierra asked whether he had ejaculated, and he responded, \u2018No.\u201d She asked Wright to drive her home, but he stated, \u2018I\u2019m not going to take you home because I don\u2019t want to go to jail.\u201d Sierra then suggested that he instead take her to his house so they could cuddle and talk. (As Sierra later explained at trial, she made this suggestion because she knew that Wright lived with his parents and she figured that if she could get there, she could get help.) Wright agreed and drove toward his parents\u2019 house. Sierra sat right next to him in an effort to make him think that everything was okay and that she was not going to report him. When they reached his parents\u2019 house, Wright initially refused to stop, but Sierra convinced him that she needed to go to the bathroom and get a drink of water. Once inside, Sierra used the restroom and then, while Wright was distracted by his dogs, she \u2018bolted\u201d into his parents\u2019 bedroom and woke them up.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">\u00b67 According to Sierra, she told Wright\u2019s dad (Jeffrey Rapp) that his son had just raped her, and Rapp responded, \u2018Well, call the cops.\u201d According to Rapp, in contrast, Sierra told him to \u201ctake me home right now or I\u2019m going to call the police and say that Tim tried to rape me.\u201d In any event, Rapp refused to take Sierra anywhere. At her request, however, Rapp went out to Wright\u2019s pickup and retrieved Sierra\u2019s cell phone from the back seat. Sierra then used it to call 911 and report the rape. She remained in Rapp\u2019s bedroom on the phone with the 911 dispatcher until Sergeant Chuck Sprague with the Belgrade Police Department arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">\u00b68 Sprague observed that Sierra \u201cwas terrified, she was crying, she was shaking. I mean I could feel her trembling through my arm. She was clutching my arm so tight it actually hurt. She just kept saying \u2018Get me out of here. Get me out of here. I want to leave.\u2019 ... She didn\u2019t seem like she felt safe to me, so that became my focus was getting her out of the house immediately.\u201d Sprague took Sierra to the hospital for a rape examination. The nurse who conducted the exam observed five areas of red, raised, linear lines, plus a round area of redness, on Sierra\u2019s neck. The nurse also noted burst blood vessels, indicating that quite a bit of force had been used. In examining Sierra\u2019s genital area, the nurse observed a reddened area with indications of broken blood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>vessels on the inner left side of her vagina, a couple of inches past the opening, possibly caused by blunt force trauma.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">\u00b69 Based on Sierra\u2019s report, investigators went to the Cameron Bridge Fishing Access. There, they observed an area of melted snow which was consistent with a map Sierra had drawn showing where the truck was parked during the rape. They also saw tire tracks in the snow. The tread patterns of these tracks indicated that the vehicle had two different sets of tires. The investigators compared these tread patterns to the tires on Wright\u2019s pickup and found them to be consistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">\u00b610 No semen was found in Sierra\u2019s vagina. Very small amounts of sperm were found on her underwear, but Wright was specifically <em>excluded </em>as the contributor. When asked to explain the presence of this sperm, Sierra opined that it may have come from a guy with whom she had been sexually active a week or two earlier, or it may have transferred from her roommate\u2019s clothes in the wash.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">\u00b611 The DNA evidence at issue in this appeal consists of testimony about a penile swab which investigators obtained from Wright. Jennifer Revis, a forensic scientist with the Department of Justice\u2019s Forensic Science Division, analyzed the swab and compared it against reference samples provided by Wright and Sierra. Revis was then called at trial to testify about the findings set out in her DNA Report. At the outset, the prosecutor asked Revis how many times she had testified before in court, and Revis replied, Tfywice.\u201d With regard to the penile swab, Revis stated that she had developed a DNA profile from epithelial cells and that this profile reflected a mixture of at least two individuals. The \u201cmajor profile\u201d in the mixture matched the DNA profile of Wright\u2019s reference sample, which was expected given that the sample had come from his penis. Revis then testified that \u2018[Sierra] cannot be excluded as a possible contributor to the mixed DNA profile,\u201d after which the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">Q. When you\u2019re determining whether or not [Sierra\u2019s] DNA is on that penis, tell me what the language \u201ccannot be excluded\u201d means?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-8\">A. So that means that the 16 locations we looked at for a DNA profile was at every of those 16 locations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-9\">Q. So whose DNA is on that penis, that penile swab that you examined at the Lab?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-10\">A. Well, it-Timothy Wright and [Sierra] can\u2019t be excluded as contributing to that profile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-11\">Q. If you4f you\u2019re finding her DNA, how come your conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>isn\u2019t that she\u2019s included in the profile? That confuses me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-4\">A. At the Forensic Science Division we don\u2019t use the word \u2018included.\u201d Instead we use \u201ccannot be excluded.\u201d It basically means the same thing. It\u2019s just our terminology we use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\u00b6 12 The prosecutor next inquired about Revis\u2019s statement in her DNA Report that, \u201c[biased on national statistics, the estimated number of unrelated people in a random population expected to have a DNA profile that could be included in this mixed DNA profile\u201d is 1 in 467,700 Caucasians, 1 in 2,351,000 Southwestern Hispanics, and 1 in 3,504,000 African-Americans:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">Q. Can you explaindet\u2019s focus on the Caucasian statistic. Can you explain that statistic to the jury? What\u2019s it really mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\">A. So that means that in a population of467,000 you would expect that one person in that population could be included in this mixture.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-8\">Q. All right. How many-what\u2019s the population of the state of Montana, do you know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-9\">A. It\u2019s approximately a million, just under.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-10\">Q. So in this particular scenario we\u2019ve got a mixture of two DNA\u2019s, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-11\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-12\">Q. Statistically speaking, then, I\u2019m just-4 want to make sure I understand you, is there only-are there only two people in the state of Montana that can contribute those particular profiles?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-13\">A. Yes. Statistically looking at the state of-er the population of Montana two people in Montana would contribute to this mixture. Q. Those being whom according to your test results?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-14\">A. According to the test results Timothy Wright and [Sierra],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-15\">\u00b613 Thereafter, defense counsel cross-examined Revis on her DNA analysis of the penile swab as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-16\">Q. The 16 loci, those are-those basically are marker points on our DNA [strand]; is that fair?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-17\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-18\">Q. They are, in fact, junk DNA, are they not, junk markers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-19\">A. Yes. They don\u2019t code for anything important like your hair color or your race or anything like that. So they\u2019re just basically junk DNA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-20\">Q. Now, how manydn a human DNA strand, how many of those little points are there possible?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-21\">A. Oh, it\u2019s limitless.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-22\">Q. Millions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>A. Yeah, uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-4\">Q. Okay. So when you do your analysis you pick just certain spots that you\u2019re testing to see where that person\u2019s genetics hit, ping,-and it goes ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-5\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\">Q. Like that? Okay. Now, you have to have all 16 of those loci in order to be able to tell if that\u2019s an exact DNA match, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\">A. For an exact match, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-8\">Q. Did you have an exact match on-with [Sierra] in the penile swab?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-9\">A. She can\u2019t be excluded. Since it\u2019s a mixture we use the \u201ccan\u2019t be excluded\u201d from the mixture term.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-10\">Q. Did you find all 16 loci of [her] DNA on Mr. Wright\u2019s penis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-11\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-12\">Q. Okay. Now, could some of those loci be from his DNA? It\u2019s a mixed sample. You\u2019ve got sperm. You said that you separate out the sperm cells from the epithelial cells, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-13\">A. This-the sample that we\u2019re talking about is the epithelial cell fraction, so it\u2019s non-sperm DNA and both Timothy Wright and [Sierra] were in that mixture.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-14\">Q. Okay. Now, above when you say that Timothy [Wright] was the contributor, but then down below was Sierra, you say that she cannot be excluded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-15\">A. That\u2019s because with Timothy Wright I was able to pull out a major DNA profile. And we use the term \u201cmatch\u201d only if we have a single source profile which is what a major DNA profile is. In the case of a mixture, which [Sierra] can\u2019t be excluded as a contributor to the mixture, we use that term \u201ccan\u2019t be excluded\u201d instead of \u201cmatch.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-16\">Q. All right. So can you tell me, let\u2019s assume that it is [Sierra\u2019s] DNA on the penile swab then, can you tell me if it was put therewas it put there by vaginal fluid?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-17\">A. I can\u2019t say what it came from.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-18\">Q. You can\u2019t tell me if it was from her hand or from spit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-19\">A. No. I can just say that it\u2019s DNA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-20\">\u00b614 On redirect examination, the prosecutor followed up on defense counsel\u2019s use of the word \u201cassume\u201d in reference to the presence of Sierra\u2019s DNA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-21\">Q. Okay. And then finally you were asked a question let\u2019s assume that it was [Sierra], her DNA that was on the Defendant\u2019s penis. Let\u2019s not assume that. Let\u2019s refer to what your testing results <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>revealed. Was it her DNA?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-4\">A. She can\u2019t be excluded as a contributor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-5\">Q. And that means?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">A. That she can\u2019t be excluded as a contributor to the mixture on the penile swab.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-7\">Q. Because she matches at all those 16 points, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-8\">A. Yes, she does.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">\u00b615 During closing arguments, the parties disputed the proper interpretation of Revis\u2019s testimony and report. Defense counsel argued that the language \u201ccannot be excluded as a contributor is not the same as [Sierra] is the other contributor.\u201d The prosecutor objected on the ground that this comment \u201c[m]ischaracterizes the testimony,\u201d but the court overruled the objection. Then, in her rebuttal, the prosecutor argued that Revis had used the term \u201ccannot be excluded\u201d4nstead of \u201cincluded\u201d-enly because this is the particular terminology used at the Forensic Science Division for mixed samples. She maintained that because Sierra\u2019s reference DNA profile matched the minor DNA profile in the sample from Wright\u2019s penis at all 16 loci, Sierra\u2019s DNA must have been on his penis.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">\u00b616 The jury found Wright guilty, and the District Court sentenced him to the Montana State Prison for 50 years. During its oral pronouncement of sentence, the court noted that Wright had since admitted that he raped Sierra. Wright\u2019s explanation was that \u2018[s]he had been picking on me earlier, calling me a fucking idiot and a retard. I screwed up.... I was drunk and angry. My anger took over.\u201d During the sentencing hearing, Wright stated on the record that he was \u201csorry to [Sierra] for what I\u2019ve done to her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AqY\">The Due Process Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b282-12\">\u00b617 To place Wright\u2019s argument in context, it is necessary at the outset to set out certain fundamental principles underlying DNA analysis.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>\u00b618 Virtually each one of the trillions of cells in the human body (except for red blood cells) has a nucleus containing DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). Each cell of a particular individual has the same DNA configuration regardless of the cell\u2019s source (i.e., whether from hair, skin, blood, etc.). The significance of DNA for forensic purposes is that, with some exceptions not at issue here, no two individuals have identical DNA configurations.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">\u00b619 The DNA molecule consists of two strands, coiled in the form of a double helix, which looks like a twisted ladder. The sides of the ladder are made up of alternating units of phosphate and sugar. Running between the sugar-phosphate strands are billions of rungs, which are made up of four types of organic bases: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine. Due to their chemical compositions, adenine will only bond with thymine, and cytosine will only bond with guanine. The sequence in which these base pairs (rungs) appear on the DNA ladder determines an individual\u2019s genetic traits. A specific sequence of base pairs that is responsible for a particular trait is called a gene. The position that a gene occupies along the DNA thread is known as its locus.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">\u00b620 Genetically, humans are more alike than dissimilar. Over 99 percent of a human DNA molecule is the same from person to person, creating such shared features as arms and legs. But the remaining regions of human DNA molecules-more specifically, the sequences of base pairs in those regions-vary distinctly from one person to another, which results in individual traits. It is these variable regions, called polymorphisms,\u201d that make it possible to establish identity and differences between individuals. Of the approximately three billion base pairs (ladder rungs) contained in one DNA molecule, only three million (0.1 percent) are thought to be polymorphic.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">\u00b621 If one could analyze the entire length of a DNA strand and compare it to another complete DNA strand, an absolute identification could be provided. There is no practical way, however, to sequence all three billion base pairs in a person\u2019s DNA. Thus, forensic scientists seek to identify individuals through variations in their base-pair sequences at certain polymorphic DNA locations (loci). DNA patterns at polymorphic loci on the evidentiary DNA molecule are compared to DNA patterns at corresponding loci on a reference DNA molecule. If the patterns do not match, then the contributor of the reference DNA can be conclusively excluded as the contributor of the evidentiary DNA. But where the patterns are sufficiently similar such that they could have originated from the same source, further analysis is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>required.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">\u00b622 The reason for this is that it is possible for unrelated individuals to have identical DNA patterns at a given locus. Hence, comparison of only one locus on the evidentiary DNA and the reference DNA would yield an extremely low confidence level that the two DNA samples came from the same person. The confidence level increases as the number of compared loci increases.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Still, because DNA profiles are composed of only a handful of loci out of the m illions that constitute an individual\u2019s entire genetic make-up, these partial profiles are <em>not </em>assumed to be unique, especially among close relatives, and the possibility of coincidental matches and their probabilities must be taken into account.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">\u00b623 \u2018The question properly addressed by the DNA analysis is therefore this: Given that the suspect\u2019s [or, in the present case, the victim\u2019s] known sample has satisfied the \u2018match criteria,\u2019 what is the probability that a person chosen at random from the relevant population would likewise have a DNA profile matching that of the evidentiary sample?\u201d <em>Soto, </em>981 P.2d at 965. This probability is usually expressed as a fractions.e., the probability that one out of a stated number of persons in the population (e.g., 1 out of 100,000) would match the DNA profile of the evidentiary sample in question. <em>Id. </em>A greater probability-i.e., a fraction with a smaller denominator (e.g., 1 out of 10,000)4ncreases the probability that one or more other persons has a DNA profile matching the evidentiary sample. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\u00b624 Accordingly, after profiling a specific number of loci on a strand of DNA, the analyst must obtain, from published tables, the frequencies of variations in genetic material at each tested locus. The frequencies of all the tested loci are then multiplied together (using the \u201cproduct rule\u201d) to obtain the frequency with which that particular profile is seen in various population groups. Without reliable accompanying evidence as to the likelihood that other individuals in a given population could be a match (or could not be excluded as possible contributors), the jury has no way to evaluate the meaning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>the result. <em>Commonwealth v. Mattei, </em>920 N.E.2d 845, 855-56 (Mass. 2010); <em>but see Young, </em>879 A.2d at 52-58 (concluding that if the probability of a random match is sufficiently minuscule (e.g., one in a trillion), then accompanying contextual statistics are not required and the expert may testify to \u201csource attribution\u201d-!, e., that it can be concluded, to a reasonable scientific certainty, the evidentiary sample and the reference sample came from the same person).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">\u00b625 In the present case, Revis examined 16 loci on the DNA of the minor contributor to the penile swab. She compared those to the same 16 loci on Sierra\u2019s reference sample and found that the DNA fragments at all 16 loci \u201cmatched.\u201d This did not mean, however, that it conclusively was Sierra\u2019s DNA on Wright\u2019s penis. Rather, this simply meant that the particular 16 loci matched. Sierra is not necessarily the only human being who has the particular base-pair configurations observed by Revis at each of these 16 loci, though there might be very few other unrelated people who have that same profile. <em>Cf. Young, </em>879 A.2d at 51 (TWlhen a DNA \u2018match\u2019 has been declared, a conclusive identification of a crime suspect as the source of the unknown DNA sample is not being made. Rather, the suspect simply has been \u2018included\u2019 as a possible source of the DNA material, because the suspect\u2019s DNA sample has matched the crime scene DNA sample at a certain number of critical alleles. The issue still remains of just how many other people in the population could share the same DNA profile with the suspect.\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">\u00b626 Thus, Revis had to ascertain the likelihood that the match between Sierra\u2019s DNA and the minor contributor\u2019s DNA was coincidentald.e., the probability that a person chosen at random from the population would likewise have a DNA profile matching the minor contributor\u2019s DNA profile at the same loci.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To that end, Revis\u2019s DNA Report states that she consulted \u201cnational statistics\u201d (specifically, B. Budowle et al., <em>Journal of Forensic Sciences </em>44(6): 1277 (1999)) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>determined that \u201cthe estimated number of unrelated people in a random population expected to have a DNA profile that could be included in this mixed DNA profile\u201d is 1 in 467,700 Caucasians, 1 in 2,351,000 Southwestern Hispanics, and 1 in 3,504,000 African-Americans. These probabilities represent two concepts: (1) the frequency with which the given DNA profile would be expected to appear in a population of unrelated people-in other words, how rare the DNA profile is (rarity statistic)-and (2) the probability of finding a match by randomly selecting one profile from a population of unrelated people (random match probability). <em>Cua, </em>119 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 402. \u2018It is relevant for the jury to know that most persons of at least major portions of the general population could not have left the evidence samples.\u201d <em>People v. Wilson, </em>136 P.3d 864, 869 (Cal. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"AY9H\">\u00b627 The prosecutor, therefore, could have argued here that it was highly unlikely Sierra would have matched the minor DNA profile without actually being the contributor of that DNA. But it was not accurate to state that Revis\u2019s findings conclusively established that Sierra was the minor contributor. Likewise, the suggestion that Wright and Sierra were the only two persons in Montana who could have contributed the DNA to the penile sample was misleading. Probability of a random match does not equate with certainty of a particular source.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">\u00b628 Wright contends that these errors in the presentation of the DNA evidence, and the prosecutor\u2019s corresponding closing arguments, amounted to a due process violation. Citing <em>Napue v. Illinois, </em>360 U.S. 264, 269, 79 S. Ct. 1173, 1177 (1959), and <em>Hayes v. Brown, </em>399 F.3d 972, 984 (9th Cir. 2005) (en banc), he argues that a criminal defendant is denied due process of law when a prosecutor either knowingly presents false evidence or fails to correct the record to reflect the true facts when unsolicited false evidence is introduced at trial. We note that in <em>Hayes, </em>the Ninth Circuit stated that <em>Napue </em>does not create a per se rule of reversal. 399 F.3d at 984. Rather, unless the error is structural,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the defendant must show that the testimony or evidence was actually false, that the prosecution knew or should have known that the testimony or evidence was actually false, and that the false testimony or evidence was material. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">\u00b629  Wright has failed to make this showing. First, the DNA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>evidence presented by the prosecutor was internally inconsistent (and perhaps somewhat confusing to the jury) on certain points, but it is doubtful that it falls into the category of being outright \u201cfalse.\u201d As the State points out, Revis clarified several times that her finding was that Sierra \u201ccannot be excluded\u201d as a possible contributor to the mixed DNA profile. Second, while the prosecutor may have taken some license during direct examination and in her closing arguments, there is no evidence that she \u201cknowingly\u201d presented false testimony. In fact, by her own admission, the prosecutor was \u201cconfused\u201d about how Revis\u2019s findings were to be interpreted. Third, defense counsel clarified with Revis during cross-examination what her precise findings were and pointed out that Sierra\u2019s DNA could have gotten on Wright\u2019s penis for reasons other than rape. Likewise, defense counsel asked the jurors during closing argument to look at Revis\u2019s report and emphasized that \u201ccannot be excluded as a contributor is not the same as [Sierra] is the other contributor.\u201d Thus, the jurors were not left with an entirely uncontested interpretation of the DNA evidence. Finally, the prosecutor\u2019s assertions that Sierra\u2019s DNA actually was on Wright\u2019s penis would be more problematic if those assertions were based solely on Revis\u2019s report. As it is, however, the prosecutor relied on the non-DNA evidence (Sierra\u2019s testimony, her 911 call, the corroborating testimony of other witnesses, and the physical evidence) as well. That evidence was very strong, and it was fair to argue that Revis\u2019s findings, in conjunction with the non-DNA evidence, showed that it was Sierra\u2019s DNA. There does not appear, therefore, to be a reasonable likelihood that the allegedly false testimony could have affected the jury\u2019s judgment. <em>Hayes, </em>399 F.3d at 984.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">\u00b630 In sum, Wright has not demonstrated that his right to due process was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The Ineffective Assistance Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">\u00b631 A convicted defendant making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must show (1) that counsel\u2019s representation was deficient and (2) that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>State v. Norman, </em>2010 MT 253, \u00b6 19, 358 Mont. 252, 244 P.3d 737. Before we may reach the merits of an ineffective assistance claim on direct appeal, we must determine whether the claim is properly before us. <em>State v. Savage, </em>2011 MT 23, \u00b6 23, 359 Mont. 207, 248 P.3d 308. In general, the test to determine whether an ineffective assistance claim is properly brought on direct appeal is whether the record contains the answer to \u201cwhy\u201d counsel took, or failed to take, action in providing a defense. <em>State v. White, </em>2001 MT 149, \u00b6 20, 306 Mont. 58, 30 P.3d 340. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>If the record explains \u201cwhy,\u201d then we will address the issue on direct appeal. <em>Savage, </em>\u00b6 23. But if the claim is based on matters outside the record, then we will dismiss it without prejudice and allow the defendant to raise the claim in a petition for postconviction relief. <em>See e.g. State v. Gunderson, </em>2010 MT 166, \u00b6\u00b6 70-78, 357 Mont. 142, 237 P.3d 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">\u00b632  Here, Wright asserts \u201cthat his trial attorney was ineffective in her challenge to the DNA evidence presented at triaFbecause she \u201cdid not properly cross-examine the State\u2019s expert, or offer expert testimony on Wright\u2019s behalf to counter that presented by the State.\u201d The record, however, does not reveal why trial counsel failed to undertake the actions Wright alleges she should have. Consequently, the claim cannot be resolved on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">\u00b633 We reject Wright\u2019s due process claim. We dismiss, without prejudice, his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and he may pursue that claim through a timely petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"ARo\">\u00b634 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b288-7\">JUSTICES WHEAT, MORRIS, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b282-13\"> The ensuing explanation is derived from the discussions of DNA and DNA analysis in <em>People v.
