We consider the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\u00b62 <em>I. Whether the District Court\u2019s denial of Otten\u2019s motion to dismiss was erroneously premised on an incorrect definition of \u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">\u00b63 <em>II. Whether the District Court erred in denying Otten\u2019s motion to dismiss on the ground that there was insufficient evidence to support the verdict.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">\u00b64 <em>III. Whether the District Court erroneously instructed the jury on the definition ofcinotor vehicle.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">\u00b65 On May 24, 2009, Glasgow police received a call from Josh Thompson, placed from Ezzie\u2019s Wholesale gas station. Thompson told police he had observed Otten pull in to Ezzie\u2019s, fill up his four-wheeler, and speed out of the lot in a \u201cwheelie,\u201d leaving tire marks in the gravel and on the pavement. Thompson recognized Otten as they had previously worked together doing ranch work in the area, and recognized his distinctive gray Yamaha Raptor four-wheeler from numerous previous instances. In response to Thompson\u2019s call, Officer Tyler Edwards arrived at Ezzie\u2019s to talk to Thompson. Thompson again relayed what he had observed, and pointed out the tire marks to Edwards. Edwards took several pictures of the marks, and attempted to find Otten in the few hours remaining before nightfall, but was unsuccessful. Edwards had also known Otten for a number of years, and had seen Otten riding his gray four-wheeler around town numerous times.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">\u00b66 Two days later, Edwards observed Otten riding his four-wheeler near Highway 2. He approached Otten and issued him a Notice to Appear and Complaint that forms the basis of the charge at issue. On October 14, 2009, Otten was convicted in Glasgow City Court for violation of \u00a7 61-11-213, MCA. He appealed the judgment to Valley County District Court. The District Court held a trial in front of a six-person jury on April 29, 2010, after which the jury returned a verdict of guilty on the sole charge. Otten stipulated that he was a habitual traffic offender whose license was revoked on the alleged date of the offense. He disputed only that the State could prove he was operating a motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>vehicle at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">\u00b67 Near the close of trial, Otten moved for a \u201cdirected verdict.\u201d He based this motion on the claim that the State presented insufficient evidence to show that Otten\u2019s four-wheeler met the definition of a motor vehicle in \u00a7 61-l-101(40)(a)(ii), MCA. Otten argued that because subsection (ii) makes specific reference to quadricycles, it alone was available for the State to prove that he was operating a motor vehicle. The State responded, and the court agreed, that the two subsections in the definition were phrased in the disjunctive, and that a four-wheeler such as Otten\u2019s could qualify as a motor vehicle under either \u00a761-1-101(40)(a)(i) or (ii), MCA. In response, Otten maintained that insufficient evidence was presented to convict him under subsection (i) regardless. Otten also objected to the jury instruction incorporating both subsections of the definition on the same basis. The court rejected Otten\u2019s motion and objection to the jury instruction, concluding that sufficient evidence supported the State\u2019s argument that Otten\u2019s four-wheeler met the definition of a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201dunder subsection (i), and that subsection (i) was properly applied to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">\u00b68 On appeal, Otten challenges the District Court\u2019s ruling on his motion and objection to jury instruction resulting from its incorporation of both subsections of \u00a761-1-101(40)(a), MCA, in the definition of\u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d He also contends that insufficient evidence was presented to meet the definition relied upon by the District Court. While Otten and the State both address the sufficiency of evidence presented under subsection (ii), the resolution of these arguments is not necessary to our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">\u00b69 As a preliminary matter, Otten\u2019s motion, framed as a motion for directed verdict of acquittal, is correctly named a \u201cmotion to dismiss for insufficient evidence.\u201d Section 46-16-403, MCA; <em>State v. McWilliams, </em>2008 MT 59, \u00b6 36, 341 Mont. 517, 178 P.3d 121. We review the denial of a motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence <em>de novo. Id. </em>at \u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"AY\">\u00b610 A district court\u2019s decision pertaining to jury instructions is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Goles v. Neumann, </em>2011 MT 11, \u00b6 9, 359 Mont. 132, 247 P.3d 1089. While the district court\u2019s discretion is broad, it is restricted by the overriding principle that jury instructions must fully and fairly instruct the jury regarding the applicable law. The instructions must prejudicially affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights to constitute reversible error. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>State v. Christiansen, </em>2010 MT 197, \u00b6 7, 357 Mont. 379, 239 P.3d 949).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">\u00b611 <em>I. Whether the District Court\u2019s denial of Otten\u2019s motion to dismiss was erroneously premised on an incorrect definition of \u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">\u00b612 Under \u00a7 46-16-403, MCA, a criminal defendant may move to dismiss the action at the close of the prosecution\u2019s evidence or at the close of all evidence where the evidence is insufficient to support a verdict of guilty. The evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, and a grant of the motion is appropriate only if there is not sufficient evidence upon which a rational trier of fact could find the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Cybulski, </em>2009 MT 70, \u00b6 42, 349 Mont. 429, 204 P.3d 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">\u00b613 Otten was charged with operating a motor vehicle while declared to be a habitual traffic offender, a misdemeanor under \u00a761-11-213, MCA. The sole element of the crime for which Otten contends the State\u2019s evidence was insufficient is that he was \u201coperating a motor vehicle.\u201d He argues that the State presented evidence that he was driving a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d only as that term is defined in \u00a7 61-1-101(40)(a)(i), not as defined in \u00a761-l-101(40)(a)(ii), which he contends is the only correct definition. Section 61-1-101, MCA, defines numerous terms used in Title 61, Motor Vehicles. The definition at issue is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-7\">(40) (a) \u2018Motor vehicle\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-8\">(i) a vehicle propelled by its own power and designed or used to transport persons or property upon the highways of the state; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-9\">(ii) a quadricycle if it is equipped for use on the highways as prescribed in chapter 9.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">\u00b614 The District Court heard oral argument on Otten\u2019s motion to dismiss at trial. The parties made substantially the same arguments in open court as they do on appeal. Otten contends that because subsection (ii) specifically applies to quadricycles, subsection (i) cannot be interpreted to also include quadricycles within its definition. Under this analysis, Otten maintains, the State must show that his quadricycle is \u201cequipped for use on the highways as prescribed in chapter 9,\u201d and submitted insufficient evidence at trial to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">\u00b615 The District Court observed that nothing in the legislative history indicates the enactment of subsection (ii), added to the definition in 2007, was meant to exclude quadricycles from qualifying under subsection (i)-as a \u201cvehicle propelled by its own power and designed or used to transport persons or property upon the highways of the state.\u201d Thus, reasoned the court, a quadricycle may fit the definition of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>\u201cmotor vehicle\u201d under either subsection (i) or (ii). The court continued, Ttjherefore, I will consider the whole definition of motor vehicle as outlined in 61-1-101(40) as the definition to apply in this case, and given that consideration, the motion ... is denied.\u201d Otten argues that this language-given that consideration\u201d4ndicates that the court would have granted his motion, were it to have found only subsection (ii) applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">\u00b616 In the construction of a statute, we are simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted. Section 1-2-101, MCA; <em>State ex rel. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Quality v. BNSF Ry. Co., </em>2010 MT 267, \u00b6 52, 358 Mont. 368, 246 P.3d 1037. A statute is to be construed according to its plain meaning, and if the language is clear and unambiguous, no further interpretation is required. <em>State v. Stiffarm, </em>2011 MT 9, \u00b6 12, 359 Mont. 116, 250 P.3d 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">\u00b617  We conclude that the District Court correctly defined \u201cmotor vehicle\u201din this case as incorporating both subsections of \u00a761-1-101(40), MCA. It is clear and unambiguous that a quadricycle meets the definition of \u201ca vehicle propelled by its own power and designed or used to transport persons or property upon the highways of the state.\u201d Section 61-l-101(51)(a), MCA, defining \u201cquadricycle,\u201dspecifically states that a quadricycle is a \u201cmotor vehicle, designed for on-road or off-road use.\u201d The state application for \u201cstreet-legal\u201d quadricycles, such as Otten\u2019s gray Yamaha Raptor, states that it applies to all quadricycles \u201cthat will be operated on highways or roads allowing for vehicular traffic dedicated to public use in the State of Montana.\u201d Furthermore, the definition of \u201cquadricycle\u201d in \u00a761-1-101(51) limits such vehicles to \u201cnot more than 50 horsepower,\u201d and the definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d cannot be logically interpreted to exclude a four-wheeler with a 55 horsepower motor, yet that is what Otten\u2019s interpretation would dictate. Otten\u2019s argument falls short in light of the inescapable applicability of subsection (i) to quadricycles used on public highways. We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a761-1-101(40), MCA, and decline to reverse the court\u2019s denial of Otten\u2019s motion to dismiss on the ground that the court applied an incorrect definition of \u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A5\">\u00b618 <em>II. Whether the District Court erred in denying Otten\u2019s motion to dismiss on the ground that there was insufficient evidence to support the verdict.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">\u00b619 Otten next argues that even under a definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d including both subsections of \u00a761-1-101(40), MCA, the State presented insufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to conclude that Otten\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>vehicle met the definition. We disagree. The State clearly presented sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to conclude that Otten\u2019s vehicle met the definition of a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201dunder subsection (i). Josh Thompson and Officer Tyler Edwards both testified that they saw Otten riding his four-wheeler on public roads, and physical evidence in the form of tire marks also provided evidence of Otten\u2019s operation of the vehicle on public roads. Otten filled out and signed the application to register his four-wheeler as \u201cstreet legal,\u201d to enable its use in transporting persons and property on public highways, and his registration was current on the date of his offense. Both Edwards and Thompson had seen Otten riding his particular gray Yamaha Raptor four-wheeler around town numerous times. This testimony directly supports a determination that the vehicle was \u201cpropelled by its own power,\u201d and was \u201cused to transport persons or property upon the highways of the state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">\u00b620 Otten also frames these arguments in a second light on appeal: that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury verdict. He incorporates by reference the arguments related to his motion to dismiss. Because we conclude that the District Court correctly denied Otten\u2019s motion to dismiss as there was substantial evidence on which a rational trier of fact could find the essential elements of the crime charged, we likewise conclude that sufficient evidence supported the jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">\u00b621 <em>III. Whether the District Court erroneously instructed the jury on the definition of \u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">\u00b622 We review the District Court\u2019s instructions to the jury for abuse of discretion, and to ensure that they fully and fairly instruct the jury regarding the applicable law. <em>Goles, </em>\u00b6 9. Otten makes substantially the same arguments regarding the interpretation of \u00a761-1-101(40), MCA, to support his contention that the District Court erroneously instructed the jury on the definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d by including both subsections (i) and (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">\u00b623  As we have concluded above, the District Court correctly determined that the full statutory definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d was applicable to Otten\u2019s four-wheeler. It therefore correctly instructed the jury to apply the definition in \u00a761-1-101(40), MCA, and did not abuse its discretion in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">\u00b624 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b179-9\">JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON, WHEAT and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
