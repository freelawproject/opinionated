We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AK\">\u00b62 J.R. raises four issues which we have restated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b61-13\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court erred in dismissing J.R.\u2019s claims of</p>\n<p id=\"b61-14\">breach of fiduciary duty and negligence because J.R. did not offer expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-15\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court\u2019s ultimate finding that the conservator appropriately managed J.R.\u2019s assets and estate was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-16\">\u00b65 3. Whether the District Court erred in discharging the conservator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>without liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">\u00b66 4. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in ordering payment of the conservator\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees from the conservatorship\u2019s assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">\u00b67 In May 2006, at the time the conservatorship proceedings in this case began, J.R. was 78 years old. He has five children and three stepchildren. His wife passed away in 2003. J.R.\u2019s daughter Marsha initiated this action when she petitioned the District Court for appointment of a conservator for J.R. She stated in her petition that a conservator was necessary for J.R.\u2019s protection because he suffers from severe short-term memory loss and has been diagnosed as suffering from early Alzheimer\u2019s disease. She further stated that J.R. is no longer capable of understanding his bank or financial statements; that significant funds owned by him have disappeared; and that he is extremely vulnerable to the demands and influences of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">\u00b68 The District Court scheduled a hearing on Marsha\u2019s petition for September 26, 2006. However, shortly before the hearing date, J.R.\u2019s daughter Robin, who opposed the conservatorship action, removed J.R. from Helena and took him to live with her in Massachusetts. Neither J.R. nor Robin notified J.R.\u2019s counsel of J.R.\u2019s move.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">\u00b69 The parties eventually stipulated to a limited conservatorship, and the District Court appointed the first conservator, Cindy Nickol of Capital City Case Management, on November 24, 2006. In March 2007, Nickol filed an Inventory of Conservator showing that the value of J.R.\u2019s assets at that time was more than $290,000. These assets included the condominium in Helena where J.R. had lived for many years, an investment account with D.A. Davidson &amp; Co., and a checking account at Mountain West Bank. Not included in this valuation were any of J.R.\u2019s personal belongings such as the antiques and art work that he and his wife had collected over the years.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">\u00b610 In June 2007, Nickol requested that the court terminate her appointment as conservator because of persistent family interference with the performance of her duties and efforts by various family members to undermine the conservatorship. A hearing on a petition to amend the conservatorship was held on August 17, 2007. Thereafter, the court issued an order allowing Nickol to withdraw as conservator. In her place, the court appointed Joseph Shevlin, a Helena CPA, to act as successor conservator for J.R.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">\u00b611 In its October 3,2007 Order appointing Shevlin, the court stated: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>\u2018Shevlin shall have all powers granted under law to act as conservator, specifically, but not limited to, those powers set forth in [\u00a7\u00a7] 72-5-427 and -428, MCA.\u201dThe court also authorized Shevlin to sell J.R.\u2019s Helena condo and to expend whatever monies were necessary for J.R.\u2019s direct care. The court prohibited Shevlin from providing any money to J.R.\u2019s family members \u201cunless it is for reimbursement for the direct care of [J.R.].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">\u00b612 During his conservatorship, Shevlin arranged for the sale of J.R.\u2019s condo and oversaw the packing and shipping of much of J.R.\u2019s personal property to J.R. in Massachusetts. However, many of the problems that had plagued Nickol throughout her term as conservator persisted throughout Shevlin\u2019s conservatorship. Other relevant facts regarding these and other problems with the conservatorship will be set out more fully where necessary in our discussion of the issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">\u00b613 On June 16, 2009, several of J.R.\u2019s family members, including daughters Robin and Cheryl, J.R.\u2019s brother William and his sister Betty, filed as \u201cInterested Persons\u201d a Petition for Orders Subsequent to Appointment. The petitioners asked the court to transfer the conservatorship to Massachusetts, to implement a trust and long-term-care plan recommended by J.R.\u2019s Massachusetts legal counsel, and to order that Shevlin\u2019s conservatorship fees and attorney\u2019s fees be returned to J.R. because of Shevlin\u2019s failure to properly perform his fiduciary duties. In his response to the petition, Shevlin requested that the court enjoin petitioners from interfering with the performance of his duties. Shevlin also sought clarification from the court regarding portions of its prior order naming him as conservator. The petitioners subsequently amended their petition adding claims of negligence and breach of fiduciary duty against Shevlin.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">\u00b614 On October 19, 2009, J.R. filed a Motion for the Removal of Conservator and Termination of the Conservatorship alleging deficiencies in Shevlin\u2019s performance as conservator. In addition, J.R. pointed out that his assets are dwindling rapidly because of the multiple parties involved in maintaining a long-distance conservatorship.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">\u00b615 These matters were heard by the District Court over three days, February 16, 2010, March 9, 2010, and March 10, 2010. On April 27, 2010, the court entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order wherein the court removed Shevlin as conservator; appointed J.R.\u2019s brother William as successor conservator; approved Shevlin\u2019s accountings; approved the sale of J.R.\u2019s condo; dismissed with prejudice the claims of breach of fiduciary duty and negligence brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>by the petitioners against Shevlin; and ordered payment from the conservatorship\u2019s assets of Shevlin\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees incurred in defending this action. The order further provided that the successor conservator could petition the court for transfer of the conservatorship to Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">\u00b616 J.R. now appeals the District Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">\u00b617 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether those findings are clearly erroneous. <em>In re Estate of Berthot, </em>2002 MT 277, \u00b6 21, 312 Mont. 366, 59 P.3d 1080 (citing <em>In re Eggebrecht, </em>2000 MT 189, \u00b6 18, 300 Mont. 409, 4 P.3d 1207; <em>In re Estate of Bolinger, </em>1998 MT 303, \u00b6 29, 292 Mont. 97, 971 P.2d 767). We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether that court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Berthot, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Issue 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">\u00b618 <em>Whether the District Court erred in dismissing J.R.\u2019s claims of breach of fiduciary duty and negligence because J.R. did not offer expert testimony.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">\u00b619 The District Court dismissed J.R.\u2019s claims of breach of fiduciary duty and negligence against Shevlin because J.R. did not provide expert testimony to establish the standard of care, whether that standard was breached, and whether any such breach caused the injury and damages about which J.R. complained. J.R. argues on appeal that this was error because expert testimony is not required to prove breach of a fiduciary duty; it is only required to prove professional negligence such as in cases of medical malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">\u00b620 Shevlin argues on the other hand that it was necessary for J.R. to present expert testimony because Shevlin, as a CPA, is held to a higher standard of care than an ordinary person and expert testimony is necessary to establish that standard and any breach of that standard. Shevlin further argues that the standard of care may not be inferred, it must be established by expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-11\">\u00b621 Section 72-5-423, MCA, provides that in the exercise of the conservator\u2019s powers, the conservator is to act as a fiduciary and observe the standards of care applicable to trustees as specified in Title 72, chapter 34, part 1. More specifically, under \u00a772-34-114, MCA, a trustee is charged with the duty of administering the trust \u201cwith the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent person would use to accomplish the purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>of the trust as determined from the trust instrument.\u201d In addition, if a trustee has special skills, then the trustee \u2018is held to the standard of the skills represented/\u2019Section 72-34-115, MCA; <em>Redies v. Cosner, </em>2002 MT 86, \u00b6 37, 309 Mont. 315, 48 P.3d 697. Thus, based on $72-5-423 and 72-34-115, MCA, a conservator with special skills also must be held to the standard of the skills represented. <em>See In re Guardianship of Saylor, </em>2005 MT 236, \u00b6 14, 328 Mont. 415, 121 P.3d 532 (\u2018Conservators are thus under the same duties as trustees.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">\u00b622 In addition, this Court noted the following regarding \u201cspecial skills\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-5\">\u2018Professional persons in general, and those who undertake any work calling for special skill, are required not only to exercise reasonable care in what they do, but also to possess a standard minimum of special knowledge and ability. Most of the decided cases have dealt with surgeons and other doctors, but the same is undoubtedly true of dentists, pharmacists, psychiatrists, veterinarians, lawyers, architects and engineers, <em>accountants, </em>abstractors of title, and many other professions and skilled trades.\u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-6\"><em>Carlson v. Morton, </em>229 Mont. 234, 239, 745 P.2d 1133, 1137 (1987) (quoting W. Page Keeton et al., <em>Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 32 (W. Page Keeton ed., 5th ed., West 1984)); <em>see also Romans v. Lusin, </em>2000 MT 84, \u00b6 17, 299 Mont. 182, 997 P.2d 114 (\u2018The Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7229A (1965), provides that \u2018one who undertakes to render services in the practice of a profession or trade is required to exercise the skill and knowledge normally possessed by members of that profession or trade ....\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">\u00b623 In its October 3, 2007 Order wherein the District Court appointed Shevlin as conservator, the court pointed out that it was familiar with Shevlin and noted that not only was Shevlin a CPA, he possessed expertise in the area of estate planning. And later, in its April 27, 2010 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order, the District Court pointed out that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-8\">Shevlin is a Certified Public Accountant practicing in Helena with the firm of Junkermier, Clark, Campanella, Stevens, P.C. (JCCS). Shevlin is a shareholder and member of the JCCS Board of Directors. Shevlin has spen[t] over 35 years working in public accounting. He has extensive experience with tax preparation and supervision. Shevlin also devotes a portion of his practice to estate planning and business consulting. Shevlin spends approximately 41 percent of his chargeable time engaged in professional advisory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>services, including estate planning and long-term financial care plans for the elderly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Clearly the court believed that Shevlin had special skills that the court expected him to use in his fiduciary capacity as conservator of J.R.\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">\u00b624 This Court stated in <em>Carlson </em>that \u201c \u2018[s]ince juries composed of laymen are normally incompetent to pass judgment on questions [regarding what standard to apply when special skills are employed], ... it has been held in the great majority of malpractice cases that there can be no finding of negligence in the absence of expert testimony to support it....\u2019 \u201d <em>Carlson, </em>229 Mont. at 239, 745 P.2d at 1137 (quoting Keeton, <em>Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts </em>at \u00a7 32)).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">\u00b625  Reading \u00a7 72-5-423, MCA, together with \u00a7\u00a7 72-34-114 and - 115, MCA, we conclude that if, as here, a conservator is appointed in reliance on his or her special skills,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> then an alleged breach of fiduciary duty involving those special skills requires expert testimony to establish the standard of care for the exercise of those skills, whether that standard was breached, and whether any such breach caused the injury and damages about which the protected person complains.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">\u00b626  However, even if the conservator possesses special skills, but the alleged breach of fiduciary duty does not involve those skills, but rather, involves only the \u201ccare, skill, prudence, and diligence\u201d that any prudent person would possess, then expert testimony is not required to establish that standard of care inasmuch as the \u201cprudent person\u201d standard is set forth in \u00a7 72-34-114, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">\u00b627  Here, the District Court erred in dismissing J.R.\u2019s claims of breach of fiduciary duty and negligence on the ground that J.R. did not offer expert standard-of-care testimony. J.R.\u2019s allegations did not involve Shevlin\u2019s special skills as a CPA (which would require expert standard-of-care testimony), but rather, were simply that Shevlin failed to exercise the care, skill, prudence, and diligence that any prudent person would possess (a standard of care which does not require expert testimony). On the record before us, however, we conclude that the court\u2019s error was harmless because, as discussed <em>infra, </em>J.R. failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove that Shevlin breached even this lesser, prudent person standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>\u00b628 Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s decision to dismiss J.R.\u2019s claims of breach of fiduciary duty and negligence against Shevlin.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">Issue 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">\u00b629 <em>Whether the District Court\u2019s ultimate finding that the conservator appropriately managed J.R.\u2019s assets and estate was erroneous.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">\u00b630 J.R. claims that the District Court erred in finding that Shevlin\u2019s management of J.R.\u2019s estate was \u201cappropriate\u201d because: (1) the court removed Shevlin as conservator; (2) the court used the wrong standard; (3) Shevlin failed to adequately provide for J.R.; (4) Shevlin failed to file an inventory; (5) Shevlin filed late and inadequate accountings; (6) Shevlin sold some of J.R.\u2019s property to himself, and (7) Shevlin charged exorbitant fees. We address each of J.R.\u2019s assertions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">\n<em>1. Removal of Shevlin as conservator</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AqM\">\u00b631 J.R. contends that the fact that the court removed Shevlin as conservator is \u201cstrong evidence that Shevlin did breach his fiduciary duty.\u201d Contrary to J.R.\u2019s contentions, the District Court determined that because of the continued bickering of J.R.\u2019s children and stepchildren, and the continuing pattern of interference with the conservatorship by Robin, the court believed it to be in the best interests of all parties to appoint J.R.\u2019s brother William as conservator. Thus, Shevlin\u2019s removal as conservator is evidence of nothing more than the lack of cooperation Shevlin received from J.R.\u2019s family.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">\n<em>2. The court\u2019s use of the wrong standard</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AQ-\">\u00b632 The District Court determined that Shevlin\u2019s management of the conservatorship was \u201cappropriate\u201dbecause he did what was ordered by the court in its October 2007 Order. J.R. claims that rather than a standard that Shevlin acted \u201cappropriately,\u201d the correct standard is whether Shevlin failed to use the care, skill and diligence of a prudent person. J.R. also points out that under \u00a772-5-423, MCA, and \u00a7\u00a772-34-114 and -115, MCA, a conservator has the same duty to use any special skills he or she possesses as does a trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">\u00b633 This is the same argument that Shevlin made in Issue 1 with which we expressed our agreement. And, as we indicated in Issue 1, not only did J.R. fail to provide the expert testimony needed to establish that Shevlin breached the standard of care for his special skills as a CPA, J.R. failed to provide sufficient evidence that Shevlin breached the prudent person standard of care. Thus, the District Court\u2019s determination that Shevlin\u2019s management of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>conservatorship was \u201cappropriate\u201d was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">\n<em>3. Failure to provide for J.R.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">\n<em>a. Reimbursement for J.R.\u2019s care</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">\u00b634 J.R. complains that Shevlin failed to provide funds for J.R.\u2019s care, noting that Shevlin only directly provided $2000 to J.R. J.R. cites to \u00a7 72-5-428, MCA, which provides for reimbursement to any person for expenditures for services rendered to a protected person, or when reasonable to expect they will be performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">\u00b635 In its October 3, 2007 Order in this matter, the District Court expressed concern with the amount of money Robin wanted to charge for caring for J.R. in her home. Thus the court stipulated that no money was to be provided to any of J.R.\u2019s family members unless the expenditure was shown to be for J.R.\u2019s direct care.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">\u00b636 Consequently, Shevlin requested that Robin send him copies of various household bills from before J.R. moved in with her so that Shevlin could determine a baseline usage of utilities and other expenses to set an appropriate amount for reimbursement. While Robin provided a few current bills, she refused to provide any past bills. Shevlin would have provided reimbursement to Robin had Robin shown that the expenditures were solely for J.R.\u2019s direct care. But, because of the earlier complaints by other family members, and the District Court\u2019s Order, it was not reasonable for Shevlin to just assume that all money sent to Robin would be used for J.R.\u2019s direct care. And, because Robin moved J.R. to Massachusetts, Shevlin had no other way to verify that the funds he sent would be used for J.R.\u2019s direct care other than through bills and receipts received from Robin or J.R.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">\u00b637 Shevlin did pay J.R.\u2019s monthly credit card bill even though Robin stopped sending receipts for the expenses on the credit card statements. At the hearing in this matter, Robin admitted that she or J.R. had been reimbursed for all of J.R.\u2019s expenses except for $100 for a lamp repair.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">\u00b638 J.R. also complained that he was constantly embarrassed by not having ready cash. Shevlin agreed to send $200 per month if J.R. or Robin would send him the corresponding receipts. This system worked for only a few months before Robin insisted it was too much trouble to keep track of the receipts.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-11\">\n<em>b. Condo rental and sale</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b68-12\">\u00b639 The District Court\u2019s order authorized Shevlin to sell J.R.\u2019s condo. Based on the advice of two Helena real estate agents, Shevlin initially listed the condo at $234,000. Prior to that listing, Shevlin had received a cash offer for the condo at $170,000. Shevlin rejected that offer as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>being below the fair market value of the property. Nevertheless, Shevlin negotiated with the real estate agents to exclude prior potential buyers from the listing agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">\u00b640 One of the real estate agents testified at the hearing that he had difficulties marketing the property due to significant structural problems with the property, problems with the common area around the property, and the slump in the nationwide housing market that began in 2007. The asking price was eventually reduced and the condo sold in December 2009, netting J.R. only $137,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">\u00b641 The District Court noted in its order that \u201c[i]n retrospect, it certainly would have solved a lot of problems if the [initial cash offer] had been accepted. However, that conclusion comes from the application of hindsight some three years after the fact.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a772-34-114(3), MCA (compliance with the prudent investor rule is not to be determined by hindsight).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">\u00b642 J.R. also complains that Shevlin should have rented the condo during the legislative session as J.R. had done in years past. J.R. blames the failure to rent the condo on the fact that Shevlin sold some of J.R.\u2019s furnishings to himself. However, Shevlin pointed out that the legislative session was from January to April, 2009, and neither Robin nor J.R. mentioned renting the condo until the end of 2008, long after a moving van full of J.R\u2019s furniture and personal property was sent to J.R. in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">\u00b643 Furthermore, as Shevlin pointed out, the objective was to sell the condo, and when the condo was put on the market in September 2008, the real estate agents advised Shevl in that it would not show well if it was occupied by renters.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">c. <em>The trust</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">\u00b644 J.R.\u2019s Massachusetts legal counsel, Paula Almgren, recommended that an \u2018intentionally defective grantor trust\u201d be set up for J.R. that would deplete J.R.\u2019s assets and make him eligible for veteran\u2019s benefits of up to $2000 per month and Massachusetts healthcare benefits which would pay up to 60 hours of home health care for J.R. J.R. faults Shevlin for not placing J.R.\u2019s assets into this irrevocable trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">\u00b645 Almgren discussed the trust with Shevlin and provided him with a copy of the trust she proposed. Shevlin rejected the trust because it violated specific terms of the court\u2019s Order. The trust named Almgren and Robin as co-trustees and gave them \u201csole and unfettered discretion\u201d to distribute the entire principal of the trust to Robin and Cheryl during J.R.\u2019s lifetime. Thus, Shevlin had no assurance that the funds in the trust would be used for J.R.\u2019s direct care.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>\n<em>d. VA benefits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">\u00b646 J.R. is a veteran of the United States Navy and is potentially eligible for veteran\u2019s pension benefits. J.R. complains that Shevlin did not seek VA benefits on his behalf. J.R. also faults Shevlin for refusing to fund the trust with J.R.\u2019s assets claiming that it delayed J.R.\u2019s eligibility for receiving VA benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">\u00b647 Shevlin tried to apply for VA benefits for J.R., but the VA does not recognize conservator status without the protected person\u2019s signed consent. Because neither J.R. nor Robin would give Shevlin the necessary authority to communicate with the VA, Shevlin could not proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">\u00b648 J.R. could access his VA benefits once his assets were reduced to $80,000 or less. J.R. faults Shevlin for failing to pay a bill from one of J.R.\u2019s legal counsel, Stefan Wall, in 2007 that would have brought J.R.\u2019s assets below the $80,000 figure. J.R. claims that failing to pay the bill delayed J.R.\u2019s receipt of VA benefits by one year. Contrary to J.R.\u2019s claim, Wall did not submit his bill to Shevlin until June 2008. Along with the bill, Wall sent his apology for failing to deliver it sooner citing the press ofbusiness. Shevlin paid the bill shortly after receiving it.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">\u00b649 The court noted that Robin proceeded to establish eligibility for VA benefits for J.R. and obtained at least one monthly pension payment on J.R.\u2019s behalf in the amount of $1,359. However, Robin placed the check in a special account and refused to provide Shevlin or the court with an accounting of the use of those funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">\n<em>4. Inventory and personal property</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Amm\">\u00b650 Section 72-5-424, MCA, provides that within 90 days of appointment, a conservator is to file with the court a complete inventory of the estate of the protected person. The purpose of the 90-day requirement is to \u2018furnish a means by which the conservator\u2019s management may be checked and the accounts verified.\u201d <em>Redies, </em>\u00b6 20. However, the conservator has \u201cdiscretion in deciding what to include and how to value the items in the estate. A conservator [need not] write down every half bar of soap sitting on a sink.\u201d <em>Redies, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">\u00b651 J.R. complains that an inventory of his personal property was not done by either conservator. Shevlin admits that he did not file an inventory of J.R.\u2019s personal property. And, while Nickol filed an Inventory of Conservator in March 2007, it did not include J.R.\u2019s personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">\u00b652 Nevertheless, Shevlinpointsoutthat J.R.\u2019spersonal property was well known to Robin and that she compiled extensive lists of the items <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>she wanted sent to J.R. in Massachusetts. In fact, Robin testified: T just knew the house very well; I knew everything in each room, and I have photographs.\u201d Shevlin further points out that J.R.\u2019s daughter Cheryl was supposed to help sort and pack J.R.\u2019s personal property, but she contacted him shortly before the movers arrived to inform him that she would not be there. Consequently, Shevlin had to undertake the sorting and packing of J.R.\u2019s personal property on his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">\u00b653 At Robin\u2019s direction, Shevlin shipped most of J.R.\u2019s personal belongings to him in July 2008. He sent the remaining property requested by J.R. and Robin in January 2010. The remainder of the property was to be donated to charity or discarded. The donated property was receipted for tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">\u00b654 We do not condone Shevlin\u2019s failure to file a complete inventory as required by \u00a7 72-5-424, MCA. Here the only property not inventoried was J.R.\u2019s personal property. While Shevlin should have timely performed and filed that inventory, we agree with the trial court that his failure to do so under the facts of this case was not grounds for his removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">\n<em>5. Late and inadequate accountings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AP0\">\u00b655 J.R. complains that the accountings filed by Shevlin were late and that they were inadequate or incomplete. Although the District Court had ordered Shevlin to file annual accountings, he waited until May 14, 2009, more than 19 months after his appointment as conservator, before filing the first accounting. This accounting covered the period from November 5, 2007, through January 5, 2009. The second accounting provided by Shevlin covered the period from January 5, 2009, through January 5,2010, and was filed on February 8,2010. The District Court expressed its disappointment that Shevlin did not file an accounting within one year of his appointment as conservator, but the court pointed out that there was no adverse impact to J.R.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">\u00b656 As to the completeness of the accountings, Shevlin explained that various bank statements and tax returns were not provided to Shevlin by Robin or J.R. so they could not be included. Shevlin did submit independent documentation with the accountings including his work papers supporting each accounting; however, J.R. objected to these documents and they were withdrawn. Nevertheless, the court noted that each of the accountings filed by Shevlin was \u201csupplemented by detailed itemization of receipts and disbursements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">\u00b657 Again, we cannot find fault with the District Court\u2019s determinations based on the facts here.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>\n<em>6. Sale of property to Shevlin</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">\u00b658 J.R. complains that Shevlin bought some of J.R.\u2019s personal property to use in rental properties owned by Shevlin. Shevlin admits that he purchased a few items for fair market value, but that these items were ones that Robin and J.R. told him to discard or to try to sell.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">\u00b659 We agree with J.R. that a conservator has a duty to avoid a conflict of interest, <em>see </em>\u00a7 72-34-105, MCA, and that obtaining this property for Shevlin\u2019s personal use was entirely improper. Nevertheless, as the court stated, J.R. did not introduce any evidence that Shevlin sold the property to himself at less than market value. \u00b660 J.R. also complains that at the time of the hearing, Shevlin was holding some of J.R.\u2019s personal property in Shevlin\u2019s garage. Shevlin points out that these items had to be removed from J.R.\u2019s condo at the time of the condo\u2019s sale and that it was necessary to store the items until he received further instructions from J.R. and Robin on what to do with the items.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">7. <em>Exorbitant fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">\u00b661 J.R. claims that Shevlin paid himself exorbitant fees as conservator for attending to minor details and that he never received any billing statements detailing Shevlin\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">\u00b662 Shevlin billed the conservatorship his regular hourly rate which is determined by JCCS and which ranged from $155 per hour when Shevlin was first appointed conservator to $ 180 per hour when Shevlin was removed as conservator. Shevlin points out that J.R. was a client of JCCS for many years prior to the conservatorship, thus J.R. would have been familiar with JCCS\u2019s billing practices. In addition, the court pointed out that J.R. and Robin hired various counsel throughout the conservatorship proceedings at hourly rates ranging from $ 165 to $225 per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">\u00b663 Contrary to J.R.\u2019s assertion that he never received any billing statements, in their Petition for Orders Subsequent to Appointment filed June 16, 2009, the petitioners, which included Robin, point out various items from Shevlin\u2019s billing statements with which they disagreed. Consequently, it is evident that the billing statements were received. Moreover, many of the fees that J.R. now takes issue with were the fees Shevlin charged for sorting and packing J.R.\u2019s personal belongings. Shevlin testified that although he did bill the conservatorship his normal hourly rate, his billing statements reflect that he did not bill for all of the time spent packing up J.R.\u2019s condo.</p>\n<p id=\"AFX\">\u00b664 Furthermore, J.R. complains on one hand that Shevlin did not do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>enough to inventory and ship J.R.\u2019s personal property, yet on the other hand he complains that Shevlin charged exorbitant fees for doing so. We also note that it would not have been necessary for Shevlin to spend time packing J.R.\u2019s personal belongings if J.R.\u2019s family members had participated in the packing and shipping of J.R.\u2019s personal property as promised.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">\u00b665 Because we have determined that the trial court is in the best position to observe and judge the credibility of witnesses, we do not \u201csecond guess the district court\u2019s determination regarding the strength and weight of conflicting testimony.\u201d <em>Brimstone Mining, Inc. v. Glaus, </em>2003 MT 236, \u00b6 20, 317 Mont. 236, 77 P.3d 175 (quoting <em>Double AA Corp. v. Newland &amp; Co., </em>273 Mont. 486, 494, 905 P.2d 138, 142 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"AIh\">\u00b666  With the exception of Shevlin\u2019s failure to compile an inventory of J.R.\u2019s personal property and the sale of some of J.R.\u2019s personal property to himself, we agree with the District Court that Shevlin substantially complied with the District Court\u2019s Order regarding the conservatorship.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">\u00b667 Accordingly, we hold that the District Court\u2019s ultimate finding that Shevlin appropriately managed J.R.\u2019s assets and estate was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Issue 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">\u00b668 <em>Whether the District Court erred in discharging the conservator without liability.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">\u00b669 Although the District Court found fault with some <em>of </em>the things Shevlin did as conservator, the court determined that they were \u201cminor errors\u201d or \u2018insubstantial\u201d and that Shevlin corrected or compensated for all of them. The court further found that ultimately Shevlin performed his duties as conservator in the manner the court anticipated in its appointment and that the conservatorship had not been damaged through Shevlin\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">\u00b670 J.R. contends on appeal that this was error by the District Court because the very fact that the court removed Shevlin as conservator \u2018implicitly suggests\u201dthat there was \u201cgood cause\u201dfor Shevlin\u2019s removal and, according to J.R., is strong evidence that Shevlin breached his fiduciary duty. Thus J.R. argues that the court should have ordered Shevlin to reimburse J.R. for the fees which Shevlin paid to himself. In support of this proposition, J.R. cites <em>In re Allard, </em>49 Mont. 219, 225, 141 P. 661, 664 (1914) (the conservatorship statute \u201ccontemplates a faithful stewardship. While a mere technical breach of duty which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>does not result in injury to the ward\u2019s estate will not ordinarily justify a court in withholding compensation altogether, a flagrant violation of the duties of the trust will do so.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">\u00b671 Contrary to J.R.\u2019s assertions, the District Court did not remove Shevlin as conservator because he committed a \u2018flagrant violation\u201d of his duties or even that he committed any violation of his duties. Instead, the court pointed to the continued bickering of J.R.\u2019s children and step-children, and the continuing pattern of Robin interfering with the conservator\u2019s efforts devoted to J.R.\u2019s conservatorship, both before and after Shevlin\u2019s appointment, as the reason for Shevlin\u2019s removal. The court stated: \u201cIt seems that some of [J.R.\u2019s] children even refuse to acknowledge the existence of the conservatorship and have failed to cooperate with it. In short, Shevlin was placed in a very difficult situation and did not receive the full cooperation that he should have been entitled to from [J.R.\u2019s] children.\u201d In Shevlin\u2019s place, the court appointed J.R.\u2019s brother William as successor conservator in the hope that he would be better able to work with the parties involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">\u00b672 As to Shevlin\u2019s fees, \u00a772-5-432, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-6\">Compensation and expenses. If not otherwise compensated for services rendered, any visitor, lawyer, physician, conservator, or special conservator appointed in a protective proceeding is entitled to reasonable compensation from the estate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">In this case, the District Court determined, and we agree, that Shevlin\u2019s fees were reasonable as Shevlin\u2019s management of J.R.\u2019s assets and estate was appropriate to provide for J.R.\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">\u00b673  Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in discharging Shevlin without liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">Issue 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">\u00b674 <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion in ordering payment of the conservator\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees from the conservatorship\u2019s assets.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">\u00b675 J.R. argues that this litigation was brought \u2018because of the inexcusable conduct on the part of the conservator ....\u201d Thus, J.R. maintains that because this litigation is completely irrelevant to the proper administration of the conservatorship, he should be reimbursed for the fees paid to Shevlin\u2019s attorneys to defend Shevlin in this case. \u00b676 Shevlin argues on the other hand that because he continued to receive communications from Robin and from J.R.\u2019s Massachusetts counsel that Shevlin interpreted as threatening, it was necessary for Shevlin to employ counsel to advise him regarding the District Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>Order appointing him as conservator and to seek instruction from the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">\u00b677 We review a District Court\u2019s grant or denial of attorney\u2019s fees for an abuse of discretion. <em>Prescott v. Innovative Resource Group, LLC, </em>2010 MT 35, \u00b6 16, 355 Mont. 220, 225 P.3d 1253. This Court has repeatedly held that absent a contractual agreement or statutory provision, the prevailing party in a civil action is not entitled to recover attorney s fees. <em>In re Estate of Berthot, </em>2002 MT 277, \u00b6 55, 312 Mont. 366, 59 P.3d 1080 (citing <em>In re Estate of Dern Family Trust, </em>279 Mont. 138, 154, 928 P.2d 123, 133 (1996); <em>Thompkins v. Fuller, </em>205 Mont. 168, 186, 667 P.2d 944, 954 (1983)). However, this case is one in which statutory provisions governing the awarding of attorney\u2019s fees and costs do exist.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-5\">(3) A conservator, acting reasonably in efforts to accomplish the purpose for which the conservator was appointed, may act without court authorization or confirmation to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-6\">(w) employ persons, including attorneys,... even though they are associated with the conservator, to advise or assist the conservator in the performance of administrative duties ...; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-7\">(x) prosecute or defend actions, claims, or proceedings in any jurisdiction for the protection of estate assets and of the conservator in the performance of the conservator\u2019s duties ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">Section 72-5-427, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">\u00b678  In this case, the District Court found that a large number of Shevlin\u2019s fees and those of his counsel were attributable to the failure of some of J.R.\u2019s children to cooperate with or even recognize the existence of the conservatorship. Thus, contrary to J.R.\u2019s contention that the attorneys fees were used to defend Shevlin, the attorneys fees were expended to protect the conservatorship. Accordingly, we hold that, on that basis, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in ordering that Shevlin\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees be paid from the conservatorship assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">\u00b679 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b75-11\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b66-10\"> While \u00a772-34-115(2), MCA, is framed in terms of a \u2018trustor\u201d appointment, we conclude that a court effectively stands in the shoes of the trustor in appointing a conservator for a protected person-4hat is, in selecting the conservator, the trial court is relying on the special skills of the person to be appointed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
