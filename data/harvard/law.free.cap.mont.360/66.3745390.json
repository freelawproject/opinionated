R. Civ. P. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>59(g) to amend the final parenting plan by striking the provision requesting alternative dispute resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">\u00b62 Pursuant to this Court\u2019s order to seal the record in this case, we have limited any reference to sensitive confidential information in the following factual summary and include those facts necessary to our analysis of the issue presented. Petitioner Heidi Hendershott and respondent Jesse Westphal were married in 1999, in Flathead County, Montana, where they resided throughout their marriage. Heidi filed a petition for dissolution and proposed parenting plan in 2007. Prior to filing for dissolution, Heidi obtained an order of protection against Jesse. Heidi\u2019s proposed parenting plan sought to allow Jesse supervised visits with the parties\u2019 two children at the Nurturing Center in Kalispell until Jesse worked his way to age appropriate visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">\u00b63 Heidi\u2019s affidavit in support of an interim parenting plan described \u2018increasing levels\u201d of physical and emotional abuse to which she could no longer subject herself or their children. Heidi alleged Jesse would frequently become enraged and had trouble controlling his anger. Heidi also alleged that their children had witnessed his actions and started to justify Jesse\u2019s behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">\u00b64 The District Court approved Heidi\u2019s proposed parenting plan as an interim parenting plan and set a hearing on the order of protection and the parenting plan. After hearing from both parties, the District Court modified the plan and granted Jesse age appropriate visitation. The court ordered that the order of protection remain in effect and be modified only to account for visitation. The court also ordered that an independent parenting plan evaluation be conducted by Dr. Edward Trontel.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">\u00b65 Heidi refused to meet with Jesse during Dr. Trontel\u2019s evaluation, which Dr. Trontel claimed \u201cperturbed\u201d his examination process. Dr. Trontel ultimately opined that \u2018there is no way to conclude, with absolute certainty, that serious endangerment is nonexistent. However, there is no empirical foundation to conclude with reasonable confidence that Mr. Westphal poses a serious danger to Ms. Westphal or her children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">\u00b66 On December 7, 2007, Heidi also underwent an evaluation by Dr. Christine Fiore, a Licensed Clinical Psychologist. Dr. Fiore opined that difficulty in Heidi\u2019s marriage, with ongoing traumatic experiences, has resulted in post traumatic stress disorder. Dr. Fiore explained that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>post traumatic stress disorder is a diagnosis commonly found in women who experience ongoing emotional or other abuse in their relationships. Dr. Fiore further concluded that continued contact with Jesse would exacerbate Heidi\u2019s symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">\u00b67 On March 3, 2008, the parties stipulated to a new interim parenting plan. By agreement, the order of protection entered against Jesse was dismissed. The stipulated interim parenting plan identified an exchange point for the children and allowed for either parent to request the presence of law enforcement. It further stipulated that Heidi and Jesse would only communicate through a written parenting journal. The stipulated plan omitted any provision for the mediation of disputes over the parenting plan. As part of the new interim parenting plan, Heidi and Jesse agreed to undergo a supplemental parenting evaluation by Dr. Paul Silverman, a Licensed Clinical Psychologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">\u00b68 Heidi consistently requested that an officer of the Kalispell Police Department be present during child exchanges. After the Kalispell Police Department complained of Heidi\u2019s frequent request for \u201cstand by\u201d officers, Heidi, with the assistance of her family, hired uniformed security guards to accompany her. After the children\u2019s visits with Jesse, Heidi claimed the children were timid and uncomfortable.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">\u00b69 On December 26, 2008, Dr. Silverman completed a parenting plan evaluation of J esse, Heidi, and the children. Dr. Silverman opined that \u201c[d]etermining whether Jesse was abusive during their marriage is extremely difficult and the truth may only be known by Jesse and Heidi.\u201d Dr. Silverman did note that Heidi\u2019s alleged abuses included constant put downs and rages and that Jesse would tell Heidi he owned her body and she should do what he wants her to do. However, Dr. Silverman concluded that these allegations, as well as other observations of Jesse\u2019s behavior, led him to question whether abuse actually was occurring or if Heidi\u2019s allegations were merely her own interpretations of Jesse\u2019s behavior. Dr. Silverman noted that Jesse agreed he had not been a \u2018Godly husband\u201d and acted towards Heidi in a way that contributed to the end of their marriage. While Dr. Silverman did not find evidence of physical or sexual abuse, he found Jesse to be insensitive and intolerant of others, that he had difficulty managing his anger, and that he viewed the relationship in a traditional male-dominated manner. Dr. Silverman also noted Heidi was inhibited socially, had low self esteem, and suffered from stress and anxiety which caused physical symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">\u00b610 Dr. Jennifer Robohm, a Licensed Clinical Psychologist and Heidi\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>individual therapist, responded to Dr. Silverman\u2019s Parenting Evaluation Report with a number of concerns about Dr. Silverman\u2019s methodology and observations. Dr. Robohm specifically noted that even though Heidi had been seeing her for six months, Dr. Silverman did not consult Dr. Robohm for her impressions. She further explained that many of the anecdotes Heidi shared with Dr. Silverman were consistent with experiences of abuse victims but were not included in his report.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">\u00b611 On February 28, 2009, Dr. Robert Geffner, a Licensed Psychologist, reviewed Dr. Silverman\u2019s report and completed a forensics consultation. Dr. Geffner noted that Dr. Silverman\u2019s report failed to account for the children\u2019s problematic behavior before or after visits with Jesse or Jesse\u2019s difficulty managing his anger. Dr. Geffner also noted many red flags for potential abuse, including power and control issues he claimed were disregarded by Dr. Silverman. Dr. Geffner concluded Heidi displayed many behaviors and traits of an abused woman and recommended Jesse undergo psychotherapy with an abuse specialist.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">\u00b612 At trial, both Heidi and Jesse presented testimony regarding Heidi\u2019s abuse allegations. The District Court heard testimony from Heidi, Jesse, Dr. Trontel, Dr. Silverman, Dr. Fiore, Dr. Robohm, and Dr. Geffner, among others.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">\u00b613 Heidi testified, as she told Dr. Silverman, that Jesse believed her body belonged to him, not to her, and that he expected her to do whatever he said. Heidi stated she lived in fear of Jesse. Heidi\u2019s counsel also presented a letter, written by Jesse, which read, in part, Ti]t is so dumb because I don\u2019t want to control you or dominate you or abuse you or manipulate you, but that\u2019s what I have done, but I sure couldn\u2019t see it.\u201d Upon questioning Jesse stated, <em>\u201c\u00cd </em>could see places where, yes, I could be viewed as a controlling person or a manipulative person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">\u00b614 On January 13, 2010, the District Court issued a decree of dissolution, along with findings of fact regarding Heidi\u2019s abuse allegations. The court reviewed the opinions of the trial witnesses and stated, \u201c[t]he Court finds that Dr. Silverman was the only professional person who performed and completed a parenting evaluation and that his final evaluation followed accepted standards which support his conclusions and recommendations.\u201d The court summarized Dr. Silverman\u2019s recommendations, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-8\">Communication between Petitioner and Respondent concerning the children should be accomplished by the existing journal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>email, or any other method agreeable to both parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-4\">With no direct contact by the parents, medical information should be shared by the parties but actual appointments attended by only the parent who scheduled the appointment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-5\">Child exchanges between the parties should take place in the vicinity of the parties\u2019 residences through neutral third parties with no direct contact between Petitioner and Respondent....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">\u00b615 The District Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-7\">[I]t is in the best interests of the parties\u2019 children to continue, as a final parenting plan, the previously approved Interim Parenting Plan of March, 2008. The children are to reside primarily with Petitioner with Respondent having parenting time as indicated in the Interim Plan.... With the exception of the recommendation by Dr. Silverman that parenting time be increased... the Court finds that Dr. Silverman\u2019s other recommendations, listed above, as to direct contact, exchanges, communication between the parents, phone contact, public school, and medical appointments, are in the best interests of the children and are to be incorporated in the parties\u2019 final parenting plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">\u00b616 The court directed Jesse\u2019s counsel to prepare a final parenting plan based on the court\u2019s findings. Heidi objected to Jesse\u2019s proposed parenting plan on the ground that, pursuant to \u00a740-4-301(2), MCA, the final parenting plan should not include a mandatory mediation provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">\u00b617 The District Court ultimately approved and ordered a final parenting plan. The plan specified that communication between the parties be with \u201cno direct contact\u201d and that \u201call non-emergency communication between mother and father should be accomplished in writing.\u201d Section IV of the final parenting plan included the following requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-10\">If not resolvable between the parties themselves, disputes concerning issues addressed in this Plan, other than as to child support, shall be submitted to a mediator (e.g. counselor, attorney) agreed upon by both parties. Any mediation should be structured to avoid direct contact by the parties, either with separate sessions or submission in writing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-11\">Heidi then moved under M. R. Civ. P. 59(g) to alter the District Court\u2019s judgment and final parenting plan, pursuant to \u00a740-4-301(2), MCA, by striking the alternative dispute resolution provision. Heidi argued it would be an abuse of discretion for the District Court to disregard \u00a740-4-301(2), MCA. Heidi cited expert testimony from trial, the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>acknowledgment of the risks in ordering the parties to communicate in writing, and her own testimony that Jesse was \u201cemotionally controlling\u201d and that being forced to meet with him made her fearful and nervous. Jesse contended mediation was appropriately included in the final parenting plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">\u00b618 The District Court denied Heidi\u2019s motion. Heidi now appeals, claiming error in the court\u2019s imposition of mandatory alternative dispute resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">\u00b619 We review for correctness a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of statutes. <em>Kulstad v. Maniaci, </em>2009 MT 326, \u00b6 50, 352 Mont. 513, 220 P.3d 595.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">\u00b620 This case requires the interpretation of \u00a740-4-301, MCA, a matter of first impression for our Court. When interpreting a statute, we look first to the plain meaning of its words. <em>Marriage of Christian, </em>1999 MT 189, \u00b6 12, 295 Mont. 352, 983 P.2d 966. This Court operates under the presumption that the Legislature does not pass meaningless legislation, and we will harmonize statutes relating to the same subject in order to give effect to each statute. <em>State v. Brendal, </em>2009 MT 236, \u00b6 18, 351 Mont. 395, 213 P.3d 448. We also presume the Legislature acts with deliberation and full knowledge of all existing laws on a subject. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">\u00b621 Section 40-4-301(1), MCA, grants a district court the discretion to require parties to participate in mediation of a family law proceeding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdB\">The district court may at any time consider the advisability of requiring the parties to a proceeding under this chapter to participate in the mediation of the case. Any party may request the court to order mediation. If the parties agree to mediation, the court may require the attendance of the parties or the representatives of the parties with authority to settle the case at the mediation sessions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">Heidi first argues that this section allows the court to order mediation only where both parties consent. We disagree. The first sentence of the statute plainly gives the court authority to <em>require </em>mediation. In the alternative, a party may <em>request </em>mediation or both parties may <em>agree </em>to mediation. In the event mediation occurs by agreement of the parties, the court nonetheless may <em>require </em>attendance of certain persons at the mediation. Subsection (1) does not limit the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>ability to order mediation. Because we find the statute to be plain, unambiguous, direct and certain, the statute speaks for itself and there is no need to resort to extrinsic means of interpretation. <em>Christian, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">\u00b622 However, \u00a7 40-4-301(2), MCA, makes an explicit exception to court-ordered mediation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-5\">The Court may not authorize or permit continuation of mediated negotiations if the court has reason to suspect that one of the parties or a child of a party has been physically, sexually, or emotionally abused by the other party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">This subsection\u2019s plain language prohibits court-ordered mediation where there is a reason to suspect abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">\u00b623 Jesse argues that subsection (2) of \u00a740-4-301, MCA, is in conflict with the final parenting plan criteria listed in \u00a7 40-4-234, MCA. Section 40-4-234(4), MCA, states \u201c[t]he Court may in its discretion order the parties to participate in a dispute resolution process to assist in resolving any conflicts between the parties regarding adoption of the parenting plan.\u201d While \u00a7 40-4-234(4), MCA, invokes the court\u2019s discretion to order mediation, it does not <em>require </em>a court to include an alternative dispute resolution provision in a parenting plan and is silent on the subject of mediation in instances of domestic abuse. Section 40-4-301(2), in contrast, prohibits mediation in all family law matters if there is reason to suspect abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">\u00b624 \u2018Reason to suspect\u201d sets a minimal standard that the legislature expressly considered and included in the law. Section 40-4-301, MCA, was enacted in 1993. <em>See </em>1993 Mont. Laws ch. 199, sec. 1. During the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s discussion of the bill, Senator Halligan, the bill\u2019s sponsor, stated the \u201creason to suspect\u201d standard was used because it was lower than probable cause and consistent with doctor and teacher standards for investigating abuse. Mont. S. Jud. Comm., <em>Executive Action on SB 117, </em>53rd Reg. Sess. 2 (Jan. 25, 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">\u00b625 The Senate Judiciary Committee also added evidence of \u201cemotional abuse\u201d as a specific reason to prohibit court-ordered mediation. <em>See </em>Mont. S. Stand. Comm. Rpt., 1993 Legis., 53rd Reg. Sess. 1 (Jan. 26, 1993). Senator Halligan explained that a reason to suspect emotional abuse should prohibit mediation due to the significant difficulties in mediating a conflict where one person is intimidated by another. Mont. S. Jud. Comm., <em>Executive Action on SB 117, </em>53rd Reg. Sess. 2 (Jan. 25, 1993). Given the plain language of the statute, together with its legislative history, it is clear the Legislature intended \u00a740-4-301(2), MCA, as an absolute bar to mediation where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>the court finds a reason to suspect abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">\u00b626 Our interpretation finds support in the legislative history of \u00a740-4-234, MCA, enacted in 1997. <em>See </em>1997 Mont. Laws ch. 343, sec. 19. In that legislation, the Legislature sought to neutralize the terminology used in parenting determinations and to provide direction for parenting plans, including specific provisions in the best interest of the child. <em>See generally </em>1997 Mont. Laws ch. 343. Section 40-4-234(4), MCA, was specifically added to encourage mediation because mediation is an effective approach to creating and enforcing parenting plans. <em>See </em>Mont. H. Jud. Comm., <em>Hearing on HB 231, </em>55th Reg. Sess., ex. 5 (Jan. 29, 1997); see <em>also </em>Laurel Wheeler, <em>Mandatory Family Mediation and Domestic Violence, </em>26 S. Ill. U.L.J. 559, 563 (2002) (citing Sarah R. Cole, et al., <em>Mediation: Law, Policy and Practice, </em>\u00a7 12:2, 122-23 (2d ed., West 2002)). However, the basic rules, assumptions, and goals of mediation are undermined in those particular cases when the parties have a history of domestic violence. David Frazee, Ann M. Noel, and Andrea Brenneke, <em>Violence Against Women: Law and Litigation, </em>\u00a716:45, 16-60 (West 1998) (when there is evidence of violence, mediation is not effective because the parties have unequal bargaining power); <em>accord </em>Andree G. Gagnon, <em>Ending Mandatory Divorce Mediation for Battered Women, </em>15 Harv. Women\u2019s L.J. 272, 272-92 (1992); Leigh Goodmark, <em>Alternative Dispute Resolution and the Potential for Gender Bias, </em>39 Judges\u2019 J. 21, 22 (Spring 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\u00b627 The legislative history indicates the Legislature was aware of these concerns and did not intend the law to require alternative dispute resolution provisions without regard to domestic abuse. The title of the 1997 Act stated that the bill provided \u201can option for dispute resolution or mediation except in cases of proven child or spousal abuse.\u201d 1997 Mont. Laws ch. 343, sec. 1. \u2018Consideration of the title of the Act through which the statute was introduced is a necessary first step in the search for the purpose and meaning of the statute.\u201d <em>Montana Dep\u2019t of Nat. Resources &amp; Conserv. v. Clark Fork Logging Co., </em>198 Mont. 494, 496, 646 P.2d 1207, 1208 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">\u00b628 By allowing a court discretion to include a mediation provision in a parenting plan, the Legislature merely encouraged practitioners and courts to consider alternative dispute resolution for future conflicts. The discretionary language of \u00a7 40-4-234, MCA, as well as the legislative history, make clear the Legislature did not seek to override the exception in \u00a740-4-301(2), MCA, to mediation of parenting conflicts in instances of abuse. We therefore conclude that \u00a740-4-234(4), MCA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>and \u00a740-4-301(2), MCA, are not in conflict. Instead, both provisions afford court discretion in ordering mediation, unless there is reason to suspect emotional, physical, or sexual abuse in the relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">\u00b629 Heidi relied on \u00a7 40-4-301(2), MCA, in requesting the District Court to strike the alternative dispute resolution provision contained in the parenting plan. She argued the law specifically prohibits the alternative dispute resolution provision because her testimony and the testimony of many professionals at trial established that Heidi and Jesse have an emotionally abusive relationship. Heidi referenced testimony that she suffers from post traumatic stress disorder and fears interacting with Jesse. Dr. Robohm, Dr. Fiore, and Dr. Silverman all testified that Heidi would be significantly traumatized by forced interaction with Jesse. Although Jesse admitted to controlling and dominating Heidi during their marriage and to having trouble controlling his anger, he denied abuse and urged the court to include mandatory mediation in the parenting plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">\u00b630 In its final decree, the District Court reviewed the various experts\u2019 testimony and concluded that Dr. Silverman was the only professional person who performed a complete parenting evaluation. The court\u2019s adoption of nearly all of Dr. Silverman\u2019s recommendations indicates it found his testimony credible. While the court noted the conflicting evidence of abuse, it did not find whether there was \u201creason to suspect\u201d that either physical, sexual or emotional abuse was present in the relationship. In its post-decree order denying Heidi\u2019s motion to strike the alternative dispute resolution provision from the proposed final parenting plan, the District Court did not discuss its factual findings, Jesse\u2019s admission of controlling and dominating behavior, Heidi\u2019s post traumatic stress disorder, or other evidence presented at trial. Instead, the District Court attempted to accommodate Heidi\u2019s concerns and other no-contact provisions of the parenting plan by requiring that \u201c[a]ny mediation should be structured to avoid direct contact by the parties.\u201dSection 40-4-301(2), MCA, however, does not afford discretion to design a special mediation procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">\u00b631  In construing and applying statutes, courts are not at liberty to \u2018insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. We conclude that \u00a740-4-301(2), MCA, explicitly prohibits courts in family law proceedings from authorizing or continuing mediation of any kind where there is a reason to suspect emotional, physical, or sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">\u00b632  We therefore hold that the District Court erred as a matter of law by failing to apply \u00a7 40-4-301(2), MCA. The statute does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>require proof of abuse by clear and convincing evidence, a preponderance of the evidence, or even probable cause, but simply a \u201creason to suspect.\u201d Jesse\u2019s admission in writing and at trial, the testimony of Dr. Silverman, which the District Court found credible, and other evidence presented at trial provide sufficient evidence of reason to suspect that Heidi and Jesse\u2019s relationship was emotionally abusive. By the express language of \u00a740-4-301(2), MCA, alternative dispute resolution may not be mandated in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">\u00b633 As a final matter, we note that while the plain language of \u00a740-4-234(4), MCA, does not undermine \u00a7 40-4-301(2), MCA, a slightly different prohibition on mediation is reflected in \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA. That section, governing the process for amending a parenting plan, states that \u201cexcept in cases of <em>physical </em>abuse or threat of physical abuse ... the court may, in its discretion, order the parties to participate in a dispute resolution process to assist in resolving any conflicts ... regarding amendment of the parenting plan.\u201d Section 40-4-219(9), MCA (emphasis added). While this case does not call for the application of \u00a740-4-219, MCA, the Legislature may wish to consider the potential conflict between its reference to physical abuse and the more expansive reference to abuse in \u00a740-4-301(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\u00b634 We reverse and remand to the District Court with instructions to strike Section IV, the alternative dispute resolution provision, from the final parenting plan, and for appropriate modification of other provisions in the plan that make reference to Section IV.</p>\n<judges id=\"b105-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
