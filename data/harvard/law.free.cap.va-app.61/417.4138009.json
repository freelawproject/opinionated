Doulgerakis, appellant, was convicted, in a bench trial, of misdemeanor possession of a concealed weapon in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308. On appeal, he argues that because the handgun was being possessed within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-308(B)(10), his possession of the gun was legal. For the reasons that follow, we reverse his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-14\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b462-15\">The facts are not in dispute. On October 28, 2011, Officer L.C. Jones of the Henrico County Police Department stopped appellant for a traffic violation. Officer Jones asked appellant if he had anything in his glove box to cause him concern. Appellant responded that he had a handgun in the glove compartment. The glove box was closed and latched, but not locked. Officer Jones removed the handgun and charged appellant with carrying a concealed weapon without a permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Code \u00a7 18.2-308 makes it unlawful for particular individuals to carry a firearm concealed from common observation. However, subsection (B)(10) of the statute creates an exception by excluding the concealed weapon prohibition from \u201cany person who may lawfully possess a firearm and is carrying a handgun while in a personal, private motor vehicle or vessel and such handgun is secured in a container or compartment in the vehicle or vessel.... \u201d It is uncontested that the vehicle in question is a personal, private motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">At trial, the Commonwealth argued that the firearm was not \u201csecured\u201d within the meaning of the statute because the gun was readily accessible to appellant for prompt and immediate use, which is precisely what the concealed weapon statute prohibits. The trial court agreed with the Commonwealth\u2019s reasoning and found appellant guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">The sole issue on appeal is whether a firearm in an unlocked, but latched, glove box of a private vehicle is \u201csecured in a container or compartment\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-308(B)(10). Appellant argues that it is, and the Commonwealth agrees, conceding error.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">On brief, the Commonwealth explains that because of the precise wording of the statute, a handgun need not be in a locked glove compartment to be exempt from the concealed weapon prohibition. Generally speaking, \u201cwe are not bound by concessions of law by the parties.\u201d <em>Epps v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 687, 703, 626 S.E.2d 912, 919 (2006) <em>(en </em>banc); <em>see also Logan v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 168, 172, 622 S.E.2d 771, 773 (2005) <em>(en banc). </em>Here, however, we agree with the Commonwealth\u2019s concession.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">\u201cStatutory interpretation is a question of law which we review <em>de novo, </em>and we determine the legislative intent from the words used in the statute, applying the plain meaning of the words unless they are ambiguous or would lead to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>absurd result.\u201d <em>Wright v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 754, 759, 685 S.E.2d 655, 657 (2009). The Virginia Supreme Court has long held that \u201cwhen analyzing a statute, we must assume that \u2018the legislature chose, with care, the words it used ... and we are bound by those words as we interpret the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>City of Virginia Beach v. ESG Enters., </em>243 Va. 149, 153, 413 S.E.2d 642, 644 (1992) (quoting <em>Barr v. Town &amp; Country Properties, </em>240 Va. 292, 295, 396 S.E.2d 672, 674 (1990)). \u201c Where the legislature has used words of a plain and definite import the courts cannot put upon them a construction which amounts to holding the legislature did not mean what it has actually expressed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tazewell County Sch. Bd. v. Brown, </em>267 Va. 150, 162, 591 S.E.2d 671, 676-77 (2004) (citation omitted). However, \u201c[ljanguage is ambiguous if it admits of being understood in more than one way or refers to two or more things simultaneously. An ambiguity exists when the language is difficult to comprehend, is of doubtful import, or lacks clearness and definiteness.\u201d <em>Brown v. Lukhard, </em>229 Va. 316, 321, 330 S.E.2d 84, 87 (1985) (citations omitted). In addition, \u201cpenal statutes are to be construed strictly against the [Commonwealth and] cannot be extended by implication, or be made to include cases which are not within the letter and spirit of the statute.\u201d <em>Wade v. Commonwealth, </em>202 Va. 117, 122, 116 S.E.2d 99, 103 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The term \u201csecured\u201d can have several different meanings. The statute does not define the level of security required of the compartment, whether it be locked, fastened, or simply closed. Because \u201csecured\u201d is ambiguous in the context of this particular statute, we are permitted to look to the legislative history of Code \u00a7 18.2-308 to determine its meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">In 2010, the General Assembly enacted subsection (B)(10) of the amendment exempting the prohibition of concealed handguns from personal vehicles in certain circumstances. History of that amendment indicates that the General Assembly specifically chose to omit the term \u201clocked\u201d from the statute. Initially, the General Assembly adopted the amendment that contained the language that a gun must be \u201clocked in a container or compartment\u201d within the vehicle. However, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Governor\u2019s recommended change to the amendment replaced the word \u201clocked\u201d with \u201csecured.\u201d <em>Journal of the House of Delegates </em>1658-59, Reg. Sess. (2010). In accepting the Governor\u2019s proposed change, the legislature made it clear that in this amendment, \u201csecured\u201d does not mean \u201clocked.\u201d Had the legislature intended for \u201csecured\u201d and \u201clocked\u201d to be synonymous, they would have disregarded the Governor\u2019s recommendation and adopted the amendment as originally written. Thus, under the facts presented here, we find that having the gun in a <em>locked </em>glove compartment is not a prerequisite for applying the Code \u00a7 18.2-308(B)(10) exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The Supreme Court of Virginia, in <em>Schaaf v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 429, 258 S.E.2d 574 (1979), explained the rationale of the concealed weapon statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-6\">\u201cThe purpose of the statute was to interdict the practice of carrying a deadly weapon about the person, concealed, and yet so accessible as to afford prompt and immediate use. \u2018About the person\u2019 must mean that it is so connected with the person as to be readily accessible for use or surprise if desired.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 430, 258 S.E.2d at 574-75 (quoting <em>Sutherland v. Commonwealth, </em>109 Va. 834, 835-36, 65 S.E. 15, 15 (1909)).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">The legislature, by adopting the exception relevant here, determined that a weapon \u201csecured in a container or compartment in the vehicle\u201d was not \u201creadily accessible for use or surprise if desired.\u201d <em>See Uniwest Constr., Inc. v. Amtech Elevator Servs., Inc., </em>280 Va. 428, 440, 699 S.E.2d 223, 229 (2010) (\u201cThe public policy of the Commonwealth is determined by the General Assembly, for \u2018it is the responsibility of the legislature, not the judiciary, ... to strike the appropriate balance between competing interests.... Once the legislature has acted, the role of the judiciary is the narrow one of determining what [it] meant by the words it used in the statute.\u2019 \u201d (alteration and omissions in original) (quoting <em>Dionne v. Southeast Foam Converting &amp; Packaging, Inc., </em>240 Va. 297, 304, 397 S.E.2d 110, 114 (1990))).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>That being said, our inquiry becomes one of defining \u201csecure\u201d as contemplated by the General Assembly within the meaning of the statute. \u201cSecured\u201d is defined as \u201cin safekeeping or custody,\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s New Universal Unabridged Dictionary </em>1641 (2d ed.1983), or \u201cwell-fastened,\u201d <em>The American Heritage Dictionary </em>1173 (New College Ed.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The evidence here shows that appellant\u2019s handgun was in a closed, latched and \u201cwell-fastened\u201d glove compartment. Pursuant to the statute, appellant\u2019s gun was \u201csecured in a ... compartment\u201d in his vehicle, thus reducing his access to the weapon. Because appellant\u2019s handgun was in compliance with the exception to the concealed weapon prohibition, his possession of the gun did not violate Code \u00a7 18.2-308.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse and dismiss appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
