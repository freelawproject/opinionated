Hamad appeals a final divorce decree awarding 60% of the marital assets to her husband. Finding no reversible error in the trial court\u2019s decision, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">On appeal, \u201cwe view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, granting it the benefit of any reasonable inferences.\u201d <em>White v. White, </em>56 Va.App. 214, 216, 692 S.E.2d 289, 290 (2010) (quoting <em>Congdon v. Congdon, </em>40 Va.App. 255, 258, 578 S.E.2d 833, 835 (2003)). \u201cThat principle requires us to discard the evidence of the appellant which conflicts, either directly or inferentially, with the evidence presented by the appellee at trial.\u201d <em>Owens v. Owens, </em>41 Va.App. 844, 848-49, 589 S.E.2d 488, 491 (2003) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">So viewed, the evidence before the trial court showed that Yasmine S. Hamad (wife) and Sammy N. Hamad (husband) married in 1982. In 2009, they each filed complaints seeking a divorce. They agreed to a no-fault divorce and submitted to the trial court their requests for equitable distribution and attorney fees. Relying entirely upon depositions and exhibits, neither presented any <em>ore tenus </em>evidence for the court to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">The trial court reviewed the evidence, read the parties\u2019 memoranda, and heard oral argument. The court thereafter issued a detailed letter opinion addressing equitable distribution and attorney fees. The issues on appeal involve the distribution of several liquid asset accounts in the joint names of husband and his mother: a Scottrade account, a Janus account, an Edward Jones account, a Peoples Advantage account, and an EVB Certificate of Deposit. The court determined the value of each account and identified the separate and marital portions of the Scottrade and Janus accounts. All of the account values derived directly from account statements introduced as joint exhibits. The parties presented no other valuation evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">The trial court then addressed the distribution factors under Code \u00a7 20-107.3. The court considered wife\u2019s admitted adultery during husband\u2019s departure of \u201cnearly four years\u201d from the marital home. App. at 1664. The court noted husband\u2019s assertion that wife\u2019s infidelity caused the marriage to dissolve, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>as well as wife\u2019s excuse that she was \u201clonely\u201d during her husband\u2019s absence. <em>Id. </em>The court also took into account the significant contributions made to the marriage by both parties. Based upon this evidence, the court distributed 60% of the marital assets to husband and 40% to wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Dissatisfied with the court\u2019s explanation for the 60/40 division, wife filed a \u201cMotion for Clarification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1666. Among other things, wife contended the 60/40 division was inconsistent with \u201cwhat appears to be a favorable discussion of [wife\u2019s] side of the case,\u201d and speculated that perhaps \u201cthe figures were merely reversed\u201d by inadvertence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">At the hearing on the motion, wife\u2019s counsel requested that the trial court further clarify the 60/40 division ratio. Wife\u2019s counsel expressed his desire \u201cto stress to the Court\u201d that he was not \u201casking for a rehearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1674. Rather, counsel simply \u201cwanted to make sure there wasn\u2019t a two percent chance that the Court didn\u2019t somehow in drafting the letter, switch those percentages,\u201d given the court\u2019s \u201cquite favorable\u201d remarks about wife in the letter opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 1678-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">From the bench, the court assured wife\u2019s counsel that the 60/40 split in husband\u2019s favor was not a clerical error. The court made no mention of wife\u2019s adultery in its clarification, but identified another consideration not mentioned in the letter opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-8\">With regard to the 60/40 split, the method that the Court used in evaluating the respective equities of the parties, quite frankly I thought that the defendant failed in tracing many of the assets. And therefore, they became either hybrid or marital assets?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-9\">On the other hand, as [husband\u2019s counsel] pointed out, many of those assets could have been foreseeably family assets. But the lack in tracing and the way that these parties did business, left the Court almost in a vacuum to make a determination as to the credibility of and the authenticity of those funds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 1681. Wife\u2019s counsel did not object to the court\u2019s additional explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">At the hearing, wife\u2019s counsel also raised what he called a \u201chalf issue,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1677, noting that the court\u2019s letter opinion had used the liquid account balances found on the statements offered into evidence. Though wife\u2019s counsel thought he and husband\u2019s counsel had already \u201cclarified\u201d the point between themselves, <em>id., </em>he said the account statements were not current as of the time of the equitable distribution hearing and stated that current statements were needed \u201cto bring everything up to date,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1678. The court did not specifically address the liquid accounts in its remarks from the bench but did restate the general rule: \u201cThe value of the assets [is] as of the date of the hearing. That\u2019s the law of the case and the law of Virginia.... And as far as the other assets, it\u2019s the value as of the date of the hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1681-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">At the court\u2019s request, wife\u2019s counsel drafted the proposed final decree for the court\u2019s consideration. The court entered the decree as written, except for one minor handwritten edit. The decree reaffirmed the court\u2019s findings, noting they were \u201cmore particularly described in its letter ruling,\u201d and restated the \u201ccharacterization of the property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1691. The decree also included this restatement of the court\u2019s earlier comments from the bench: \u201c[M]any of the contested assets, [husband] was unable to completely trace which caused the assets to become marital or hybrid. However, these assets could have been foreseeably [husband\u2019s] family assets. The Court considered the substantial contributions of [husband\u2019s] parents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1698. Consistent with the court\u2019s letter opinion, the final decree distributed 60% of the marital assets to husband and 40% to wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">The final decree did not address wife\u2019s contention that the valuation figures should be updated with more current account balances. Instead, the decree recited the amounts previously noted in the court\u2019s letter opinion, which were based upon the account statements offered by the parties into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Wife\u2019s counsel endorsed the order with the caveat, \u201cSeen and objected to ... based on [wife\u2019s] objections filed herein.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1700. Three of wife\u2019s objections are relevant to this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-4\">\u2022 [Wife] objects to the Court\u2019s ruling which awarded [husband] ... 60% of the marital estate or assets.... [T]he Court utilized a factor, which is not an appropriate factor, to determine the extent of equitable distribution under Code Section 20-107.3. The Court, after ruling that numerous accounts held jointly by [husband] and his mother were \u201cmarital accounts,\u201d basically utilized some remaining doubts about the classification of those assets to award [husband] 60%.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-5\">\u2022 [Wife] objects to the Court\u2019s ruling which did not award a majority of the marital assets to [wife] as the Court did not properly consider all of the statutory factors found in Code Section 20-107.3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-6\">\u2022 [Wife] objects to the Court\u2019s ruling which did not call for a division of the current balance of numerous liquid accounts such as CDs and money market funds, and instead only awarded [wife] a percentage of the balance of those marital accounts at the time that the evidence was produced by way of deposition almost 6 months before. There was no need to \u201cvalue\u201d accounts that are entirely marital and liquid such as money market funds, stock funds and CDs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1687-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">Wife retained new counsel to appeal the trial court\u2019s ruling. Wife\u2019s appellate counsel raises two assignments of error. The first asserts the trial court erred (for four separate reasons) in awarding husband 60% of the marital assets. The second contends the court erred by using stale values for the liquid accounts (calculated generally around the time of several depositions) rather than the account balances at the time of the equitable distribution hearing. We find several aspects of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>wife\u2019s arguments on appeal to be procedurally defaulted and conclude the remaining arguments have no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">A. Procedurally Defaulted Sub-Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Wife supports her first assignment of error challenging the 60/40 distribution ratio with four sub-arguments. As wife sees it, the trial court erroneously (la) distributed marital assets \u201cas if\u2019 they were hybrid; (lb) treated its own \u201cspeculation and confusion over the evidence\u201d as a distribution factor; (lc) took into account \u201cthe substantial contributions\u201d to the marriage made by husband\u2019s parents; and (Id) \u201cfailed to identify any factor\u201d justifying the 60/40 distribution ratio. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">In the trial court, however, wife made only two objections to the 60/40 distribution ruling: First, she claimed that the court based its decision on its \u201cremaining doubts about the classification\u201d and improperly treated those doubts as a distribution factor. App. at 1687. Second, she argued that the court \u201cdid not properly consider all of the statutory factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1688.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">To some extent, wife\u2019s sub-arguments on appeal attempt to flesh out her rather general objections in the trial court. But, in doing so, her sub-arguments go considerably beyond the objections made in the trial court. Rule 5A:18 precludes us from addressing on appeal issues different from those presented to the trial court. If the differences are merely semantic, we overlook them as insignificant. But truly substantive differences, even if quite subtle, cannot be overlooked.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nor should they be.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Trial courts deserve to have the contested issues framed clearly and precisely. Only then can a trial court respond to a particular argument, either with a corrective action or with a clarification that could make an appeal wholly unnecessary. <em>See generally Brandon v. Cox, </em>284 Va. 251, 255, 726 S.E.2d 298, 300 (holding that procedural default principles \u201cprotect the trial court from appeals based upon undisclosed grounds\u201d and \u201cenable the trial judge to rule intelligently\u201d), <em>amended by </em>\u2014 Va. -, 736 S.E.2d 695, and <em>reh\u2019g granted, </em>2012 Va. Lexis 178 (2012). This is particularly true in modern divorce and equitable distribution cases, where even a slight rewording of a point can demonstrably change its conceptual contours.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">In this case, we see no need to dissect wife\u2019s first assignment of error in an effort to compare and contrast specific phrases of her sub-arguments on appeal with her objections in the trial court. Instead, we will simply assume her sub-arguments on appeal at least encompass the two objections she made in the trial court regarding the distribution ratio. Our appellate review, however, ends there. We will not address the restated sub-arguments to the extent that they subtly recast her trial court objections in substantive ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">B. The 60/40 Distribution Ratio</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">Viewing wife\u2019s argument on appeal through the lens of her objections in the trial court, we discern a single, common theme. Wife contends the trial court misunderstood the distinction between classification and distribution. She interprets the court\u2019s remarks from the bench during the hearing on her motion for clarification as a palpable demonstration of its confusion. Under wife\u2019s interpretation, the trial court divided the marital property as if it were hybrid. For several reasons, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>To begin with, we presume trial judges \u201cknow the law and correctly apply it.\u201d <em>White, </em>56 Va.App. at 217, 692 S.E.2d at 290 (citation omitted). \u201cAn appellant can rebut the presumption by showing, either by the ruling itself or the reasoning underlying it, the trial judge misunderstood the governing legal principles. We are particularly skeptical of appellate efforts to piece together such a conclusion from fragmented remarks from the bench.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 217-18, 692 S.E.2d at 291. And we decline invitations to \u201cfix upon isolated statements of the trial judge taken out of the full context in which they were made, and use them as a predicate for holding the law has been misapplied.\u201d <em>Damon v. York, </em>54 Va.App. 544, 555, 680 S.E.2d 354, 360 (2009) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">That said, we acknowledge the trial court\u2019s remarks are difficult to interpret. Even so, when viewed in a favorable context, they are consistent with Virginia law. Equitable distribution involves three distinct decisions: classification, valuation, and distribution. <em>See Marion v. Marion, </em>11 Va.App. 659, 665, 401 S.E.2d 432, 436 (1991). Property can be classified as marital, separate, or hybrid. Hybrid property involves a mixture of \u201cpart marital property and part separate property.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3). The party seeking to segregate the separate property bears the burden of proof to equitably trace the truly separate component. <em>See Sfreddo v. Sfreddo, </em>59 Va.App. 471, 480, 720 S.E.2d 145, 150 (2012) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If a preponderance of the evidence fails to do so, the property remains fully marital. <em>See Rahbaran v. Rahbaran, </em>26 Va.App. 195, 209, 494 S.E.2d 135, 141 (1997); 1 Brett R. Turner, <em>Equitable Distribution of Property </em>\u00a7 5:63, at 638 (3d ed. 2005) (\u201cIf any link in the tracing chain cannot be proven, ... the asset is marital property.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The trial court found that husband\u2019s parents had made substantial monetary and non-monetary contributions to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>parties\u2019 business ventures during the marriage.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court concluded, nonetheless, that husband did not satisfy his burden of tracing the separate property in what \u201ccould have been foreseeably family assets\u201d and observed that husband\u2019s \u201cfail[ure] in tracing many of the assets\u201d created an evidentiary \u201cvacuum\u201d that precluded the court from identifying those assets as anything other than \u201chybrid or marital.\u201d App. at 1681.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The question then becomes whether the court\u2019s concerns are so out of bounds as to constitute an abuse of discretion, which is precisely what wife argues: \u201cThe court\u2019s own language indicated how confused it was by the Husband\u2019s failure to trace, but, nonetheless, gave the Husband improper consideration in the distribution of the marital property on a 60/40 basis.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 28-24. \u201cConsequently,\u201d wife reasons, \u201cthe court\u2019s proper classification of the assets as marital, but utilization of confusion and speculation as to whether there might be some hybrid component, clearly led this court to its 60/40 division of marital property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">We believe wife\u2019s argument caricatures the trial court\u2019s reasoning by suggesting the court somehow misunderstood the difference between classification and distribution. As wife sees it, the court reluctantly classified the property as marital, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>but changed the distribution ratio because of its speculative belief that perhaps some of the property was actually separate. This assertion makes several assumptions which we find unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">First, wife assumes the court\u2019s clarifying remarks regarding the contributions of husband\u2019s parents to the marital estate revealed the <em>sole </em>justification for the 60/40 ratio. The trial court\u2019s letter opinion, however, also considered wife\u2019s admitted adultery as well as her less-than-compelling loneliness excuse. That consideration, by itself, would have fully justified the 60/40 ratio adopted by the court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court\u2019s later remarks about husband\u2019s parents\u2019 contributions identified an <em>additional </em>consideration justifying its distribution decision. The trial court did not say it was the only basis for the 60/40 ratio.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">We believe, moreover, that wife misinterprets not only what the trial court said but what it did. The court did not classify the property as marital and then circuitously distribute it as if it were non-marital. The court, in deciding how to fairly distribute the marital property, simply took into account the fact that husband\u2019s family had contributed a considerable amount of property to the marital estate. Virginia courts, as well as many others,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> consider this a valid factor in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>distribution decision. <em>See Marion, </em>11 Va.App. at 666, 401 S.E.2d at 437 (stating that the \u201csource of funds,\u201d in this case family members of the parties, is a \u201cfactor properly considered when distributing the property\u201d); <em>Srinivasan v. Srinivasan, </em>10 Va.App. 728, 732, 396 S.E.2d 675, 678 (1990) (stating that the \u201csource of funds is a particularly significant factor where funds have been transmuted\u201d); <em>Lambert v. Lambert, </em>6 Va. App. 94, 103-04, 367 S.E.2d 184, 190 (1988) (recognizing the consideration of a spouse\u2019s contribution as an amelioration of the \u201cinequity\u201d of finding commingled property fully marital). As one commentator persuasively explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-5\">No classification system is perfect, and for one reason or other, contributions from nonmarital sources sometimes do not create separate property interests. When this happens, the contribution may be considered as one relevant factor favoring an unequal division of the marital estate. The effect is that the division stage functions as an equitable steam valve, allowing the court to adjust the final division of property to account for quirks and flaws in the classification system....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-6\">When separate property is traced into a presently-existing asset, but the amount of the separate contributions cannot be proven, the separate contribution is generally lost. The court nevertheless retains the power to recognize the lost separate contribution by making an unequal division, either of the commingled asset or the marital estate in general.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>2 Brett R. Turner, <em>supra </em>\u00a7\u00a7 8:5, 8:6, at 791, 794 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">Finding no error in the court\u2019s explanation for its 60/40 distribution decision, we next address wife\u2019s argument that the trial court \u201cdid not properly consider <em>all </em>of the statutory factors found in Code Section 20-107.3.\u201d App. at 1688 (emphasis added). We find this assertion meritless. The letter opinion, amplified by the final decree, identified and discussed the court\u2019s consideration of each of the statutory factors. The factors weighing in husband\u2019s favor included his wife\u2019s admitted adultery and the contributions of his parents to the marital estate\u2014either of which, as noted earlier, would have fully justified the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">As we have often said, \u201cVirginia law does not establish a presumption of equal distribution of marital assets.\u201d <em>Watts v. Watts, </em>40 Va.App. 685, 702, 581 S.E.2d 224, 233 (2003) (citation omitted). A trial court \u201cneed not start off at the 50-yard line and then look to the discretionary factors of Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E) to move the ball marker up or down the sidelines.\u201d <em>Robbins v. Robbins, </em>48 Va.App. 466, 480-81, 632 S.E.2d 615, 622 (2006). Instead, a trial court \u201cmust consider each of the \u00a7 20-107.3(E) statutory factors and only then determine what relative weight to assign to each.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 481, 632 S.E.2d at 622. \u2018What weight, if any, to assign to this or that factor in the overall decision lies within the trial court\u2019s sound discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Equitable distribution, after all, is simply the judicial task of distributing property equitably. The statutory factors serve only to guide the decisionmaking process, not to dictate a precise algorithm yielding an exact and indisputably correct result. The governing principles of law must be honored scrupulously, to be sure, but they should never downgrade the decision from a conscientious exercise of judgment into a mechanical application of formulas.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Consequently, an equitable distribution decision \u201ccan be overturned only by a showing of an abuse of that discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>tion.\u201d <em>Smith v. Smith, </em>43 Va.App. 279, 286, 597 S.E.2d 250, 254 (2004) (citation omitted). An abuse of discretion occurs only when \u201creasonable jurists\u201d could not disagree as to the proper decision. <em>Brandau v. Brandau, </em>52 Va.App. 632, 641, 666 S.E.2d 532, 537 (2008). This principle necessarily implies that, for some decisions, conscientious jurists could reach different conclusions based on exactly the same facts\u2014yet still remain entirely reasonable. This bell-shaped curve of reason-ability governing our appellate review rests on the venerable belief that the judge closest to the contest is the judge best able to discern where the equities lie.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">In sum, the trial court\u2019s 60/40 distribution ratio reflects a reasonable and equitable judgment, fully consistent with the legal principles governing this case. Wife offers no persuasive reason for us to conclude otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">C. Valuation Date of Liquid Assets</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Wife also argues the \u201ctrial court erred by dividing the liquid marital assets using a valuation date of a much earlier <em>de bene esse </em>deposition rather than the date of the hearing.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 33. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>As noted earlier, the parties submitted the case to the trial court entirely by exhibits and <em>de bene esse </em>depositions. During one of the depositions, wife\u2019s counsel suggested that at least two of the joint accounts should be divided at whatever their value was at the time \u201cthe Court decides to do something with it.\u201d App. at 373. Husband\u2019s counsel agreed with this suggestion. <em>Id. </em>at 374.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At the equitable distribution hearing, the parties submitted various depositions and exhibits identifying the liquid accounts.

In its letter opinion listing the accounts and their balances, the court used the balances stated on the exhibits\u2014the only factual information available to the court at the time. At the hearing on wife\u2019s motion for clarification, wife\u2019s counsel informed the court that he had \u201cnot received statements [he] thought [he was] getting\u201d from the two previous quarters, which he \u201cwould like to have ... to draft the order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Counsel described this point as a \u201chalf issue\u201d that he thought counsel had already \u201cclarified\u201d between themselves. <em>Id. </em>at 1677.

Nor did he proffer that the more current balances were likely to be significantly different from the balances noted on the exhibits presented at the equitable distribution hearing.
