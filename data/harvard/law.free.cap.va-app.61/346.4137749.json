The stop led to the discovery of illegal drugs. He challenges the validity of the stop, contending that the stop was not justified because, as a matter of law, his brake light was not defective. We disagree and affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">On April 15, 2011, Deputy D.J. Hart of the Spotsylvania County Sheriffs Office was conducting surveillance of a suspect vehicle driven by appellant. As he drove closer to appellant\u2019s car, Deputy Hart noticed that \u201ca portion of the third brake light, the high mount brake light, was out.\u201d This particular brake light had \u201ctwo lights in it,\u201d and Deputy Hart testified, \u201cone-half of that light was out.\u201d Based on this fact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>Deputy Hart made a traffic stop. On cross-examination, Deputy Hart acknowledged that he was able to see the brake lights illuminate. He could not determine with certainty the distance between his vehicle and appellant\u2019s, but he stated that the two vehicles could have been separated by 500 feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">As he approached the vehicle, Deputy Hart noticed \u201ca strong and distinct odor of fresh marijuana coming from inside the vehicle.\u201d When asked about the odor, Otey admitted that there was a bag of marijuana in the center console. Deputy Hart seized the bag, as well as a digital scale located under the driver\u2019s seat. Otey admitted to possessing two additional bags in his pockets. Otey later stated that he was \u201cfronted\u201d the marijuana, meaning that he would sell it and then reimburse his supplier with the proceeds from the sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Otey moved to suppress the evidence seized following the traffic stop, arguing that the stop was improper. The trial court denied the motion, reasoning that the stop was justified based on the defective brake light. Otey was convicted of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and sentenced to serve three years in prison, with all but 60 days suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">When this Court reviews a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress, \u201c \u2018the burden is upon [the losing party] to show that the ruling, when the evidence is considered most favorably to the [prevailing party], constituted reversible error.\u2019 \u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 197, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en banc) </em>(quoting <em>Fore v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 1007, 1010, 265 S.E.2d 729, 731 (1980)). Although the facts here are not in dispute, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>Branham v. Commonwealth, </em>283 Va. 273, 279, 720 S.E.2d 74, 77 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. U.S. Const, amend. IV. An officer\u2019s stop of a vehicle is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment if the officer possesses at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>articulable and reasonable suspicion that the vehicle is in violation of a statute or regulation governing the vehicle\u2019s equipment. <em>Delaware v. Prouse, </em>440 U.S. 648, 663, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979). <em>See also McCain v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 546, 553, 659 S.E.2d 512, 516 (2008) (\u201cAn officer may effect a traffic stop when he has reasonable suspicion to believe a traffic or equipment violation has occurred.\u201d). If the search violates the suspect\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights, exclusion of the illegally seized evidence generally constitutes the remedy. <em>See Davis v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2419, 2423, 180 L.Ed.2d 285 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The issue before us pivots on a question of statutory construction, namely, the meaning of the term \u201cdefective\u201d in Code \u00a7 46.2-1003. \u201cStatutory interpretation presents a pure question of law and is accordingly subject to <em>de novo </em>review by this Court.\u201d <em>Washington v. Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 449, 455, 634 S.E.2d 310, 313 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Code \u00a7 46.2-1003 makes it \u201cunlawful for any person to use or have as equipment on a motor vehicle operated on a highway any device or equipment mentioned in \u00a7 46.2-1002 which is defective or in unsafe condition.\u201d In turn, Code \u00a7 46.2-1002 mentions \u201clighting device[s], warning device[s], signal deviee[s], safety glass, [and] other equipment for which approval is required by any provision of this chapter... ,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Finally, Code \u00a7 46.2-1014.1 requires automobiles to \u201cbe equipped with a supplemental center high mount stop light of a type approved by the Superintendent or which meets the standards adopted by the United States Department of Transportation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Appellant argues that Deputy Hart\u2019s stop was based on a mistaken reading of the law. He contends that Code \u00a7 46.2-1014 supplies the standard for what constitutes a \u201cdefective\u201d brake light. Code \u00a7 46.2-1014 provides in relevant part that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Every motor vehicle ... except an antique vehicle not originally equipped with a brake light, registered in the Commonwealth and operated on the highways in the Commonwealth shall be equipped with at least two brake lights of a type approved by the Superintendent. Such brake lights shall automatically exhibit a red or amber light plainly visible in clear weather from a distance of 500 feet to the rear of such vehicle when the brake is applied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Appellant reasons that his brake light was not defective because it was visible from 500 feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">\u201cOrdinarily, when a particular word in a statute is not defined therein, a court must give it its ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Moyer v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 8, 35, 531 S.E.2d 580, 593 (2000) <em>(en </em>banc) (citing <em>McKeon v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 24, 27, 175 S.E.2d 282, 284 (1970)). The plain, ordinary meaning of the term \u201cdefective\u201d is straightforward. A brake light is \u201cdefective\u201d if it is \u201cfaulty, deficient.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>591 (1981). A brake light that lights up by only half is faulty and deficient, just as an engine that sputters and lurches is defective, even if it works well enough to enable the driver to reach his destination. We adopt the plain language reading of the term \u201cdefective.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">In addition, Code \u00a7 46.2-1003 is codified among the provisions regulating \u201cvehicle and equipment safety.\u201d As we noted in <em>Ragland v. Commonwealth, </em>No. 1036-96-2, 1997 WL 65780, 1997 Va.App. LEXIS 109 (Va.Ct.App. Feb. 18, 1997),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> this provision</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-8\">does more than set a minimum standard; it regulates the maintenance of devices or equipment used on a vehicle. In particular, Code \u00a7 46.2-1003 prohibits the use on a vehicle of <em>any </em>equipment mentioned in Code \u00a7 46.2-1002 that is either unsafe or defective, whether or not this equipment exceeds the minimum requirements set forth elsewhere in the Code. Thus, the apparent intent of Code \u00a7 46.2-1003 is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>to compel automobile owners to repair or replace any of their vehicle\u2019s equipment that falls into a defective or unsafe condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-5\"><em>Id. </em>at *2-3, 1997 Va.App. LEXIS 109, at *6-7. Appellant\u2019s attempt to harmonize Code \u00a7 46.2-1003 and Code \u00a7 46.2-1014 would have \u201cthe effect of eviscerating the impact of Code \u00a7 46.2-1003 because it would create an entire class of equipment that may be legally used on a vehicle in an unsafe or defective condition simply because the equipment is in excess of the Code\u2019s minimum requirements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *2-3, 1997 Va.App. LEXIS 109, at *7. We decline to \u201cconstrue these two provisions to achieve such an unwarranted result.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Moreover, reading Code \u00a7 46.2-1003 in the manner argued by appellant\u2014that a brake light is defective only if it is not visible from 500 feet\u2014would render superfluous and redundant the language in Code \u00a7 46.2-1003 prohibiting defective equipment. Under appellant\u2019s suggested reading, Code \u00a7 46.2-1003 would simply repeat the requirements already set forth in Code \u00a7 46.2-1014. Basic canons of statutory construction proscribe interpreting statutes in a way that renders statutory language superfluous. <em>See, e.g., Zhou v. Zhou, </em>38 Va.App. 126, 136-37, 562 S.E.2d 336, 340-41 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">We also note that under the Virginia Administrative Code, a vehicle will not pass inspection if a vehicle\u2019s rear light assembly \u201cdoes not work as designed by the manufacturer,\u201d if all rear lamps \u201care not in operating condition\u201d and where a lamp\u2019s \u201cfilaments do not burn.\u201d 19 VAC \u00a7 30-70-150(1), (2), (10).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It certainly would be odd for a vehicle\u2019s malfunctioning rear light to cause the vehicle to fail the state inspection but at the same time not be \u201cdefective.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>Finally, appellant makes a policy argument in support of reversal, contending that a stop such as this one is \u201cunduly burdensome to the driver.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 12. Our role as a reviewing court is to determine whether the stop conformed to the law. The legislature certainly may choose to constrain the discretion exercised by law enforcement officers in particular contexts beyond the requirements of the Fourth Amendment. That policy decision, however, is for the legislature to make.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Deputy Hart\u2019s stop of appellant\u2019s vehicle was based on a reasonable, articulable suspicion that appellant\u2019s vehicle had defective equipment. Therefore, the trial court correctly denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b391-13\">.
