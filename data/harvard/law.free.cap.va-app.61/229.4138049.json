On appeal, Starbucks contends: 1) the commission erred in denying Starbucks\u2019 allegation that claimant returned to work on January 26, 2010; 2) the commission erred in denying Starbucks\u2019 allegation that claimant returned to work on November'26, 2010; and 3) the commission erred in denying Starbucks\u2019 allegation that claimant abandoned the labor force on January 4, 2011. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b277-14\">On appeal from the commission, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to claimant, the party prevailing below. <em>Tomes v. James City Fire, </em>39 Va.App. 424, 429-30, 573 S.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>312, 315 (2002) (citing <em>R.G. Moore Bldg. Corp. v. Mullins, </em>10 Va.App. 211, 212, 390 S.E.2d 788, 788 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">\n<em>A. Claimant\u2019s Injury and Award Order</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">So viewed, the evidence showed that claimant suffered an upper back injury on December 8, 2009, during the course of her employment at Starbucks. The following day, claimant was placed on a workers\u2019 compensation leave of absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">On January 26, 2010, claimant made an unsuccessful attempt to return to work for Starbucks at the store where she worked prior to her injury. During this unsuccessful attempt at returning to work, claimant performed what she described as \u201clight duty work; mostly cashiering.\u201d Despite performing only light-duty work over an interrupted six-week basis, claimant testified that her attempt to work a full shift caused her \u201cextreme pain\u201d and that she \u201ccould not move around or move [her] arms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">In March 2010, after this failed attempt at returning to work, claimant was referred to Dr. Stephanie Clopp, who became claimant\u2019s treating physician and advised her to discontinue her work activity. Claimant worked her last day at Starbucks on March 8, 2010. On March 23, 2010, claimant was again placed on a workers\u2019 compensation leave of absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">On April 19, 2010, claimant filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits and requested a hearing with the commission. In her claim, claimant alleged injuries to her right shoulder, neck, and back.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">Prior to claimant\u2019s hearing before the commission, Starbucks provided claimant with an award agreement, providing for payment of temporary total disability benefits beginning on December 8, 2009. Claimant accepted the award agreement, and the parties submitted the agreement to the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">On July 27, 2010, the commission entered an award order, approving the award agreement, as well as entering an award of medical benefits pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-603. Following entry of the award, Starbucks neither sought review of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>award nor argued that it should be modified or vacated. On August 26, 2010, the award order became final.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">In November 2010, claimant applied for a job with the clothing retailer American Eagle. Claimant began working for American Eagle on November 26, 2010, and completed twelve hours of work over two shifts on nonconsecutive days before resigning in December 2010. Following her resignation from American Eagle, claimant then enrolled in Blue Ridge Community College as a full-time student on January 9, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">\n<em>B. Starbucks\u2019 Applications for a Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">On December 3, 2010, Starbucks filed an application for a hearing before the commission. Starbucks alleged that claimant\u2019s return to her pre-injury work at Starbucks on January 26, 2010, was a change in condition and sought the termination or suspension of claimant\u2019s outstanding award.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">Starbucks filed a second application for a hearing before the commission on April 4, 2011, alleging that claimant\u2019s return to light-duty work with American Eagle on November 26, 2010, constituted a change in condition and warranted termination or suspension of claimant\u2019s outstanding award.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">On May 18, 2011, Starbucks again filed an application for a hearing before the commission, claiming a change in condition based on claimant\u2019s January 26, 2010 return to light-duty work at Starbucks and requested the termination or suspension of claimant\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">One week later, on May 25, 2011, Starbucks filed its final application for a hearing before the commission, alleging that claimant abandoned the labor force when she became a full-time college student on January 4, 2011. In addition, Starbucks alleged that \u201cclaimant did not timely report [her enrollment in college] to the commission,\u201d as required by Code \u00a7 65.2-712.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">\n<em>C. Deputy Commissioner Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">On June 3, 2011, a deputy commissioner held a hearing on Starbucks\u2019 four consolidated applications for hearing. During <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>the hearing, claimant testified that after returning to work for Starbucks on January 26, 2010, when she attempted to work a full shift, she suffered extreme pain and experienced difficulty moving. Because her work exacerbated her pain, claimant testified that she was unable to work a full week schedule. Claimant also testified that after she stopped working for Starbucks in March 2010, she was not offered employment or job search assistance by Starbucks.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Claimant also addressed her attempted return to work with American Eagle in November 2010. Claimant testified that when she applied to work for American Eagle, she was willing to work forty hours per week. Moreover, claimant testified that she quit working at American Eagle because she was not offered the hours she requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Additionally, claimant testified that she enrolled as a full-time student at Blue Ridge Community College in January 2011. Since enrolling at Blue Ridge, claimant acknowledged that she had not looked for work. However, claimant also testified that she had not refused any assistance from Starbucks in finding employment because of her student status.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">After reviewing the evidence and testimony offered during the June 3, 2011 hearing, the deputy commissioner rejected each of Starbucks\u2019 four applications. First, the deputy commissioner found that by agreeing in June 2010 to entry of the award agreement with knowledge of claimant\u2019s brief and unsuccessful attempt to return to work in January 2010, Starbucks had waived and abandoned the allegations raised in its December 3, 2010 and May 18, 2011 applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">Alternatively, the deputy commissioner concluded that Starbucks failed to carry its burden of proving the allegations raised in the December 3, 2010 and May 18, 2011 applications. Specifically, the deputy commissioner found that, upon return to work for Starbucks in January 2010, claimant\u2019s \u201cattendance was sporadic at best, and [credited her] testimony that she continued to experience accident-related symptoms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">Similarly, the deputy commissioner found that Starbucks failed to meet its burden to show a change in condition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>concerning claimant\u2019s November 26, 2010 return to work with American Eagle. The deputy commissioner noted that claimant\u2019s employment with American Eagle was too short to constitute a change in her condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">The deputy commissioner also found Starbucks\u2019 May 25, 2011 application lacked merit, concluding that claimant had not withdrawn from the labor force when she enrolled in college on January 4, 2011. The deputy commissioner determined that claimant was not precluded from seeking employment by enrolling in college, that she had not refused any vocational assistance due to her status as a student, and that Starbucks had neither offered claimant a new job nor offered to help her find a job. Accordingly, the deputy commissioner concluded that Starbucks\u2019 allegations did not \u201cestablish a change in [claimant\u2019s] condition sufficient to suspend payments of compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Moreover, the deputy commissioner found unpersuasive Starbucks\u2019 assertion that claimant was required to notify the commission that she became a full-time college student. The deputy commissioner observed that Code \u00a7 65.2-712 only imposed a duty to disclose to the employer or its insurer, not the commission, a change in a claimant\u2019s status as a full-time student. More importantly, the deputy commissioner interpreted Code \u00a7 65.2-712 to place \u201ca duty upon a claimant to disclose that he or she is no longer a full-time student for purposes of the dependency provisions of the Act, not to disclose that he or she has become a full-time student.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">\n<em>D. Full Commission Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Starbucks requested a review of the deputy commissioner\u2019s findings by the full commission on September 12, 2011. On November 17, 2011, the commission unanimously affirmed the deputy commissioner\u2019s June 16, 2011 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">The commission found that Starbucks did not appeal or seek to vacate the July 27, 2010 award order, and concluded that the award was thus final. Applying the principles of res judicata, the commission concluded that the award order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>barred Starbucks\u2019 December 3, 2010 and May 18, 2011 requests for review. In addition, the commission found that Starbucks was aware of claimant\u2019s January 2010 unsuccessful work attempt prior to execution of the award agreement, and, thus, \u201cabandoned [its] claim to assert a change in condition prior to signing [the award agreement].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The commission also concluded that Starbucks\u2019 May 25, 2011 application for hearing was meritless, finding that claimant\u2019s \u201cenrollment in college [was] not a basis for termination of [the] award.\u201d Significantly, the commission affirmed the deputy commissioner\u2019s finding that there was no evidence that claimant had withdrawn from the labor market upon her enrollment in college. Finally, the commission adopted the deputy commissioner\u2019s interpretation of Code \u00a7 65.2-712 and concluded that claimant was under no duty to inform the commission of her status as a full-time student. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AVj\">\n<em>A. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">In reviewing a decision of the commission, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to claimant, the party prevailing below. <em>See Wainwright v. Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co., </em>50 Va.App. 421, 430, 650 S.E.2d 566, 571 (2007). \u201cDecisions of the commission as to questions of fact, if supported by credible evidence, are conclusive and binding on this Court.\u201d <em>Manassas Ice &amp; Fuel Co. v. Farrar, </em>13 Va.App. 227, 229, 409 S.E.2d 824, 826 (1991); <em>Wise Coal &amp; Coke Co. v. Roberts, </em>157 Va. 782, 789, 161 S.E. 911, 913 (1932) (noting that whether a claimant suffered a change in condition is a question of fact). \u201cHowever, the commission\u2019s legal determinations are not binding on appeal and will be reviewed <em>de novo.\u201d Wainwright, </em>50 Va.App. at 430, 650 S.E.2d at 571 (citing <em>Robinson v. Salvation Army, </em>20 Va.App. 570, 572, 459 S.E.2d 103, 104 (1995)); <em>see also Pruden v. Plasser Am. Corp., </em>45 Va.App. 566, 573, 612 S.E.2d 738, 742 (2005) (\u201cThe determination of <em>res judicata </em>is a question of law and is reviewed <em>de </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number><em>novo.\u201d </em>(citing <em>Rusty\u2019s Welding Serv., Inc. v. Gibson, </em>29 Va.App. 119, 128, 510 S.E.2d 255, 259 (1999) <em>(en </em>banc))).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">\n<em>B. Claimant\u2019s January 26, 2010 Return to Work</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Starbucks contends that the commission erred in denying its allegation that claimant returned to work on January 26, 2010. Specifically, Starbucks contends that the commission erroneously applied the doctrine of res judicata because the July 27, 2010 award order was not a final judgment on the merits. Starbucks asserts that the award order was merely an administrative order recognizing claimant\u2019s right to collect wage-loss benefits and that \u201c[t]he substantive claim of [claimant\u2019s] return to work was never litigated before the [cjommission on the merits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">As this Court has expressed before, \u201c \u2018the relationship of the [cjommission to an award is that of a court to a judgment during the term at which it is rendered.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brock v. Voith Siemens Hydro Power Generation, </em>59 Va.App. 39, 47, 716 S.E.2d 485, 488 (2011) (quoting <em>K &amp; L Trucking Co., Inc. v. Thurber, </em>1 Va.App. 213, 219, 337 S.E.2d 299, 302 (1985)). \u201cA \u2018contested matter before the [cjommission,\u2019 we explained, involves an \u2018assertion of particular legal rights which have arisen out of a definable factual transaction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 47, 716 S.E.2d at 488-89 (quoting <em>Thurber, </em>1 Va.App. at 220, 337 S.E.2d at 302).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Here, it is beyond dispute that the award order in the instant matter resulted from a contested matter before the commission. Claimant sought to assert the legal rights available to her under the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (Act) when she filed her April 19, 2010 claim for benefits. In her claim, claimant alternatively demonstrated a willingness to accept temporary partial benefits during the period she worked light duty for Starbucks. Nevertheless, Starbucks initiated an agreement on July 2, 2010, to award claimant temporary total disability benefits beginning December 8, 2009, despite knowing that claimant had returned to work with Starbucks, at the same store, on January 26, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>The award order was also a final judgment. \u201cAbsent fraud or mistake, \u2018the decisions of the [cjommission or its deputy commissioners from which no party seeks timely review are binding upon the [cjommission.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pruden, </em>45 Va.App. at 574, 612 S.E.2d at 742 (quoting <em>Thurber, </em>1 Va.App. at 219, 337 S.E.2d at 302). Here, the deputy commissioner accepted the parties\u2019 agreement to pay benefits and issued an award order consistent with the terms of the agreement. Starbucks did not seek review of that order or move to have it vacated before it became final.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">In an effort to avoid the conclusive effect of the award order, Starbucks contends that the award order was not a final judgment because it was \u201cadministratively entered.\u201d This argument misplaces the inquiry this Court is required to make. An order by the commission awarding benefits to a claimant by agreement of the parties is a final determination of the matters which were actually, or might have been, litigated in that suit. <em>See Brock, </em>59 Va.App. at 47, 716 S.E.2d at 488 (\u201c \u2018[T]he relationship of the [cjommission to an award is that of a court to a judgment during the term at which it is rendered.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>K &amp; L Trucking Co., </em>1 Va.App. at 219, 337 S.E.2d 299 at 302)); <em>see also Wallihan v. Hughes, </em>196 Va. 117, 130, 82 S.E.2d 553, 561 (1954) (\u201cWhen the parties are before a court of competent jurisdiction and a separation agreement is approved, confirmed and decreed upon, its validity is by that judgment rendered res judicata between the parties.\u201d); <em>Martin v. Martin, </em>167 Va. 206, 211, 188 S.E. 148, 150 (1936) (\u201cThe judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, dismissing a suit agreed, on the ground that it has been agreed by the parties, is a final determination of the matters which were actually, or might have been litigated in that suit, as against said parties and all claiming under them.\u201d). Accordingly, the suggestion that the award order was administratively entered provides no basis for disturbing the commission\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Finally, Starbucks\u2019 argument that the award order was not a final judgment because claimant\u2019s return to work \u201cwas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>never litigated before the [cjommission on the merits,\u201d presupposes that res judicata applies only to issues actually litigated before a court or commission. However, as this Court has expressed before, the principles of res judicata can be comprised of two distinct concepts: \u201cissue preclusion\u201d and \u201cclaim preclusion.\u201d <em>See Brock, </em>59 Va.App. at 45, 716 S.E.2d at 487. \u201cIssue preclusion bars \u2018successive litigation of an issue of fact or law actually litigated and resolved in a valid court determination essential to the prior judgment,\u2019 even if the issue recurs in the context of a different claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>New Hampshire v. Maine, </em>532 U.S. 742, 748-49, 121 S.Ct. 1808, 1814, 149 L.Ed.2d 968 (2001)). In contrast, claim preclusion \u201c \u2018foreclos[es] litigation of a matter that never has been litigated, because of a determination that it should have been advanced in an earlier suit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nottingham v. Weld, </em>237 Va. 416, 419 n. 2, 377 S.E.2d 621, 622 n. 2 (1989) (quoting <em>Migra v. Warren City School Dist. Bd. of Ed., </em>465 U.S. 75, 77 n. 1, 104 S.Ct. 892, 894 n. 1, 79 L.Ed.2d 56 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"> The issue raised before this Court was one of claim preclusion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-5\">Virginia\u2019s application of the claim preclusion component of res judicata was best stated a century ago: \u201cEvery litigant should have opportunity to present whatever grievance he may have\u201d but if given an opportunity to do so and \u201chaving failed to avail himself of it, he must accept the consequences.\u201d <em>Miller v. Smith, </em>109 Va. 651, 655, 64 S.E. 956, 957 (1909). <em>Thus, the \u201ceffect of a final decree is not only to conclude the parties as to every question actually raised and decided, but as to every claim which properly belonged to the subject of litigation and which the parties, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, might have raised at the time.\u201d Smith v. Holland, </em>124 Va. 663, 666, 98 S.E. 676, 677 (1919) (citing <em>Diamond State Iron Co. v. Alex K. Rarig &amp; Co., </em>93 Va. 595, 25 S.E. 894 (1896)); <em>Miller, </em>109 Va. at 651, 64 S.E. at 956. Claims precluded by res judicata include those \u201cmade or tendered by the pleadings,\u201d as well as those \u201cincident to or essentially connected with the subject matter of the litigation, whether the same, as a matter of fact, were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>or were not considered.\u201d <em>Lofton Ridge, LLC v. Norfolk S. Ry., </em>268 Va. 377, 381, 601 S.E.2d 648, 650 (2004) (quoting <em>Kemp v. Miller, </em>166 Va. 661, 674-75, 186 S.E. 99, 103-04 (1936)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-7\"><em>Brock, </em>59 Va.App. at 46, 716 S.E.2d at 488 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the commission\u2019s finding that res judicata bars review of claimant\u2019s January 26, 2010 return to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">\n<em>C. Claimant\u2019s November 26, 2010 Return to Work</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">Starbucks next asserts that the commission erred in finding that claimant\u2019s twelve-hour shift with American Eagle was not of sufficient duration to show a change in condition and return to work. Starbucks argues that a return to work of <em>any duration </em>constitutes a change in condition that warrants termination of claimant\u2019s benefits as a matter of law. In support of this argument, Starbucks relies on <em>Brown v. Johnston Memorial Hospital, </em>No. 233-60-73 (Va. Workers\u2019 Comp. Comm\u2019n Mar. 8, 2010), and <em>Robbins v. Lee County School Board, </em>No. 209-20-79 (Va. Workers\u2019 Comp. Comm\u2019n Sept. 26, 2005). Starbucks cites <em>Brown </em>and <em>Robbins </em>to support the argument that a return to work for one or two days, respectively, would be sufficient to prove a change in condition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">Starbucks\u2019 reliance on <em>Brown </em>and <em>Robbins </em>misconstrues the change in condition standard. In neither <em>Brown </em>nor <em>Robbins </em>did the commission establish as a categorical rule that a one or two day absence from, or return to, work would <em>per se </em>constitute a change in condition. Rather, the commission held in both cases that a change in condition occurred where the evidence demonstrated that the claimant was <em>unable </em>to perform his work for one day, <em>Robbins, </em>No. 209-20-79 (Va. Workers\u2019 Comp. Comm\u2019n Sept. 26, 2005) (finding the claimant disabled for missed day of work because deputy commissioner found the claimant acted reasonably in missing work due to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>back pain), or two days, <em>Brown, </em>No. 233-60-73 (Va. Workers\u2019 Comp. Comm\u2019n Mar. 8, 2010) (finding the claimant disabled where physician excused the claimant from work for two days due to scheduled diagnostic studies). Because <em>Brown </em>and <em>Robbins </em>involved changes in condition based upon claimants\u2019 inability to work, they are distinguishable from and inapplicable to the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">Accordingly, the issue facing the commission was not simply whether claimant attempted to return to her preinjury work. Rather, under Code \u00a7 65.2-101<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Starbucks bore the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that claimant experienced a change in condition that affected her right to compensation. <em>See Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co. v. Bateman, </em>4 Va.App. 459, 464, 359 S.E.2d 98, 101 (1987) (\u201cGeneral principles of workman\u2019s compensation law provide that \u2018in an application for review of an award on the ground of change in condition, the burden is on the party alleging such change to prove his allegations by a preponderance of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Pilot Freight Carriers, Inc. v. Reeves, </em>1 Va.App. 435, 438-39, 339 S.E.2d 570, 572 (1986))). As the Supreme Court has expressed, \u201c[t]he threshold test of compensability is whether the employee is \u2018able fully to perform the duties of his preinjury employment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Celanese Fibers Co. v. Johnson, </em>229 Va. 117, 120, 326 S.E.2d 687, 690 (1985) (quoting <em>Sky Chefs Inc. v. Rogers, </em>222 Va. 800, 805, 284 S.E.2d 605, 607 (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">In the present case, Starbucks\u2019 application for a change in condition was premised solely on claimant\u2019s November 26, 2010 return to work at American Eagle. While a return to work may ordinarily be strong evidence that a claimant is capable of performing his or her pre-injury employment, it is not dispositive. Here, the commission credited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>\u201cclaimant\u2019s hearing testimony that she worked for American Eagle a total of 12 hours over only two workdays that were approximately three weeks apart,\u201d and further found claimant\u2019s unsuccessful attempt to return to the labor force not consequential enough to constitute a change in condition. Reviewing the commission\u2019s holding, we cannot say as a matter of law that the evidence submitted by Starbucks, simply showing that claimant returned to work for a period of twelve hours, was sufficient to prove a change in condition. <em>Tomko v. Michael\u2019s Plastering Co., </em>210 Va. 697, 699, 173 S.E.2d 833, 835 (1970) (\u201cUnless we can say as a matter of law that the evidence submitted by Tomko was sufficient to sustain his burden, then the Commission\u2019s finding that he did not suffer injury by accident is binding and conclusive upon us.\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm the commission\u2019s holding on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">\n<em>D. Claimant\u2019s Enrollment in College</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Starbucks raises- two arguments under its final assignment of error. First, Starbucks asserts that claimant was required by Code \u00a7 65.2-712 to disclose her status as a full-time student to the commission, and, second, Starbucks argues that claimant abandoned the labor force when she enrolled as a full-time student and is no longer entitled to temporary total disability payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">In reviewing the decision of the commission in this regard, we note that \u201c \u2018Conclusions of the commission upon questions of law, or mixed questions of law and fact, are not binding on appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gallahan v. Free Lance Star Publ\u2019g Co., </em>41 Va.App. 694, 698, 589 S.E.2d 12, 14 (2003) (quoting <em>Sinclair v. Shelter Constr. Corp., </em>23 Va.App. 154, 156-57, 474 S.E.2d 856, 857-58 (1996)). Nevertheless, \u201c[t]he commission\u2019s construction of the Act is entitled to great weight on appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Cross v. Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co., </em>21 Va.App. 530, 533, 465 S.E.2d 598, 599 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Starbucks asserts that claimant was required by Code \u00a7 65.2-712 to disclose her status as a full-time student to the commission. Starbucks contends that because claimant failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>to make this disclosure, the award for temporary total disability should be terminated on the date claimant enrolled in Blue Ridge Community College.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">In affirming the holding of the deputy commissioner, the commission held that the disclosure requirement in Code \u00a7 65.2-712 referred not to injured employees, like claimant, but to dependents pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-515.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Recognizing the great weight afforded to the commission\u2019s construction of the Act, we also note that the language and history of Code \u00a7 65.2-712 demonstrate an intent to link receipt of compensation <em>as a statutory dependent </em>with the disclosure requirement for a change in student status.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Higgins v. Inspection Enterprises, Inc., </em>77 O.W.C. 273 (1998) (\u201c[Code \u00a7 ] 65.2-712 requires a dependent to notify the [commission of her status as a student.\u201d); <em>Boyd v. James River Limestone Company, Inc., </em>78 O.W.C. 157 (1999) (\u201cThe 1996 Amendments to [Code] \u00a7 65.2-712 impose another singular duty upon the statutory dependent to immediately disclose to the employer a change in his status as a full-time student.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Because we find that Code \u00a7 65.2-712 does not impose on claimant a requirement to disclose to the commission <em>her </em>status as a full-time student, we affirm this portion of the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">In addition, we also affirm the commission\u2019s holding that claimant\u2019s enrollment in college was not a basis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>terminating the award order. Starbucks argues that claimant abandoned the labor force when she enrolled as a full-time student and is, accordingly, no longer entitled to temporary total disability payments. In support of this argument Starbucks cites <em>Baskerville v. Saunders Oil Co., </em>1 Va.App. 188, 192, 336 S.E.2d 512, 514 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">However, Starbucks\u2019 reliance on <em>Baskerville </em>is misplaced. In <em>Baskerville, </em>this Court held that a \u201c[claimant\u2019s voluntary criminal acts leading to his incarceration ... removed him from the labor market,\u201d and relieved the employer from paying benefits during the period of incarceration. <em>Id. </em>In reaching this holding, the Court noted that workers\u2019 compensation exists to compensate an employee for loss of earning power, which is not always proportional to disability. <em>Id. </em>at 193, 336 S.E.2d at 514. While incarceration would not affect the earning power of an employee suffering from permanent or temporary total disability, \u201c[i]n the case of temporary <em>partial disability ... </em>incarceration would be the controlling factor in preventing the employee from participating in selective employment or rehabilitative services.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 193, 336 S.E.2d at 514-15. Accordingly, the Court confined the holding \u201cto the case of temporary <em>partial disability </em>when incarceration occurs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 194, 336 S.E.2d at 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">This distinction between total and partial disability\u2014-juxtaposed by this Court in Baskerville\u2014is relevant here. Whether a claimant voluntarily removed herself from the labor force is a factor the commission and this Court consider when determining whether a claimant failed to market her remaining work capacity. <em>See Lynchburg Gen. Hosp. v. Spinazzolo, </em>22 Va.App. 160, 468 S.E.2d 146 (1996). However, a claimant under an award for permanent or temporary total disability is under no obligation to market her remaining work capacity. <em>See Georgia Pac. Corp. v. Dancy, </em>17 Va.App. 128, 134, 435 S.E.2d 898, 901-02 (1993) (\u201cBecause Dancy is totally, not partially, disabled, he is not required to prove that he made a reasonable effort to market his residual work capacity in order to receive temporary total disability benefits.\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Rather, a claimant under an open award for permanent or temporary total disability is required to cooperate with reasonable vocational rehabilitation efforts offered by her employer. Code \u00a7 65.2-603.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">Here, claimant is under an open award for ongoing temporary total disability. Accordingly, claimant is required only to cooperate with reasonable vocational rehabilitation efforts offered by Starbucks. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-603. Starbucks has not accused claimant of refusing vocational rehabilitation services or failing to accept selective employment. Consequently, we find that claimant has not abandoned the labor force by enrolling in college courses, and, accordingly, affirm the holding of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">For these reasons, we find that the commission did not err in denying Starbucks\u2019 allegations that claimant experienced a change in condition upon her return to work on January 26, 2010, that claimant experienced a change in condition upon her return to work on November 26, 2010, or that claimant abandoned the labor force when she enrolled in college courses on January 4, 2011. Therefore, the decision of the commission is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b286-12\">. While decisions of the commission are not binding on this Court, they may be persuasive in some cases. <em>See Pruden, </em>45 Va.App. at 580, 612 S.E.2d at 745.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b287-6\">. Code \u00a7 65.2-101 states that a \u201c '[cjhange in condition' means a change in physical condition of the employee as well as any change in the conditions under which compensation was awarded, suspended, or terminated which would affect the right to, amount of, or duration of compensation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b289-8\">.
