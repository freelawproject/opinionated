On appeal, appellant contends the circuit court erred in denying his motion to dismiss that indictment. He asserts that prosecution was barred by Code \u00a7 19.2-294.1 as a result of his prior conviction of reckless driving arising out of the same course of driving. For the following reasons, we reverse the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">On April 12, 2011, appellant was involved in a single car accident in Henry County. He admitted to Virginia State Trooper R.E. Dillon that he was the driver. A subsequent blood test showed his blood alcohol content to be 0.18 by weight by volume.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">On May 18, 2011, the Henry County General District Court (\u201cdistrict court\u201d) found appellant guilty of reckless driving. The district court also found probable cause to believe appellant committed the felony offense of driving while intoxicated, fourth or subsequent offense, in violation of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-266 and 18.2-270, as well as driving while intoxicated while his driver\u2019s license was revoked for two or more prior driving while intoxicated offenses, in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-391 (D). He was subsequently indicted on each of those offenses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">On September 29, 2011, appellant moved the circuit court to dismiss the indictment for driving while intoxicated, fourth or subsequent offense, arguing that conviction was barred by Code \u00a7 19.2-294.1 as a result of his prior reckless driving conviction arising out of the same course of driving. The circuit court denied appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss, stating that because the district court had no authority to try a felony charge, the subsequent felony prosecution and conviction in the circuit court did not violate Code \u00a7 19.2-294.1. Appellant thereafter was convicted on his conditional guilty plea to driving while intoxicated, fourth offense. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">\u201cAn issue of statutory interpretation is a pure question of law which we review de novo.\u201d <em>Kozmina v. Commonwealth, </em>281 Va. 347, 349, 706 S.E.2d 860, 862 (2011).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>\u201cWhen the language of a statute is unambiguous, we are bound by the plain meaning of that language. Furthermore, we must give effect to the legislature\u2019s intention as expressed by the language used unless a literal interpretation of the language would result in a manifest absurdity. If a statute is subject to more than one interpretation, we must apply the interpretation that will carry out the legislative intent behind the statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 349-50, 706 S.E.2d at 862 (quoting <em>Conyers v. Martial Arts World of Richmond, Inc., </em>273 Va. 96, 104, 639 S.E.2d 174, 178 (2007) (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Code \u00a7 19.2-294.1 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-7\">[wjhenever any person is charged with a violation of \u00a7 18.2-266 or any similar ordinances of any county, city, or town and with reckless driving in violation of \u00a7 46.2-852 or any ordinance of any county, city or town incorporating \u00a7 46.2-852, growing out of the same act or acts and is convicted of one of these charges, the court shall dismiss <em>the remaining charge.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">Applying the plain meaning of Code \u00a7 19.2-294.1, we conclude that the circuit court erred in not granting appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment charging him with driving while intoxicated, fourth or subsequent offense.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-10\">Under the plain and unambiguous terms of Code \u00a7 19.2-294.1, one may not be \u201ccharged\u201d and \u201cconvicted\u201d of both DUI and \u201creckless driving.\u201d A conviction of either DUI or reckless driving, whether in simultaneous or successive prosecutions, requires dismissal of the other charge if the other charge arose from the same act or acts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-11\"><em>White v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 410, 413, 494 S.E.2d 896, 897 (1998).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>Because appellant had previously been convicted of reckless driving in the district court, arising out of the same acts or act that were the basis of the felony indictment for driving while intoxicated, fourth or subsequent offense, Code \u00a7 19.2-294.1 requires the dismissal of the driving while intoxicated, fourth or subsequent offense, indictment. Accordingly, we hold that the circuit court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment charging him with driving while intoxicated, fourth or subsequent offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse appellant\u2019s conviction for driving while intoxicated, fourth offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b338-9\">.
