She asserts that the trial court erred by imposing separate ten-year sentences for each conviction of unlawful wounding. She notes that the maximum sentence permitted by statute for unlawful wounding, a Class 6 felony, is five years\u2019 incarceration. Code \u00a7 18.2-10(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Appellant lived with Harrison Veney (\u201cHarrison\u201d) in Richmond County. On September 3, 2011, she and Harrison argued. During the argument, appellant cut Harrison and his brother, Columbus Veney, with a knife. By the time law enforcement officers responded to the scene, appellant had absconded with Harrison\u2019s cellular phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">The trial court found appellant guilty of two counts of unlawful wounding and one count of petit larceny.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the sentencing hearing, the Commonwealth recommended to the trial court that it sentence appellant to ten years\u2019 incarceration for each conviction of unlawful wounding, with nine years suspended on the first conviction, and nine years and nine months suspended on the second conviction. Appellant asked the trial court to impose \u201can active sentence that is the mid point [sic] in the guidelines.\u201d The trial court sentenced appellant to ten years\u2019 imprisonment, with eight years and six months suspended, on the first count of unlawful wounding, and to ten years\u2019 imprisonment, with all ten years suspended, on the second count of unlawful wounding. It ordered that appellant serve those sentences consecutively, for a total active sentence of one year and six months\u2019 incarceration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Appellant contends the trial court erred by sentencing her to ten years\u2019 incarceration for each conviction of unlawful wounding. She asserts that the maximum penalty permitted by statute for a conviction of unlawful wounding, a Class 6 felony, is five years\u2019 incarceration. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2\u201410(f), 18.2-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">A. <em>Rule 5A: 18</em></p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">Appellant failed to object to the trial court\u2019s order sentencing her to ten years\u2019 incarceration for each of her convictions of unlawful wounding. She asks this Court to consider her argument that the trial court erred by sentencing her to a period of incarceration exceeding the statutory maximum under the \u201cends of justice\u201d exception to Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8W\">\u201cThe Court of Appeals will not consider an argument on appeal which was not presented to the trial court.\u201d <em>Ohree v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 299, 308, 494 S.E.2d 484, 488 (1998) (citing <em>Jacques v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 591, 593, 405 S.E.2d 630, 631 (1991)). However, Rule 5A:18 provides for consideration of a ruling by the trial court that was not objected to at trial \u201cto enable the Court of Appeals to attain the ends of justice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-8\"><em>Legette v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 221, 224, 532 S.E.2d 353, 354 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">\u201c[A] sentence imposed in violation of a prescribed statutory range of punishment is void <em>ab initio </em>.... \u201d <em>Rawls v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 213, 221, 683 S.E.2d 544, 549 (2009). \u201cDenying [a defendant] his liberty on the basis of a void sentence would impose a grave injustice upon him[, and t]he application of the ends of justice exception is, therefore, fully justified----\u201d <em>Charles v. Commonwealth, </em>270 Va. 14, 20, 613 S.E.2d 432, 435 (2005). Here, the trial court sentenced appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>lant to a term of incarceration of ten years for each of two convictions of unlawful wounding. Because Code \u00a7 18.2\u201410(f) authorizes the imposition of a maximum five years\u2019 incarceration for unlawful wounding, a Class 6 felony, the sentence is invalid. The ends of justice exception to Rule 5A:18 applies. Accordingly, we consider appellant\u2019s argument that the trial court erred by imposing a sentence for unlawful wounding that exceeded the statutory maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">B. <em>Unlawful Sentence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The Code of Virginia dictates that the maximum sentence for a conviction of unlawful wounding, a Class 6 felony, is five years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-10(f), 18.2-51. The trial court erred by sentencing appellant to ten years\u2019 incarceration for each conviction of unlawful wounding.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">The only issue remaining for this Court to determine is the proper remedy for the trial court\u2019s error.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">C. <em>Remedy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">Appellant contends this Court must remand each case for retrial. However, \u201c[bjeeause the error could have affected only the sentence and because the sentence was imposed by a trial court sitting without a jury, we may set aside that part of the final judgment\u201d without remand for retrial. <em>Woodward v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 672, 676, 432 S.E.2d 510, 513 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">Citing <em>Dargan v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 495, 500 S.E.2d 228 (1998) <em>(en </em>banc), and <em>Hines v. Commonwealth, </em>59 Va.App. 567, 721 S.E.2d 792 (2012), the Commonwealth contends that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-11\">in [case number CR11-114], the [trial court] sentenced [appellant] on one unlawful wounding offense to what the court perceived as the maximum sentence allowed, and then suspended the entire sentence. On this offense, a new sentencing hearing is unnecessary. The intent of the trial court is clear. In this case, the excessive portion of the invalid sentence can be deleted (five years) and the remain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>ing maximum sentence of five years, all suspended, can be imposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-4\">?j* V V ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-5\">Regarding [case number CR11-113], the court again imposed [what it believed to be] the maximum potential punishment. With regard to this conviction, this Court could eliminate five of the ten years imposed and affirm the judgment except as to the length of the suspended sentence. Only that aspect of the judgment of the trial court should be remanded for reconsideration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Commonwealth Br. at 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Contrary to the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion, there is no indication in the record that the trial court sentenced appellant \u201cto what the court perceived as the maximum sentence allowed\u201d for unlawful wounding. <em>Id. </em>at 6. The trial court did not state, explicitly or otherwise, that it intended to impose the maximum sentence for each of the two convictions of unlawful wounding. Accordingly, we cannot agree with the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion that the trial court intended to impose what it \u201cperceived as the maximum sentence allowed\u201d for unlawful wounding. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">In addition, we conclude that the Commonwealth\u2019s reliance on <em>Dargan </em>and <em>Hines </em>is misplaced. In <em>Dargan, </em>the trial court erroneously instructed the jury that the maximum penalty for conviction of possession of a weapon in a corrections facility was ten years\u2019 incarceration. The jury sentenced the defendant to ten years\u2019 incarceration, and the trial court imposed the sentence set by the jury. Nearly two months after the sentencing hearing, the trial court ruled that the jury had been erroneously instructed and that the ten-year sentence imposed exceeded the five-year maximum sentence authorized by law. Over Dargan\u2019s objection, the trial court set aside five years of the ten-year sentence and imposed a sentence of five years\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, this Court affirmed, holding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-9\">\u201cA sentence in excess of one prescribed by law is not void <em>ab initio </em>because of the excess, but is good insofar as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>power of the court extends, and is invalid only as to the excess.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-4\">\u2756 \u00edH * * \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-5\">Therefore, ... the trial court did not err in conforming the sentence to a term permitted by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-6\"><em>Dargan, </em>27 Va.App. at 498-99, 500 S.E.2d at 229-30 (quoting <em>Deagle v. Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 304, 305, 199 S.E.2d 509, 510-11 (1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">In <em>Rawls, </em>a case decided after <em>Dargan, </em>the Supreme Court held that the appellate courts \u201cha[d] not acted uniformly when determining whether a defendant, who received an improper sentence, was entitled to a new sentencing hearing.\u201d 278 Va. at 220, 683 S.E.2d at 548. In <em>Rawls, </em>the Supreme Court adopted a rule</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-8\">that is designed to ensure that all criminal defendants whose punishments have been fixed in violation of the statutorily prescribed ranges are treated uniformly without any speculation. We hold that a sentence imposed in violation of a prescribed statutory range of punishment is void <em>ab initio </em>because \u201cthe character of the judgment was not such as the [Cjourt had the power to render.\u201d <em>Anthony v. Kasey, 83 </em>Va. 338, 340, 5 S.E. 176, 177 (1887); <em>accord Evans v. Smyth-Wythe Airport Comm\u2019n, </em>255 Va. 69, 73, 495 S.E.2d 825, 828 (1998). Thus, a criminal defendant in that situation is entitled to a new sentencing hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 221, 683 S.E.2d at 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-10\">Consistent with <em>Rawls, </em>this Court has no authority to strike the excessive portion of appellant\u2019s sentences for unlawful wounding and impose the statutory maximum sentence for each conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-11\"><em>Hines </em>does not compel a different result. The trial court sentenced Hines to twenty years\u2019 incarceration for each of two robbery convictions and ten years\u2019 incarceration for one conviction of use of a firearm. Hines asserted on appeal to this Court that the trial court erred by imposing a ten-year sentence for the use of a firearm conviction. He argued that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 established the maximum sentence to be three years\u2019 incarceration. On appeal, this Court held that the trial court erred by imposing a ten-year sentence for the use of a firearm conviction, concluding that the \u201cmandatory minimum\u201d language of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 provided that the trial court could sentence a defendant <em>only </em>to a mandatory term of imprisonment of three years for the first conviction. The case was remanded \u201cwith instructions for entry of an order consistent with this opinion,\u201d but was not remanded for a new sentencing hearing. <em>Hines, </em>59 Va.App. at 581, 721 S.E.2d at 798.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-5\">Ordinarily, \u201ca criminal defendant ... is entitled to a new sentencing hearing\u201d where \u201ca sentence [is] imposed in violation of a prescribed statutory range of punishment.\u201d <em>Rawls, </em>278 Va. at 221, 683 S.E.2d at 549. However, because a term of three years imprisonment is the <em>only available sentence </em>for the trial court to impose, a new sentencing hearing is unnecessary. Accordingly, we need not remand for a new sentencing hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 581 n. 7, 721 S.E.2d at 798 n. 7 (emphasis added) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Here, unlike in <em>Hines, </em>the five-year maximum sentence for unlawful wounding is not \u201cthe only available sentence for the trial court to impose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-10(f) provides the trial court with the discretion to impose, \u201c[f]or Class 6 felonies, a term of imprisonment of not less than one year nor more than five years, or in the discretion of ... the court ..., confinement in jail for not more than 12 ^months and a fine of not more than $2,500, either or both.\u201d Neither Code \u00a7 18.2\u201410(f) nor Code \u00a7 18.2-51 compels the trial court to impose the maximum term of incarceration for unlawful wounding. While, on remand, the trial court is free to impose the maximum term of incarceration, it is not required to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>Because this Court can only speculate as to the sentence the trial court might impose on remand for each conviction of unlawful wounding, a Class 6 felony, using the correct statutory sentencing range, we remand each case to the trial court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b728-8\">. Appellant appealed her convictions in all three cases. On October 31, 2012, this Court granted her an appeal limited to one assignment of error which pertained only to the unlawful wounding convictions. <em>Gordon v. Commonwealth, </em>No. 0940-12-2 (Va.Ct.App. Oct. 31, 2012). Accordingly, appellant\u2019s conviction of petit larceny is not before us on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b728-9\">. The trial court sentenced appellant to twelve months' incarceration for petit larceny, with all twelve months suspended.
