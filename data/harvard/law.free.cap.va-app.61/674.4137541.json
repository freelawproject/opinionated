On appeal, appellant only challenges the amount of restitution ordered on Indictment No. 01431-11, grand larceny.

Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 1, 11, 492 S.E.2d 826, 831 (1997) (quoting <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">As part of the stipulated evidence at trial, the Commonwealth proffered that the following items were stolen from L.F.\u2019s (the victim) home: \u201csilver necklaces, 61; three gold bangles; bracelets, three of them; 19 times 7 earrings, pairs of earrings, and a gold ring with diamonds.\u201d At the sentencing hearing, the Commonwealth proffered the value of the items stolen from L.F.\u2019s house in order to determine the amount of restitution. The following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-7\">THE COURT: What items have you been advised by the insurance company that you are missing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-8\">THE WITNESS: Oh my gosh, Judge, I couldn\u2019t begin to tell you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-9\">THE COURT: Does the Commonwealth have a list?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-10\">[COMMONWEALTH]: Your Honor, I have a list of the items that were recovered. [L.F.] was able to make an assessment of what was not recovered and it was about two thousand dollars worth of items that weren\u2019t recovered after he had gone to the pawnshop.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-11\">THE COURT: Do you have a list of those items?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-12\">[COMMONWEALTH]: I can see whether or not I have a list. I have photographs of just about everything. And the officer has a comprehensive list.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>THE COURT: Do you have a copy of whatever you submitted to the insurance company?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-5\">THE WITNESS: Yes, I do. I turned it into the police officer right away as well as my insurance company. I think the detective may have a list as well. That\u2019s how they knew some of the things they had retrieved were mine because I had identified them.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Appellant did not cross-examine L.F. on her testimony concerning the value of the stolen property.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">The trial court sentenced appellant and ordered restitution in the amount of $2,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">Appellant contends the evidence of L.F.\u2019s loss is speculative, therefore failing to meet the burden of proving the amount of loss by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-11\">\u2018When considering a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction, [an appellate court] reviews \u2018the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party at trial and considers] all inferences fairly deducible from that evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Clark v. Commonwealth, </em>279 Va. 636, 640, 691 S.E.2d 786, 788 (2010) (quoting <em>Jones v. Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number><em>wealth, </em>276 Va. 121, 124, 661 S.E.2d 412, 414 (2008)). We \u201cwill not set aside the factual findings of the trial court unless those findings are \u2018plainly wrong or without supporting evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>52 Va.App. 194, 197, 662 S.E.2d 627, 628-29 (2008) (quoting <em>Foster v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 549, 554, 567 S.E.2d 547, 549 (2002)). Further, the fact finder, \u201cwho has the opportunity to see and hear the witnesses, has the sole responsibility to determine their credibility, the weight to be given their testimony, and the inferences to be drawn from proven facts.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Taylor, </em>256 Va. 514, 518, 506 S.E.2d 312, 314 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">\u201cAt the time of sentencing, the court shall determine the amount to be repaid by the defendant and the terms and conditions thereof.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-305.1(D)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>; <em>see also Alger v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 252, 257, 450 S.E.2d 765, 768 (1994).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-6\">A trial court has \u201cwide latitude\u201d to make sentencing decisions such as the ordering of restitution, <em>Deal v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 157, 160, 421 S.E.2d 897, 899 (1992), because \u201c[tjhe determination of sentencing lies within the sound discretion of the trial court,\u201d <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 733, 735, 652 S.E.2d 109, 111 (2007). \u201cA sentencing decision will not be reversed unless the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cOn appeal, where the restitutionary amount is supported by a preponderance of the evidence and is \u2018reasonable in relation to the nature of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>the offense,\u2019 the determination of the trial court will not be reversed.\u201d <em>McCullough v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 811, 817, 568 S.E.2d 449, 451-52 (2002) (quoting <em>Deal, </em>15 Va.App. at 160-61, 421 S.E.2d at 899); <em>see Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>52 Va.App. 26, 30 n. 2, 660 S.E.2d 691, 693 n. 2 (2008) (noting the well-established preponderance of the evidence standard that is to be used when determining the amount of restitution). Furthermore, \u201c \u2018[o]nly when reasonable jurists could not differ can we say an abuse of discretion has occurred.\u2019 \u201d <em>Grattan v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 602, 620, 685 S.E.2d 634, 644 (2009) (quoting <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 741, 753, 607 S.E.2d 738, 743 (2005)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-4\"><em>Burriesci v. Commonwealth, </em>59 Va.App. 50, 55-56, 717 S.E.2d 140, 143 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">In <em>Smith, </em>52 Va.App. 26, 660 S.E.2d 691, we upheld the \u201csettled principle that a victim of theft may offer his own opinion on the value of the stolen property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30, 660 S.E.2d at 693. In that case, we concluded that the trial court was not wrong to rely on victim loss statements, or to use them in fashioning the restitution award. <em>Id. </em>at 33, 660 S.E.2d at 694. Essentially, the <em>Smith </em>Court restated the principle that at sentencing, the court, \u201c \u2018in determining the appropriate amount of restitution, may consider hearsay evidence that bears \u201cminimal indicia of reliability\u201d so long as the defendant is given an opportunity to refute that evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Bourne, </em>130 F.3d 1444, 1447 (11th Cir.1997)) (other citation omitted). We should note that appellant offered no such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">While L.F.\u2019s list of stolen items was not offered into evidence, that fact would be considered by the fact finder as to the weight of the evidence. L.F. prepared the list and certainly knew of its accuracy. A sentencing court may appropriately consider hearsay \u201cto establish an appropriate amount of restitution.\u201d <em>McCullough, </em>38 Va.App. at 816, 568 S.E.2d at 451. <em>See also </em>6 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 26.5(a), at 802 (3d ed.2007) (observing that \u201cthe sentencing court can consider other types of hearsay, whether contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>in the presentence report or offered by the prosecution or defense\u201d). \u201cThis broad rule of inclusion is tempered by the requirement that the information bear some indicia of reliability.\u201d <em>Moses v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 293, 302, 498 S.E.2d 451, 456 (1998) (citing <em>Alger, </em>19 Va.App. at 258, 450 S.E.2d at 768).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">L.F.\u2019s list, an unsworn \u201cout of court\u201d statement, was the type of statement allowed as evidence of the victim\u2019s loss.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARB\">\u201cTribunals passing on the guilt of a defendant always have been hedged in by strict evidentiary procedural limitations. But both before and since the American colonies became a nation, courts in this country and in England practiced a policy under which a sentencing judge could exercise a wide discretion in the sources and types of evidence used to assist him in determining the kind and extent of punishment to be imposed within limits fixed by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-6\"><em>McClain v. Commonwealth, </em>189 Va. 847, 859-60, 55 S.E.2d 49, 55 (1949) (quoting <em>Williams v. New York, </em>337 U.S. 241, 246, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 1082, 93 L.Ed. 1337 (1949)).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">L.F.\u2019s list clearly bears \u201csome indicia of reliability.\u201d She assessed the value of the stolen items not recovered, and she gave that information to her insurance carrier and the police. The prosecutor proffered without objection that the police officer \u201chas a comprehensive list\u201d and that this assessment of the items was \u201cabout two thousand dollars.... \u201d L.F. submitted the list to the police as part of their investigation of the crime, and to L.F.\u2019s insurance carrier as part of her claim. It is reasonable to believe that L.F. provided her insurance company with an accurate claim of loss. <em>See Allstate Insurance Co. v. Chanty, </em>255 Va. 55, 59, 496 S.E.2d 430, 431-32 (1998) (\u201c[T]he purpose of a proof of loss is to enable the insurer to investigate the insured\u2019s losses, to estimate its rights and liabilities, and to prevent assertion of fraudulent or unjust claims.\u201d). Further, the trial court could reasonably infer that L.F. would not exaggerate her claim of loss and risk the chance of her insurance carrier denying her claim altogether. <em>See C.C. Vaughan &amp; Co. v. Va. Fire &amp; Marine Ins. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number><em>Co., </em>102 Va. 541, 545, 46 S.E. 692, 694 (1904) (\u201c[NJothing is better settled than that the assured must observe, in dealing with the insurer, the utmost good faith, without which there can be no recovery.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">As in <em>Smith, </em>appellant did not cross-examine L.F. on the values contained in the list but had the opportunity to do so. At oral argument, appellant contended he never had an opportunity to cross-examine L.F. as to the value of the stolen property because the list prepared for the police and the insurance carrier was not before the court. This contention is unpersuasive and is belied by the record. L.F. was on the stand. She acknowledged she had prepared such a list and provided the list to the police and the insurance carrier. The Commonwealth proffered that the list indicated \u201cabout two thousand dollars.... \u201d Appellant certainly could have inquired of L.F. the specific items stolen or how she determined value. If appellant thought he needed to review the actual list, he could have asked for its production or asked for a continuance for such a review. He did nothing. Thus, it is apparent from the record that appellant had an opportunity to cross-examine L.F. as to the values of the items stolen, but chose not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">We find the restitution evidence to be supported by a preponderance of the evidence. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding the contested restitution to L.F.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b719-15\">. In his brief, appellant also assigns error to the restitution awarded in Indictment No. 01418-11 and the court's active sentence of eight years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>and three months. While these issues were presented in appellant's petition for appeal, this Court denied those assignments of error by <em>per curiam </em>order dated November 8, 2012. \"Only those arguments presented in the petition for appeal and granted by this Court will be considered on appeal.\u201d <em>McLean v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 322, 329, 516 S.E.2d 717, 720 (1999) <em>(en banc). </em>Therefore, we do not consider those issues here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b720-14\">. Appellant did not object to this proffer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b721-12\">. The list mentioned was not introduced into evidence and therefore is not part of this record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b721-13\">. To the extent appellant argues his due process rights were violated by the trial court not adhering to this standard, this argument is waived because that argument was not raised at trial. Rule 5A: 18 is clear that \"[n]o ruling of the trial court ... will be considered as a basis for reversal unless an objection was stated with reasonable certainty at the time of the ruling....\u201d Indeed, \"[i]n order to preserve an issue for appeal, 'an objection must be timely made and the grounds stated with specificity.' \" <em>McDuffie v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 170, 177, 638 S.E.2d 139, 142 (2006) (quoting <em>Marlowe v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 619, 621, 347 S.E.2d 167, 168 (1986)). If a party fails to timely and specifically object, he waives his argument on appeal. <em>Arrington v. Commonwealth, </em>53 Va.App. 635, 674 S.E.2d 554 (2009).
