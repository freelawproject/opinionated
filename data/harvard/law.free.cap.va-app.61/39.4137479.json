Appellant contends that the Circuit Court of Fairfax County (\u201ctrial court\u201d) erred by not withholding a finding of guilt and deferring disposition of his charges for future dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">On March 21, 2011, a Fairfax County grand jury indicted appellant for possession with intent to distribute ecstasy and possession with intent to distribute LSD.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At a hearing before the trial court on June 15, 2011, appellant pled guilty to both indictments. The trial court accepted appellant\u2019s \u201cpleas of guilty and made them a part of the record after making specific inquiries of [appellant] and determining that the pleas were made voluntarily and with full understanding of the nature of the charges and the consequences of the pleas.\u201d The trial court found there was \u201coverwhelming and sufficient evidence for a finding of guilt.\u201d However, at appellant\u2019s request, the trial court \u201cwithheld a finding of guilt pending sentencing ... to permit [c]ounsel for [appellant] to make an argument related to the Supreme Court of Virginia\u2019s decision in <em>[Hernandez v. Commonwealth, </em>281 Va. 222, 707 S.E.2d 273 (2011)].\u201d The trial court continued the case to October 28, 2011 for argument and sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">Two days prior to the sentencing hearing, appellant filed a memorandum seeking \u201cto not become a convicted felon.\u201d Specifically, appellant requested that the trial court \u201cwithhold a finding of guilt on the charges in this matter and continue this case for a period of time, place [appellant] on terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>release, and upon review, consider whether to dismiss the case without any convictions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">At his sentencing hearing on October 28, 2011, appellant confirmed that his \u201centire purpose\u201d in seeking a deferred disposition was \u201cin the hope that, based on [his] good behavior and other proof of rehabilitation, that [the trial court] would ultimately dismiss the charges.\u201d The trial court found that, pursuant to <em>Hernandez, </em>it \u201c[unquestionably\u201d had the authority to continue the disposition of the case. However, the trial court concluded it had \u201cno authority now or later to <em>dismiss </em>the case.\u201d (Emphasis added). The trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-6\">I want to be absolutely clear that I am not exercising my discretion here; I find I do not have discretion. I have discretion to continue this; I can absolutely continue this for two years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-7\">But at the end of two years, my only option would be to sentence [appellant] on the charges in which he entered pleas of guilty. And, as [appellant\u2019s counsel] has confirmed, the whole purpose in seeking the deferral is ultimately to obtain a dismissal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">The trial court, citing <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>58 Va.App. 435, 440, 445, 449, 710 S.E.2d 518, 520, 523, 525 (2011), concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-9\">[I]n my view I do not have the authority, absent a Commonwealth motion, ever to dismiss a case where the defendant has entered a plea of guilty. <em>Taylor </em>is on point because in <em>Taylor </em>the evidence established the defendant\u2019s guilt, and here [appellant\u2019s] plea establishes [his] guilt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-10\">* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-11\">Given that [appellant] has admitted his guilt and has entered a guilty plea and the Commonwealth has proffered sufficient evidence in support of his plea, I could not find that the evidence was lacking and warranted dismissal. And if dismissal is not an option, there\u2019s no bona fide reason to defer disposition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Accordingly, the trial court entered a finding of guilt and convicted appellant of possession with intent to distribute ecstasy and possession with intent to distribute LSD, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248(A). The trial court sentenced appellant to five years\u2019 imprisonment on each charge, ordered the sentences to run concurrently, and suspended the entire length of confinement for each sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">II. ANALYSIS<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred by finding it did not \u201cha[ve] the authority to withhold a finding of guilt and defer adjudication in [appellant\u2019s] case for possible future dismissal of the charges.\u201d Opening Br. at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Whether the trial court erred by concluding it did not have the authority to withhold a finding of guilt and to defer appellant\u2019s adjudication in order to dismiss the indictment against him is a pure question of law that this Court reviews <em>de novo. Moreau v. Fuller, </em>276 Va. 127, 133, 661 S.E.2d 841, 845 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>As recognized by this Court in <em>Epps v. Commonwealth, </em>59 Va.App. 71, 717 S.E.2d 151 (2011), the Supreme Court in <em>Hernandez </em>held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-5\"><em>\u201cduring the interval between the conclusion of the evidence and the entry of a written order adjudicating the defendant guilty, </em>the circuit court ha[s] the inherent power, in the exercise of its discretion, to take the matter under advisement and to continue the case for future disposition, subject to such lawful conditions as the court might prescribe.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 81, 717 S.E.2d at 156 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Hernandez, </em>281 Va. at 226, 707 S.E.2d at 275). The Supreme Court expressly held that \u201cthe mere statement by a judge that the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction\u201d did not preclude deferred disposition because it did not constitute a \u201cformal adjudication of guilt.\u201d <em>Hernandez, </em>281 Va. at 225-26, 707 S.E.2d at 275. Appellant contends the trial court erred by not deferring his disposition for future dismissal, arguing that, pursuant to <em>Hernandez, </em>\u201ca trial court has the inherent authority to withhold a written order of adjudication, take the matter under advisement, and defer disposition to another date <em>in contemplation of a dismissal.\u201d </em>Opening Br. at 5-6 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">Contrary to appellant\u2019s assertion, however, the Supreme Court in <em>Hernandez </em>explicitly declined to address \u201cthe question whether a court may defer judgment and continue a case <em>with a promise of a particular disposition </em>at a later date.\u201d <em>Hernandez, </em>281 Va. at 225, 707 S.E.2d at 274 (emphasis added). In <em>Taylor, </em>this Court emphasized \u201cthe limited scope of ... <em>Hernandez</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-8\">In short, <em>Moreau </em>and <em>Hernandez </em>merely hold a trial court has the discretion to continue a case for a future disposition. Neither ease addresses what future disposition the court has authority to impose. In other words, neither <em>Moreau </em>nor <em>Hernandez </em>addressed whether the decision ultimately made by the trial court, after the discretionary continuance, could be one <em>acquitting a criminal defendant whose guilt was proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number><em>Taylor, 58 </em>Va.App. at 449-50, 710 S.E.2d at 525 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">This Court, addressing the question left open in <em>Hernandez, </em>concluded that a trial court \u201cha[s] no authority\u2014constitutional, common law, or statutory\u2014to acquit\u201d a defendant \u201cafter finding the evidence proved [his] guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 450, 710 S.E.2d at 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">As a practical matter, in the wake of <em>Hernandez </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>trial courts may, notwithstanding a finding of guilt, take a matter under advisement for a variety of long-accepted purposes. For example, courts may, before entering a written order of guilt, examine cases cited by the parties, consider motions for a new trial, or review testimony or notes taken on the bench, in order to ensure the conclusion the court has reached on a point of law or on the facts is correct. What courts may not do, in the absence of a statutory grant of authority, is defer disposition upon set terms and, upon satisfaction of those terms, later acquit a defendant who was determined to be guilty of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Appellant seeks to distinguish the holding in <em>Taylor </em>from the facts presented in the record on appeal by noting that Taylor moved the trial court to defer disposition and dismiss the felony charge against her <em>after </em>the court entered a written order finding her guilty. <em>Id. </em>Here, appellant moved the trial court to defer disposition and to dismiss the charges against him <em>prior </em>to the trial court\u2019s entry of a written order adjudicating him guilty. Appellant contends this distinction afforded the trial court the discretion, prior to the entry of a written order adjudicating him guilty, to defer disposition and dismiss the charges against him. <em>See Hernandez, </em>281 Va. at 226, 707 S.E.2d at 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Appellant correctly states that <em>Taylor </em>held that a trial court has no discretion \u201cto acquit a criminal defendant <em>after </em>finding the evidence proved [his] guilt.\u201d <em>Taylor, 58 </em>Va.App. at 448, 710 S.E.2d at 522 (emphasis added). Similarly, this Court in <em>Epps </em>held that a trial court does not have discretion, <em>after </em>entering a written order adjudicating the defendant guilty, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>later \u201cvacate [the defendant\u2019s] conviction solely as an act of judicial clemency.\u201d 59 Va.App. at 84, 717 S.E.2d at 157. However, appellant disregards the rationale articulated by the Court in <em>Taylor </em>and <em>Epps, </em>namely, that \u201cnothing in the separation-of-powers doctrine suggests a court has the inherent power to acquit a defendant of a crime that the evidence proved beyond a reasonable doubt [he] committed.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>58 Va.App. at 440, 710 S.E.2d at 520; <em>see also id. </em>at 441, 710 S.E.2d at 521 (\u201c[A] court simply has no \u2018authority to free guilty defendants,\u2019 whose guilt was proved in a lawful trial.\u201d (quoting <em>Sorrells v. United States, </em>287 U.S. 435, 449, 53 S.Ct. 210, 215, 77 L.Ed. 413 (1932))); <em>Epps, </em>59 Va.App. at 77, 717 S.E.2d at 154 (\u201c \u2018[A] Virginia court <em>cannot refuse to convict a guilty defendant </em>merely because it questions the category of offense assigned by the legislature, considers the range of statutory punishment too harsh, or believes certain guilty offenders undeserving of a criminal conviction.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Taylor, </em>58 Va.App. at 442, 710 S.E.2d at 521 (emphasis added))).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Here, appellant\u2019s \u201c \u2018voluntary and intelligent plea[s] of guilty ... [were], in reality, a self-supplied conviction authorizing imposition of the punishment fixed by law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kibert v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 660, 664, 222 S.E.2d 790, 793 (1976) (quoting <em>Peyton v. King, </em>210 Va. 194, 196, 169 S.E.2d 569, 571 (1969)). Appellant\u2019s guilty ple\u00e1s \u201c \u2018[were] a conviction or the equivalent of a conviction of the highest order, the effect of which [was] to authorize the imposition of the sentence prescribed by law on a verdict of guilty of the crime sufficiently charged in the indictment or information.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hobson v. Youell, </em>177 Va. 906, 912, 15 S.E.2d 76, 78 (1941) (quoting 14 Am.Jur. 952); <em>see also Crutchfield v. Commonwealth, </em>187 Va. 291, 296, 46 S.E.2d 340, 342 (1948) (a \u201cplea of guilty, accepted and entered by the court, is a conviction or the equivalent of a conviction of the offense to which it is directed\u201d). When the trial court accepted appellant\u2019s knowing and voluntary guilty pleas and entered his guilty pleas on the record, it thereafter had no discretion to dismiss the charges against him. <em>See Taylor, </em>58 Va.App. at 445, 710 S.E.2d at 523 (neither the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Virginia Constitution, the common law, nor Virginia statutes \u201cauthorize courts to refuse to convict a criminal defendant (for reasons wholly unrelated to guilt or innocence) where the defendant\u2019s guilt was proved beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">More broadly, appellant\u2019s argument urges us,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-6\">[i]n effect, ... to enter the domain of penology, and more particularly that tantalizing aspect of it, the proper apportionment of punishment. Whatever views may be entertained regarding severity of punishment, whether one believes in its efficacy or its futility ... these are peculiarly questions of legislative policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-7\"><em>Gore v. United States, 357 </em>U.S. 386, 393, 78 S.Ct. 1280, 1285, 2 L.Ed.2d 1405 (1958). The legislature is best situated to make the broad and complex value judgments necessary to fix the type and maximum length of sentences for particular crimes. Under our state and federal constitutions, it is also the proper branch to do so. We have previously noted the elementary fact that, in Virginia, \u201c[tjrial and appellate courts \u2018do not sit as a \u201csuper legislature\u201d to second-guess\u2019 legislative choices concerning penological policy and sentencing ranges.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 218, 226, 604 S.E.2d 122, 126 (2004) (quoting <em>Ewing v. California, </em>538 U.S. 11, 28, 123 S.Ct. 1179, 1189, 155 L.Ed.2d 108 (2003)). Consequently, we must decline appellant\u2019s invitation to rewrite a host of statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">For the reasons stated above, we conclude that the trial court did not err by finding it lacked the authority to defer appellant\u2019s disposition solely in order to dismiss the charges against him. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b85-9\">. Ecstasy and LSD are Schedule I controlled substances. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 54.1-3446(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b87-8\">. The Commonwealth initially contends that appellant waived his challenge to the trial court's ruling by pleading guilty to the charges against him. \"Where a conviction is rendered upon a voluntary and intelligent guilty plea and a punishment fixed by law is in fact imposed in a proceeding free of jurisdictional defect, there is nothing to appeal.\u201d <em>Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>59 Va.App. 710, 725, 722 S.E.2d 310, 317 (2012). However, \"[a] guilty plea waives all objections to non-jurisdictional defects that occurred <em>before </em>the [entry of the guilty] plea.\u201d <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 725, 728, 536 S.E.2d 916, 918 (2000) (emphasis added); <em>see also Tollett v. Henderson, </em>411 U.S. 258, 267, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 1608, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973) (when defendant has admitted in open court that he is guilty of the offense charged, he may not thereafter raise independent claims regarding deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred <em>prior </em>to entry of guilty plea); <em>Beaver v. Commonwealth, </em>232 Va. 521, 527, 352 S.E.2d 342, 345 (1987) (accused appealing death sentence may not complain of non-jurisdictional defects that occurred <em>prior </em>to guilty plea); <em>Hill v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 667, 673-74, 626 S.E.2d 459, 462-63 (2006) (accused appealing conviction may not challenge denial of motion to suppress that occurred <em>prior </em>to entry of guilty plea). Here, appellant assigns error to a ruling of the trial court that occurred <em>after </em>he entered his guilty pleas. Accordingly, he did not waive his challenge on appeal to the trial court\u2019s adverse ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
