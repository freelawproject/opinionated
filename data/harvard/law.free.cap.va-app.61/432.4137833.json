Moreover, both parties seek an award of appellate attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">For the following reasons, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand the matter to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">I. Background<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">, The parties married in August 1986, had three daughters during the marriage,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and separated in July 2008, at which time they resided in the City of Richmond.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Following the parties\u2019 divorce trial in December 2010, the trial court issued two letter opinions, dated February 3, 2012 and March 29, 2012. The trial court then entered the April 26, 2012 final decree, from which both parties now appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">Husband, an attorney, joined Hunton &amp; Williams in 1991 and became an equity partner there in 1994. Husband is the head of that law firm\u2019s Capital Real Estate Finance Group and is compensated at the third-highest compensation level out of the sixteen compensation levels for equity partners. Robert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>Raymond, C.P.A., who provided expert testimony for wife at the parties\u2019 divorce trial, opined that the marital value of husband\u2019s law practice at Hunton &amp; Williams was worth approximately $1,492,000. The trial court accepted this value for equitable distribution purposes, finding it was more credible than the value of $502,887 provided by husband\u2019s expert, Gregory Lawson, C.P.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Husband has three retirement accounts with Hunton &amp; Williams\u2014only one of which, the supplemental retirement plan (SRP), is pertinent to this appeal. The trial court initially found in its February 3, 2012 letter opinion that the SRP was not subject to equitable distribution because \u201cit does not vest until the future, if at all.\u201d Wife filed a written motion for reconsideration concerning this and other issues, and, following a hearing, the trial court found in the March 29, 2012 letter opinion that the SRP contained marital property. In the final decree, the trial court awarded \u201cwife 25 percent [of the SRP] under the deferred distribution method approach when and if the account is payable upon vesting.\u201d The final decree does not distinguish between the value of the marital share of the SRP and the SRP\u2019s total value.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Wife holds an undergraduate degree in economics from Duke University, <em>magna cum laude, </em>and a Master\u2019s degree in Business Administration (M.B.A.) from the University of Virginia, but she did not obtain regular employment outside the home after the parties\u2019 children were born. She was a homemaker, was the children\u2019s caretaker, and helped coordinate entertainment for husband\u2019s business interests. Husband\u2019s vocational expert, Peder Melberg, opined that wife, despite her long absence from the workforce, was employable in several fields and could foreseeably earn $85,000 annually if she were to become an established financial services representative. In addition to disputing this assessment, wife testified that she had no intention of seeking employment, explaining instead that she engages in volunteer work every day.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Wife requested $30,000 in monthly spousal support for an undefined duration. The trial court in its February 3, 2012 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>letter opinion awarded wife $10,000 in monthly spousal support for a defined, four-year period\u2014noting that this award gave wife \u201ca reasonable time to establish employment by acquiring and updating skills for entry into the job market.\u201d The trial court did not revisit this ruling in the March 29, 2012 letter opinion, although it did grant wife a reservation of future spousal support rights\u2014which was relief that wife had requested in her written motion for reconsideration and at the hearing that followed. Wife requested the presumptive length for such a reservation under Code \u00a7 20-107.1(D)\u2014i.e., one-half the length of time between the date of the marriage and the date of the separation. However, neither the March 29, 2012 letter opinion nor the April 26, 2012 final decree indicates the length of the reservation awarded to wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">At the divorce trial, wife contended that the trial court should use the date of separation\u2014-not the date of the evidentiary hearing in the trial court\u2014as the date for valuing two accounts (the Ameritrade account and the Bank of America account) that were titled in husband\u2019s name but that wife claimed were marital property. Wife alleged that husband had unfairly diminished the value of these accounts following the parties\u2019 separation\u2014thereby rendering the date of their separation a more equitable date for valuing the marital share of those accounts. Although the trial court found that the Ameritrade and Bank of America accounts were marital property, the trial court found no good cause for valuing these accounts as of the date of the parties\u2019 separation. The trial court recognized in its March 29, 2012 letter opinion that wife\u2019s argument dealt with marital \u201cequity, not waste,\u201d but the trial court found that husband\u2019s use of the Ameritrade and Bank of America funds was proper under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">A. Husband\u2019s Appeal (Record No. 0947-12-2)</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">1. Issues Relating to the Reservation of Spousal Support Rights</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">In his first two assignments of error, husband challenges the trial court\u2019s decision to reserve wife\u2019s right to receive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>spousal support in the future. Thus, to address these assignments of error on appeal, we must consider the spousal support statute, Code \u00a7 20-107.1, which states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">C. The [trial] court, in its discretion, may decree that maintenance and support of a spouse be made in periodic payments for a defined duration, or in periodic payments for an undefined duration, or in a lump sum award, or in any combination thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">D. In addition to or in lieu of an award pursuant to subsection C, the court may reserve the right of a party to receive support in the future.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In any case in which the right to support is so reserved, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the reservation will continue for a period equal to 50 percent of the length of time between the date of the marriage and the date of separation. Once granted, the duration of such a reservation shall not be subject to modification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">(Footnote added).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">\n<em>a. Decision to Award Wife the Reservation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">In his first assignment of error, husband argues that wife abandoned any claim to a reservation of spousal support rights under Code \u00a7 20-107.1(D) because she did not specifically request a reservation of spousal support rights in her divorce complaint, in any of her notices or other pleadings filed with the trial court prior to the divorce trial, or during the parties\u2019 divorce trial. Instead, wife first requested a reservation of spousal support rights in her motion to reconsider the trial court\u2019s February 3, 2012 letter opinion. Following a hearing on the motion to reconsider, the trial court then awarded wife this reservation in its subsequent March 29, 2012 letter opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Husband recognizes that \u201c[decisions concerning [spousal] support rest within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed on appeal unless plainly wrong or unsupported by the evidence.\u201d <em>Calvert v. Calvert, </em>18 Va.App. 781, 784, 447 S.E.2d 875, 876 (1994). Husband argues that the trial court\u2019s decision to award wife a reservation of spousal support rights here was plainly wrong. Husband claims that the trial court should have ruled that wife\u2019s request simply came too late in the proceedings. However, husband\u2019s argument is foreclosed by this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Vissicchio v. Vissicchio, </em>27 Va.App. 240, 498 S.E.2d 425 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">In <em>Vissicchio, </em>one of the parties (Mrs. Vissicchio) requested permanent spousal support in her pleadings and continued to request spousal support at trial. When Mrs. Vissicchio\u2019s counsel submitted the draft decree to the trial court, the draft decree included a reservation of future spousal support rights for her. The trial court then deleted this specific provision from the final decree, without explaining why it had denied a reservation of spousal support rights for Mrs. Vissicchio. <em>Id. </em>at 254, 498 S.E.2d at 432. On appeal, this Court held that the trial court in <em>Vissicchio </em>committed reversible error. This Court explained that Mrs. Vissicchio\u2019s request for a reservation of spousal support rights was implicit in her request for spousal support, that there was no legal barrier to Mrs. Vissicchio receiving spousal support, and that the trial court erred in refusing her request in the draft decree to reserve the right to receive spousal support in the event of a change in circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 254-55, 498 S.E.2d at 432-33 (citing <em>Blank v. Blank, </em>10 Va.App. 1, 4, 389 S.E.2d 723, 724 (1990); <em>Bacon v. Bacon, </em>3 Va.App. 484, 491, 351 S.E.2d 37, 41 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Here, wife (like Mrs. Vissicchio) requested an award of spousal support in her divorce complaint. <em>See Vissicchio, </em>27 Va.App. at 254, 498 S.E.2d at 432; <em>cf. Harrell v. Harrell, </em>272 Va. 652, 658, 636 S.E.2d 391, 395 (2006) (\u201cMs. Harrell had no valid pleading before the trial court requesting permanent spousal support. <em>Without such a pleading, </em>it was error for the trial court to grant a reservation of spousal support to her pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-107.1(D).\u201d (emphasis added)). Fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>thermore, as in <em>Vissicchio, </em>the record on appeal contains no legal barrier prohibiting wife from receiving spousal support. <em>See Vissicchio, </em>27 Va.App. at 254, 498 S.E.2d at 432. The parties here specifically agreed in a consent decree that neither party was barred from seeking spousal support. Moreover, as in <em>Vissicchio, </em>a request for a reservation of spousal support rights was communicated to the trial court in time for it to act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Neither <em>Vissicchio </em>nor any other authority relied upon by husband supports his argument that a request for a reservation of spousal support rights made in a motion for reconsideration is untimely (when, as here, that party has already requested spousal support in his or her pleadings and there is no bar prohibiting that party from receiving spousal support). Given these circumstances, the trial court\u2019s decision to award wife a reservation of spousal support rights was appropriate under this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Vissicchio </em>and did not constitute an abuse of its discretion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">\n<em>b. Duration of the Reservation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">In his second assignment of error, husband argues that, even if the trial court had authority to award wife a reservation of spousal support rights, the trial court still committed reversible error because the duration of the awarded reserva<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>tion is unclear from the trial court\u2019s rulings on this subject and could be construed to have no end date. We agree with husband\u2019s interpretation of the trial court\u2019s March 29, 2012 letter opinion and April 26, 2012 final decree (neither of which indicates the duration of the spousal support reservation)\u2014 and also agree with husband\u2019s argument that the trial court committed reversible error on this specific issue under the circumstances presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Code \u00a7 20-107.1(D) states that \u201cthere shall be a rebuttable presumption that the reservation will continue for a period equal to 50 percent of the length of time between the date of the marriage and the date of separation.\u201d The parties here were married in August 1986, and the trial court found that they separated in July 2008\u2014a span of nearly twenty-two years. Thus, under Code \u00a7 20-107.1(D), there exists a rebut-table presumption that the appropriate period for a reservation of wife\u2019s spousal support rights equals one-half of the period from the date of marriage to the date of separation\u2014 i.e., nearly eleven years in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">A rebuttable presumption \u201cmay be overcome by the introduction of contrary evidence.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1205 (7th ed.1999); <em>see Miller v. Commonwealth, </em>172 Va. 639, 651, 2 S.E.2d 343, 348 (1939) (stating that a non-conclusive presumption \u201cmay be rebutted or overcome with opposing or contradictory evidence\u201d). Even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to wife as the prevailing party on this issue in the trial court, the record on appeal does not support rebutting the statutory presumption of Code \u00a7 20-107.1(D) that \u201cthe reservation will continue for a period equal to 50 percent of the length of time between the date of the marriage and the date of separation.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Indeed, wife never requested the trial court to order a reservation of spousal support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>duration longer than the presumptive period under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Accordingly, we must reverse the portion of the final decree pertaining to the reservation of wife\u2019s future spousal support rights, as the statutory presumptive reservation period set forth in Code \u00a7 20-107.1(D) was not rebutted. We remand the matter to the trial court for a \u201cclear and explicit\u201d ruling on the appropriate length of the reservation of spousal support rights awarded to wife based on the circumstances of this case. <em>Poliquin v. Poliquin, </em>12 Va.App. 676, 681, 406 S.E.2d 401, 404 (1991). On remand, the trial court shall award wife a reservation of spousal support rights for a period no longer than the statutory presumptive period of one-half of the length of time between the date of the marriage and the date of separation\u2014which was the relief wife sought in her written motion for reconsideration and at the hearing on wife\u2019s motion for reconsideration. <em>See Irwin v. Irwin, </em>47 Va.App. 287, 298 n. 10, 623 S.E.2d 438, 444 n. 10 (2005) (\u201cCourts can only grant relief requested.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">2. Issues Relating to Equitable Distribution</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Among the requirements of the equitable distribution statute, Code \u00a7 20-107.3, a trial court shall \u201cdetermine the legal title as between the parties, and the ownership and value of all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, of the parties and shall consider which of such property is separate property, which is marital property, and which is part separate and part marital\u201d property. Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A). Thus, Code \u00a7 20-107.3 \u201c \u2018mandates\u2019 that trial courts determine the ownership and value of all real and personal property of the parties.\u201d <em>Bowers v. Bowers, 4 </em>Va.App. 610, 617, 359 S.E.2d 546, 550 (1987) (quoting <em>Hodges v. Hodges, </em>2 Va.App. 508, 516, 347 S.E.2d 134, 139 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">\u201cIn reviewing an equitable distribution award on appeal, we have recognized that the trial court\u2019s job is a difficult one, and we rely heavily on the discretion of the trial judge in weighing the many considerations and circumstances that are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>presented in each case.\u201d <em>Klein v. Klein, </em>11 Va.App. 155, 161, 396 S.E.2d 866, 870 (1990). Accordingly, \u201cdecisions concerning equitable distribution rest within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed on appeal unless plainly wrong or unsupported by the evidence.\u201d <em>McDavid v. McDavid, </em>19 Va.App. 406, 407-08, 451 S.E.2d 713, 715 (1994); <em>see Srinivasan v. Srinivasan, </em>10 Va.App. 728, 732, 396 S.E.2d 675, 678 (1990). Moreover, \u201c[i]t is well established that the trier of fact ascertains a witness\u2019 credibility, determines the weight to be given to their testimony, and has the discretion to accept or reject any of the witness\u2019 testimony.\u201d <em>Street v. Street, </em>25 Va.App. 380, 387, 488 S.E.2d 665, 668 (1997) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">\n<em>a. The Hunton &amp; Williams SRP</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">In his third assignment of error, husband argues that the trial court erred in finding that the Hunton &amp; Williams SRP contains marital property when and if it vests. In his fourth assignment of error, husband argues that, even if part of the SRP\u2019s value can be classified as marital when and if it vests, the trial court erred in awarding wife twenty-five percent of its entire value\u2014as opposed to a percentage of <em>the marital share of its value. The </em>parties agree that these assignments of error concern Code \u00a7 20-107.3, which states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-6\">The [trial] court may direct payment of <em>a percentage of the marital share of any pension, profit-sharing or deferred compensation plan or retirement benefits, whether vested or nonvested, which constitutes marital property </em>and whether payable in a lump sum or over a period of time. The court may order direct payment of such percentage of the marital share by direct assignment to a party from the employer trustee, plan administrator or other holder of the benefits. However, the court shall only direct that payment be made as such benefits are payable. No such payment shall exceed 50 percent of the marital share of the cash benefits actually received by the party against whom such award is made. <em>\u201cMarital share\u201d means that portion of the total </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number><em>interest, the right to which was earned during the marriage and before the last separation of the parties, </em>if at such time or thereafter at least one of the parties intended that the separation be permanent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Code \u00a7 20-107.3(0(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">\n<em>i. Whether a Marital Share can be Determined</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">\u25a0 The trial court classified the SRP as \u201cmarital property\u201d and found, therefore, that the SRP was subject to equitable distribution under Code \u00a7 20-107.3(0(1), even though husband\u2019s eligibility to receive retirement benefits under the SRP has not yet vested. The trial court\u2019s finding that the SRP contains marital property (\u201cwhen and if the account is payable upon vesting\u201d) is accorded deference on appeal because it was a factual finding by the trial court. \u201cBecause the trial court\u2019s classification of property is a finding of fact, that classification will not be reversed on appeal unless it is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Ranney v. Ranney, </em>45 Va.App. 17, 31-32, 608 S.E.2d 485, 492 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to wife, as we must since she was the prevailing party below on this issue, the trial court\u2019s classification of the SRP was supported by evidence in the record on appeal. Testifying for wife, Mr. Raymond explained that the SRP is \u201ca nonqualified plan\u201d under which husband was eligible to receive \u201cabout [$0125,000 a year for five to seven years,\u201d subject to some limitations. These limitations were explained by John Wilson (Hunton <em>&amp; </em>Williams\u2019 Director of Financing and Accounting) and J. Waverly Pulley, III (a member of Hunton &amp; Williams\u2019 Executive Committee), who testified as husband\u2019s witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">Mr. Wilson testified that Hunton &amp; Williams equity partners have no immediate right or entitlement to benefits under the SRP prior to their retirement at age sixty-five and also testified that, \u201cin order to get the SRP, if they retire before the age of 65, they have to have the Executive Committee\u2019s approval to retire.\u201d Mr. Wilson stated that the benefits payable under the SRP amount to \u201ca percentage of the high <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>five share of profits, up to a maximum of $125,000 for five years if you retire at 65\u201d\u2014explaining that the \u201chigh five share\u201d is the \u201caverage of the five highest [years of] earnings\u201d from that equity partner.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Mr. Pulley described the SRP provision as a benefit offered to equity partners as \u201csort of a carrot to stay\u201d at Hunton <em>&amp; </em>Williams. Mr. Pulley testified that \u201c[a]ge 65 is the trigger\u201d <em>for </em>SRP eligibility, adding that \u201cthere\u2019s always a measure of discretion in the Executive Committee as to whether to award the SRP even if you\u2019re age 65.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Mr. Pulley mentioned only one additional requirement for eligibility under the SRP (aside from retiring at age sixty-five)\u2014that an equity partner who has retired from Hunton &amp; Williams must honor a non-compete agreement in order to receive benefits under the SRP. Thus, Mr. Pulley characterized husband\u2019s eligibility to receive benefits under the SRP as \u201cpresumptive if he\u2019s a good boy.\u201d On cross-examination, Mr. Pulley testified that, to his knowledge, no Hunton &amp; Williams equity partner had retired at age sixty-five and not received benefits under the SRP.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">The plain language of Code \u00a7 20-107.3(G)(l) authorizes trial courts to \u201cdirect payment of a percentage of the marital share of <em>any pension, profit-sharing or deferred compensation plan or retirement benefits, whether vested or nonvested, </em>which constitutes marital property and whether payable in a lump sum or over a period of time.\u201d (Emphasis added). Virginia\u2019s courts must apply the \u201ccardinal rule of statutory construction\u201d that \u201ca statute be construed from its four corners,\u201d <em>First Virginia Bank v. O\u2019Leary, </em>251 Va. 308, 312, 467 S.E.2d 775, 777 (1996), and courts may never construe statutory language \u201cin a way that effectively holds that the General Assembly did not mean what it actually expressed,\u201d <em>Hicks v. Mellis, </em>275 Va. 213, 218, 657 S.E.2d 142, 144 (2008). Both this Court and the Supreme Court have recognized that Code \u00a7 20-107.3(G) reflects the General Assembly\u2019s \u201cintention to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>treat uniformly <em>all plans of compensation, </em>whether payable upon retirement or not, if payment is deferred to the future but earned during the marriage.\u201d <em>Dietz v.

We disagree with husband\u2019s contention that benefits under the Hunton &amp; Williams SRP are not only not yet vested, but are also entirely <em>unearned, </em>until they are actually awarded by the Hunton &amp; Williams Executive Committee following the equity partner\u2019s retirement. This contention does not give due consideration to the fact that one must first <em>become </em>and then <em>remain </em>an equity partner at Hunton &amp; Williams even to become potentially eligible to receive SRP benefits. Given Mr. Pulley\u2019s testimony describing the SRP as \u201ca carrot\u201d offered to equity partners to convince them \u201cto stay\u201d at Hunton &amp; Williams, the evidence supports a reasonable inference that SRP benefits are continually being <em>earned, </em>by the equity partner and are eventually paid as a \u201creturn for work done or services rendered.\u201d <em>See Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>714 (1981) (defining \u201cearn\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to wife, her efforts contributed to husband\u2019s successful efforts to attain an equity partnership with Hunton &amp; Williams and then to his continuing efforts to grow his very successful real estate investment trust practice there.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Husband became an equity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>partner <em>in </em>Hunton &amp; Williams back in 1994\u2014eight years into the marriage. The parties separated in 2008. Although husband\u2019s eligibility to receive SRP benefits is conditioned upon his continued employment as an equity partner at Hun-ton &amp; Williams, husband became an equity partner during the marriage and then maintained equity partner status for a span of fourteen years prior to the date of the parties\u2019 separation. The evidence supports a finding that some reasonably identifiable portion of the SRP\u2019s value in retirement benefits (when and if they become payable) \u201cwas earned during the marriage and before the last separation of the parties\u201d here.

Based on the evidence in the record here, benefits awarded under the SRP are not based on the length of the equity partner\u2019s <em>employment </em>with Hunton &amp; Williams. Instead, eligibility to receive SRP benefits is predicated on being an equity partner with Hunton <em>&amp; </em>Williams and then retiring, usually at the age of sixty-five, and receiving the SRP with Executive Committee approval. Thus, it is fair and equitable to both parties that the marital share of the SRP value reflect <em>only </em>the period of time after which husband became an equity partner\u2014in short, the period of time during the marriage that husband was an equity partner prior to the separation of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Accordingly, on remand, the trial court shall order that, if and when the SRP is received by husband, the marital share of the SRP shall be determined using the following fraction\u2014the numerator shall be the number of years that husband has been an equity partner with Hunton &amp; Williams that occurred during the marriage prior to the separation of the parties, and the denominator shall be the total number of years husband has been an equity partner with Hunton <em>&amp; </em>Williams at the time he retires and the SRP award is approved by the firm to be made to husband.

The trial court accepted this valuation from Robert Raymond (wife\u2019s expert) over that of Gregory Lawson (husband\u2019s expert), who opined that the marital value of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>husband\u2019s law practice was $502,887.

Howell, </em>31 Va.App. 332, 338, 523 S.E.2d 514, 517 (2000). In <em>Bosserman v. Bosserman, </em>9 Va.App. 1, 384 S.E.2d 104 (1989), this Court held that \u201c[t]rial courts valuing marital property for the purpose of making a monetary award must determine from the evidence that value which represents the property\u2019s intrinsic worth\u201d to the parties. <em>Id. </em>at 6, 384 S.E.2d at 107. \u201cIntrinsic value is a very subjective concept that looks to the worth of the property to the parties.\u201d <em>Howell, </em>31 Va.App. at 339, 523 S.E.2d at 517. Determining intrinsic value must depend on the facts of the case. <em>Id. </em>\u201cWe affirm if the evidence supports the findings and if the trial court finds a reasonable evaluation based on proven methodology and on the application of it to the particular facts of the case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">In addition, when a trial court values a professional practice, it must consider the presence of goodwill. <em>See Russell v. Russell, </em>11 Va.App. 411, 416, 399 S.E.2d 166, 168 (1990). \u201cThe value of goodwill can have two components.\u201d <em>Howell, </em>31 Va.App. at 344, 523 S.E.2d at 520. \u201cProfessional goodwill (also designated as individual, personal, or separate goodwill) is attributable to the individual and is categorized as separate property in a divorce action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cPractice goodwill (also designated as business or commercial goodwill) is attributable to the business entity, the professional firm, and may be marital property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn valuing the goodwill of the partnership interest, courts must take special care not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>confuse the owner spouse\u2019s personal future earning capacity with practice goodwill attributable to the law firm in order to avoid double counting.\u201d <em>Id.; see Russell, </em>11 Va.App. at 417, 399 S.E.2d at 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">In this case, Mr. Raymond used a method of valuation called \u201cbottom-up.\u201d Use of this methodology was approved by this Court in <em>Howell </em>(which also involved determining the marital value of the law practice of a Hunton &amp; Williams equity partner),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> where it was also called the excess earnings method. In <em>Howell, </em>the Court described this methodology accordingly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">The wife\u2019s expert began by comparing the husband\u2019s average income for three years to that of a peer group. The difference between the two was the excess earnings due to the husband\u2019s association with the firm, but not the earnings due to his personal efforts. It was the additional income he received from being associated with his law firm. The wife\u2019s expert projected those excess earnings over the husband\u2019s expected career with Hunton &amp; Williams. Using the discounted future earnings method, he then calculated the present value of the husband\u2019s total future excess earnings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQO\"><em>Howell, </em>31 Va.App. at 342, 523 S.E.2d at 519. Although the husband in <em>Howell </em>argued \u201cthat this method, described as working from the \u2018bottom up,\u2019 is incorrect,\u201d this Court held that the trial court in that case was entitled to find that the bottom-up methodology was an accurate way to determine the professional practice\u2019s intrinsic value under the circumstances of that case. <em>Id. </em>at 343, 523 S.E.2d at 519-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Here, husband argues that the circumstances in <em>Howell </em>were distinguishable from those in this case. In particular, husband notes that the \u201cbottom-up\u201d method was used in <em>Howell </em>in large part due to \u201cthe unavailability of partnership financial data,\u201d which had been successfully quashed by the law firm in that case. <em>Id. </em>at 343, 523 S.E.2d at 520. Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Raymond\u2019s testimony at the parties\u2019 divorce trial here strongly suggests that he had more financial information at his disposal in this case. However, to the extent that husband contends that the \u201cbottom-up\u201d methodology is <em>only </em>appropriate when pertinent financial data has been quashed or is otherwise unavailable, neither <em>Howell </em>nor any other authority suggests such a rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">In the absence of controlling authority directing trial courts that the \u201cbottom-up\u201d methodology can only be used in a limited class of cases, the issue here is no different than any other factual issue that the trial court decides after considering and weighing the evidence. Such decisions \u201crest within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed on appeal unless plainly wrong or unsupported by the evidence.\u201d <em>McDavid, </em>19 Va.App. at 407-08, 451 S.E.2d at 715; <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-680.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The trial court in this particular case was entitled to find as credible and give appropriate weight to Mr. Raymond\u2019s testimony at the parties\u2019 divorce trial that the \u201cbottom-up\u201d methodology is preferred over other approaches and is the \u201capproach that I\u2019ve used in valuing virtually every professional practice, large or small, certainly for the last 10, 15 years.\u201d After considering both experts\u2019 assessments, the trial court specifically found that Mr. Raymond\u2019s opinion was \u201cbetter reasoned and more credible\u201d than Mr. Lawson\u2019s, that Mr. Raymond\u2019s approach had a \u201cbetter focus on intrinsic value,\u201d and that it was \u201cmore persuaded by [Mr. Raymond\u2019s] estimation of goodwill\u201d because Mr. Raymond \u201cbetter isolated institutional goodwill by determining what an attorney\u2019s law firm interest value with husband\u2019s skill, knowledge, and experience value would be if he was in a firm that lacked the attributes of husband\u2019s law firm.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The trial court considered, but reject<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>ed, husband\u2019s criticisms of Mr. Raymond\u2019s methods\u2014while also finding that \u201cthe adjustments and discounts that husband\u2019s expert applies are arbitrary.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> These findings were not plainly wrong or without evidence to support them.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-5\">The evidence presented at trial determines the result, and the result may vary from case to case as the evidence differs. If conflicting, competent evidence is presented, that found more credible will determine whether goodwill exists and its value if it does exist. The existence is not fixed as a matter of law, nor is the method of valuation; both are functions of the fact finding process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-6\"><em>Howell, </em>31 Va.App. at 340-41, 523 S.E.2d at 518.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Therefore, under the settled standard of review on appeal, we will not disturb the trial court\u2019s credibility determinations of the expert witnesses and their testimony\u2014or the trial court\u2019s resulting finding that the marital value of husband\u2019s interest in his law practice at Hunton &amp; Williams was $1,492,000 at the time of its valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">B. Wife\u2019s Appeal (Record No. 0958-12-2)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">1. Whether There is Procedural Default</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">Husband argues that all three of wife\u2019s assignments of error are procedurally defaulted. These assignments of error contend that the trial court \u201cerred as a matter of law\u201d in various respects. Husband asserts that this Court cannot consider these assignments of error because wife never actually informed the trial court that it was committing errors as a matter of law when it ruled against her on what she indicated in the trial court were discretionary matters. Thus, husband <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>contends that wife did not preserve the issues corresponding to her assignments of error with the specificity required under Rule 5A:18. He also contends that wife fails to satisfy Rule 5A:20 because he claims that her opening brief on appeal does not contain any argument or authority to support her contention that the trial court erred as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Rule 5A:18 states that \u201c[n]o ruling of the trial court ... will be considered as a basis for reversal unless an objection was stated with reasonable certainty at the time of the ruling, except for good cause shown or to enable the Court of Appeals to attain the ends of justice.\u201d Rule 5A:20(e) requires an appellant\u2019s opening brief to contain \u201c[t]he standard of review and the argument (including principles of law and authorities) relating to each assignment of error.\u201d Wife\u2019s objections to the trial court\u2019s rulings that correspond to her assignments of error were stated with reasonable certainty, and her opening brief identifies the standard of review on appeal and appropriate principles of law and authorities to address those issues. While wife\u2019s assignments of error could perhaps be stated more artfully, the issues raised within them are not procedurally defaulted for any reason that is alleged by husband<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> under the Rules of Court.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number><em>2. </em>Valuation Date and Allegedly Inequitable Use of Marital Funds</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">In her first assignment of error, wife argues that the trial court committed reversible error when it declined to use an alternate valuation date for the Ameritrade and Bank of America accounts. In her second assignment of error, wife argues that the trial court committed reversible error when it found that husband had properly spent significant marital funds totaling approximately $1,400,000 from the Ameritrade <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and Bank of America<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> accounts to pay his personal expenses and spousal support when she claims that husband had the means to make such payments from his post-separation earnings from Hunton <em>&amp; </em>Williams or from other separate property sources. The premise underlying both of these assignments of error is that husband, in wife\u2019s view, should have paid for post-separation expenses from his <em>separate </em>funds (rather than from the marital Ameritrade and Bank of America accounts) because he amassed significant separate funds after the separation.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>\n<em>a.

As is the case in several previous decisions of this Court that we have noted, \u201c[t]his is not a case involving a deliberate waste of marital assets.\u201d <em>Amburn, </em>13 Va.App. at 666, 414 S.E.2d at 850.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Nevertheless, wife argues that marital funds from the Ameritrade and Bank of America accounts were inequitably spent by husband after the parties\u2019 separation, given the particular facts of this case. Wife claims that husband <em>could </em>have made these expenditures from his own separate funds\u2014especially in light of husband\u2019s high compensation level at Hunton &amp; Williams, which Mr. Pulley described as \u201cpretty rarified air.\u201d In essence, wife argues that husband\u2019s post-separation choice of expending money from the Ameritrade and Bank of America <em>accounts\u2014rather than from his own separate </em>funds\u2014 unfairly diminished the parties\u2019 marital equity in those accounts following the parties\u2019 separation, thereby reducing the value of the marital funds that were subject to equitable distribution by the time of the evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Wife cites no controlling Virginia authority in support of this argument. Virginia\u2019s appellate case law recognizes two categories of post-separation expenditures of marital assets: (1) expenditures for proper purposes, and (2) waste. There is not a third category under Virginia\u2019s appellate case law\u2014and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>we decline to hold, based on the circumstances of this case, that the trial court was required, as a matter of law, to consider the extent of husband\u2019s post-separation income or other separate assets in determining whether husband unfairly diminished marital assets following the parties\u2019 separation.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">c. <em>Good Cause Determination is a Discretionary Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"A2p\">Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A) states that the trial court \u201cshall determine the value of any such property as of the date of the evidentiary hearing on the evaluation issue\u201d unless, \u201cfor good cause shown\u201d, in order to attain the ends of justice, the trial court \u201corder[s] that a different valuation date be used.\u201d \u201cA good cause determination invests a trial court with discretion.\u201d <em>AME Fin. Corp. v. Kiritsis, </em>281 Va. 384, 392, 707 S.E.2d 820, 824 (2011) (citing <em>Stephens v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 157, 162, 645 S.E.2d 276, 278 (2007)); <em>see also, e.g., Emrich v. Emrich, </em>9 Va.App. 288, 292, 387 S.E.2d 274, 276 (1989). \u201c[A] circuit court\u2019s determination\u201d on the presence or absence of good cause \u201cmust be supported by evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Stephens, </em>274 Va. at 163, 645 S.E.2d at 278; <em>see Goodhand v. Kildoo, </em>37 Va.App. 591, 599, 560 S.E.2d 463, 466 (2002) (explaining that, \u201cwhen a court hears evidence at an <em>ore tenus </em>hearing, its decision is entitled to great weight and will not be disturbed on appeal unless plainly wrong or without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>evidence to support it\u201d and that \u201cthe burden is on the moving party to show a right to the relief sought\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">Here, the trial court specifically found that \u201cno good cause has been shown\u201d to use an alternate valuation date for the Ameritrade and Bank of America accounts. This finding was not plainly wrong or unsupported by the evidence. Husband spent money from these accounts for proper purposes, as discussed <em>supra. </em>To the extent that wife specifically challenges husband\u2019s use of funds from the Ameritrade account to pay for spousal support and attorney\u2019s fees, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that husband was not required to use his separate funds to pay for these expenses. Furthermore, the record indicates that significant portions of the Ameritrade and Bank of America account expenditures were paid to satisfy the parties\u2019 joint tax obligations<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and the mortgage for the marital home. Such payments reduced the parties\u2019 <em>marital </em>debt, which contributed to the marital funds that were subject to equitable distribution. Moreover, the trial court was aware that, at the outset of the divorce trial, husband had paid wife $525,000 from his own separate funds for her share of the marital home. This payment was received by wife <em>in addition </em>to the assets she received through equitable distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Based on all of these circumstances, therefore, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion when it found no good cause for selecting an alternate valuation date for valuing the marital funds in the Ameritrade and Bank of America accounts that were subject to equitable distribution. Accordingly, we find that the trial court did not err in the manner alleged by wife in her first two assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">3. Defined-Duration Spousal Support Award</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">In her third assignment of error, wife argues that the trial court committed reversible error when it awarded her a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>defined-duration spousal support award of $10,000 per month for a four-year period. Wife contends that limiting the spousal support award to a four-year period was not supported by the evidence in this case. We disagree with wife\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in this regard, especially in light of the deferential standard of review on appeal. <em>See Calvert, </em>18 Va.App. at 784, 447 S.E.2d at 876 (\u201cDecisions concerning [spousal] support rest within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed on appeal unless plainly wrong or unsupported by the evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Code \u00a7 20-107.1 states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">C. The [trial] court, in its discretion, may decree that maintenance and support of a spouse be made in periodic payments for a defined duration, or in periodic payments for an undefined duration, or in a lump sum award, or in any combination thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-7\"><em>% </em>\u00edJ\u00ed j\u00a1* <em>'Jfi </em>sji</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-8\">F. In contested cases in the circuit courts, any order granting, reserving or denying a request for spousal support shall be accompanied by written findings and conclusions of the court identifying the factors in subsection E which support the court\u2019s order. If the court awards periodic support for a defined duration, such findings shall identify the basis for the nature, amount and duration of the award and, if appropriate, a specification of the events and circumstances reasonably contemplated by the court which support the award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">Here, the trial court awarded defined-duration spousal support, as permitted by Code \u00a7 20-107.1. The trial court identified the terms, basis, and statutory factors favoring a defined-duration award, as Code \u00a7 20-107.1 required it to do. Furthermore, the trial court\u2019s selection of a four-year term for the spousal support award was supported by evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">Wife holds an M.B.A. degree from the University of Virginia and was regularly employed during the early portion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>of the parties\u2019 marriage. She contends that she has been rendered essentially unemployable because she earned her M.B.A. degree too long ago and argues her departure from the workforce has been too lengthy. Husband presented expert testimony to the contrary. Husband\u2019s expert, Peder Melberg, testified that wife could earn between $36,000 to $56,000 in an entry-level financial services position with the opportunity to advance to an $85,000-per-year position if she were to become an established financial services representative. In its role as factfinder, the trial court was entitled to accept Mr. Melberg\u2019s testimony. <em>See Street, </em>25 Va.App. at 387, 488 S.E.2d at 668 (explaining that the factfinder \u201cascertains a witness\u2019 credibility, determines the weight to be given to their testimony, and has the discretion to accept or reject any of the witness\u2019 testimony\u201d). It was also permitted to make reasonable inferences from wife\u2019s testimony that she did not intend to find employment.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>See Congdon v. Congdon, </em>40 Va.App. 255, 258, 578 S.E.2d 833, 835 (2003) (explaining that the appellate court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below, granting to that party the benefit of any reasonable inferences).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to husband (as we must since he was the prevailing party on this issue), the trial court was permitted to find that wife <em>could </em>successfully return to the workforce\u2014even if she did not intend to do so.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Under the governing standard of review on appeal, the trial court did not err in directing a four-year defined duration of spousal support for wife that, in the words of the trial court, gave wife \u201ca reasonable time to establish employment by acquiring and updating skills for entry into the job market.\u201d Although <em>some </em>jurists conceivably could have selected a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>lengthier duration for the spousal support award, nothing in the record here supports a conclusion that <em>all </em>reasonable jurists simply \u201ccould not differ\u201d in the opinion that the trial court erred on this issue. <em>See Robbins, </em>48 Va.App. at 482, 682 S.E.2d at 623. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">C. Appellate Attorneys\u2019 Fees and Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Both parties request an award of appellate attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. \u201cThe appellate court has the opportunity to view the record in its entirety and determine whether [an] appeal is frivolous or whether other reasons exist for requiring additional payment.\u201d <em>O\u2019Loughlin v. O\u2019Loughlin, </em>23 Va.App. 690, 695, 479 S.E.2d 98, 100 (1996). Upon consideration of the record on appeal, we do not deem either party\u2019s appeal to be frivolous or see other reasons sufficient to warrant an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. Therefore, we deny each party\u2019s request for such an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the trial court\u2019s April 26, 2012 final decree in all respects, except for its failure to identify the duration of the reservation of wife\u2019s future spousal support rights and its failure to limit the equitable distribution award pertaining to husband\u2019s Hunton <em>&amp; </em>Williams SRP to the marital share of the SRP (when and if benefits under this supplemental retirement plan vest). The final decree is reversed as to those issues, and we remand the matter to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b485-5\">. We have summarized husband's assignments of error\u2014which, in their entirety, including subparts, fully encompass two pages of his opening brief on appeal. More specifically (without repeating certain allegations that husband lists more than once in his assignments of error), husband alleges:</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">(1) that the trial court should have found that wife waived her right to request a reservation of spousal support rights because she did not make such a request \"until after she rested her case and the [trial] court ruled on the matter\u201d;</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">(2) that the trial court \"erred in failing to define a timeframe for the reservation awarded to wife\u201d and that \"[a]ny reservation granted to Wife should be for a period no longer than one-half of the length of time between the date of the marriage and the date of separation\u201d;</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">(3) that the trial court \"erred in classifying Husband\u2019s SRP as marital property and in awarding Wife 25% of Husband\u2019s SRP\u201d because the SRP \"has no marital value,\u201d husband \"had no interest in the SRP\u201d at the time of the final decree, and, even if husband \"is awarded an interest in the SRP, the award could be based entirely on his post-separation earnings and, therefore, entirely his separate property\u201d;</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">(4) that the trial court \"erred in awarding Wife 25% of the SRP as opposed to 25% of the marital share of the SRP\u201d; and,</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">(5) that the trial court \"erred in accepting Wife's expert\u2019s valuation of Husband's interest in his law practice; in finding that Wife\u2019s expert\u2019s opinion was more credible, entitled to greater weight and better focused on intrinsic value than Husband's valuation; and in valuing that interest at $1,492,000\u201d because (a) the valuation accepted by the trial court \"erroneously used the \u2018bottom-up\u2019 approach even though the relevant financial data was available to the evaluator,\u201d (b) this valuation \"neither properly valued nor accounted for Husband\u2019s personal goodwill,\u201d (c) this valuation \"failed to tax effect accounts receivable and work in progress,\u201d (d) this valuation \"used a comparison group of attorneys and firms which were not comparable to Husband and his practice,\u201d and (e) this valuation \"assumed an increase in Husband\u2019s income which included Husband's separate post-separation earnings and assumed an increase in Husband's income ignoring the testimony that he is subject to a reduction in income, and ignoring the undisputed evidence of his intention to retire at age sixty-one.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">As his sixth assignment of error, which we treat as a request for appellate attorney\u2019s fees and costs, husband contends that he is entitled to such fees and costs on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b486-9\">. Under settled principles, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party in the trial court, granting to that party the benefit of any reasonable inferences. <em>Congdon v. Congdon, </em>40 Va.App. 255, 258, 578 S.E.2d 833, 835 (2003). Thus, for these consolidated appeals, the evidence related to the issues raised in husband's appeal is viewed in the light most favorable to wife as the prevailing party below\u2014and the evidence related to the issues raised in wife\u2019s appeal is viewed in the light most favorable to husband as the prevailing party below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b486-10\">. At the time that the final decree was entered, only one of the parties\u2019 daughters was still a minor. Child support is not an issue in these appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b486-11\">. Wife filed the initial divorce complaint in this matter in 2008, and husband thereafter filed an answer and cross-complaint. The parties later agreed to amend their respective complaints to reflect the divorce grounds of living separate and apart continuously for more than one year.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b489-10\">. Consistent with Code \u00a7 20-107.1, the trial court awarded wife a reservation of spousal support rights <em>in addition to </em>its award of a four-year period of spousal support to wife.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b491-8\">. In fact, wife's request in this case was communicated sooner and much more directly than the request that was made in <em>Vissicchio. </em>Unlike in Vissicchio\u2014where the request was simply inserted within a draft decree\u2014wife specifically noted her reservation request in her written motion for reconsideration of the trial court\u2019s February 3, 2012 letter opinion. Following a hearing, the trial court granted wife a reservation of spousal support rights in its March 29, 2012 letter opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b491-9\">. To the extent that husband seeks the decision in <em>Vissicchio </em>to be overruled, \"[ujnder the interpanel accord doctrine, the decision of one panel becomes a predicate for application of the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>and cannot be overruled except by the Court of Appeals sitting <em>en banc </em>or by the Virginia Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Atkins v. Commonwealth, </em>54 Va.App. 340, 343 n. 2, 678 S.E.2d 834, 835 n. 2 (2009) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b492-7\">. At the hearing on wife's motion to reconsider the February 3, 2012 letter opinion, wife\u2019s trial counsel acknowledged that this statutory presumption would apply \"unless somebody presents evidence to rebut that.\u201d Wife then never presented any evidence that a reservation period greater than the statutory presumptive period was appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b496-7\">. Mr. Pulley testified that age sixty-five is normally the mandatory retirement age for Hunton &amp; Williams equity partners.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b497-7\">. The trial court found that wife not only \"devoted her time to being a housewife and mother,\" participating \u201cfirst-hand in the rearing, caring, and upbringing of the children,\u201d but also found that wife \u201csupported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>husband in his family and business, for example, coordinating entertainment for his business associates in the marital home.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b502-8\">. Although this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Howell </em>does not identify the prevailing party\u2019s expert in that case, both parties here acknowledge that the expert there was Mr. Raymond\u2014wife\u2019s expert in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b503-7\">. Mr. Raymond's valuation assessment, which the trial court accepted, did not derive a value for husband's personal goodwill. While husband on appeal considers this an omission amounting to reversible error, we note that the trial court explained in the final decree that it \"can only take cognizance of <em>institutional </em>goodwill,\u201d a marital asset. (Emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>added). Given this explanation, and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to wife (as the prevailing party below on this assignment of error), we conclude that no part of husband's <em>personal </em>goodwill was included in calculating the equitable distribution award pertaining to these parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b504-12\">. Furthermore, the trial court, acting as factfinder, was not required to accept or give significant weight to husband's testimony that he intended to retire at age sixty-one.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b505-6\">. This Court is in receipt of husband\u2019s notice to the Court of an additional authority husband requested the Court to consider after oral argument in this case\u2014i.e., this Court's recent published opinion in <em>Fox v. Fox, </em>61 Va.App. 185, 734 S.E.2d 662 (2012). We conclude that the decision in <em>Fox </em>is inapplicable to the issues before us here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b505-7\">. To the extent that husband identifies a distinction between committing error as a matter of law and committing an abuse of discretion, the Supreme Court has explained that a discretionary decision means \" 'that the court has a range of choice, and that its decision will not be disturbed as long as it stays within that range and is not influenced by any <em>mistake of law.\u2019 \u201d Landrum v. Chippenham &amp; Johnston-Willis Hosps., Inc., 282 </em>Va. 346, 352, 717 S.E.2d 134, 137 (2011) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Kern v.

The Ameritrade account had a balance of $2,695,275 when the parties separated on July 11, 2008. At the time of the December 2010 evidentiary hearing, the marital portion of the Ameritrade account balance was $1,410,939.77. Between the date of the separation and the date of the evidentiary hearing, husband spent $834,335 of the Ameritrade funds in this account on payment of state and federal taxes for 2008 and 2009 on the parties\u2019 jointly filed tax returns. Husband also made post-separation payments from the Ameritrade account for real estate taxes for the marital home, for tuition and other school expenses for the parties\u2019 youngest daughter, for spousal support payments to wife, and for husband's attorney's fees and expert fees related to the divorce litigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b506-7\">. The Bank of America account had a balance of $105,610.75 at the time of the parties' separation. At the time of the evidentiary hearing in the trial court, the account balance was $5,178. Most of husband's payments from this account between the date of separation and the date of the hearing went to pay the mortgage payment on the marital home. Husband also testified that tuition and taxes may have also been paid out of this account at times following the separation of the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b510-6\">. During oral argument before this Court on appeal, wife\u2019s counsel was unable to articulate any income threshold or other guideline for directing trial courts when they must, as a matter of law, find that marital assets have been unfairly diminished following a separation and in anticipation of a divorce by a spouse who earns a considerable salary or otherwise has significant separate assets at his or her disposal. Such a determination surely must be made, if at all, in the trial court. Here, the trial court, in the exercise of its discretion, ultimately decided not to credit husband for the full $259,021 that he repaid the Ameritrade account with his own separate funds. The trial court's initial February 3, 2012 letter opinion granted husband a credit for this full amount, finding that husband had not committed marital waste. However, following wife's motion for reconsideration, the trial court recognized that wife's argument \"was about equity, not waste,\" and added $95,838 to wife's equitable distribution award \"based on the percentage of distribution already determined.\" Husband did not appeal this specific ruling to this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b511-8\">. We note that, even on the parties' 2009 tax forms, following their separation, the parties' filing status was listed as ''[m]arried filing jointly.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b513-6\">. Indeed, at oral argument before this Court, wife's counsel confirmed, in response to a question from the Court, that she had been clear to the trial court that she would not seek employment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b513-7\">.

Given the uncertain nature of an award under the SRP\u2014the Executive Committee may decline to make an award to husband, or husband may refuse to sign a non-compete agreement upon retirement\u2014the trial court is not instructed to reconsider spousal support at this time. If and when the Hunton &amp; Williams Executive Committee has made an SRP award to husband, the trial court should then reconsider whether any spousal support should be paid or changed at that time, provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>that it has retained the necessary authority to do so through a reservation of wife's future spousal support rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
