On appeal, he argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions because appellant was not \u201cin public\u201d or \u201cin any public place\u201d at the time of the alleged offenses. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-14\">On appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, as the party prevailing below. <em>E.g., Rawls v. Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 334, 340, 634 S.E.2d 697, 699 (2006). Shamieka Owens testified that as an employee of the Newport News Pretrial Services unit, she visited the Newport News jail to interview an inmate. The interview occurred \u201c[o]n the first floor in lockup,\u201d which a person needs specific authorization in order to access. During the interview, Owens <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>saw appellant, an inmate in a nearby cell. He stood at the front of his cell, \u201cup at the bars,\u201d masturbating, and looking at her with \u201ca grin on his face.\u201d At least eight other inmates were present in the cells behind her.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Appellant moved to strike, arguing that the Commonwealth failed to prove that the alleged conduct occurred in a public place. The trial court denied the motion, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">[L]et me just read ... the statute, \u201cAny person who while in any public place where others are present.\u201d The Court defines public place \u201cwhere others are present.\u201d And I think that\u2019s the intent of the General Assembly when they give that public, where others are present, not people just happenstancedly just walking in and out of a building, but where other people are present. So if that\u2019s not true, then any person, any inmate, in any jail can take out his penis and show it because the argument would be that it\u2019s not in public but this was, in fact, a public area. It was open to the other inmates. It was open to Ms. Owens who was there doing a public duty, a job that required her to talk to others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">After appellant testified, he again argued the alleged offenses did not occur in a public place, because the jail was essentially his home. The trial court found appellant guilty, sentencing him to five years\u2019 incarceration for indecent exposure and twelve months for sexual display.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">Appellant appeals both convictions, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support them because he was not \u201cin public\u201d or \u201cin any public place\u201d as defined by the statutes. The Commonwealth responds that the first floor of the jail was a public area.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>We review the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the statute <em>de novo. See Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 409, 413, 650 S.E.2d 89, 91 (2007). \u201cThe primary objective of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to legislative intent.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Zamani, </em>256 Va. 391, 395, 507 S.E.2d 608, 609 (1998). Thus, we construe a statute \u201cwith reference to its subject matter, the object sought to be attained, and the legislative purpose in enacting it; the provisions should receive a construction that will render it harmonious with that purpose rather than one which will defeat it.\u201d <em>Esteban v. Commonwealth, </em>266 Va. 605, 609, 587 S.E.2d 523, 526 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">\u201cIt is a cardinal principle of law that penal statutes are to be construed strictly against the [Commonwealth]\u201d and \u201ccannot be extended by implication, or be made to include cases which are not within the letter and spirit of the statute.\u201d <em>Wade v. Commonwealth, </em>202 Va. 117, 122, 116 S.E.2d 99, 103 (1960). However, \u201cwe will not apply \u2018an unreasonably restrictive interpretation of the statute\u2019 that would subvert the legislative intent expressed therein.\u201d <em>Armstrong v. Commonwealth, </em>263 Va. 573, 581, 562 S.E.2d 139, 144 (2002) (quoting <em>Ansell v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 759, 761, 250 S.E.2d 760, 761 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-387 provides it is illegal for a \u201cperson [to] intentionally make[] an obscene display or exposure of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>person, or the private parts thereof, <em>in any public place, or in any place where others are </em>present.\u201d (Emphasis added). Code \u00a7 18.2-387.1 criminalizes the act of \u201c[a]ny person who, while <em>in any public place where others are present, </em>intending that he be seen by others, intentionally and obscenely ... engages in actual or explicitly simulated acts of masturbation.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Neither code section nor the chapter provides a definition for the term \u201cpublic place.\u201d However, other jurisdictions have addressed the issue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In doing so, courts have focused on an act\u2019s \u201copen and notorious\u201d nature or the reasonable foreseeability of public witnesses. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Carr, </em>28 M.J. 661, 665 (N-M C.M.R 1989) (holding that a sexual act is \u201copen and notorious\u201d if it occurs \u201cin such a place and under such circumstances that it is reasonably likely to be seen by others\u201d); <em>Michigan v. Neal, </em>266 Mich.App. 654, 702 N.W.2d 696 (2005) (affirming conviction where a guest in defendant\u2019s home witnessed indecent exposure because it occurred where she \u201cwould have reasonably been expected to observe it, and she might reasonably have been expected to have been offended by what was seen\u201d); <em>New York v. McNamara, </em>78 N.Y.2d 626, 578 N.Y.S.2d 476, 585 N.E.2d 788, 793 (1991) (holding that a place is \u201cpublic\u201d for purposes of the public lewdness statute \u201cunder circumstances indicating [the place] is visible to a member of the passing public, and that ... it likely would be observed by such a person\u201d); <em>Messina v. State, </em>212 Md. 602, 130 A.2d 578, 579-80 (1957) (\u201c \u2018The place where the offense is committed is a public one if the exposure be such that it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>likely to be seen by a number of casual observers.\u2019 \u201d (quoting 67 C.J.S. <em>Obscenity </em>\u00a7 5)).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Similarly, we hold that \u201cpublic place,\u201d as used in Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-387 and 18.2-387.1 comprises places and circumstances where the offender does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy, because of the foreseeability of a non-consenting public witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">This conclusion is harmonious with the statutes\u2019 purpose. Code \u00a7 18.2-387 codified the common law offense of \u201copen and notorious lewdness.\u201d <em>Moses v. Commonwealth, </em>45 Va.App. 357, 360-61, 611 S.E.2d 607, 609 (2005). Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-387 and 18.2-387.1 include language restricting such behavior \u201cwhere others are present.\u201d The statutory history and \u201cwhere others are present\u201d language indicate the legislature\u2019s purpose in enacting the statutes was to protect individuals from witnessing the offensive conduct. <em>See, e.g., McNamara, </em>585 N.E.2d at 791 (noting the public lewdness statute \u201cwas aimed at protecting ... \u2018unsuspecting, unwilling, nonconsenting, innocent, surprised, or likely-to-be offended or corrupted types of viewers\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Standing by the bars at the front of his cell in first floor lockup, appellant was in open view to staff, other inmates, and to members of the public with authorized access. Under the circumstances, it was probable that a non-consenting witness would observe his conduct. Therefore, appellant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy and the facts were sufficient to support the finding that his behavior occurred in a public place under Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-387 and 18.2-387.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">Our holding is in line with other jurisdictions that have considered the issue and held that correctional facilities are \u201cpublic places\u201d for purposes of public indecency statutes due to the possible viewing by staff or visitors.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">In <em>Louisiana v. Narcisse, </em>833 So.2d 1186, 1191-92 (La.Ct.App.2002), the Louisiana Court of Appeals examined whether a prison infirmary qualified as a \u201cpublic place\u201d under that state\u2019s obscenity statute. Noting that \u201c[a] public place or place open to the public view does not have to be open to all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>members of the public,\u201d the court defined \u201ca public place or a place open to the public view\u201d as \u201cany place where other people can observe the obscene act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1192. The court concluded that the evidence of accessibility to the infirmary by visitors and staff provided a sufficient basis for the fact finder to conclude it was a public place or a place open to the public. <em>Id. </em>at 1193.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">The Michigan Court of Appeals has held that \u201c \u2018the key issue in determining whether an act of oral sexual conduct was performed in a \u201cpublic place\u201d is not so much the exact location of the act, but whether there is the possibility that the unsuspecting public could be exposed to or view the act.\u2019\u201d <em>Michigan v. Williams, </em>237 Mich.App. 413, 416, 603 N.W.2d 300, 301 (1999) (quoting <em>Michigan v. Brown, </em>222 Mich.App. 586, 591, 564 N.W.2d 919, 921 (1997)), <em>vacated in part on other grounds, </em>613 N.W.2d 721 (Mich.2000). Applying this framework, the Michigan Court of Appeals held that the attorney interview room \u201cwas a public place to the extent that certain members of the public with access to this area of the jail could possibly have been exposed to defendant\u2019s sexual act with his client.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 417, 603 N.W.2d at 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">In <em>Arkansas v. Black, </em>260 Ark. 864, 867, 545 S.W.2d 617, 619 (1977), the court held that the \u201cdrunk tank\u201d was a public place for purposes of the sexual indecency statute in light of the possibility of being observed by persons on an occasional tour of the jail, frequent visitors to inmates, and the other inmates present.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">The evidence supported the finding that appellant\u2019s conduct occurred in a public place under Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-387 and 18.2-387.1. Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b541-11\">. The Commonwealth additionally contends that appellant failed to adequately preserve his argument as to his indecent exposure convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>tion for appeal. Under Rule 5A:18, \"[n]o ruling of the trial court ... will be considered as a basis for reversal unless an objection was stated with reasonable certainty at the time of the ruling.\u201d The purpose of this rule is to ensure \" 'that objections be promptly brought to the attention of the trial court with sufficient specificity that the alleged error can be dealt with and timely addressed and corrected when necessary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Redman v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 215, 220, 487 S.E.2d 269, 272 (1997) (quoting <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 126, 131, 380 S.E.2d 8, 10 (1989)). Furthermore, the rule allows \"correction of an error if possible during the trial, thereby avoiding the necessity of mistrials and reversals.\u201d <em>Gardner v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 418, 423, 350 S.E.2d 229, 232 (1986). The appellant clearly argued that the location did not constitute a \u201cpublic place,\u201d and the trial court rejected that contention. Therefore, appellant sufficiently preserved this issue for appeal as to both of his convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b543-6\">. In this instance, other sections of the Virginia Code offer little clarification. <em>See King v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 708, 710, 347 S.E.2d 530, 531 (1986) (\"The Code of Virginia constitutes a single body of law, and other sections can be looked to where the same phraseology is employed.\u201d). Code \u00a7 4.1-100 defines \"public place,\u201d but limits the provided definition to the context of Title 4.1, the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act. In <em>Crislip v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 66, 554 S.E.2d 96 (2001), we interpreted the meaning of \"in public\" under Code \u00a7 18.2-388, which proscribes \u201cin public\u201d intoxication, but distinguished the term \u201cin public\u201d from \u201cpublic place\u201d under Title 4.1. <em>Id. </em>at 70-71, 544 S.E.2d at 98.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
