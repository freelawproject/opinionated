On appeal, Fitzgerald assigns several errors to the trial court\u2019s admission of two certificates into evidence at trial: the certificate of blood alcohol analysis and a certificate of instrument accuracy. Fitzgerald\u2019s first three assignments of error challenge the trial court\u2019s admission of the certificate of instrument accuracy on various grounds. His fourth assignment of error challenges the trial court\u2019s admission of the certificate of blood alcohol analysis on the sole ground that if the certificate of instrument accuracy was improperly admitted, then so was the certificate of blood alcohol analysis. For the reasons expressed below, we conclude that the certificate of blood alcohol analysis was admissible regardless of any alleged error in admitting the certificate of instrument accuracy and that, correspondingly, any error in admitting the certificate of instrument accuracy was harmless. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b326-12\">\u201cOn appeal, \u2018we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>inferences fairly deducible therefrom/ \u201d <em>Archer v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 1, 11, 492 S.E.2d 826, 831 (1997) (quoting <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">On July 16, 2011, Lieutenant J.W. Smith saw Fitzgerald pull out in front of oncoming traffic as Fitzgerald was driving a van. Fitzgerald barely missed hitting another vehicle, and Lieutenant Smith pulled him over. When Lieutenant Smith walked up to the van, he smelled an odor of alcohol and saw that Fitzgerald\u2019s eyes were bloodshot. Fitzgerald admitted that he had recently had a couple of shots of alcohol at a local bar. After administering three field sobriety tests, Lieutenant Smith arrested Fitzgerald at 12:15 a.m. for driving under the influence. Lieutenant Smith took Fitzgerald to the Danville City Jail, where Sergeant Casey Allen conducted a breath test to determine Fitzgerald\u2019s blood alcohol content.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">At trial, the trial court admitted into evidence, over Fitzgerald\u2019s objections, both a certificate of instrument accuracy for the breath test equipment<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and a certificate of blood alcohol analysis showing the results of the breath test. The certificate of blood alcohol analysis indicated that Fitzgerald\u2019s blood alcohol content was 0.16 at 1:14 a.m. on July 16, 2011. The certificate also contained the following attestation, signed by Sergeant Allen:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">I certify that the above is an accurate record of the test conducted; that the test was conducted with the type of equipment and in accordance with the methods approved by the Department of Forensic Science; that the test was conducted in accordance with the Department\u2019s specifications; that prior to administration of the test the accused was advised of his right to observe the process and see the blood alcohol reading on the equipment used to perform the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>breath test, and that I possess a valid license to conduct such test, given under my hand this 16th day of July, 2011.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The trial court convicted Fitzgerald of driving a motor vehicle while intoxicated, first offense. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">This appeal presents us with a question of statutory construction. Fitzgerald argues that Code \u00a7 18.2-268.9 requires the Commonwealth to introduce evidence affirmatively showing that the equipment used to conduct a defendant\u2019s breath test was maintained by the Department of Forensic Science (the \u201cDepartment\u201d) and that the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to properly introduce such evidence renders the breath test results inadmissible. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">\u201c \u2018The admissibility of evidence is within the broad discretion of the trial court, and a ruling will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of an abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bynum v. Commonwealth, </em>57 Va.App. 487, 490, 704 S.E.2d 131, 133 (2011) (quoting <em>Gonzales v. Commonwealth, </em>45 Va.App. 375, 380, 611 S.E.2d 616, 618 (2005) (en banc)). Of course, \u201c[a]n error of law by the trial court is <em>ipso facto </em>an abuse of its discretion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">\u201c \u2018Statutory construction is a question of law which we review <em>de novo </em>on appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lynchburg Div. of Soc. Servs. v. Cook, </em>276 Va. 465, 480, 666 S.E.2d 361, 368 (2008) (quoting <em>Parker v. Warren, </em>273 Va. 20, 23, 639 S.E.2d 179, 181 (2007)). In accordance with well-established principles, we will \u201c \u2018apply the plain language of a statute unless the terms are ambiguous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Boynton v. Kilgore, </em>271 Va. 220, 227, 623 S.E.2d 922, 926 (2006)). \u201c \u2018[T]he primary objective of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to legislative intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Amerson, </em>281 Va. 414, 418, 706 S.E.2d 879, 882 (2011) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Conger v. Barrett, </em>280 Va. 627, 630, 702 S.E.2d 117, 118 (2010)); <em>see also B.P. v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 735, 739, 568 S.E.2d 412, 413 (2002) (\u201cWe will not place a construction upon a statute which leads to an absurd result or one plainly contrary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>to the expressed intent of the General Assembly....\u201d). Indeed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-4\">\u201c[i]n the construction of statutes, the courts have but one object, to which all rules of construction are subservient, and that is to ascertain the will of the legislature, the true intent and meaning of the statute, which are to be gathered by giving to all the words used their plain meaning, and construing all statutes <em>in pari materia </em>in such manner as to reconcile, if possible, any discordant feature which may exist, and make the body of the laws harmonious and just in their operation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-5\"><em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>59 Va.App. 496, 500, 720 S.E.2d 157, 159-60 (2012) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Lucy v. Cnty. of Albemarle, </em>258 Va. 118, 129-30, 516 S.E.2d 480, 485 (1999)). Furthermore, \u201c \u2018[w]e ... presume that the legislature chose, with care, the words it used when it enacted the relevant statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Seabolt v. Cnty. of Albemarle, </em>283 Va. 717, 720, 724 S.E.2d 715, 717 (2012) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Addison v. Jurgelsky, </em>281 Va. 205, 208, 704 S.E.2d 402, 404 (2011)).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Regarding the admissibility of a certificate of blood alcohol analysis following a breath test, Code \u00a7 18.2-268.9(B) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">Any individual conducting a breath test under the provisions of \u00a7 18.2-268.2 shall issue a certificate which will indicate that the test was conducted in accordance with the Department\u2019s specifications, the name of the accused, that prior to administration of the test the accused was advised of his right to observe the process and see the blood alcohol reading on the equipment used to perform the breath test, the date and time the sample was taken from the accused, the sample\u2019s alcohol content, and the name of the person who examined the sample. This certificate, when attested by the individual conducting the breath test on equipment maintained by the Department, shall be admissible in any court as evidence of the facts therein stated and of the results of such analysis (i) in any criminal proceeding, provided that the requirements of subsection A of \u00a7 19.2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>187.1 have been satisfied and the accused has not objected to the admission of the certificate pursuant to subsection B of \u00a7 19.2-187.1, or (ii) in any civil proceeding. Any such certificate of analysis purporting to be signed by a person authorized by the Department shall be admissible in evidence without proof of seal or signature of the person whose name is signed to it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">The purpose of this language is to specify the foundation the Commonwealth must lay to introduce into evidence what would otherwise be considered hearsay\u2014a certificate of blood alcohol analysis following a breath test.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The statute expressly lists all the facts the certificate must indicate to render the certificate admissible. The statute plainly states that a certificate \u201cshall be admissible\u201d when properly attested by the person who conducted the breath test. <em>Id. </em>This indicates that the intent of the General Assembly in employing this language was to require the Commonwealth to introduce evidence showing\u2014by way of a formal attestation\u2014that certain requirements regarding the conducting of the breath test were met. Concomitantly, it also indicates that these are the <em>only </em>facts the Commonwealth must prove to establish the certificate\u2019s admissibility. Indeed, as the Supreme Court has previously observed, \u201c[w]hen the certificate contains what the statute requires, the statute makes the certificate self-authenticating for purposes of admissibility.\u201d <em>Stroupe v. Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 243, 245, 207 S.E.2d 894, 896 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Prior to the 2009 amendment, the list of requirements in Code \u00a7 18.2-268.9 that the certificate had to indicate included the fact that \u201cthe equipment on which the breath test was conducted has been tested within the past six months and has been found to be accurate.\u201d However, in 2009, the General Assembly removed this requirement from the list of facts the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>certificate had to indicate to be admissible. The General Assembly simultaneously added the current phrase, \u201con equipment maintained by the Department,\u201d to the following sentence in the statute dictating the admissibility of a certificate that is properly attested. Fitzgerald argues that the amended language still requires the Commonwealth to introduce affirmative evidence showing that the breath test was conducted on equipment maintained by the Department. However, we hold that the amendment to the statute, considered as a whole, indicates the opposite intent by the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">\u2018\u201c[W]hen a statute has been amended, there is a presumption that the General Assembly intended to effect a substantive change in the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thomas, </em>59 Va.App. at 503, 720 S.E.2d at 161 (quoting <em>Britt Constr., Inc. v. Magazzine Clean, LLC, </em>271 Va. 58, 63, 623 S.E.2d 886, 888 (2006)); <em>see also Scott v. Commonwealth, </em>58 Va.App. 35, 49, 707 S.E.2d 17, 24 (2011) (noting that \u201cwhen the legislature amends a particular statute, we normally presume that \u2018a change in law was intended\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Wisniewski v. Johnson, </em>223 Va. 141, 144, 286 S.E.2d 223, 225 (1982))). \u201cAccordingly, we must \u2018assume that a statutory amendment is purposeful, rather than unnecessary.\u2019\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>59 Va.App. at 503, 720 S.E.2d at 161 (quoting <em>Britt Constr., Inc., </em>271 Va. at 63, 623 S.E.2d at 888).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The elimination of the express requirement that the certificate indicate that the breath test equipment has been tested and found accurate within the past six months demonstrates the General Assembly\u2019s intent no longer to require the Commonwealth to introduce evidence regarding the maintenance of breath test equipment in order to admit a certificate of analysis into evidence. The addition of the phrase \u201con equipment maintained by the Department\u201d in another sentence in the statute does not negate this intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">The provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-268.11 are relevant at this point. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-8\">The steps set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-268.2 through 18.2-268.9 relating to taking, handling, identifying, and disposing of blood or breath samples are procedural and not substantive. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Substantial compliance shall be sufficient. Failure to comply with any steps or portions thereof shall not of itself be grounds for finding the defendant not guilty, but shall go to the weight of the evidence and shall be considered with all the evidence in the case; however, the defendant shall have the right to introduce evidence on his own behalf to show noncompliance with the aforesaid procedures or any part thereof, and that as a result his rights were prejudiced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AU\">Code \u00a7 18.2-268.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The language in Code \u00a7 18.2-268.9 regarding \u201cequipment maintained by the Department\u201d does not constitute a requirement that the Commonwealth must affirmatively prove to render a certificate admissible as evidence. Rather, it is a procedural circumstance for which a defendant may introduce evidence to show noncompliance that has resulted in prejudice to his rights. In other words, under the statutory scheme, a certificate is admissible into evidence without an affirmative showing by the Commonwealth that the breath test equipment was properly maintained by the Department. However, a defendant is free to introduce evidence showing that the breath test equipment was <em>not </em>properly maintained by the Department and that this noncompliance with proper procedure resulted in prejudice to his rights. The failure of the Commonwealth to comply with proper maintenance requirements for breath test equipment does not render certificates of blood alcohol analysis inadmissible. Instead, such failure \u201cgo[es] to the weight of the evidence and shall be considered with all the evidence in the case.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-268.11; <em>see Cutright v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 593, 600-01, 601 S.E.2d 1, 4 (2004) (noting that \u201c[b]y statute, ... the legislative remedy for a <em>procedural violation </em>is not suppression of the evidence, but a full and fair opportunity for both sides to attempt to prove or disprove any prejudicial effect of the violation\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>We are guided in our analysis by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Stroupe, </em>215 Va. 243, 207 S.E.2d 894. In <em>Stroupe, </em>the defendant argued that the Commonwealth had not introduced affirmative evidence proving compliance with all the various statutory requirements for breath tests and certificates of analysis. <em>Id. </em>at 244-45, 207 S.E.2d at 895-96. Noting that the certificate in that case \u201ccontained every averment, datum, signature, and attestation specifically required by the statute,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 244-45, 207 S.E.2d at 896, the Supreme Court held that \u201c[w]hen the certificate contains what the statute requires, the statute makes the certificate self-authenticating for purposes of admissibility,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 245, 207 S.E.2d at 896.</p>\n<p id=\"AY\">The Court proceeded to explain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">Once the certificate is admitted, the statute makes it evidence of the alcoholic content of the blood to be considered with all other evidence in the case. But the statute does not make the certificate conclusive evidence of the statutory regularity of the test. With respect to regularity of the test, the statute affords the defendant the right to prove noncompliance with test procedures---- Even had [the defendant] ... proved some prejudicial irregularity in test procedures, such proof would not have defeated admissibility of the certificate but only affected its weight as evidence of the alcoholic content of his blood.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-9\"><em>Id.; see also Woolridge v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 339, 345, 512 S.E.2d 153, 156 (1999) (noting that when a \u201ccertificate complie[s] with all the requirements contained in Code \u00a7 18.2-268.9, ... the burden [is] on appellant to prove a substantive, rather than merely procedural, irregularity sufficient to defeat the certificate\u2019s admissibility\u201d). This is essentially the reasoning we have set forth above in response to Fitzgerald\u2019s argument. \u201cSimply put, the statute does not require proof of the accuracy of an individual test as a prerequisite to admissibility of the resulting certificate.\u201d <em>Woolridge, </em>29 Va.App. at 345, 512 S.E.2d at 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Furthermore, the Court in <em>Stroupe </em>noted that \u201c[t]here was evidence on the face of the certificate that the test was performed by [a licensed] operator.\u201d 215 Va. at 244, 207 S.E.2d at 896. The Court held that this \u201cevidence raise[d] the reasonable inference that such operator was trained with a [properly approved] machine ..., in [properly approved] methods ..., and that the same machine and methods were used to conduct the test administered to defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, the certificate in this case contains an attestation \u201cthat the test was conducted with the type of equipment and in accordance with the methods approved by the Department of Forensic Science.\u201d This evidence permits the reasonable inference that the equipment was maintained by the Department. Indeed, Fitzgerald introduced no evidence indicating that the equipment had not been properly maintained by the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">It is true that Code \u00a7 9.1-1101 requires the Department to \u201c[t]est the accuracy of equipment used to test the blood alcohol content of breath at least once every six months,\u201d and mandates that \u201c[o]nly equipment found to be accurate shall be used to test the blood alcohol content of breath.\u201d Code \u00a7 9.1-1101(B)(3). However, a plain reading of Code \u00a7 18.2-268.9 indicates that the Commonwealth is not required to introduce affirmative evidence showing the Department\u2019s compliance with Code \u00a7 9.1-1101(B)(3) before a certificate of blood alcohol analysis becomes admissible. Rather, the substantial compliance provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-268.11 explained above indicate that the defendant has the burden of producing evidence showing noncompliance with procedural requirements like that contained in Code \u00a7 9.1-1101(B)(3). This is consistent with the general principle that \u201c[t]here is a presumption that public officials will perform their duties in accordance with the law.\u201d <em>Bd. of Supervisors v. Safeco Ins. Co. of Am., </em>226 Va. 329, 338, 310 S.E.2d 445, 450 (1983); <em>see also Mar v. Malveaux, </em>60 Va.App. 759, 772, 732 S.E.2d 733, 739 (2012) (\u201c[I]t is \u2018presumed that public officials will discharge their duties honestly and in accordance with law.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Ours Properties, Inc. v. Ley, </em>198 Va. 848, 851, 96 S.E.2d 754, 756 (1957))). Thus, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>purposes of admitting a certificate of analysis into evidence under Code \u00a7 18.2-268.9, the Department\u2019s compliance with requirements like that prescribed in Code \u00a7 9.1-1101(B)(3) is presumed, but the defendant has the right to introduce evidence showing noncompliance by the Department that prejudiced the defendant\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">Fitzgerald cites <em>Brooks v. City of Newport News, </em>224 Va. 311, 295 S.E.2d 801 (1982), to support his argument. In <em>Brooks, </em>the certificate of analysis showed on its face that the breath test operator\u2019s license had expired several weeks before he conducted the defendant\u2019s breath test. <em>Id. </em>at 313-14, 295 S.E.2d at 802-03. The Supreme Court noted that although \u201cthe statute does not require the expiration date of the license to be recorded on the certificate of analysis,\u201d the fact that it was recorded revealed \u201ca patent inconsistency with [the operator\u2019s] certification that he possessed a valid license.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 314, 295 S.E.2d at 803. Here, however, there was no evidence demonstrating noncompliance with the requirements of the statute. Thus, <em>Brooks </em>does not apply to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">\u201cThe burden is on the Commonwealth to show that it substantially complied with the requirements of the statute.\u201d <em>Snider v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 729, 732, 496 S.E.2d 665, 666 (1998). \u201cWhen the certificate contains what the statute requires, the statute makes the certificate self-authenticating for purposes of admissibility.\u201d <em>Stroupe, </em>215 Va. at 245, 207 S.E.2d at 896. The record here demonstrates that the certificate of analysis contained what Code \u00a7 18.2-268.9 requires. Therefore, we hold that the trial court did not commit an error of law and thereby abuse its discretion in admitting the certificate into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Furthermore, our analysis regarding the admissibility of the certificate of blood alcohol analysis is unaffected by the question of whether it was error to admit the certificate of instrument accuracy into evidence. Assuming without deciding that the trial court erred in admitting the certificate of instrument accuracy, we hold that because proof of the facts in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>the certificate of instrument accuracy was not a prerequisite to the admissibility of the certificate of blood alcohol analysis, the trial court did not err in admitting the certificate of blood alcohol analysis and the breath test results it contained. In light of this holding, we also hold that any error in admitting the certificate of instrument accuracy was harmless on the facts of this case. <em>See Atkins v. Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 144, 154, 631 S.E.2d 93, 98 (2006) (discussing standard for non-constitutional harmless error); <em>Lilly v. Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 548, 551, 523 S.E.2d 208, 209 (1999) (discussing standard for constitutional harmless error).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Fitzgerald\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b327-8\">. In addition to containing the certification date of the equipment, the certificate of instrument accuracy also contained the following certification: \"The above listed instrument was found to meet all requirements for accuracy and performance established by the Department of Forensic Science.

Code \u00a7 18.2-268.9(A) sets forth the foundation the Commonwealth must establish for the results of a breath test to be \"considered valid as evidence,\u201d or in other words, the foundation for the admissibility of the actual test results. Fitzgerald does not argue that these foundational requirements were not met.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b332-6\">.
