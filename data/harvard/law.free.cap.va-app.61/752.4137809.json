Ross argues on appeal that the trial court should have suppressed the evidence of his guilt because the police discovered the firearms in his residence without a warrant. We agree and reverse his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-13\">When reviewing a denial of a suppression motion, we view the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, giving it the benefit of any reasonable inferences.\u201d <em>Glenn v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 413, 416, 642 S.E.2d 282, 283 (2007) <em>(en </em>banc) (citation omitted), <em>aff'd, </em>275 Va. 123, 654 S.E.2d 910 (2008). This standard requires us to \u201cgive due weight to inferences drawn from those facts by resident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>279 Va. 521, 528, 690 S.E.2d 95, 99 (2010) (citation omitted). \u201cIn doing so, we consider facts presented both at the suppression hearing and at trial.\u201d <em>Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>61 Va.App. 112, 116, 733 S.E.2d 683, 685 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">So viewed, the evidence showed Ross filed a petition in the Amherst County Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court seeking additional visitation with his daughter, who was in the physical custody of her mother. The JDR district court ordered the Lynchburg Department of Social Services (DSS) to conduct a \u201chome study\u201d of Ross and to report its findings to the court. <em>See </em>App. at 42. The order authorized an unannounced visit, but did not authorize the DSS social worker to enter Ross\u2019s residence against his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Prior to conducting the home study, the DSS social worker determined that Ross was a \u201cconvicted felon,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>id. </em>at 19, and suspected him of distributing marijuana. The social worker also obtained from an undisclosed source a photo of Ross holding what appeared to be an SKS rifle. Another photo showed Ross and one of his children together holding the same rifle. The social worker also suspected Ross of a \u201cviolent background with women\u201d including his ex-wife. <em>Id. </em>Given his concerns, the social worker asked the Lynchburg police to provide backup security during the home visit. The social worker provided the police with the results of his investigation of Ross. He also advised the police \u201cthere was a possibility there may be minor children in the residence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">On the day of the home visit, the social worker arrived at Ross\u2019s home and spoke with Ross in the front yard. As the social worker remembers it, Ross \u201cwas trying everything verbally to convince me that he didn\u2019t want me in his home at that point.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 46. Ross did not threaten the social <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>worker or commit any criminal act in the social worker\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">A police officer, viewing the situation from an unmarked police car, saw Ross \u201cgetting upset and somewhat agitated\u201d and \u201cflaring his arms around\u201d while speaking to the social worker. <em>Id. </em>at 7. The officer called for uniformed officers in a marked police car to pull up in front of the home. As they drove up, they observed Ross to be \u201cextremely nervous,\u201d \u201cvery tense and expressionless,\u201d and his body \u201cappeared to become very rigid and upright.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15. When Ross saw the marked police car come to a stop, he ran back into his residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">The uniformed officers did not observe Ross commit any \u201ccriminal act\u201d or possess any \u201cdangerous instrumentality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17. Nor did they conclude they had \u201cprobable cause\u201d to arrest Ross for any crime. <em>Id. </em>at 18. Nonetheless, while the social worker remained outside, two officers, with weapons drawn, entered Ross\u2019s residence and placed him in handcuffs. No evidence suggested he was armed or about to arm himself. The officers observed a small child on a couch. The officers then made a protective sweep of the residence and discovered in plain view marijuana and various firearms. Based upon their observations, the officers obtained a search warrant and seized the incriminating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">Prior to trial, Ross moved to suppress the incriminating evidence found in his residence. He claimed the officers\u2019 warrantless entry violated the Fourth Amendment, and thus, the later warrant based upon that entry was likewise invalid. The trial court denied the motion and conducted a jury trial at which Ross was convicted of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">On appeal, Ross contends the trial court erred in not suppressing the evidence of his guilt discovered during the warrantless entry into his residence. In response, the Commonwealth argues the warrantless entry was justified under the emergency and community-caretaker exceptions to the warrant requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">A. The Warrant Requirement &amp; Exceptions</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">\u201cAmong the many interests served by the Fourth Amendment, the privacy interest in one\u2019s home has few equals.\u201d <em>Kyer v. Commonwealth, </em>45 Va.App. 473, 480-81, 612 S.E.2d 213, 217 (2005) <em>(en banc); see also Washington v. Commonwealth, </em>60 Va.App. 427, 436-37, 728 S.E.2d 521, 526 (2012). \u201cAt the very core of the Fourth Amendment stands the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion.\u201d <em>Kyllo v. United States, </em>533 U.S. 27, 31, 121 S.Ct. 2038, 2041, 150 L.Ed.2d 94 (2001) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cIt is axiomatic that the \u2018physical entry of the home is the chief evil against which the wording of the Fourth Amendment is directed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Welsh v. Wisconsin, </em>466 U.S. 740, 748, 104 S.Ct. 2091, 2097, 80 L.Ed.2d 732 (1984) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">As a general rule, \u201csearches and seizures inside a home without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable.\u201d <em>Kentucky v. King, </em>- U.S. -, -, 131 S.Ct. 1849, 1856, 179 L.Ed.2d 865 (2011) (citation omitted). \u201cBut even on this topic the Fourth Amendment\u2019s text endorses no absolutes. It instead condemns only \u2018unreasonable\u2019 searches and seizures.\u201d <em>Kyer, </em>45 Va.App. at 480, 612 S.E.2d at 217. The \u201cpresumption may be overcome in some circumstances\u201d because the \u201cwarrant requirement is subject to certain reasonable exceptions.\u201d <em>King, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 1856.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-11\">\u201cOne well-recognized exception applies when \u2018the exigencies of the situation\u2019 make the needs of law enforcement so compelling that a warrantless search is objectively reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Washington, </em>60 Va.App. at 436, 728 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>S.E.2d at 526 (quoting <em>King, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 1856). Such exigencies often arise in one of two scenarios: (i) where the police have probable cause to enter or search a location or thing, but exigent circumstances excuse the need to obtain a warrant, and (ii) where no probable cause exists, but a warrantless entry or search is justified because of an emergency.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">In the first category, the exigent circumstance exception \u201cnecessarily embraces the separate, but closely related, question of probable cause.\u201d <em>Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>56 Va.App. 592, 600, 696 S.E.2d 211, 215 (2010); <em>see also Alexander v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 671, 674, 454 S.E.2d 39, 41 (1995). In these cases, the police have probable cause to enter or search <em>and </em>exigent circumstances justify doing so without first obtaining a warrant. <em>See, e.g., Verez v. Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 405, 337 S.E.2d 749 (1985) (holding police had probable cause to believe a motel room contained drugs prior to the warrantless entry); <em>Washington, </em>60 Va.App. at 437-38, 728 S.E.2d at 526-27 (finding probable cause and exigent circumstances to enter what appeared to be a recently burglarized residence).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">In the second category, the exigency need not be directly related to suspected criminality. In such cases, the constitutional reasonableness standard \u201crecognizes the \u2018right of the police to enter and investigate\u2019 when someone\u2019s health or physical safety is genuinely threatened,\u201d (the so-called emergency exception), and also takes into account that \u201cpolice owe \u2018duties to the public, such as rendering aid to individuals in danger of physical harm, reducing the commission of crimes through patrol and other preventive measures, and providing services on an emergency basis,\u2019 \u201d (often called the community-caretaker exception). <em>Kyer, 45 </em>Va.App. at 480-81, 612 S.E.2d at 217 (citation omitted); <em>see also Knight v. Commonwealth, </em>61 Va.App. 297, 306-07, 734 S.E.2d 716, 720-21 (2012) (surveying the scope of the community-caretaker exception).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>In this case, the Commonwealth concedes the officers did not have probable cause to believe Ross may have committed (or was about to commit) a crime. Nor does the Commonwealth contend that Ross had hidden or destroyed (or was about to hide or destroy) incriminating evidence in his residence. On appeal, the Commonwealth relies solely on the emergency and community-caretaker exceptions to the warrant requirement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We find neither applicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">B. The Emergency Exception</p>\n<p id=\"AJ\">The emergency exception recognizes \u201cthat the Fourth Amendment permits an officer to enter a residence if the officer has a reasonable basis for concluding that there is an imminent threat of violence.\u201d <em>Ryburn v. Huff, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 132 S.Ct. 987, 990, 181 L.Ed.2d 966 (2012) <em>(per </em>curiam). When this exception applies, the \u201cneed to protect or preserve life or avoid serious injury is justification for what would be otherwise illegal absent an exigency or emergency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Brigham City v. Stuart, </em>547 U.S. 398, 403, 126 S.Ct. 1943, 1947, 164 L.Ed.2d 650 (2006)). Police officers understandably must respond, with or without a warrant, to any \u201cimminent threat to their safety and to the safety of others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 132 S.Ct. at 991; <em>see also Kyer, </em>45 Va.App. at 480-81, 612 S.E.2d at 217. It follows that \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>police may seize any evidence that is in plain view during the course of their legitimate emergency activities.\u201d <em>Mincey v. Arizona, </em>437 U.S. 385, 393, 98 S.Ct. 2408, 2413, 57 L.Ed.2d 290 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">When determining whether the emergency exception applies, a court should not look at \u201ceach separate event in isolation\u201d in support of the <em>faux </em>conclusion that \u201ceach, in itself, did not give cause for concern.\u201d <em>Rybum, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 132 S.Ct. at 991. As is always the case, a court should examine the totality of the circumstances, for \u201cit is a matter of common sense that a combination of events each of which is mundane when viewed in isolation may paint an alarming picture.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under the Fourth Amendment, \u201creasonableness \u2018must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight,\u2019 \u201d and the \u201ccalculus of reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments\u2014in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 132 S.Ct. at 992 (quoting <em>Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 396-97, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 1872, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-10\">The Commonwealth contends the emergency exception applies to this case because of the \u201cdanger to anybody in the house <em>once </em>[the social worker] entered.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. at 7 (emphasis added). This justification, however, depends entirely on the assumption that the social worker in fact would have entered the residence and thereby triggered the emergency situation. We find nothing in the record to support this assumption. Ross did not want the social worker in his home and told him so. The JDR district court \u201chome study\u201d order did not authorize the social worker to enter Ross\u2019s residence against his will.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And nothing in the record suggests the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>social worker attempted to defy Ross and enter anyway. Other than asking for permission to enter and being turned down, the social worker made no effort to enter the residence. The police, therefore, faced no emergency\u2014much less one constituting an imminent threat to their safety or to the safety of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Perhaps this case would be different if the social worker had already entered the residence, if the social worker had some legal right to enter over Ross\u2019s refusal, if Ross had reluctantly invited him inside despite his animated misgivings, if Ross had threatened him in any way, or if Ross had said or done anything to suggest he intended to arm himself. Any of these circumstances, given Ross\u2019s reputation for violence, may very well have justified a warrantless entry by the police. But none of them were shown to exist in this case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">C. The Community-Caretaker Exception</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">The Commonwealth also contends the community-caretaker doctrine applies because of the officers\u2019 duty to protect both the social worker and any of Ross\u2019s children within the residence. We again disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>As we have already concluded, the social worker did not need protection as he stood outside the residence, and nothing suggested he would have entered the residence contrary to Ross\u2019s wishes. As for Ross\u2019s children, the police had been told only that \u201cthere was a possibility there may be minor children in the residence.\u201d App. at 20. <em>Cf. Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 439, 453, 642 S.E.2d 295, 301 (2007) <em>(en </em>banc) (finding a warrantless entry valid, for purposes of a protective sweep following an arrest, where \u201cpolice officers did have information indicating the presence of others inside the apartment\u201d). But no evidence suggested a reasonable likelihood that children were in Ross\u2019s residence at the time the police entered. Nor did the circumstances imply that Ross intended to harm his children during this episode. While talking with the social worker, Ross made no threats concerning the children and said nothing to suggest he would put their safety at risk. It is possible, as the Commonwealth contends, that a child could become an unintended victim of violence if an altercation broke out between Ross and the DSS social worker either inside or outside the residence\u2014but that scenario did not arise in this case, nor was there any imminent risk of it arising.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Because neither the emergency nor community-caretaker exceptions rebut the presumption that the warrantless entry into Ross\u2019s residence violated the Fourth Amendment, the trial court erred in denying Ross\u2019s motion to suppress. We thus reverse the trial court\u2019s order denying the motion to suppress, vacate the conviction, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b801-7\">. In 2004, the JDR district court found Ross guilty of two counts of distributing cocaine, a felony under Code \u00a7 18.2-248. Because he was 17 at the time of the offense, Ross received a delinquency adjudication from the JDR district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b802-7\">. Ross\u2019s juvenile adjudication finding him guilty of distributing cocaine served as the predicate offense under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A)(iii) (\"It shall be unlawful for ... any person under the age of 29 who was adjudicated delinquent as a juvenile 14 years of age or older at the time of the offense of a delinquent act which would be a felony if committed by an adult....\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b804-8\">. The community-caretaker exception also extends to situations not involving any emergency conditions. <em>See, e.g., Williams v. Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number><em>wealth, </em>42 Va.App. 723, 731, 594 S.E.2d 305, 309 (2004) (recognizing that, \"[u]nder the community caretaker exception, the police may conduct a warrantless inventory search of a vehicle\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b805-11\">. The Commonwealth does not argue that the search warrant would have justified the seizure of evidence from Ross's residence notwithstanding the allegedly tainted information gained during the initial warrantless entry. <em>See Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 612, 619, 496 S.E.2d 113, 116 (1998); <em>accord United States v. Moses, </em>540 F.3d 263, 271 (4th Cir.2008); <em>United States v.

In this respect, the JDR district court \"home study\" order was unlike orders sometimes issued during child abuse investigations expressly authorizing nonconsensual entry. \"In child-abuse investigations, a Family Court order is equivalent to a search warrant for Fourth Amendment purposes.\u201d <em>Southerland v. City of New York, </em>680 F.3d 127, 144 n. 15 (2d Cir.2011) (citing <em>Nicholson v.

We offer no opinion on the validity of such orders under Virginia law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b807-9\">. We reject Ross's assertion that the police attempted (albeit unsuccessfully) to create exigent circumstances that would excuse the need to obtain a search warrant. Whether they did or not is irrelevant. For Fourth Amendment purposes, the objective facts\u2014not the subjective intent of the police\u2014determines whether exigent circumstances exist. If the officers' actions were objectively reasonable, and they did not gain entry to the premises by an actual or threatened violation of the Fourth Amendment, it matters not that they \"deliberately created the exigent circumstances with the bad faith intent to avoid the warrant requirement.\u201d King, - U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 1859 (quoting and disapproving of <em>King v. Kentucky, </em>302 S.W.3d 649 (Ky.2010)). <em>King </em>supersedes our overly broad <em>dicta </em>in <em>Crosby v.

Our holding does not forbid the Commonwealth, if it be so advised, from retrying Ross based upon evidence free of the taint of the unlawful entry into his residence. <em>See United States v. MacDonald, </em>435 U.S. 850, 861 n. 7, 98 S.Ct. 1547, 1553 n. 7, 56 L.Ed.2d 18 (1978) (\"Dismissal of the indictment is the proper sanction ... when the <em>only </em>evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>against him was seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>see generally </em>1 LaFave, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 1.6(c), at 248. In addition to the firearms discovered in Ross\u2019s residence, the record contains photos of Ross holding what appears to be a firearm prior to the search. After the search, Ross made statements concerning those photos. Because the trial court denied the motion to suppress, the court did not address what the proper scope of a suppression order would be if one had been entered. We will not address this issue for the first time on appeal. \"While the conclusions we have reached require us to reverse the [trial] court's ruling\u201d that Ross\u2019s \"constitutional rights were not violated, those conclusions do not determine the scope of the suppression order (if any) to be entered.\u201d <em>United States v.
