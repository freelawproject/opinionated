Marine Res. Comm\u2019n v. Chincoteague Inn, </em>60 Va.App. 585, 731 S.E.2d 6 (2012). The Virginia Marine Resources Commission (\u201cVMRC\u201d) initially appealed an order of the Circuit Court of Accomack County (\u201ccircuit court\u201d) holding that VMRC lacked jurisdiction to order Chincoteague Inn (\u201cInn\u201d) to remove a vessel from over state-owned subaqueous bottomland.

Marine Res. Comm\u2019n v. Chincoteague Inn, </em>60 Va.App. 719, 732 S.E.2d 45 (2012). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Upon rehearing en banc, we hold that the circuit court did not err in holding that VMRC lacked jurisdiction to order the removal of a temporarily moored vessel from over state-owned subaqueous bottomlands. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">At some point prior to June 8, 2010, the Inn borrowed a barge from BIC, Inc., moored it to the dock outside the Inn along the Chincoteague Channel, outfitted it with a new deck, tables, and chairs, and installed and connected the barge to shore power and water. The Inn did this with the intent of using the vessel<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for four months as additional seating for its restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">On June 8, 2010, another restaurant owner notified VMRC staff that the Inn had made this addition. VMRC staff conducted a site inspection on June 11, 2010, and determined that part of the vessel was over state-owned subaqueous bottomland. On June 15, 2010, VMRC sent a notice to comply to the Inn, through Raymond Britton (\u201cBritton\u201d), the manager of the Inn, regarding the portion of the vessel that was over state-owned subaqueous bottomland without a permit. Specifically, the letter notified the Inn that the \u201cwestern 54-foot by 13.6-foot portion\u201d of the \u201c71.5-foot long by 13.6-foot wide floating platform/pier and a 30-foot by 33.5-foot floating platform with a 22-foot by 12-foot roof structure that is open on three sides\u201d was within VMRC\u2019s jurisdiction and needed to be removed within ten days of receipt of the letter. The letter stated further that the matter would be placed before the full Commission for an enforcement action if the Inn failed to comply within the time specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">The Inn then submitted a joint permit application (\u201capplication\u201d) to the Commission on June 18, 2010, for an after-the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>fact-permit for the entire vessel. By e-mail on June 22, 2010, VMRC notified the Inn that they would not process the Inn\u2019s application until the structure was removed. VMRC sent a second e-mail to the Inn on June 24, 2010, asking whether the Inn was going to withdraw its application, reiterating that VMRC could not proceed with the application until the vessel was removed, and restating that the Inn\u2019s failure to remove the vessel would result in a VMRC enforcement action. VMRC staff conducted another site inspection on June 28, 2010, and found that the vessel had not been removed and was secured to the pier with mooring lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">On August 24, 2010, the Commission held a hearing on the Inn\u2019s failure to comply. At the hearing, Britton testified that he had been in marine construction for about twenty-five years and that his company, BIC, Inc., owned several barges, one of which is the vessel at issue, and that the barges were moored at the Inn when they were not in use. With regard to the subject vessel, Britton testified that they installed new decking and a handrail on it. Britton also testified there was additional seating on the barge and two gangways from the restaurant to the barge, each connected to the restaurant so that the gangways could be raised. Britton then stated that on July 19, 2010, they disconnected the water and electricity lines, pulled the gangways up, removed the vessel from her slip by use of its push boat, traveled down the Chincoteague Channel to the old drawbridge, returned to the slip, moored it to the Inn\u2019s dock, and reconnected the lines all within thirty-two minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">During the hearing, there was division among the Commissioners as to whether the barge was a vessel and whether the Commission had any authority over the vessel\u2014regardless of whether it was a barge or floating platform. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Commission concluded that the \u201cfloating structure\u201d was an unlawful use of state-owned subaqueous bottomland, pursuant to Code \u00a7 28.2-1203, and directed the Inn to remove the portion of the vessel under VMRC\u2019s jurisdiction within ten days. The Commission made no express finding that the structure was a vessel. On August 26, 2010, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>the Commission sent a letter to the Inn setting forth its holding and directing the removal of the portion of the vessel over state-owned subaqueous bottomlands.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">On September 16, 2010, VMRC notified the Inn that it was violating the Commission\u2019s order due to its failure to remove the vessel within the established time frame. VMRC then referred the matter to the Attorney General to petition the appropriate circuit court for an order requiring removal of part of the vessel as well as the assessment of civil penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The Inn mailed its notice of appeal to VMRC on September 23, 2010. On appeal to the circuit court, the Inn argued that VMRC lacked jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 28.2-1203 to regulate a temporarily moored vessel floating over state-owned subaqueous bottomland and that federal maritime law precludes state regulation over a vessel in navigation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In response, VMRC argued that the Commonwealth owned the subaqueous bottomland and VMRC had jurisdiction to regulate the vessel because VMRC\u2019s scope of authority included regulating encroachments over state-owned subaqueous bottomlands pursuant to Code \u00a7 28.2-1203.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">On October 14, 2011, the circuit court heard argument and accepted the Inn\u2019s position, ruling that VMRC lacked jurisdiction over the vessel as its mooring was not a permanent attachment to land and it was capable of being moved from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>place to place in navigable waters. The circuit court then deferred ruling on the Inn\u2019s request for fees and costs. In its final order issued on December 20, 2011, the circuit court found that VMRC erred in determining that it had jurisdiction over the vessel and was not in compliance with the statutory authority and/or jurisdiction limitations set forth in Code \u00a7 2.2-4027. The circuit court also awarded the Inn its fees and costs since it had \u201csubstantially prevailed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">On August 14, 2012, a panel of this Court reversed the circuit court\u2019s decision holding that VMRC had jurisdiction to order the removal of the vessel, and reversing and remanding for the circuit court to determine the issues presented in the Inn\u2019s petition for appeal to the circuit court, including the scope of Code \u00a7 28.2-1203. <em>Va. Marine Res. Comm\u2019n, </em>60 Va.App. at 599, 731 S.E.2d at 13. On appeal, the panel held that the issue was \u201cwhether federal maritime law preempts the state\u2019s ability to order the removal of the structure\u201d while noting that VMRC never ruled on federal preemption. <em>Id. </em>at 591, 731 S.E.2d at 9. Based on four factors, the panel held that federal law did not preempt VMRC from ordering the removal of the vessel pursuant to its right to regulate encroachments upon or over the state-owned subaqueous bottomlands. <em>Id. </em>at 597-99, 731 S.E.2d at 12. The panel also vacated the circuit court\u2019s award of fees and costs to the Inn, and remanded for a determination of fees and costs, if any, based on Code \u00a7 2.2-4030. <em>Id. </em>at 599, 731 S.E.2d at 12-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">On September 18, 2012, this Court granted the Inn\u2019s petition for a rehearing en banc with regard to the issues raised by the Inn in the petition, stayed the mandate of the panel\u2019s decision, and reinstated the appeal. <em>Va.

ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">On appeal, VMRC contends that the circuit court\u2019s ruling that VMRC lacked jurisdiction over the vessel should be reversed because the Commission has jurisdiction to order cessation of encroachments over state-owned subaqueous bottomlands and this jurisdiction is not preempted by federal maritime law particularly as it relates to floating additions to restaurants. The Inn argues, however, that the circuit court did not err because the scope of Code \u00a7 28.2-1203 does not create jurisdiction in VMRC to regulate a vessel either in transit or temporarily moored over state-owned subaqueous bottomland so as to require it to be permitted under Code \u00a7\u00a7 28.2-1203 and -1204, or removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">Before addressing whether federal law preempts state law, we must first determine if the statute grants VMRC jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>tion to order the removal of a temporarily moored vessel. Thus, the threshold issue in this case is whether Code \u00a7 28.2-1203 provides VMRC jurisdiction over vessels temporarily moored over state-owned subaqueous bottomlands. In making this determination, we must look to the language of the statute and the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting it. <em>Evelyn, </em>46 Va.App. at 629-30, 621 S.E.2d at 136.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-4\">\u201cIn construing statutes, courts are charged with ascertaining and giving effect to the intent of the legislature.\u201d <em>Crown Cent. Petroleum Corp. v. Hill, </em>254 Va. 88, 91, 488 S.E.2d 345, 346 (1997). \u201cThat intention is initially found in the words of the statute itself, and if those words are clear and unambiguous, we do not rely on rules of statutory construction or parol evidence, unless a literal application would produce a meaningless or absurd result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). \u201c[Wjords and phrases used in a statute should be given their ordinary and usually accepted meaning unless a different intention is fairly manifest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-5\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Woolfolk v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 840, 847, 447 S.E.2d 530, 534 (1994)). Thus, \u201c \u2018[w]hen the language of a statute is unambiguous, we are bound by the plain meaning of that language.... If[, however,] a statute is subject to more than one interpretation, we must apply the interpretation that will carry out the legislative intent behind the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Scott v. Commonwealth, </em>58 Va.App. 35, 48, 707 S.E.2d 17, 24 (2011) (quoting <em>Evans v. Evans, </em>280 Va. 76, 82, 695 S.E.2d 173, 176 (2010)).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Although Code \u00a7 28.2-1203 is part of the law that has been codified by the General Assembly and entrusted to VMRC to apply, the outcome of this appeal turns on the statutory interpretation of Code \u00a7 28.2-1203. Therefore, we do not give the agency\u2019s interpretation of its jurisdiction under the statute any deference. See <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Va. State Water Control Bd., </em>56 Va.App. at 481, 694 S.E.2d at 296 (quoting <em>The Mattaponi Indian Tribe, </em>43 Va.App. at 707, 601 S.E.2d at 676). Furthermore, while the statute is penal, it \u201chas a primarily regulatory, non-penal purpose and should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>construed liberally in favor of the public interest rather than against it.\u201d <em>Evelyn, </em>46 Va.App. at 631, 621 S.E.2d at 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">In 1953, the United States Congress ceded title and ownership of lands beneath navigable waters within a state\u2019s boundaries to that respective state, as well as the natural resources within such lands and waters.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Submerged Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1311; <em>see also Taylor v.

Pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 28.2-1203, and -1204, VMRC\u2019s jurisdiction includes its authority to require permits from any person who \u201cbuild[s], dump[s], trespass[es] <em>or encroach[es] upon or over, </em>or take[s] or use[s] any materials from the beds of the bays, ocean, rivers, streams, or creeks which are the property of the Commonwealth,.... \u201d (Emphasis added). While Code \u00a7 28.2-1203(A) makes it unlawful, absent the issuance of a permit, for a person to \u201cencroach upon or over\u201d state-owned subaqueous bottomlands, it does not define the term \u201cencroach.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Webster\u2019s Third International Dictionary defines \u201cencroach\u201d as \u201cto enter by gradual steps or by stealth into the possessions or rights of another\u201d or \u201cto advance beyond desirable or normal limits.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third International Dictionary </em>747 (2002). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary also defines \u201cencroach\u201d as \u201c[t]o enter by gradual steps or stealth into the possessions or rights of another,\u201d but also defines it as \u201c[t]o gain or intrude unlawfully upon another\u2019s lands, property, or authority.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>607 (9th ed.2009). Thus, when applying the plain meaning of the word in conjunction with the legislative intent behind the statute, one must be unlawfully over the state-owned bottomlands such that it violates the right of \u201call the people of the Commonwealth\u201d to use the bottomlands \u201cfor the purpose of fishing, fowling, hunting, and taking and catching oysters and other shellfish,\u201d Code \u00a7 28.2-1200, and prohibits the Commonwealth from properly manag<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>ing the bottomlands in order for the action to constitute an encroachment under Code \u00a7 28.2-1203.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">Although a portion of the vessel was temporarily moored over state-owned bottomlands, it was not unlawfully encroaching over the bottomlands such that it violated the rights of the people of the Commonwealth to use the bottomlands. Neither did it interfere with VMRC\u2019s management of state-owned bottomlands or fish and shellfish habitats. The focus of Code \u00a7 28.2-1203 is to ensure the continued use and enjoyment of the bottomlands consistent with the Commonwealth\u2019s policy as well as the public trust doctrine. To that end, VMRC is authorized to regulate and require permits where such use of the bottomlands is in contravention of Code \u00a7 28.2-1203. The statute, however, does not require an individual temporarily mooring a vessel over bottomlands, without more, to first obtain a permit nor did the legislature intend a temporarily moored vessel to constitute an \u201cencroachment\u201d requiring a permit. If that were the case, every vessel owner would be in jeopardy whenever they were temporarily moored over state-owned bottomlands.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Furthermore, if the statute authorized VMRC to require a permit for a vessel every time it was temporarily moored, it would be impossible for VMRC to implement as vessels can move and stop over the bottomlands numerous times in one day. In addition, under VMRC\u2019s sweeping conception of \u201cencroachment,\u201d any owner of a vessel temporarily moored over state-owned bottomland who did not obtain a permit from VMRC would be subject to a fine of up to $25,000 per day and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>prosecution for a Class 1 misdemeanor. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 28.2-1203(B) (Class 1 misdemeanor); -1211 (injunction against violations of Code \u00a7 28.2-1203); -1212 (monitoring, inspections, compliance, and restoration); -1213 (penalties). Accordingly, this Court declines to utilize such a broad interpretation as it would produce an absurd result in contravention to the legislature\u2019s intent, and holds that a vessel, such as the one at issue, temporarily moored over state-owned bottom-lands is not an encroachment\u2014an unlawful intrusion\u2014requiring a permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Based on the foregoing, this Court holds that the circuit court did not err in holding that VMRC lacked jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 28.2-1203 to order the removal of the temporarily moored vessel. Because we hold that the circuit court did not err in its ruling on jurisdiction, we need not address whether federal law preempts state law as there is no state law applicable. Accordingly, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s order including its award of fees and costs to the Inn.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b419-8\">.
