Following a bench trial, he was also convicted of felony murder predicated on the felony driving while intoxicated offense. On appeal, appellant argues the trial court erred by 1) \u201cimputing malice to [his] action of drunk driving,\u201d 2) \u201cholding that the homicide was within the <em>res gestae </em>of the felonious undertaking,\u201d 3) \u201cfinding that [he] caused the death in an effort to further the underlying felony,\u201d and 4) \u201cviolating the principles of double jeopardy by imposing punishments for involuntary manslaughter and felony murder for the death of one person.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We disagree and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">\u201cUnder familiar principles of appellate review, we view the evidence and all reasonable inferences fairly deducible from that evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the party that prevailed below.\u201d <em>Banks v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 539, 543, 586 S.E.2d 876, 877 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>So viewed, the evidence proved that on the morning of August 1, 2010, Steven Lester was driving in a 45-mile-per-hour zone when he saw appellant\u2019s vehicle rapidly approaching him from behind. Lester explained appellant\u2019s vehicle appeared to hit the wall of a bridge and then bounce towards the wall on the opposite side of the road. Appellant\u2019s ear struck a vehicle in which three women were riding. One of the women died as a result of injuries sustained in the collision, and the other two suffered serious injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Appellant was transported to a hospital after emergency assistance arrived at the scene of the crash. Appellant\u2019s blood was tested at the hospital, and his blood alcohol content was .20% by weight by volume at the time the test was administered. The police found nearly twenty beer containers in appellant\u2019s vehicle. One of the open cans still contained beer and had condensation on it, suggesting appellant had been drinking it while driving, although appellant initially claimed he had stopped drinking the previous night.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Dr. Carol O\u2019Neal testified as an expert in the field of forensic toxicology. She explained alcohol consumption \u201cslow[s] down certain processes of the body both physical and mental.\u201d A blood alcohol concentration above .08% by weight by volume results in increased reaction time, decreased vision, decreased decision-making ability, and a general loss of coordination making it more difficult for a person to respond quickly to an emergency. Above .12% a person experiences tunnel vision and cannot see objects in the periphery. O\u2019Neal stated that at or above .20% a driver is \u201cfifty times more likely to be involved in an accident----\u201d Alcohol consumption impairs reaction time such that an impaired driver takes longer to recognize an emergency and to take evasive action. She also emphasized that \u201cas the concentration increases, the effects become more intense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">Following argument, the trial court concluded that third offense driving under the influence at appellant\u2019s level of impairment was an inherently dangerous activity, that malice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>was imputed to appellant\u2019s actions, and that the death occurred within the <em>res gestae </em>of the underlying felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">Appellant asserts the trial court erred \u201cby imputing malice to [his] action of drunk driving.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">Code \u00a7 18.2-33 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-9\">The killing of one accidentally, contrary to the intention of the parties, while in the prosecution of some felonious act other than those specified in \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-31 and 18.2-32, is murder of the second degree and is punishable by confinement in a state correctional facility for not less than five years nor more than forty years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">Thus, Code \u00a7 18.2-33 provides that an accidental killing accompanied by some felonious act, other than those specified in Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-31 and 18.2-32, will support a second-degree murder conviction. In such case, malice is imputed and raises an accidental homicide to the level of second-degree murder. <em>See Heacock v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 397, 403-04, 323 S.E.2d 90, 94 (1984). \u201cThe statute \u2018encompasses all felonious acts\u2019 not expressly excluded and is not limited to those felonies from which death is a foreseeable consequence.\u201d <em>Hylton v. Commonwealth, </em>60 Va.App. 50, 52-53, 723 S.E.2d 628, 629 (2012) (quoting <em>Heacock, </em>228 Va. at 404, 323 S.E.2d at 94).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-11\">While \u00a7 18.2-32 [first-degree felony murder] contemplates a \u201ckilling with malice\u201d, the malice intrinsic in the commission of one of the predicate felonies \u201cprovides the malice prerequisite to a finding that the homicide was murder.\u201d <em>Wooden v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 758, 762, 284 S.E.2d 811, 814 (1981). The same imputation of malice is implicit in \u00a7 18.2-33 which contemplates an accidental killing; the commission of <em>any </em>felonious act (other than those expressly excepted) during the prosecution <em>of </em>which a death occurs supplies the malice which raises the incidental homi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>tide to the level of second-degree murder. This statute codifies ancient common law. <em>See Whiteford v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va. (6 Rand.) 721 (1828).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-5\"><em>Heacock, </em>228 Va. at 403, 323 S.E.2d at 93.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-6\">\u201cThe [felony-murder] doctrine was developed to elevate to murder a homicide committed during the course of a felony by imputing malice to the killing. The justification for imputing malice was the theory that the increased risk of death or serious harm occasioned by the commission of a felony demonstrated the felon\u2019s lack of concern for human life.... The purpose of the doctrine was to deter inherently dangerous felonies by holding the felons responsible for the consequences of the felony, whether intended or not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AtK5\"><em>Barnes v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 619, 630-31, 535 S.E.2d 706, 712 (2000) (quoting <em>King v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 351, 354, 368 S.E.2d 704, 705-06 (1988) (citations omitted)). The holdings in <em>Heacock </em>and <em>Hylton </em>that Code \u00a7 18.2-33 \u201c \u2018encompasses all felonious acts\u2019 not expressly excluded,\u201d <em>Hylton, </em>60 Va.App. at 52, 723 S.E.2d at 629 (quoting <em>Heacock, </em>228 Va. at 404, 323 S.E.2d at 94), necessitate the conclusion that the statute included appellant\u2019s felonious driving while intoxicated. Furthermore, driving while intoxicated or recklessly is a felony considered to be \u201cinherently dangerous.\u201d <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 408, 413, 404 S.E.2d 377, 380 (1991). By implication, it presents a substantial risk to life. <em>See for example, Snow v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 766, 774-75, 537 S.E.2d 6, 10-11 (2000), noting reckless driving is dangerous and demonstrates a reckless disregard for human life in the context of Code \u00a7 18.2-371.1. \u201c \u2018[T]he increased risk of death or serious harm occasioned by the commission of \u201d appellant\u2019s felony of driving while intoxicated demonstrated appellant\u2019s \u201c \u2018lack of concern for human life\u2019 \u201d and constitutes the justification for imputing malice. <em>Spain v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 385, 393-94, 373 S.E.2d 728, 732-33 (1988) (quoting <em>King, </em>6 Va.App. at 354, 368 S.E.2d at 705-06).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">Appellant also challenges the finding of causation in this case, asserting the trial court erred \u201cby holding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>homicide was within the <em>res gestae </em>of the felonious undertaking.\u201d Specifically, he argues \u201c[t]he unintended death that occurred as a result of the accident was not in furtherance of either driving under the influence or driving with a suspended license,\u201d and, therefore, \u201cshould not be considered within the res <em>gestae </em>of the felonies.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The Virginia Supreme Court defined the term, <em>res gestae, </em>in the context of felony-murder prosecutions in <em>Heacock, </em>concluding that, when the predicate or underlying felony and the homicide \u201c \u2018were parts of one continuous transaction, and were closely related in point of time, place and causal connection,\u2019 \u201d a felony murder is established. <em>Heacock, </em>228 Va. at 405, 323 S.E.2d at 94-95 (quoting <em>Haskell v. Commonwealth, 218 </em>Va. 1033, 1041, 243 S.E.2d 477, 482 (1978)). <em>See also Griffin v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 413, 425, 533 S.E.2d 653, 659 (2000) (holding that \u201cCode \u00a7 18.2-33 applies where the initial felony and the accidental killing are parts of one continuous transaction and are closely related in point of time, place and causal connection\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When the homicide \u201cresulted from an act which was an integral part of the felony or an act in direct furtherance of or necessitated by the felony,\u201d felony murder is established. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">In this case, the elements of <em>res gestae, </em>were proved. The expert testimony made clear that the car accident which killed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>the victim occurred because appellant was highly intoxicated while he was driving. Appellant\u2019s vision, motor skills, and reaction time were all adversely affected by his intoxication, and nothing in the record suggests that the accident likely would have occurred had appellant not been under the influence of alcohol. <em>Cf. King, </em>6 Va.App. at 358, 368 S.E.2d at 708.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On the contrary, the evidence established that the underlying felony of driving while intoxicated caused the collision and resulted in an accidental death. <em>See Davis, </em>12 Va.App. at 413, 404 S.E.2d at 380 (in applying the <em>res gestae </em>theory, we affirmed the appellant\u2019s conviction because the habitual offender was committing, or \u201cfurthering,\u201d the underlying offense while attempting to escape detection when the accident occurred (citing <em>King, </em>6 Va.App. at 358, 368 S.E.2d at 708)).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">Appellant\u2019s intoxicated operation of his vehicle was, thus, inextricably linked and integral to the victim\u2019s death. <em>See Griffin, </em>33 Va.App. at 425, 533 S.E.2d at 659 (quoting 40 Am.Jur.2d <em>Homicide </em>\u00a7 70 (1999)). Accordingly, we find no error with the trial court\u2019s conclusions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">In his third assignment of error, appellant repeats the arguments he made to support his first two assignments of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>error, emphasizing that \u201c[t]he accident was not in furtherance of the underlying felonies nor was it the result of any malice on [his] part[.]\u201d He asserts he \u201cdid not crash his vehicle in an attempt to further either felony, nor was the car crash necessitated by the felony.\u201d \u201cThe resulting death,\u201d he argues, \u201cwas plain happenstance, and not in furtherance of the felony.\u201d As these arguments are fully addressed above, we need not separately address this assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">For the reasons stated, we affirm the trial court\u2019s decision and appellant\u2019s felony-murder conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b656-11\">. At oral argument before this Court, appellant expressly waived consideration of this issue on appeal. Accordingly, we do not address this assignment of error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b660-7\">. It appears from the record that the trial court relied only upon the driving under the influence felony offense as the underlying felony for the felony-murder conviction. Accordingly, we do not address whether the driving with a suspended license conviction can serve as the predicate felony under Code \u00a7 18.2-33.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b660-8\">. \"[T]he required elements of the rule, i.e., time, place, and causal connection, are stated in the conjunctive. Therefore, all three elements must be established for the felony-murder statute to apply.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Montague, </em>260 Va. 697, 702, 536 S.E.2d 910, 913 (2000). <em>See also, Woodard v. Commonwealth, </em>61 Va.App. 567, 739 S.E.2d 220, 2013 WL 1195573 (2013), (finding the underlying felony of the sale of ecstasy did not support a conviction for felony murder under Code \u00a7 18.2-33 because the killing occurred after the drug sale was completed and in a location different from that of the drug sale and was thus separated from the alleged felony murder by both time and place).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b661-7\">.

In <em>Essex </em>the defendant was convicted of three counts of second-degree murder stemming from an accident caused while he was driving while intoxicated.
