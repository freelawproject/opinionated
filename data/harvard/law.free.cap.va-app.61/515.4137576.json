Hartford now appeals that finding. Finding no error, we affirm the commission\u2019s decision for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">On all dates relevant to compensability, Michael Markulik (claimant) was employed as an electrician for S &amp; S Electric, Inc. (S <em>&amp; </em>S Electric). Until April 14, 2011, Central was S &amp; S Electric\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier. Thereafter, Hartford assumed workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage for S &amp; S Electric.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">A. Relevant Medical Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">On March 19, 2011, claimant suffered an electrical shock injury while he was installing a new transformer. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>experiencing numbness in his right arm for about ten or fifteen minutes, claimant felt a persistent burning sensation in his right arm. Claimant was referred to a neurologist, Dr. Patrick Capone, and claimant has been held out of work since May 7, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Dr. Capone initially treated claimant solely for right arm neuropraxia.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For purposes of this appeal, it is undisputed that claimant\u2019s right arm neuropraxia resulted from the March 19, 2011 electrical shock accident, that it is a compensable injury, and that Central is the insurer responsible for this injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">During the course of his treatment of claimant, Dr. Capone also came to believe that claimant suffered from carpal tunnel syndrome. On May 31, 2011, Dr. Capone indicated that claimant reported \u201cburning discomfort in his right upper arm with weakness and discomfort in his right hand where he drops things\u201d as well as \u201csimilar, although less severe discomfort in his left hand when he extends it forward.\u201d Dr. Capone assessed claimant\u2019s symptoms accordingly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\"><em>Right arm pain and numbness. This appears to be multifactorial. </em>The patient has objective evidence of a right radial sensory neuropathy in his right upper arm. This is most likely due to neurapraxia from the electrical injury which occurred in his upper arm. The patient has concomitant right carpal tunnel syndrome with some distal ulnar involvement according to the EMG study. This is less likely due to the electrical injury and more likely associated with his employment as an electrician. <em>His new left distal arm and hand complaint is also more likely carpal tunnel in etiology </em>although we have not confirmed that at present with an EMG and nerve conduction study.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">(Emphasis added). At that time, Dr. Capone mentioned the possibility of claimant undergoing a carpal tunnel decompres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>sion procedure. Following a July 13, 2011 appointment, when claimant reported that he \u201ccannot use either arm,\u201d Dr. Capone indicated that an EMG of claimant\u2019s left arm and a referral to a neurosurgeon were required.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">Dr. Shabih Hasan, a neurologist, conducted an independent medical examination of claimant on August 16, 2011. Dr. Hasan found \u201csymptoms indicative of neurapraxic nerve injury resulting in paresthesia and pain in the right arm,\u201d which were \u201cmost likely related to electrical shock trauma\u201d claimant received during the March 19, 2011 workplace accident. Dr. Hasan also found that claimant\u2019s \u201celectromyogram exam shows bilateral carpal tunnel of moderate severity,\u201d which presented itself \u201cmore on the right than left,\u201d and was \u201cmost likely related to underlying repetitive use of the wrist and hand and not related to the electrical shock injury.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">On September 7, 2011, Dr. Capone diagnosed claimant with <em>two </em>conditions\u2014(1) \u201cright arm neurapraxia secondary to electrical injury,\u201d <em>and </em>(2) \u201cbilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.\u201d Dr. Capone signed a disability slip indicating that claimant was still unable to work, although he did not indicate which specific condition was causing the continuing disability or how the two conditions precisely contributed to claimant\u2019s continuing disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">In responses to questionnaires from counsel dated October 26, 2011 and November 15, 2011, Dr. Capone ruled out all causes other than claimant\u2019s employment as an electrician for claimant\u2019s bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome and indicated that this condition was a direct result of his longstanding history of employment as an electrician. For purposes of this appeal, it is undisputed that claimant proved by clear and convincing evidence that his bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome is a com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>pensable ordinary disease of life under Code \u00a7 65.2-401<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that Hartford is the insurer responsible for this compensable condition under Code \u00a7 65.2-404.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">On November 22, 2011, Dr. Capone signed a disability slip indicating that claimant remained \u201coff work until further notice due to carpal tunnel syndrome and electrical shock injury.\u201d This disability slip is the first evidence in the commission record of Dr. Capone excusing claimant from work at least in part due to his carpal tunnel syndrome.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">B. Commission Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Following a hearing, the deputy commissioner found that claimant \u201chas proven total disability since May 7, 2011 and continuing,\u201d that \u201cthe disability was initially related solely to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>the right arm injury sustained on March 19, 2011,\u201d and that \u201cthe ongoing disability is <em>causally related to both </em>the right arm nerve injury and the compensable bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.\u201d (Emphasis added). The deputy commissioner held that Central was \u201cresponsible for payment of ongoing temporary total disability under the two causes rule.\u201d Central sought review of the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision from the full commission\u2014contending, <em>inter alia, </em>that the two causes rule was inapplicable to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">In its unanimous review opinion, the commission adopted the deputy commissioner\u2019s factual <em>findings</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em>\u2014but expressly disagreed </em>with the deputy commissioner\u2019s legal analysis. The commission found that the deputy commissioner\u2019s \u201canalysis under the two-causes rule is problematic since the right arm injuries and the carpal tunnel syndrome both are compensable.\u201d Instead, the commission found that Hartford was responsible for claimant\u2019s ongoing temporary total disability payments under Code \u00a7 65.2-506\u2014as well as under this Court\u2019s decision in <em>The Greif Companies v. Hensley, </em>22 Va.App. 546, 471 S.E.2d 803 (1996), and the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Eggleston, </em>264 Va. 13, 563 S.E.2d 685 (2002), both of which interpreted Code \u00a7 65.2-506.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The commission explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-7\">Based upon the findings in <em>Henlsey [Hensley </em>] and <em>Eggleston, </em>we hold that <em>if the employee\u2019s disability is related in part to the original work accident and in part to a second, subsequent compensable condition, ongoing compensation benefits may be assigned to the latter, second claim until disability therefrom </em>abates.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Since we have concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>[claimant\u2019s] disability is related in part to the original work accident and in part to the subsequent compensable ordinary disease of life then [claimant\u2019s] temporary total disability entitlement should be assigned to the second claim for his bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">(Emphasis added). Therefore, the commission held Hartford responsible for payment of claimant\u2019s temporary total disability benefits beginning on November 22, 2011 (the first date Dr. Capone signed a disability slip referencing bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome) and continuing.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">In its assignment of error on appeal, Hartford asserts that the commission \u201capplied the incorrect legal analysis to the facts of this case\u201d when it reversed the deputy commissioner\u2019s finding that Central (rather than Hartford) was responsible for payment of ongoing temporary total disability benefits to claimant. Hartford contends in its assignment of error that the commission \u201cincorrectly applied\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-506 and \u201cdisregarded the \u2018two causes rule.\u2019 \u201d Thus, Hartford raises an issue of law. In <em>Minor v. Aramark/VCU, </em>59 Va.App. 622, 721 S.E.2d 818 (2012), this Court stated, \u201cAlthough this Court generally gives deference to the commission\u2019s construction of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act on appeal, \u2018we are not bound by the commission\u2019s legal analysis in this or prior cases.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 628-29, 721 S.E.2d at 822 (quoting <em>Peacock v. Browning </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number><em>Ferris, Inc., </em>38 Va.App. 241, 248, 563 S.E.2d 368, 372 (2002)). Therefore, we review the commission\u2019s decision <em>de novo. Id. </em>at 623, 721 S.E.2d at 822.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">A. Code \u00a7 65.2-506</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Here, the commission found that Hartford was responsible for claimant\u2019s ongoing temporary total disability benefits payments under Code \u00a7 65.2-506, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-7\"><em>If an employee receives an injury for which compensation is payable while he is still receiving or entitled to compensation for a previous injury in the same employment, he shall not at the same time be entitled to compensation for both injuries, </em>but if he is, at the time of the second injury, receiving compensation under the provisions of \u00a7 65.2-503, payments of compensation thereunder shall be suspended during the period compensation is paid on account of the second injury, and after the termination of payments of compensation for the second injury, payments on account of the first injury shall be resumed and continued until the entire amount originally awarded has been paid. However, if, at the time of the second injury, he is receiving compensation under the provisions of \u00a7 65.2-502, then no compensation shall be payable on account of the first injury during the period he receives compensation for the second injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5m\">(Emphasis added). In <em>Eggleston, </em>264 Va. at 19, 563 S.E.2d at 688, the Supreme Court stated that Code \u00a7 65.2-506 contains a \u201cprohibition against paying benefits for more than one injury at a time.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Hartford challenges the commission\u2019s application of Code \u00a7 65.2-506 to the facts of this case. Hartford contends that this statute only applies when the second injury to a claimant occurs while the claimant is already receiving compensation for a permanent disability under Code \u00a7 65.2-503 or compensation for a partial disability under Code \u00a7 65.2-502. Hartford contends that neither of these conditions was met here. However, Hartford fails to show that the commission erred as a matter of law given its reliance on this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Hensley, </em>which applied Code \u00a7 65.2-506 to circumstances very similar to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">B. The <em>Hensley </em>Decision</p>\n<p id=\"AOj\">1. The Circumstances in <em>Hensley</em></p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\"><em>Hensley </em>also involved two separate compensable injuries for which two different workers\u2019 compensation insurance carriers were responsible.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The commission found that Hensley\u2019s compensable right wrist carpal tunnel syndrome was a recurrence of an earlier injury (for which the first insurer was responsible) and that her compensable left wrist carpal tunnel syndrome was a new compensable condition (for which the second insurer was responsible). Finding that Hensley had proven temporary total disability, but noting that the evidence did not establish which compensable condition predominantly caused Hensley\u2019s disability, the commission ordered both in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>surers to pay Hensley\u2019s temporary total disability benefits equally. 22 Va.App. at 550-51, 471 S.E.2d at 805-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">On appeal, this Court reversed the commission\u2019s decision to assign payments of disability benefits to both insurers. Relying on Code \u00a7 65.2-506, this Court held that the second insurer was responsible for paying Hensley\u2019s ongoing temporary total disability benefits. This Court deferred to the commission\u2019s finding that Hensley\u2019s temporary total disability was caused \u201cpartially to her right-hand condition and partially to the left,\u201d observing that the commission made no finding that either condition, standing alone, was totally disabling. <em>Id. </em>at 552-53, 471 S.E.2d at 806-07. This Court noted that \u201c[ejither CTS alone, causing only partial incapacity, might provide the basis for an award\u201d for partial disability benefits\u2014 but explained that the conditions in both wrists, in conjunction, caused Hensley\u2019s ongoing total disability. <em>Id. </em>at 553, 471 S.E.2d at 807. In finding the second insurer was responsible for paying the temporary total disability benefits, this Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-5\"><em>Code \u00a7 65.2-506 sets forth a statutory scheme requiring payment of compensation for multiple injuries in inverse order of occurrence, the injury last suffered being first compensated. </em>Ms. Hensley\u2019s disability in her right wrist derived from her 1992 CTS. Her left wrist disability related to a CTS that developed later and was first diagnosed in May, 1994. Because the left CTS contributes to Ms. Hensley\u2019s total incapacity, the left CTS may properly be considered the basis for a total incapacity award pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-500. <em>By operation of Code \u00a7 65.2-506, compensation for the later injury must be paid first. </em>When that compensation is exhausted, or when the left wrist condition ceases to impose incapacity, compensation for the right wrist condition will resume, if justified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-6\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">This Court in <em>Hensley </em>recognized that Hensley was not receiving partial disability benefits under Code \u00a7 65.2-502 at the time of her second injury, and, thus, this Court acknowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>edged that \u201cthis case does not fit precisely into the language of \u00a7 65.2-506.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 554, 471 S.E.2d at 807. However, this Court explained, \u201cCode \u00a7 65.2-506 expresses the legislative approach to multiple contributing injuries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This Court held that the \u201csame approach\u201d was \u201cappropriate to this case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">2. Commission\u2019s Application of <em>Hensley </em>to this Case</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">In this case, given the factual findings that the commission made\u2014-which are not challenged on appeal<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>\u2014the commission reasonably determined that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hensley </em>was instructive and very persuasive authority that guided the analysis here. The commission here expressly found that claimant \u201cwas disabled <em>in part </em>from his compensable work injuries from the March 19, 2011 work accident\u201d\u2014i.e., claimant\u2019s right arm neuropraxia\u2014\u201cand <em>in part </em>from his compensable ordinary disease of life\u201d\u2014i.e., claimant\u2019s bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. (Emphasis added). These findings are very similar to the commission\u2019s findings in <em>Hensley </em>that Hensley\u2019s temporary total disability was attributable \u201cpartially to her right-hand condition and partially to the left\u201d hand condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">It is undisputed, as Hartford contends, that claimant\u2019s right arm neuropraxia initially was the sole cause of claimant\u2019s temporary total disability following the March 19, 2011 electrical shock accident. However, claimant\u2019s bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome clearly emerged as <em>another </em>cause of claimant\u2019s temporary total disability once its diagnosis was confirmed. Both conditions \u201cindependently are compensable,\u201d as the commission noted. The medical evidence simply conflicted as to precisely <em>how much </em>each of these compensable conditions continued to contribute to claimant\u2019s temporary total disability\u2014especially as many months transpired after the March 19, 2011 electrical shock accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>While Dr. Hasan opined that \u201cusually neurapraxic injuries improve in a few months and would be unusual to last more than six months,\u201d Dr. Capone signed disability slips excusing claimant from work on December 7, 2011 and January 17, 2012 that referenced only claimant\u2019s right arm neuropraxia. However, Dr. Capone was also very clear in the notes from claimant\u2019s December 7, 2011 appointment that claimant was \u201cawaiting carpal tunnel decompression <em>so that this gentleman can return to some type of employment.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Claimant was still awaiting the carpal tunnel decompression procedure when the evidence closed in the commission proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">On appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to Central, as it was \u201cthe prevailing party before the commission.\u201d <em>Dunnavant v. Newman Tire Co., </em>51 Va.App. 252, 255, 656 S.E.2d 431, 433 (2008). Under this settled standard of review, Central\u2014not Hartford\u2014benefits from all reasonable inferences from the evidence. Both the right arm neuropraxia and the bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome <em>might, </em>in isolation, remain sufficiently debilitating to cause claimant\u2019s ongoing temporary total disability standing alone\u2014but the commission never made this express finding. Rather, the commission simply explained that both conditions \u201cindependently are compensable.\u201d Furthermore, sorting through the conflicting medical evidence, as it was entitled to do, the commission concluded generally\u2014and without much further elaboration\u2014that claimant\u2019s temporary total disability was \u201cattributable to both compensable conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The commission is generally accorded some deference in its construction of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, although its legal analysis certainly is not binding on Virginia\u2019s appellate courts. <em>See Minor, </em>59 Va.App. at 628-29, 721 S.E.2d at 822. Given the commission\u2019s conclusion that claimant\u2019s ongoing temporary total disability was caused \u201cin part\u201d by his right arm neuropraxia and \u201cin part\u201d by his bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, the commission reasonably determined that the circumstances in this case were sufficiently analogous to those in <em>Hensley </em>in order to render that decision persuasive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>on the commission\u2019s analysis of the present ease. The commission then followed this Court\u2019s directive from <em>Hensley </em>that, \u201c[b]y operation of Code \u00a7 65.2-506, compensation for the later injury must be paid first.\u201d 22 Va.App. at 553, 471 S.E.2d at 807. Adhering to that language from this Court, the commission ordered Hartford, the insurer responsible for claimant\u2019s latter compensable condition (bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome), to pay claimant\u2019s temporary total disability benefits until that condition no longer contributes to claimant\u2019s disability.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that the commission\u2019s decision was erroneous\u2014especially in the absence of any authority even suggesting that the opposite result is correct as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">C. Two Causes Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Hartford contends that the commission should have adopted the deputy commissioner\u2019s application of the two causes rule and found that Central was responsible for claimant\u2019s ongoing temporary total disability benefits. However, we agree with the commission that the two causes rule is inapplicable to the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">The two causes rule applies in determining whether there is proof of a compensable injury. <em>See, e.g., Haftsavar v. All Am. Carpet &amp; Rugs, Inc., </em>59 Va.App. 593, 600, 721 S.E.2d 804, 808 (2012). The two causes rule \u201c \u2018refers to the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>where a disability has two causes: one related to the employment and one unrelated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith v. Fieldcrest Mills, Inc., </em>224 Va. 24, 28, 294 S.E.2d 805, 808 (1982) (quoting <em>Bergmann v. L &amp; W Drywall, </em>222 Va. 30, 32, 278 S.E.2d 801, 803 (1981)). Under the two causes rule, \u201c \u2018a condition which has two causes, one related to a work injury, and one not, is compensable and the treatment of that condition will be the responsibility of the employer.\u2019 \u201d <em>Haftsavar, </em>59 Va.App. at 600, 721 S.E.2d at 808 (quoting <em>Papco Oil v. Farr, </em>26 Va.App. 66, 75, 492 S.E.2d 858, 862 (1997)); <em>see also Augusta County Sheriff\u2019s Dep\u2019t v. Overbey, </em>254 Va. 522, 527, 492 S.E.2d 631, 634 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">Here, claimant proved two compensable conditions\u2014both related to his employment for S &amp; S Electric. Therefore, the two causes rule simply is inapplicable to the issue presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The commission did not err when it ordered Hartford, the insurer responsible for claimant\u2019s most recent compensable condition, to pay for claimant\u2019s ongoing temporary total disability benefits. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we affirm the commission\u2019s decision in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b561-12\">. During the pendency of this appeal, claimant's counsel filed a request for expedited review by this Court. In this request, claimant\u2019s counsel represents that claimant \"has lost his home as a result of not receiving any income for more than a year\u201d and \"is currently homeless.\" We have expedited our review in light of claimant's circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b562-8\">. Some documents in the commission record also refer to this condition as neurapraxia.

For an ordinary disease of life to be compensable under Code \u00a7 65.2-401, a claimant must prove several elements by \"clear and convincing evidence,\u201d i.e., \"not a mere probability....\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-401. Claimant\u2019s proof of those elements by clear and convincing evidence is not an issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b564-9\">. Code \u00a7 65.2-404(A) states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-10\">When an employee has an occupational disease that is covered by this title, the employer in whose employment he was last injuriously exposed to the hazards of the disease and the employer\u2019s insurance carrier, if any, at the time of the exposure, shall alone be liable therefor, without right to contribution from any prior employer or insurance carrier.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-11\">Hartford's liability under this statute for claimant\u2019s bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome is not an issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b564-12\">. On December 7, 2011, Dr. Capone indicated that claimant\u2019s right arm neuropraxia was \u201cstable\u201d and that claimant was still \"awaiting carpal tunnel decompression so <em>that this gentleman can return to some type of employment.\" </em>(Emphasis added). However, Dr. Capone\u2019s disability slip from that date referenced only the March 19, 2011 electrical shock accident. On January 17, 2012, Dr. Capone signed a disability slip indicating that claimant was \"[o]ff work until further notice due to electrical shock injury.\u201d This disability slip did not mention claimant's bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome\u2014even though, according to the record on appeal, claimant had not yet undergone carpal tunnel decompression surgery by the close of the evidence in the commission proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b565-8\">. Among its factual determinations, the commission concluded that the deputy commissioner \"properly found [claimant] was disabled in part from his compensable work injuries from the March 19, 2011 work accident and in part from his compensable ordinary disease of life.\u201d The commission also agreed with the deputy commissioner that claimant\u2019s \"disability is attributable to both compensable conditions.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b565-9\">. In this case, there is no dispute that claimant's bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome (for which Hartford is liable) is a more recent compensable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>injury or condition than his right arm neuropraxia. The commission expressly found that the diagnosis of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome was first communicated to claimant for purposes of Code \u00a7 65.2-403 on September 7, 2011 (nearly six months after the electrical shock accident that caused claimant\u2019s right arm neuropraxia) and that claimant\u2019s bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome was, therefore, claimant\u2019s \"subsequent\u201d compensable injury or condition. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-403(A) (explaining that \"first communication of the diagnosis of an occupational disease to the employee or death of the employee resulting from an occupational disease as herein listed and defined shall be treated as the happening of an injury by accident\u201d). Furthermore, Hartford expressly acknowledges on brief that Central is the insurer responsible for claimant's first compensable injury or condition and that Hartford is the insurer responsible for claimant\u2019s second compensable injury or condition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b567-8\">. Given the Supreme Court's statement that Code \u00a7 65.2-506 \"provides that a claimant may not receive compensation for more than one injury at a time,\u201d <em>Eggleston, </em>264 Va. at 19, 563 S.E.2d at 688, the commission correctly determined that it was required to find <em>which </em>insurer\u2014 Central <em>or </em>Hartford\u2014was responsible for payment of claimant\u2019s ongoing temporary total disability benefits. <em>See also Hensley, </em>22 Va.App. at 554, 471 S.E.2d at 807 (holding that the commission erred in assessing liability for Hensley\u2019s compensation for two separate compensable injuries equally between two different insurers). Although claimant's temporary total disability related <em>both </em>to his right arm neuropraxia <em>and </em>his bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, the commission simply could not, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>under authority from the Supreme Court and from this Court that is binding on the commission, assign claimant\u2019s temporary total disability benefits partly to Central and partly to Hartford.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b568-8\">. Hensley was initially diagnosed with right wrist carpal tunnel syndrome, which the first insurer accepted as compensable. The first insurer agreed to pay Hensley a period of temporary total disability benefits for the right wrist condition. When Hensley returned to work (under a five percent permanent partial disability award), she was diagnosed with recurrent right wrist carpal tunnel syndrome, and the first insurer agreed to reinstate Hensley's temporary total disability award (thereby removing the permanent partial disability award). Hensley then reported left wrist pain, and nerve conduction studies revealed bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. By this time, the second insurance carrier had assumed the employer's workers\u2019 compensation coverage. <em>Hensley, 22 </em>Va.App. at 548-50, 471 S.E.2d at 804-05.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b570-7\">. Hartford's assignment of error on appeal does not challenge any of the commission's actual factual findings. Instead, Hartford\u2019s assignment of error challenges only the commission's selection of a legal standard to apply to the facts of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b572-8\">. A majority of states appear to have adopted the \"last injurious exposure rule\u201d for cases that involve two separate compensable injuries or conditions. <em>See </em>9 Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, <em>Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 153.02[1]. This rule \"places full liability upon the carrier covering the risk at the time of the most recent injury that bears a causal relationship to the disability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under this rule, \"[wjhen an employee sustains a subsequent industrial injury that is found to be a \u2018new\u2019 injury, the insurer at risk at the time of the second injury is liable for all of claimant\u2019s benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 153.02[2]; <em>see also General Acc. Fire &amp; Life Assurance Corp. v. Waldon, </em>121 Ind.App. 1, 3-4, 94 N.E.2d 487, 489 (1950) (holding that the first insurer remained responsible for payment of Waldon's disability benefits because Waldon\u2019s second injury was not a new injury, but was instead a recurrence of the first injury). Virginia, however, has not adopted the \"last injurious exposure rule\u201d <em>as a matter of law </em>when the situation involves two separate compensable injuries or conditions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
