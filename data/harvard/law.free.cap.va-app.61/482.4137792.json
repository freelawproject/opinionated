(\u201cMuller Martini Manufacturing\u201d) and Wausau Business Insurance Company (\u201cWausau\u201d) (collectively, \u201cappellees\u201d). On appeal, OSC contends that the commission erred in \u201cadopting the findings of fact and conclusions of law contained in the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s opinion holding that\u201d (1) \u201cDr. Coleman received Aetna\u2019s AWCA<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Invitation Letter,\u201d (2) \u201ceven assuming Dr. Coleman received it, Aetna\u2019s AWCA Invitation Letter was sufficient to enroll Dr. Coleman in AWCA,\u201d (3) \u201cDr. Coleman had accepted, acquiesced in, or waived any right to object to, his inclusion in the Aetna Workers\u2019 Comp Access plan,\u201d and (4) \u2018Wausau was entitled to apply reductions to the charges submitted by Dr. Coleman based upon his purported participation in the AWCA plan and program.\u201d For the reasons that follow, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Garry Messer (\u201cMesser\u201d), an employee for Muller Martini Manufacturing, suffered a compensable injury while working on February 2, 2007. On February 22, 2008, the commission awarded him weekly compensation in addition to lifetime medical benefits related to the injury. Messer received treatment from Dr. Martin R. Coleman (\u201cDr. Coleman\u201d) at OSC for his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Prior to Messer\u2019s contact with OSC, Dr. Coleman had entered into a Specialist Physician Agreement (the \u201cSPA\u201d) with Aetna Health, Inc. (\u201cAetna\u201d) on September 29, 2003. Under the terms of the SPA, Dr. Coleman agreed to become a participating provider, which required him to provide certain health care services to individuals covered by Aetna plans in exchange for reimbursement from Aetna. Under the terms of the SPA, Aetna reserved \u201cthe right to introduce and designate [Dr. Colemanj\u2019s participation in new Plans, Specialty Programs and products during the term of [the SPA]\u201d as long as Aetna provided Dr. Coleman with \u201cwritten notice of such new Plans, Specialty Programs and products and the associated compensation.\u201d The contract then mandates that \u201c[f]or those programs and products which are not health benefit products (e.g. worker\u2019s compensation or auto insurance), [Dr. Coleman] shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of the aforementioned notice from [Aetna] to notify [Aetna] in writing if [Dr. Coleman] elects not to participate in such product(s).\u201d The agreement goes on to require that Dr. Coleman \u201cshall accept compensation in accordance with [the SPA] for the provision of any Covered Services to Members under a Plan, Specialty Program or product in which [Dr. Coleman] has agreed to participate hereunder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">In a different section of the SPA, the agreement sets forth what constitutes adequate notice. Specifically, it states that \u201c[u]nless otherwise specified herein, any notice required to be given pursuant to the terms and provisions hereof shall be effective only if given in writing and sent by overnight delivery service with proof of receipt, or by certified mail return <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>receipt requested.\u201d The SPA also includes several miscellaneous terms relevant to this appeal, including provisions governing amendments to the agreement<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and waivers of any breaches or violations of the agreement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">According to Jacqueline Dupuis (\u201cDupuis\u201d),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a Senior Project Manager with AWCA, AWCA sent Dr. Coleman a letter (\u201cinvitation letter\u201d) in December 2005 \u201cdesignating him as a Participating Provider in AWCA with an option to opt out if he chose not to participate\u201d pursuant to the SPA. Dupuis did not indicate whether AWCA sent the invitation letter using overnight delivery service with proof of receipt or by certified mail return receipt requested as required under the SPA. AWCA did not receive an opt-out notice from Dr. Coleman in response to the invitation letter, and thus, according to Dupuis, he became a Participating Provider in the AWCA network effective April 1, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Dr. Coleman rendered services on March 14, 2007 and May 24, 2007 in relation to Messer\u2019s injury. OSC then sought reimbursement for the services from Muller Martini Manufacturing\u2019s insurance carrier, Wausau, in the amount of $13,131. Wausau, however, only reimbursed OSC a total of $1,288 by way of an April 10, 2007 check for $548 and a July 16, 2007 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>check for $740. Both checks\u2019 stubs contain an explanation of benefits which state that the paid amount was \u201creviewed in accordance with your contract with Aetna Worker\u2019s [sic] Comp Access, LLC.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">On September 21, 2011, OSC filed a claim with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission seeking payment for the remainder of Messer\u2019s medical bills. In a February 17, 2012 opinion, the deputy commissioner denied OSC\u2019s claim. The deputy commissioner relied on the mailing presumption to conclude that OSC \u201creceived the notice within a reasonable time after December 2005, and that the Aetna agreement was modified to include the AWCA plan whether or not the notice was sent by overnight delivery or certified mail.\u201d The deputy commissioner recognized that the \u201cagreement provides that any notices must be sent by overnight delivery or by certified mail\u201d and that \u201cthe employer has presented no evidence that it complied with these provisions.\u201d However, he went on to conclude that it was of no consequence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-5\">In the present matter, whether or not the non-conforming notice would be effective by itself is of little moment. In the present matter, we have ample evidence of acceptance, acquiescence, and/or waiver. Specifically, the explanation of benefits furnished by [Wausau] when it made its initial payment to the medical provider specifically states that, \u201cthis bill was reviewed in accordance with your Aetna Workers\u2019 Comp Access, LLC.\u201d [OSC] accepted this payment, and failed to file the present claim until more than four years thereafter. Under these circumstances, we find that the medical provider\u2019s silence and acceptance of payment is sufficient to evidence its acceptance of the proposal to modify the contract to include workers\u2019 compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHq\">OSC subsequently requested review from the full commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">In a July 26, 2012 opinion, the full commission affirmed the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision. In its opinion, the full commission found that \u201cevidence in the case, specifically the Affidavit of Ms. Dupuis, sufficiently established that the letter was sent to Dr. Coleman. We further note, as did the Deputy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>Commissioner, that Dr. Coleman never denied receiving the letter, and that, in fact, Dr. Coleman failed to introduce any evidence on the issue.\u201d The commission went on to \u201cadopt the findings of fact and rulings of law contained\u201d in the deputy commissioner\u2019s February 17, 2012 opinion. Following the full commission\u2019s decision, OSC noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">We start our analysis by addressing OSC\u2019s second and third assignments of error together.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That is, we begin by determining whether the invitation letter was sufficient to enroll Dr. Coleman in AWCA, and if not, whether Dr. Coleman waived his right to object to his inclusion in the AWCA plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">\u201cThe interpretation of a contract presents a question of law subject to de novo review.\u201d <em>PBM Nutritionals, LLC v. Lexington Ins. Co., </em>283 Va. 624, 633, 724 S.E.2d 707, 712-13 (2012). \u201c \u2018[0]n appeal [this Court is not] bound by the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the contract provision at issue; rather, [this Court has] an equal opportunity to consider the words of the contract within the four corners of the instrument itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(alterations in original) (quoting <em>Eure v. Norfolk Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Corp., </em>263 Va. 624, 631, 561 S.E.2d 663, 667 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">Basic contract interpretation principles dictate that \u201c \u2018[w]hen the terms in a contract are clear and unambiguous, the contract is construed according to its plain meaning.\u2019\u201d <em>Envtl. Staffing Acquisition Corp. v. B &amp; R Constr. Mgmt., </em>283 Va. 787, 793, 725 S.E.2d 550, 554 (2012) (quoting <em>PMA Capital </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number><em>Ins. Co. v. U.S. Airways, Inc., </em>271 Va. 352, 358, 626 S.E.2d 369, 372-73 (2006)). Likewise, the \u201c \u2018[w]ords that the parties used are normally given their usual, ordinary, and popular meaning,\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018[n]o word or clause in the contract will be treated as meaningless if a reasonable meaning can be given to it, and there is a presumption that the parties have not used words needlessly.\u2019 \u201d <em>Preferred Sys. Solutions, Inc. v. GP Consulting, LLC, </em>284 Va. 382, 392, 732 S.E.2d 676, 681 (2012) (quoting <em>D.C. McClain, Inc. v. Arlington Cnty., </em>249 Va. 131, 135, 452 S.E.2d 659, 662 (1995); <em>D.C. McClain, </em>249 Va. at 135-36, 452 S.E.2d at 662).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">Under the SPA, Aetna reserved \u201cthe right to introduce and designate [Dr. Colemanj\u2019s participation in new Plans, Specialty Programs and products during the term of\u2019 the SPA, so long as Aetna provided Dr. Coleman \u201cwith written notice of such new Plans, Specialty Programs and products and the associated compensation.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, it is clear that, given proper notice, Aetna had the power to enroll Dr. Coleman in the AWCA plan. However, proper notice of enrollment was not given in this case. Under the terms of the SPA, Aetna was specifically required to provide notice in writing and sent by overnight delivery service with proof of receipt or by certified mail return receipt requested. The appellees failed to present any evidence whatsoever that the invitation letter was sent using either of these methods. Thus, it is clear that the notice provision was not satisfied, and Dr. Coleman never became a participating member in the AWCA plan under the plain terms of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">However, this does not end our analysis, because the commission found that there was \u201cample evidence of acceptance, acquiescence, and/or waiver.\u201d Furthermore, the commission found \u201cthat the medical provider\u2019s silence and acceptance of payment is sufficient to evidence its acceptance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>proposal to modify the contract to include workers\u2019 compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">At the trial or adjudicatory hearing level, the \u201c \u2018burden rests on the party relying on a waiver ... to prove the essentials of such waiver ... by clear, precise and unequivocal evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stanley\u2019s Cafeteria, Inc. v. Abramson, </em>226 Va. 68, 74, 306 S.E.2d 870, 873 (1983) (quoting <em>Utica Mutual v. National Indemnity, </em>210 Va. 769, 773, 173 S.E.2d 855, 858 (1970)). \u201c[P]roof of waiver is a question for the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Management Enterprises, Inc. v. Thorncroft Co., </em>243 Va. 469, 474, 416 S.E.2d 229, 232 (1992). We are bound by the factual findings of the commission,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-5\">[h]owever, such findings of fact are \u201cconclusive and binding\u201d only to the extent that they are \u201cpredicated upon evidence introduced or appearing in the proceedings.\u201d In other words, \u201c[i]f ... there is no credible evidence on which the Commission\u2019s findings of fact are based, its findings [of fact] are not binding and the question presented becomes one of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-6\"><em>Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund v. Gabriel, </em>272 Va. 659, 664, 636 S.E.2d 408, 411 (2006) (second and third alterations in original)(quoting <em>Vanzant v. Southern Bending Co., </em>143 Va. 244, 246, 129 S.E. 268, 268 (1925); <em>Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. v. Robertson, </em>218 Va. 1051, 1053, 243 S.E.2d 234, 235 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">\u201c[W]aiver is an intentional relinquishment of a known right. \u2018In waiver, both knowledge of the facts basic to the exercise of the right and the intent to relinquish that right are essential elements.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stanley\u2019s Cafeteria, </em>226 Va. at 74, 306 S.E.2d at 873 (quoting <em>Employers Ins. Co. v. Great American, </em>214 Va. 410, 412-13, 200 S.E.2d 560, 562 (1973)). In this case, we need not even determine whether Dr. Coleman intentionally relinquished his right to proper notice. The SPA specifically states \u201call waivers must be in writing and signed by an authorized officer of the Party to be charged.\u201d Appellees never introduced any writing purporting to be a waiver at the hearing before the commission. Instead, appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>lees introduced two check stubs stating that the payment was \u201creviewed in accordance with [Dr. Coleman\u2019s] contract with Aetna Worker\u2019s [sic] Comp Access, LLC.\u201d This is clearly not sufficient to constitute a waiver under the SPA as it is not signed by an authorized officer of OSC. The fact that OSC accepted the two checks from Wausau is of no consequence, as the terms of the contract were not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">Furthermore, there is insufficient evidence to support the commission\u2019s finding that the SPA was modified with Dr. Coleman\u2019s concurrence. \u201c \u2018A contract in writing, but not required to be so by the statute of frauds, may be dissolved or varied by a new oral contract, which may or may not adopt as part of its terms some or all of the provisions of the original written contract....\u2019\u201d <em>Reid v. Boyle, </em>259 Va. 356, 369-70, 527 S.E.2d 137, 144-45 (2000) (quoting <em>Zurich General Accident &amp; Liability Ins. Co. v. Baum, </em>159 Va. 404, 409, 165 S.E. 518, 519 (1932)). However, as with waiver, a \u201cmodification of a contract must be shown by \u2018clear, unequivocal and convincing evidence, direct or implied.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 370, 527 S.E.2d at 145 (quoting <em>Stanley\u2019s Cafeteria, </em>226 Va. at 73, 306 S.E.2d at 873). \u201cIn certain circumstances written contracts, even those that contain prohibitions against unwritten modifications, may be modified by parol agreement.\u201d <em>Lindsay v. McEnearney Assocs., </em>260 Va. 48, 53, 531 S.E.2d 573, 576 (2000), <em>see also Reid, </em>259 Va. at 369-70, 527 S.E.2d at 144-45 (\u201c \u2018Nor does it make any difference that the original written contract provided that it should not be substantially varied except by writing. This stipulation itself may be rescinded by parol and any oral variation of the writing which may be agreed upon and which is supported by a sufficient consideration is by necessary implication a rescission to that extent.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Zurich, </em>159 Va. at 409, 165 S.E. at 519)).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The SPA contains an amendment provision which states that it \u201cconstitutes the entire understanding of the Parties hereto and no changes, amendments or alterations shall be effective unless signed by both Parties, except as expressly provided herein.\u201d While Virginia law dictates that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>such a provision does not prohibit an unwritten modification of the contract, there is not \u201cclear, unequivocal and convincing evidence, direct or implied\u201d in the record to show that there was such a modification in this case. The commission relied solely upon OSC\u2019s silence and acceptance of Wausau\u2019s checks to find the modification. \u201c[Standing alone, an obligee\u2019s acceptance of less than full performance by the obligor does not prove intent to relinquish the right to enforce full performance.\u201d <em>Stanley\u2019s Cafeteria, </em>226 Va. at 74, 306 S.E.2d at 873 (citing <em>Employers Ins.
