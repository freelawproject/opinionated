For the reasons that follow, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Appellant owns and operates She-Sha Caf\u00e9 and Hookah Lounge (\u201cShe-Sha\u201d) in Blacksburg, Virginia. She-Sha has been in operation since 2003 and sells flavored tobacco products for its customers to use on the premises by smoking the tobacco through a hookah.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Customers may purchase the tobacco for off-premises use as well. In addition to the hookah-related transactions, She-Sha offers customers a menu of food and beverage items. The Town of Blacksburg issued She-Sha a business license based on a December 2, 2009 application listing the business as a \u201crestaurant and retail tobacco store.\u201d She-Sha holds a valid permit from the Virginia Department of Health (\u201cthe Department\u201d) as a full service restaurant. She-Sha is also licensed by the Commonwealth of Virginia Department of Taxation as an \u201cOther Tobacco Products Retailer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">On January 22, 2010, the Department received a complaint claiming that She-Sha was allowing patrons to smoke within its establishment in violation of the Virginia Indoor Clean Air Act (\u201cVICAA\u201d). On January 27, 2010, in a Food Establishment Evaluation Report (\u201cthe report\u201d), She-Sha was cited by the Department for two noncritical violations of the VICAA: an individual was smoking in the building and the facility failed to post \u201cno smoking\u201d signs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">To contest the violations, appellant requested an informal fact finding hearing, which was held on March 22, 2010. By <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>letter dated July 8, 2010, the Department upheld its determination that She-Sha was \u201cproperly labeled as a restaurant and that ... none of [the exceptions to VICAA] apply to SheSha.\u201d The letter noted that a restaurant under VICAA is \u201cany place where food is served,\u201d and the term \u201cshall include any bar or lounge area that is part of such restaurant.\u201d It also noted that the smoking ban applies to hookah use, as it involves \u201cthe carrying or holding of any lighted pipe ... or any other lighted smoking equipment, or the lighting, inhaling, or exhaling of smoke [from] a pipe.... \u201d In conclusion, the Department found that She-Sha was a restaurant because it served food, and even if the hookah lounge was considered a bar or lounge area, the VICAA expressly subjected such areas to its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Appellant then requested a formal adjudicatory hearing. Appellant also renewed its request for a summary case decision by the Department pursuant to Code \u00a7 2.2-4020.1.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In its request, appellant stipulated that She-Sha was a restaurant as defined in the VICAA. By letter dated October 12, 2010, the State Health Commissioner informed appellant that a summary case decision was inappropriate at that time, but the Department would consolidate the summary case decision proceeding with the formal hearing appellant had requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">The formal hearing was conducted on March 15, 2011. On May 19, 2011, the hearing officer recommended nine findings of fact and conclusions of law. The Department issued its case decision on June 17, 2011, in which the Health Commissioner adopted the hearing officer\u2019s recommendations. The case decision upheld the violations noted in the report and stated that She-Sha is a restaurant subject to the regulations of the VICAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Appellant petitioned the Circuit Court of Montgomery County on August 12, 2011 for an appeal of the Department\u2019s final decision in accordance with Code \u00a7\u00a7 2.2-4026 and 2.2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>4027. Upon consideration of the pleadings and argument of the parties, the circuit court found that the Department made no error of law and dismissed the appeal with prejudice. The court opined that it believed She-Sha should be exempt from the VICAA, but that the statute as written does not allow for its exemption. Appellant now challenges the circuit court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">I. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">The issue on appeal is whether She-Sha is exempt from complying with the restaurant smoking ban contained in the VICAA. Appellant argues that the circuit court erred in upholding the Department\u2019s case decision because She-Sha is a retail tobacco store and the applicability provisions of the VICAA exempt retail tobacco stores from regulation by the other provisions within the Act. The Department maintains that even if She-Sha is a retail tobacco store, it is also a restaurant and the VICAA prohibits smoking in restaurants. The Department also contends that the VICAA provides express exemptions to the restaurant smoking ban, none of which apply to She-Sha.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">The Virginia Administrative Process Act (\u201cVAPA\u201d) authorizes judicial review of agency decisions. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 2.2-4027. Under settled principles, the burden is upon the party appealing such a decision to demonstrate error. <em>Avante at Roanoke v.

Generally, however, \u201c[a]n agency\u2019s legal interpretations of statutes is accorded no deference because we have long held that pure statutory interpretation is the prerogative of the judiciary, and thus, Virginia courts do not delegate that task to executive agencies.\u201d <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

The main provision at issue in this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>involves the restaurant smoking ban contained in Code \u00a7 15.2-2825. Code \u00a7 15.2-2825(A) states that \u201csmoking shall be prohibited and no person shall smoke in any restaurant in the Commonwealth.... \u201d The inspection and regulation of restaurants is within the general purview of the Department, and pursuant to Code \u00a7 15.2-2825(1), \u201c[a]ny local health department shall, while inspecting a restaurant as otherwise required by law, inspect for compliance with [Code \u00a7 15.2-2825].\u201d \u201cRestaurant\u201d is defined by Code \u00a7 15.2-2820 as \u201cany place where food is prepared for service to the public on or off the premises, or any place where food is served.... \u2018Restaurant\u2019 shall include any bar or lounge area that is part of such restaurant.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It was both acknowledged by appellant and determined by the Department that She-Sha is a place where food is served; therefore, She-Sha plainly fits the statute\u2019s definition of \u201crestaurant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">As a restaurant, She-Sha must comply with the restaurant smoking ban, unless it falls within one of the six expressly stated exemptions to this section of the VICAA set forth in Code \u00a7 15.2-2825(A)(l)-(6):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-5\">1. Any place or operation that prepares or stores food for distribution to persons of the same business operation or of a related business operation for service to the public. Examples of such places or operations include the preparation or storage of food for catering services, pushcart operations, hotdog stands, and other mobile points of service;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-6\">2.

Any portion of a restaurant that is used exclusively for private functions, provided such functions are limited to those portions of the restaurant that meet the requirements of subdivision 5;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-5\">5. Any portion of a restaurant that is constructed in such a manner that the area where smoking may be permitted is (i) structurally separated from the portion of the restaurant in which smoking is prohibited and to which ingress and egress is through a door and (ii) separately vented to prevent the recirculation of air from such area to the area of the restaurant where smoking is prohibited. At least one public entrance to the restaurant shall be into an area of the restaurant where smoking is prohibited. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, nothing shall be construed to require the creation of an additional public entrance in cases where the only public entrance to a restaurant in existence as of December 1, 2009, is through an outdoor area described in subdivision 2; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-6\">6. Any private club.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">Appellee argues for application of the maxim <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius, </em>meaning \u201cthe expression of one thing is the exclusion of another.\u201d This maxim is a fundamental principle of statutory construction which gives rise to the implication that \u201c \u2018omitted terms were not intended to be included within the scope of the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>See, e.g. Conkling v. Commonwealth, </em>45 Va.App. 518, 522, 612 S.E.2d 235, 237 (2005) (quoting <em>Commonwealth v. Brown, </em>259 Va. 697, 704-05, 529 S.E.2d 96, 100 (2000)). Applying this principle to the statute at hand, the legislature included certain express exemptions to the restaurant smoking ban, implying that any restaurant that fails to meet the criteria for at least one of the stated exemptions is not exempt from compliance with the smoking ban.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>She-Sha does not fit within any of the six stated exemptions. She-Sha does not prepare or store food for distribution as a catering service or other mobile point of service. It does not operate an outdoor, non-enclosed area of its restaurant. She-Sha is not a private club, nor is it used exclusively for private functions. There is no portion of She-Sha that is structurally separate and separately vented from smoking areas. And most pertinently, She-Sha is not a restaurant located on the premises of a manufacturer of tobacco products. Tobacco manufacturing facilities are referenced elsewhere in the VICAA in conjunction with retail tobacco stores and tobacco warehouses. Retail tobacco stores and tobacco warehouses, however, are missing from the exemption language in Code \u00a7 15.2-2825(A)(3). The legislature\u2019s express inclusion of tobacco manufacturers and exclusion of retail tobacco stores and tobacco warehouses is evidence of the intent that the latter be subject to compliance with the restaurant smoking ban.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">Appellant argues that Code \u00a7 15.2-2821, governing applicability of the VICAA, takes precedence over the restaurant smoking ban contained in the subsequent provisions of the chapter and exempts She-Sha from compliance. Code \u00a7 15.2-2821 provides: \u201cNothing in this chapter shall be construed to: 1. Permit smoking where it is otherwise prohibited or restricted by other applicable provisions of law; <em>or </em>2. Regulate smoking in retail tobacco stores, tobacco warehouses, or tobacco manufacturing facilities.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Emphasis added). Appellant asserts that She-Sha is a retail tobacco store and heavily emphasizes the language \u201c[njothing in this chapter shall be construed to regulate smoking in retail tobacco stores.\u201d Appellant claims the Department ignored this controlling language in determining that She-Sha is not exempt from the VICAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>Appellant\u2019s interpretation of Code \u00a7 15.2-2821 is inconsistent with Code \u00a7 15.2-2825. Since interpretation of multiple, related statutory provisions must give full effect to each provision while remaining true to the purpose and intent behind them, Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.2-2821 and 15.2-2825 must be construed together. As discussed above, smoking is \u201cotherwise prohibited\u201d in non-exempt restaurants by Code \u00a7 15.2-2825. If Code \u00a7 15.2-2821 was intended by the legislature to provide a blanket exemption for tobacco warehouses, tobacco manufacturing facilities, and retail tobacco stores not operated exclusively as such, then there would have been no need for the legislature to expressly exempt restaurants on the premises of tobacco manufacturers later in Code \u00a7 15.2\u20142825(A)(3). Since these facilities would already be covered by Code \u00a7 15.2-2821, such an interpretation effectively renders the exemption in Code \u00a7 15.2-2825 meaningless. Further, Code \u00a7 15.2-2825 regulates smoking in restaurants, not retail tobacco stores. Thus, it does not conflict with Code \u00a7 15.2-2821.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">For these reasons, we reject appellant\u2019s arguments. Even though appellant recognizes that She-Sha can simultaneously be both a retail tobacco store and a restaurant, it seeks to be treated as one to the exclusion of the other, and thereby circumvent the statutory obligations associated with being a restaurant. The statutory provisions read in conjunction with each other show that the legislature did not intend an all-encompassing exemption for retail tobacco stores not operating exclusively as such. Even if it were to be determined that She-Sha is a retail tobacco store as contemplated by the VICAA, She-Sha is also a restaurant as defined by the statute, and She-Sha does not fall within any of the stated exemptions to the restaurant smoking ban. Without an applicable exemption, She-Sha must comply with the VICAA restaurant smoking ban, including posting the appropriate signs and prohibiting patrons from smoking.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">\n<em>Attorney\u2019s Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Appellant requests it be granted attorneys\u2019 fees and costs associated with the proceeding pursuant to Code \u00a7 2.2-4030. This section provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>In any civil case brought under Article 5 (\u00a7 2.2-4025 et seq.) of this chapter ... in which any person contests any agency action, such person shall be entitled to recover from that agency ... reasonable costs and attorneys\u2019 fees if such person substantially prevails on the merits of the case and the agency\u2019s position is not substantially justified, unless special circumstances would make an award unjust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Code \u00a7 2.241030(A). Where a party does not substantially prevail on the merits of the case and the agency\u2019s position is substantially justified, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs will not be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">For the reasons stated above, appellant did not substantially prevail on the merits of the case and the Department\u2019s position was substantially justified. Appellant\u2019s argument for exemption from the VICAA was rejected, and the Department\u2019s case decision was upheld as a reasonable interpretation of the statutory provisions. In light of this outcome, it is inappropriate to award appellant attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">Because She-Sha is a restaurant as contemplated by the VICAA, it is subject to the restaurant smoking ban and must comply with its requirements. She-Sha does not fall within any of the stated exemptions to the restaurant smoking ban, and the VICAA does not provide an all-encompassing exemption for retail tobacco stores that simultaneously operate as a restaurant subject to the VICAA smoking ban. Interpreting the VICAA as such would render other provisions of the statute superfluous. For these reasons, the circuit court did not err in upholding the Department\u2019s decision that She-Sha was not exempt from compliance with the VICAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b743-8\">.

Indeed, the majority uses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>several such principles in order to construe Code \u00a7 15.2-2825 in a way that would prohibit smoking in the She-Sha Caf\u00e9 and Hookah Lounge, a business that unquestionably is engaged in the retail sale of tobacco products.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In doing so, however, the majority ignores the express intent of the General Assembly prohibiting such construction.

[rjegulate smoking in <em>retail tobacco stores, </em>tobacco warehouses, or tobacco manufacturing facilities.\u201d (Emphasis added). Accordingly, by doing exactly what Code \u00a7 15.2-2821 expressly prohibits, the majority glosses over the plain language of the statute and applies the Indoor Clean Air Act to a business the General Assembly clearly intended to exclude. Therefore, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">The General Assembly passed the Indoor Clean Air Act in 1990 as Chapter 28 of Title 15.2 of the Virginia Code. The Act banned smoking in various government buildings and in some public areas. It also required certain restaurants to provide separate smoking and non-smoking areas. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.2-2800 to -2810. In 2009, the General Assembly repealed Chapter 28 and replaced it with Chapter 28.2. The new Indoor Clean Air Act banned smoking in all restaurants and bars in the Commonwealth. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 15.2-2825.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>the General Assembly carried over an express provision from the repealed Act that exempted retail tobacco stores from any of the Act\u2019s provisions that regulated smoking. Code \u00a7 15.2-2821. Thus, it would seem to me that before we engage in an analysis of whether She-Sha is a restaurant as defined in Code \u00a7 15.2-2820, or whether the Department of Health may enforce the provisions of the Act pertaining to restaurants, we first must determine if the business is a retail tobacco store. If it is, no amount of statutory-construction gymnastics can overcome the definite and precise language of Code \u00a7 15.2-2821\u2014\u201c[njothing in this chapter shall be construed to regulate smoking in retail tobacco stores____\u201d In other words, if SheSha is a retail tobacco store, we do not need to concern ourselves with any of the provisions of the Indoor Clean Air Act, including its definition of a restaurant, because they simply do not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Nevertheless, the majority concludes that because She-Sha meets the definition of a restaurant, as defined in Code \u00a7 15.2-2820, the Indoor Clean Air Act applies to it regardless of whether it is primarily a retail tobacco store. This conclusion is based upon the assumption that the General Assembly did not intend to exempt from Code \u00a7 15.2-2825 those businesses mentioned in Code \u00a7 15.2-2821, if that business also operates as a restaurant. Specifically, the majority reasons that smoking is prohibited in any establishment that prepares or serves food to the public unless the establishment is specifically exempted by Code \u00a7 15.2~2825(A). In advancing its construction of the Act, the majority points to the specific exemption in Code \u00a7 15.2-2825(A) for \u201cany restaurants located on the premises of any manufacturer of tobacco products.\u201d The majority states that because a tobacco manufacturing facility is also specifically exempted in Code \u00a7 15.2-2821, the General Assembly intended for Code \u00a7 15.2-2825 to apply to any business listed in Code \u00a7 15.2-2821 unless there is a specific exemption in Code \u00a7 15.2-2825(A). The majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>applies the statutory construction principle of <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>to reach the conclusion that \u201c[t]he legislature\u2019s express inclusion of tobacco manufacturers and exclusion of retail tobacco stores and tobacco warehouses is evidence of the intent that the latter be subject to compliance with the restaurant smoking ban.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">This conclusion stands in stark contrast to the plain language of the relevant statutory provisions. Code \u00a7 15.2-2821 exempts \u201ctobacco manufacturing facilities\u201d from the application of the Indoor Clean Air Act. Code \u00a7 15.2-2825(A) exempts restaurants \u201clocated on the premises of any manufacturer of tobacco products\u201d from the application of the Indoor Clean Air Act. \u201cTobacco manufacturing facilities\u201d and \u201cpremises of any manufacturer of tobacco products,\u201d as used in the Indoor Clean Air Act, are not synonymous; they describe completely different things.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We know this to be true because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWB\">\u201c[w]e look to the plain meaning of the statutory language, and presume that the legislature chose, with care, the words it used when it enacted the relevant statute.\u201d Moreover, when the General Assembly has used specific language in one instance, but omits that language or uses different language when addressing a similar subject elsewhere in the Code, we must presume that the difference in the choice of language was intentional.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-5\"><em>Zinone v. Lee\u2019s Crossing Homeowner\u2019s Ass\u2019n, </em>282 Va. 330, 337, 714 S.E.2d 922, 925 (2011) (quoting <em>Addison v. </em>Jurgelsky, 281 Va. 205, 208, 704 S.E.2d 402, 404 (2011)).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">While the Indoor Clean Air Act does not provide a definition for \u201ctobacco manufacturing facilities,\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 15.2-2821, Code \u00a7 15.2-2820 does provide a definition for \u201cfacility,\u201d as used in connection with other terms in the Indoor Clean Air</p>\n<p id=\"b756-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>Act: \u201c \u2018Educational facility\u2019 means any building used for instruction of enrolled students\u201d; \u201c \u2018Health care facility\u2019 means any institution, place, building, or agency....\u201d; \u201c \u2018Recreational facility\u2019 means any enclosed, indoor area used by the general public and used as a stadium, arena, skating rink, video game facility, or senior citizen facility.\u201d Looking at the various definitions of \u201cfacility\u201d in the Indoor Clean Air Act, the common theme running throughout each one is that \u201cfacility\u201d includes some type of building or structure which facilitates the desired function. Indeed, the plain and ordinary meaning of facility is \u201csomething (as a hospital, machinery, plumbing) that is built, constructed, installed, or established to perform some particular function or to serve or facilitate some particular end.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>812 (1981). Thus, the plain meaning of \u201ctobacco manufacturing facility\u201d is some type of building or structure which facilitates the manufacture of tobacco.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">The Indoor Clean Air Act does not provide a definition for \u201cpremises of any manufacturer of tobacco products.\u201d However, the key term in this phrase, for our purposes, is \u201cpremises.\u201d The plain and ordinary meaning of premises is \u201ca specified piece or tract of land with the structures on it,\u201d or \u201cthe place of business of an enterprise or institution.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s, supra, </em>at 1789. Thus, \u201cpremises of any manufacturer of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>tobacco products\u201d would include any land with structures on it that a tobacco manufacturer uses as its place of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">Accordingly, \u201cpremises,\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 15.2-2825(A), has a different meaning than \u201cfacilities,\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 15.2-2821. Code \u00a7 15.2-2821 exempts tobacco manufacturing <em>facilities </em>from the Indoor Clean Air Act. This means that any buildings or structures which facilitate the manufacture of tobacco are exempt from the Indoor Clean Air Act under Code \u00a7 15.2-2821. This exemption would apply to restaurants located within a tobacco manufacturing facility; it would not apply to restaurants located on the premises of a tobacco manufacturer. This is where Code \u00a7 15.2-2825(A) presumably fills the gap left by Code \u00a7 15.2-2821. Code \u00a7 15.2-2825(A) exempts \u201crestaurants located on the premises of any manufacturer of tobacco products.\u201d This means that a restaurant located on land with structures on it that the tobacco manufacturer uses as its place of business is exempt from the Indoor Clean Air Act under Code \u00a7 15.2-2825(A). Accordingly, a tobacco manufacturer could have a restaurant in its manufacturing <em>facility, </em>and that restaurant would be exempt from the Indoor Clean Air Act under Code \u00a7 15.2-2821. On the other hand, a tobacco manufacturer could have a stand-alone restaurant located on its <em>premises, </em>and that restaurant would be exempt from the Indoor Clean Air Act under Code \u00a7 15.2-2825(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">The language of Code \u00a7 15.2-2821 is clear. If a business is a retail tobacco store, tobacco warehouse, or tobacco manufacturing facility, then it is exempt from all provisions of the Indoor Clean Air Act. <em>Nothing </em>in the Indoor Clean Air Act can be construed to regulate smoking in the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">The Department of Health argues that a restaurant could avoid the requirements of the Indoor Clean Air Act by selling packets of cigarettes and labeling itself as a retail tobacco store. Indeed, a restaurant\u2019s ability to masquerade as a retail tobacco store would undermine the General Assembly\u2019s purpose in implementing the Indoor Clean Air Act. I am not unmindful of the Department\u2019s public policy concerns. Accordingly, I would adopt a primary purpose test to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>whether a business is a retail tobacco store, and therefore, exempt from the provisions of the Indoor Clean Air Act under Code \u00a7 15.2-2821. In order for a business to fall under the Code \u00a7 15.2-2821 exemption for a retail tobacco store, the primary purpose of the business must be the sale of tobacco. I do not propose a bright-line, formulaic approach to the classification of a business. Instead, the primary purpose of a business can be determined by looking at the totality of the evidence, including whether the business derives the majority of its revenue from the sale of tobacco. Both the Department and the trial court refused to determine whether She-Sha was a tobacco retail store. Because of this refusal, I would remand this case to the trial court with instructions to remand to the Department of Health for it to make a determination whether She-Sha is a retail tobacco store and thus exempt from the operation of the Indoor Clean Air Act.</p>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b753-5\">. The business model for She-Sha involves charging patrons for a flavored, wet tobacco which is heated by a burning coal and then smoked through a water-filled pipe known as a hookah. She-Sha sells tobacco and tobacco-related products as well as food and alcohol to its customers. However, it derives the majority of its revenue from the sale of tobacco. Tobacco and tobacco-related sales, e.g., hookah rentals, accounted for sixty-six to sixty-seven percent of She-Sha's revenue in the three months preceding the citations from the Department of Health. These sales figures have been consistent since September 2008. She-Sha has a license from the Virginia Department of Taxation classifying it as an \"Other Tobacco Products Retailer.\u201d As of February 2010, She-Sha has paid over $7,200 in taxes, as required for retail tobacco sales. While food and alcohol are also sold, the revenue from these sales is less than one-third of the total revenue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b753-6\">. Code \u00a7 15.2-2825(A) provides various exemptions to the restaurant smoking ban. The only Code \u00a7 15.2-2825(A) exemption at issue in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>case is an exemption for \"restaurants located on the premises of any manufacturer of tobacco products.\u201d Code \u00a7 15.2\u20142825(A)(5).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b755-7\">.

Although, Code \u00a7 15.2-5000 is not applicable here, and it specifically states that the definition is to be used for bonding purposes only, it is nonetheless instructive in our quest for an acceptable definition of tobacco manufacturing facilities. Code \u00a7 15.2-5000 states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-6\">\"Manufacturing facility\u201d means (i) any facility which is used in the manufacturing or production of tangible personal property, including the processing resulting in a change of condition of such property, (ii) any facility which is used in the creation or production of intangible property as described in \u00a7 197(d)(1)(C)(iii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, to be any patent, copyright, formula, process, design, pattern, knowhow, format, or other similar item, or (iii) any facility which is functionally related and subordinate to a manufacturing facility if such facility is located on the same site as the manufacturing facility.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
