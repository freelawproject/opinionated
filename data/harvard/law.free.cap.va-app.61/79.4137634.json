Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), and <em>Missouri v. Seibert, 542 </em>U.S. 600, 124 S.Ct. 2601, 159 L.Ed.2d 643 (2004). We assume, without deciding, that appellant was in custody, and we hold that the statements were admissible under <em>Seibert. </em>We, therefore, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b126-12\">On December 11, 2009, around 7:20 a.m., Kuhne walked into the lobby of a Herndon police station and told the 911 supervisor, Tammy Farley, that he \u201cneed[ed] to be arrested for [his] actions.\u201d He then began to weep. He handed Farley a handwritten note. Farley informed Sergeant Darcy Nidell of what had just happened. Nidell, in turn, informed Sergeant Dennis Royal. As Royal walked toward the lobby, Farley handed him the note. Royal made copies of the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-13\">The note states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Words can not express how sorry I am. I wish I could take it back. I did not mean for this to happen[.] I only wanted her to stop saying she would take my son away from me. I waited until morning so I could spend one last night with my son....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-5\">I put my wife in a bag on the porch so my son would not see what happened when he woke up this morning. Our address is 718 Tamarack Way ... in Herndon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-6\">We have no close family members. If they will take my son I hope he can be raised by either my mother ... my brother ... or my sister____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-7\">I hope I can die. I have lost my spouse and am now utterly alone. I have deprived my son of his mother and father. I have deprived my wife of her daily joy in contact with our son.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">The note was not signed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">Sergeant Michael Berg and Sergeant Nidell arrived in the lobby and introduced themselves to appellant as police officers. Nidell had not seen the note. Nidell said, \u201cI understand you are here and you want to talk about a crime\u201d or \u201cturn yourself in for a crime\u201d or words to that effect. Sergeant Nidell asked appellant where he resided, to determine whether the Herndon police officers had jurisdiction over the case. Berg asked appellant where his wife was, and he responded \u201cin a bag\u201d and provided an address in the Town of Herndon. Berg then asked appellant to put his hands on top of his head so he could be patted down for weapons. Appellant complied, and he was patted down. Berg also took possession of appellant\u2019s wallet, car keys, and some papers.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">Berg then escorted appellant out of the lobby, through a door, and into a hallway of the police station. This door is secured electronically and opens with a fob. At the end of a hallway that spans 50 to 75 feet, Berg opened a door with a pass key, led appellant into a foyer, and then through a second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>door that also opens with a pass key and into the interview area. In the interview room, appellant was asked to remove his shoes and lift his feet to ensure that nothing was hidden in the shoes. Appellant complied, and his shoes were returned to him. Appellant was not handcuffed or touched, aside from the initial pat down and the examination of his feet. Berg was not armed. Appellant was seated in an interview room with an open door. Sergeant Berg placed appellant\u2019s wallet, keys, scarf, and jacket on a bench in front of the interview room. The interview room is about 10 feet by 12 feet, with a table and a chair. Berg told appellant something like \u201cwe\u2019re going to have you sit and we will get somebody back to talk to you.\u201d Sergeant Nidell found some paper towels and gave them to appellant as he waited for Sergeant Royal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Approximately 20 minutes after Sergeants Berg and Nidell first encountered appellant in the lobby, Sergeant Royal arrived in the interview room. Royal first asked some preliminary questions, such as appellant\u2019s name, date of birth, and address, and whether he has any medical issues, such as diabetes. Royal next asked appellant if he had written the note. Appellant stated that he had. Royal then issued <em>Miranda </em>warnings to appellant. Appellant also signed a written form waiving his Fifth Amendment rights. Royal proceeded to question appellant. The interview lasted about an hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">In the interview, appellant explained that he was in the process of separating from his wife, Minghua Zheng. Appellant stated that she pressured him to sign a paper prepared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>by her lawyer, but he was reluctant to do so without first consulting an attorney. He stated that his wife told him that she would take him to court and charge him with cruelty and that he would never see his son again. He told her, \u201c[H]e\u2019s my son, I should be able to see my son.\u201d Appellant stated that she laughed at him. Although appellant stated that he does not remember doing this, appellant at some point strangled his wife and put her body in a bag. After killing her, he placed the bag outside. He then wrote the note, initially intending for it to serve as a suicide note.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The videotaped interview is part of the record. It depicts a distraught appellant unburdening himself to Sergeant Royal. Sergeant Royal was gentle and compassionate in his demeanor throughout the interview. At the conclusion of the interview, appellant was arrested and handcuffed.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Police arrived that morning at the address mentioned in the note. They found Zheng\u2019s body in a large suitcase on the balcony.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Kuhne was charged with the murder of his wife. Prior to trial, he filed a motion to suppress his statement to the police, arguing that it was obtained in violation of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. At the hearing, Sergeant Royal stated that he was familiar with the deliberate \u201ctwo-step\u201d interview practice\u2014one in which the police deliberately omit <em>Miranda </em>warnings, obtain incriminating statements, and then prod a suspect to confess anew following <em>Miranda </em>warnings\u2014but he testified that the Herndon Police Department had never used that practice and that he never had used it. Sergeant Nidell stated that she had only recently become familiar with the two-step interrogation procedure. She testified that \u201c[i]t\u2019s not anything that we practice and I\u2019ve never seen it practiced or an interview handled that way.\u201d Finally, Sergeant Berg stated that he did not know what the two-step interrogation was until defense counsel explained it to him shortly before trial. Berg stated that to his knowledge, this practice had never been employed in his 24 years with the Herndon Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>The trial court denied the suppression motion, concluding that appellant was not in custody. The court further held that, even if he had been in custody, the actions of the police did not implicate the decision in <em>Missouri v. Seibert, </em>542 U.S. 600, 124 S.Ct. 2601, 159 L.Ed.2d 643 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">At the conclusion of a jury trial, appellant was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and sentenced to serve seven years in the penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in refusing to suppress his statement to the police. First, he argues that he was in custody for <em>Miranda </em>purposes, and, therefore, any statements he made prior to those warnings must be suppressed. Second, he contends that this Court should follow the plurality decision of <em>Seibert </em>authored by Justice Souter, 542 U.S. at 604, 124 S.Ct. at 2605-06, and exclude all of appellant\u2019s statements to the police, including those that occurred after he was given <em>Miranda </em>warnings. We will assume, without deciding, for purposes of this opinion, that appellant was in custody and, therefore, appellant should have been issued <em>Miranda </em>warnings from the outset of the interrogation. Nevertheless, the concurring opinion by Justice Kennedy in <em>Seibert, </em>which we adopt as constituting the narrowest ground, establishes that the statements appellant made after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings were admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">On appeal, the burden rests with appellant to show that the denial of his suppression motion constituted reversible error. <em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 689, 695, 668 S.E.2d 141, 145 (2008). The reviewing court is bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support them, and \u201cmust give deference to the inferences that may be drawn from those factual findings.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Hilliard, </em>270 Va. 42, 49-50, 613 S.E.2d 579, 584 (2005). The trial court\u2019s determination that the provision of <em>Miranda </em>warnings cured actual, or, in this instance, assumed, constitutional violations raised by the earlier police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>interrogation is a legal determination, subject to <em>de novo </em>review by this Court. <em>See, e.g., Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 554, 561, 500 S.E.2d 257, 260 (1998); <em>Shears v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 394, 398, 477 S.E.2d 309, 311 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">In 1966, the United States Supreme Court, concerned about \u201cpolice violence and the \u2018third degree\u2019 \u201d as well as the inherent psychological effects of incommunicado interrogation in a police-dominated atmosphere, fashioned the now famous <em>Miranda </em>warnings that police must issue prior to interrogating suspects who are in custody. 384 U.S. at 445-58, 479, 86 S.Ct. at 1612-19, 1630-31. The Court designed these warnings to \u201cassure that the individual is accorded his privilege under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution not to be compelled to incriminate himself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 439, 86 S.Ct. at 1609. The Court held that \u201cthe prosecution may not use statements, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 444, 86 S.Ct. at 1612.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">On occasion, a suspect who is in custody will provide incriminating statements without <em>Miranda </em>warnings and later provide further incriminating details after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The initial failure to warn may be due to oversight, confusion about whether a suspect is in custody, or a tactical choice by the police not to supply <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Two cases from the United States Supreme Court address the impact of such a situation. First, in <em>Oregon v. Elstad, </em>470 U.S. 298, 105 S.Ct. 1285, 84 L.Ed.2d 222 (1985), a police officer questioned a suspect at his mother\u2019s home about a burglary, without first providing <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The suspect was in custody at that time and, therefore, police should have provided <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The suspect admitted he was present during the burglary. <em>Id. </em>at 301, 105 S.Ct. at 1288-89. Police then took the suspect to the police station. About an hour later, police informed him about his <em>Miranda </em>rights and proceeded to question him. He waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>and confessed to his involvement in the crime. <em>Id. </em>at 301-02, 105 S.Ct. at 1288-89. The defendant sought to suppress the statement he made at the police station, arguing that the \u201c[unwarned] statement he made in response to questioning at his house \u2018let the cat out of the bag\u2019 and tainted the subsequent confession as \u2018fruit of the poisonous tree.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 302, 105 S.Ct. at 1289 (citations omitted). The Court rejected this argument, reasoning that \u201c[t]hough <em>Miranda </em>requires that the unwarned admission must be suppressed, the admissibility of any subsequent statement should turn in these circumstances solely on whether it is knowingly and voluntarily made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 309, 105 S.Ct. at 1285. \u201c[A]bsent deliberately coercive or improper tactics in obtaining the initial statement,\u201d the Court concluded, \u201csubsequent administration of <em>Miranda </em>warnings ... ordinarily should suffice to remove the conditions that precluded admission of the earlier statement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 314, 105 S.Ct. at 1296.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">The Court revisited the issue in 2004 when it addressed \u201ca new challenge to <em>Miranda </em>a deliberate \u201cquestion first\u201d or \u201ctwo-step\u201d interrogation technique. <em>Seibert, </em>542 U.S. at 609, 124 S.Ct. at 2608. Under this technique, police would first seek to elicit a confession without <em>Miranda </em>warnings. If successful, police would then issue <em>Miranda </em>warnings and guide the suspect through a repetition of the statement that was obtained without the benefit of <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>Id. </em>at 605-06, 609, 124 S.Ct. at 2606-07, 2608. Although five Justices concluded that the suspect\u2019s second statement could not be admitted as evidence, no single opinion spoke for the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Justice Souter, writing for a plurality that included Justices Stevens, Ginsburg, and Breyer, wrote that \u201c[t]he threshold issue when interrogators question first and warn later is ... whether it would be reasonable to find that in these circumstances the warnings could function \u2018effectively1 as <em>Miranda </em>requires.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 611-12, 124 S.Ct. at 2610. Justice Souter provided some \u201crelevant facts that bear on whether <em>Miranda </em>warnings delivered midstream could be effective\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">[1] the completeness and detail of the questions and answers in the first round of interrogation, [2] the overlapping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>content of the two statements, [3] the timing and setting of the first and the second, [4] the continuity of police personnel, and [5] the degree to which the interrogator\u2019s questions treated the second round as continuous with the first.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AkO\"><em>Id. </em>at 615, 124 S.Ct. at 2601.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Justice Breyer joined the plurality in full and wrote a separate concurring opinion, in which he expressed his view that \u201cCourts should exclude the \u2018fruits\u2019 of the initial unwarned questioning unless the failure to warn was in good faith.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 617, 124 S.Ct. at 2613. He expressed his agreement with Justice Kennedy\u2019s opinion \u201cinsofar as it is consistent with this approach and makes clear that a good-faith exception applies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 618, 124 S.Ct. at 2614.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">For his part, Justice Kennedy concurred in the judgment, but on what he termed \u201cnarrower\u201d grounds. <em>Id. </em>at 622, 124 S.Ct. at 2616. Justice Kennedy agreed with the plurality that \u201c[t]he interrogation technique used in this case is designed to circumvent <em>Miranda v. Arizona\u201d </em>and that \u201cstatements obtained through the use of this technique are inadmissible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 618, 124 S.Ct. at 2614. He concluded, however, that the plurality opinion \u201ccuts too broadly\u201d because it would apply to both intentional and unintentional two-step interrogations. <em>Id. </em>at 622, 124 S.Ct. at 2616. In his view, unless the police employed \u201cthe two-step interrogation technique ... in a calculated way to undermine the <em>Miranda </em>warning,\u201d then \u201c[t]he admissibility of postwarning statements should continue to be governed by the principles of <em>Elstad.\u201d Id. </em>at 622, 124 S.Ct. at 2616.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Finally, Justice O\u2019Connor, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Scalia and Thomas, dissented on the basis that the <em>Elstad </em>framework compelled a different outcome. Justice O\u2019Connor noted her agreement with the Souter plurality that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>the defendant\u2019s statement \u201ccannot be held inadmissible under a \u2018fruit of the poisonous tree\u2019 theory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 623, 124 S.Ct. at 2616. Furthermore, in disagreement with Justice Kennedy, she wrote that \u201cthe plurality correctly declines to focus its analysis on the subjective intent of the interrogating officer.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Although this Court has not by binding precedent determined the scope of the <em>Seibert </em>holding,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a strong majority of federal courts<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and state courts<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> have adopted Justice Kennedy\u2019s concurring opinion as providing the rule of decision. The United States Supreme Court has instructed lower courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>that \u201c[wjhen a fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, \u2018the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.\u2019 \u201d <em>Marks v. United States, </em>430 U.S. 188, 193, 97 S.Ct. 990, 993, 51 L.Ed.2d 260 (1977) (citation omitted). The plurality and Justice Kennedy agree that where law enforcement officers <em>deliberately </em>employ a two-step interrogation to obtain a confession and where separations of time and circumstance and additional curative warnings are absent or do not inform a reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s position of his rights, the trial court must suppress the incriminating statement. The <em>Seibert </em>plurality would review <em>all </em>two-step interrogations under a multi-factor test designed to determine whether the subsequent warnings \u201ccould be effective enough to accomplish their object.\u201d <em>Seibert, </em>542 U.S. at 615-16, 124 S.Ct. at 2612. Justice Kennedy\u2019s opinion would apply a form of heightened scrutiny only to those two-step cases in which law enforcement officers deliberately employed a two-step procedure designed to weaken <em>Miranda's </em>protections. 542 U.S. at 621-22, 124 S.Ct. at 2615-16. Justice Kennedy\u2019s concurring opinion, therefore, represents the narrowest ground and, consequently, constitutes the holding in <em>Seibert.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Justice Kennedy\u2019s concurrence also is most consistent with the <em>Elstad </em>decision, which both the plurality and the dissent accepted as valid precedent. In <em>Elstad, </em>the Court noted that \u201cabsent deliberately coercive or improper tactics in obtaining the initial statement, the mere fact that a suspect has made an unwarned admission does not warrant a presumption of compulsion.\u201d 470 U.S. at 314, 105 S.Ct. at 1296. Justice Kennedy\u2019s concurrence essentially concludes, consistently with <em>Elstad, </em>that the two-step interrogation technique is one that is \u201cdeliberately coercive or improper\u201d and takes such interrogations outside of the general rule articulated in <em>Elstad.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">We hold that unless police deliberately employ the \u201cquestion first\u201d strategy, the admissibility of postwarning statements is governed by <em>Elstad. </em>If the two-step, question first strategy is employed, postwarning statements that are related to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>substance of prewarning statements must be excluded unless police take curative measures before the postwarning statements are made. The net effect of <em>Seibert </em>is to carve out an exception to the <em>Elstad </em>framework for cases in which a law enforcement officer employs a deliberate, two-step strategy to obtain a postwarning confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The circuit court concluded that this was not a <em>Seibert </em>two-step case, <em>i.e., </em>one in which the officers deliberately obtained a confession and then prodded the suspect to repeat the confession following <em>Miranda </em>warnings. We first note that this \u201cdeliberateness finding is appropriately reviewed as a factual finding.\u201d <em>United States v. Narvaez-Gomez, </em>489 F.3d 970, 974 (9th Cir.2007). This Court is \u201cbound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact unless \u2018plainly wrong\u2019 or without evidence to support them.\u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 198, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) (en banc) (quoting <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1663, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996)). Sergeant Royal testified that he did not employ the two-step technique. The evidence establishes that the Herndon Police Department had never used this technique. Moreover, the way Sergeant Royal proceeded differs markedly from the method employed in <em>Seibert. </em>In <em>Seibert, </em>the suspect was questioned for 30 or 40 minutes until she confessed. 542 U.S. at 604-05, 124 S.Ct. at 2605-06. The officer in <em>Seibert </em>testified that he deliberately did not provide <em>Miranda </em>warnings at this time. After the suspect confessed, she received a 20-minute coffee and cigarette break. <em>Id. </em>at 605, 124 S.Ct. at 2606. The officer then turned on a tape recorder, provided <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and resumed questioning. <em>Id. </em>Here, aside from a few preliminary questions, the only question asked before appellant was given <em>Miranda </em>warnings was whether he had authored the note. The trial court\u2019s conclusion, that this was not a <em>Seibert </em>two-step case, is fully supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The distinct method employed by the police in <em>Seibert </em>was not used here. Therefore, the admissibility of appellant\u2019s statements is governed by <em>Elstad. </em>Under that decision, \u201cab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>sent deliberately coercive or improper tactics in obtaining the initial statement, the mere fact that a suspect has made an unwarned admission does not warrant a presumption of compulsion\u201d with regard to any later, postwarning statement. <em>Elstad, </em>470 U.S. at 314, 105 S.Ct. at 1296; <em>Seibert, </em>542 U.S. at 622, 124 S.Ct. at 2616 (Kennedy, J., concurring). Instead, \u201c[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, in fact, the second statement also was voluntarily made.\u201d <em>Elstad, </em>470 U.S. at 318, 105 S.Ct. at 1298.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Examining \u201cthe surrounding circumstances and the entire course of police conduct with respect to the suspect,\u201d <em>Elstad, </em>470 U.S. at 318, 105 S.Ct. at 1298, there can be no serious dispute that the statement appellant provided after he received <em>Miranda </em>warnings was voluntary. The videotape of the interrogation, which is included in the record and which we have viewed, shows that Sergeant Royal was gentle, solicitous even, in the way he questioned appellant. The surrounding circumstances reveal a guilt stricken man who sought to unburden himself of the crime he committed. Indeed, appellant does not contend that his statement was involuntary.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">The statements Kuhne made following his <em>Miranda </em>waiver were admissible under <em>Seibert </em>and <em>Elstad. </em>Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b127-11\">. Kuhne later signed and dated the note at the request of Sergeant Royal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b128-7\">. At the suppression hearing, Sergeant Nidell testified that after she placed appellant in the interrogation room, and before Sergeant Royal arrived, she asked appellant a few questions. Nidell asked appellant if his wife was still alive. Nidell explained that she had limited information about what had occurred and thought perhaps \"there was a way we could get in there to save her.\" She asked appellant if he was injured. Nidell also asked appellant if he had prior contact with the police, and whether he had left anything in the lobby. These questions and the answers to these questions were not adduced at trial. Because these statements were not introduced into evidence at trial, appellant suffered no conceivable prejudice and we do not discuss these statements further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b133-8\">. Justice Kennedy further reasoned that where the interrogating officer deliberately uses the two-step strategy, \u201cpostwarning statements that are related to the substance of prewarning statements must be excluded unless curative measures are taken before the postwarning statement is made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 622, 124 S.Ct. at 2616.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b134-6\">.
