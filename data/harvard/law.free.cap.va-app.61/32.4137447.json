We reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">On August 22, 2003, mother married Donald Lee Layne (father). They had one child. On March 31, 2006, they separated. On May 3, 2006, they entered into a property settlement agreement, which included the following provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-11\">9. <em>CHILD CUSTODY AND VISITATION: </em>[Mother] agrees that she has and does hereby relinquishes [sic] her parental rights and any and all claims of parenthood to [the child].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-13\">10. <em>CHILD SUPPORT: </em>[Father] hereby waives the right to any claim of child support.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-14\">The property settlement agreement was ratified, confirmed, approved, and incorporated into the parties\u2019 final decree of divorce, which the trial court entered on May 10, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>On July 21, 2011, mother moved the trial court to reinstate the case on the docket to establish for her a visitation schedule with the parties\u2019 child. On September 8, 2011, the trial court held that because mother\u2019s parental rights had been terminated by the May 10, 2006 final decree, she was not, as defined by Code \u00a7 20-124.1, a \u201cperson with a legitimate interest\u201d entitled to seek visitation with the child. It denied mother\u2019s motion to reinstate. Mother filed a motion to reconsider. On September 29, 2011, without further ruling from the bench, the trial court entered the order on appeal setting forth the foregoing rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">\n<em>Preservation of issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Father asserts that this appeal should be dismissed because mother failed to preserve her assignments of error. He argues that she failed to give the trial court an opportunity to rule on her motion to reconsider and to rule on her objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">\u201cNo ruling of the trial court ... will be considered as a basis for reversal unless an objection was stated with reasonable certainty at the time of the ruling, except for good cause shown or to enable the Court of Appeals to attain the ends of justice.\u201d Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">\u201cThe purpose of Rule 5A:18 is to allow the trial court to correct in the trial court any error that is called to its attention.\u201d <em>Lee v. Lee, </em>12 Va.App. 512, 514, 404 S.E.2d 736, 737 (1991) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">The parties appeared before the trial court on September 8, 2011. There is no transcript of that hearing. The written statement of facts states that no evidence was presented and that the trial court made the findings incorporated in the September 29, 2011 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">On September 29, 2011, the trial court entered the final order. Mother\u2019s counsel handwrote on the order the following objections:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>1) The separation agreement and decree violate public policy, i.e. child\u2019s right to support. <em>See Kelley v. Kelley, </em>248 Va. 295 [449 S.E.2d 55] (1994).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-4\">2) This Court had no jurisdiction to terminate mother\u2019s parental rights in this matter. <em>See Church v. Church, </em>24 Va.App. 52[sic] [483 S.E.2d 498] (1997).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\">3) The lack of jurisdiction relates to the effort to terminate mother\u2019s parental rights. The parties cannot contract away the parental relationship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-6\">4) The only basis for termination of parental rights in the May 10, 2006 divorce decree was the May 3, 2006 separation agreement. No action was taken pursuant to 16.1-283.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">The trial court had an opportunity to consider mother\u2019s objections prior to the entry of the order. Mother noted her objections on the face of the order. The written statement of facts attaches the order, with mother\u2019s objections noted. Mother noted her objections timely. Her assignments of error are preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">\n<em>Termination of parental rights</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"An\">Mother argues that the trial court erred in ruling that her parental rights had been terminated and that she lacked a legitimate interest to seek visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">In its September 29, 2011 order, the trial court found that mother\u2019s \u201cparental rights were terminated by the May 10, 2006 Order of this Court based upon the [mother\u2019s] agreement and this Court\u2019s finding that such termination was in the child\u2019s best interests; that the [mother] personally endorsed that Order as Seen and Agreed to.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">\u201cUnder Virginia\u2019s statutory scheme, the circumstances providing authority for the termination of parental rights, and the attendant obligation of support, are limited.\u201d <em>Church v. Church, </em>24 Va.App. 502, 506, 483 S.E.2d 498, 500 (1997).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-11\">The statutory scheme for the constitutionally valid termination of residual parental rights in this Commonwealth is primarily embodied in Code \u00a7 16.1-283. That scheme pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>vides detailed procedures designed to protect the rights of the parents and their child. These procedures must be strictly followed before the courts are permitted to sever the natural and legal bond between parent and child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-5\"><em>Rader v. Montgomery Cnty. Dep\u2019t Soc. Servs., </em>5 Va.App. 528, 526, 365 S.E.2d 234, 235-36 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">\u201cThe obligation to comply with the statutory scheme that has been designed by the legislature to protect parents and children cannot be abandoned by a judge under the guise of seeking to \u2018promote the best interests of the child.\u2019 \u201d <em>Willis v. Gamez, </em>20 Va.App. 75, 82, 455 S.E.2d 274, 278 (1995) (citation omitted). That compliance is jurisdictional. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Mother\u2019s parental rights were not terminated pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-283. The procedural and substantive requirements of the statute were not met. Thus, its provision of jurisdiction was not invoked. The parties simply included a sentence in their property settlement agreement, and the final decree simply accepted this and stated that termination was in the child\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-8\">A judgment entered by a court that does not have jurisdiction over the subject matter is void. <em>Rook v. Rook, </em>233 Va. 92, 95, 353 S.E.2d 756, 758 (1987). Although the parties agreed to the termination of ... parental rights, together with [the] support obligation, jurisdiction cannot be established by the parties\u2019 consent. <em>Lucas v. Biller, </em>204 Va. 309, 313, 130 S.E.2d 582, 585 (1963).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-9\"><em>Church, </em>24 Va.App. at 505, 483 S.E.2d at 500.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">Furthermore, the agreement between the parties to terminate mother\u2019s parental rights is \u201cvoid as against public policy and unenforceable as a matter of law ... [and a] decree based on such an agreement must likewise be deemed void.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 508, 483 S.E.2d at 501 (citing <em>Kelley v. Kelley, </em>248 Va. 295, 298-99, 449 S.E.2d 55, 56-57 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">Accordingly, the provision in the May 10, 2006 decree terminating mother\u2019s parental rights to her child is null and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>The trial court held that because her parental rights had been terminated, mother lacked a legitimate interest to seek visitation. Because the trial court erred in terminating mother\u2019s parental rights, it also erred in relying on that termination to hold that she lacked a legitimate interest to seek visitation with her child.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">\n<em>Motion to reinstate</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">A party may reinstate a matter on the docket in order to obtain complete relief. Code \u00a7 20-121.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">\u201cA trial court\u2019s determination of matters within its discretion is reversible on appeal only for an abuse of that discretion, ... and a trial court\u2019s decision will not be set aside unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Farley v. Farley, </em>9 Va.App. 326, 328, 387 S.E.2d 794, 795 (1990) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">Because the trial court erred in holding that mother lacked a legitimate interest to seek visitation, it erred in denying her motion to reinstate and in denying her a hearing on her request for visitation. Upon remand, it shall reinstate the case on the docket and grant her that hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
