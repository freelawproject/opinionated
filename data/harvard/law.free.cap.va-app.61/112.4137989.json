He conditioned his plea upon preserving a right to appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of his pretrial motion, which sought to suppress the victim\u2019s identification of him in a photographic array. Because the trial court did not err by denying Smith\u2019s motion, we affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">When reviewing a denial of a suppression motion, we review the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, giving it the benefit of any reasonable inferences.\u201d <em>Glenn v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 413, 416, 642 S.E.2d 282, 283 (2007) <em>(en </em>banc) (citation omitted), <em>aff'd, </em>275 Va. 123, 654 S.E.2d 910 (2008). This standard requires us to \u201cgive due weight to inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>Malbrough v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 163, 169, 655 S.E.2d 1, 3 (2008) (citation omitted). In doing so, we consider facts presented both at the suppression hearing and at trial. <em>Tizon v. Commonwealth, </em>60 Va.App. 1, 15, 723 S.E.2d 260, 267 (2012).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>The trial court record established that a female prostitute agreed to enter a sports utility vehicle (SUV) in Portsmouth, at the request of the vehicle\u2019s driver. The driver thereafter picked up three other males. Brandishing what appeared to be a firearm, a fifth male climbed out of the cargo area of the SUV. Each man forced the victim to perform fellatio on him. The men then drove her to a remote area, beat her with sticks and a two-by-four board, and left her there alone. No evidence suggested any of the men wore masks.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">A police officer on patrol found the victim and took her to a police station to report the crime. Based on her statements, the police discovered the SUV, found the weapon (a BB handgun), and interviewed four of the five suspects. A few days after the incident, a Portsmouth detective prepared a photo array consisting of four pages, each containing a photo of a suspect \u201crandomly inserted in the array of six photos.\u201d App. at 29. Although Smith had a juvenile arrest record, his photo was unavailable. That being so, the detective took a photograph of Smith with a digital camera and placed the photo on one of the photo array pages. Because the size of Smith\u2019s photo was different from the other photos on the page, the detective resized Smith\u2019s photo to match the others, which created a \u201cslight elongation\u201d of his face.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Nothing in the detective\u2019s interviews with the victim or his independent investigation suggested that one of the assailants had an unusually long face. When presenting the photo array to the victim, the detective did not say or do anything suggesting that he had independent knowledge that Smith participated in the crime. Nor did he identify anyone by name. Before presenting the photo array, the detective told the victim to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>\u201clook them over carefully,\u201d \u201cdon\u2019t make a jump decision,\u201d and, \u201cif you see somebody in there that looks like one of the suspects, initial that, turn it over, write on the back where you know them from.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29-30; <em>see also id. </em>at 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The detective also told the victim he had conducted an investigation and obtained photographs of several suspects that would appear in the four-page photo array. He did not tell her the names of any of the suspects or where their photos would be placed. Without her knowledge, the detective had randomly placed the photo of one suspect on each page of the array. The victim looked over the pages, spending between one and three minutes on each page. The detective testified she picked out Smith\u2019s photo with a \u201chundred percent\u201d certainty that he was one of her attackers. <em>Id. </em>at 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Prior to trial, Smith filed a motion to suppress the victim\u2019s identification of him from the photo array. Smith claimed the photo array violated his due process rights and should have been excluded from the evidence. The trial court disagreed and found the detective \u201cin no way suggested which photograph was to be considered as the suspect\u201d and, at any rate, the \u201cslight elongation\u201d of Smith\u2019s photograph \u201cto make it the same size as the others\u201d was \u201cminor in effect and of no consequence.\u201d App. at 65. For these reasons, the court denied the motion to suppress and later received evidence in support of Smith\u2019s conditional guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">On appeal, Smith argues two circumstances of the photo array violated his due process rights: first, the detective \u201cdistorted Smith\u2019s photo, causing it to stand out in the photo array,\u201d and, second, the detective \u201cimplied to the witness that the suspect was shown in the photo array.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 17-18. Like the trial court, we disagree that either of these conditions warranted the exclusion of the victim\u2019s identification of Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">The \u201cdue process check on the admission of eyewitness identification\u201d applies only when \u201cthe police have arranged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>suggestive circumstances leading the witness to identify a particular person as the perpetrator of a crime,\u201d <em>Perry v. New Hampshire, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 716, 720, 181 L.Ed.2d 694 (2012), and when these circumstances damage the reliability of the identification to the extent that there exists \u201ca very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification,\u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Simmons v. United States, </em>390 U.S. 377, 384, 88 S.Ct. 967, 971, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247 (1968)); <em>see also Neil v. Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Both elements of a due process violation must be shown before the identification can be suppressed. \u201cAn identification infected by improper police influence, our case law holds, is not automatically excluded.\u201d <em>Perry, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 132 S.Ct. at 720. If the \u201cindicia of reliability are strong enough to outweigh the corrupting effect of the police-arranged suggestive circumstances, the identification evidence ordinarily will be admitted, and the jury will ultimately determine its worth.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">The defendant bears the burden of proving both elements of the due process violation. <em>Winston v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 564, 593-94, 604 S.E.2d 21, 37-38 (2004). It is a \u201cweighty burden\u201d for the defendant, <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>52 Va.App. 388, 392, 663 S.E.2d 536, 538 (2008) (citation omitted), because the exclusion of such evidence is a \u201cdrastic sanction\u201d reserved for \u201cidentification testimony which is manifestly suspect,\u201d <em>Harker v. Maryland, </em>800 F.2d 437, 443 (4th Cir.1986). This approach stems from the \u201crecognition that the jury, not the judge, traditionally determines the reliability of evidence,\u201d particularly given the many procedural safeguards at trial \u201cbuilt into our adversary system that caution juries against placing undue weight on eyewitness testimony of questionable reliability.\u201d <em>Perry, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 132 S.Ct. at 728.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">(i) The Elongated Photo of Smith</p>\n<p id=\"b163-12\">The unduly-suggestive test presupposes that the power of suggestion links a photo to a victim\u2019s recollection of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>the individual she accuses of the crime or in some other way implies that the police are singling out a photo as the man who they believe committed the crime. <em>Compare Williamson v. Commonwealth, 211 </em>Va. 57, 59, 175 S.E.2d 285, 286 (1970) (finding the police did not do \u201canything which would tend to point out defendant, or to set him aside or apart <em>as the individual whom they suspected </em>as being the guilty party\u201d (emphasis added)), <em>with Foster v. California, </em>394 U.S. 440, 443, 89 S.Ct. 1127, 1128, 22 L.Ed.2d 402 (1969) (finding photo of suspect unduly suggestive because of his height and that \u201che was wearing a leather jacket similar to that worn by the robber\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The suggestive effect, in other words, must be something akin to the police saying \u201cto the witness, <em>\u2018This </em>is the man.\u2019 \u201d <em>Foster, </em>394 U.S. at 443, 89 S.Ct. at 1129 (emphasis in original). The suggestion can happen in myriad ways, such as where a photo array includes \u201cpictures of several persons among which the photograph of a single such individual recurs or is in some way emphasized,\u201d <em>Simmons, </em>390 U.S. at 383, 88 S.Ct. at 971, thereby baiting the victim to think the police believe he is indeed \u201cthe man,\u201d <em>Foster, </em>394 U.S. at 443, 89 S.Ct. at 1129. And, no doubt, a photo can be impermissibly emphasized so as to attract the victim\u2019s selection, as where it alone includes characteristics unique to the victim\u2019s reported observations, or where the photo is specifically singled out as one of the suspects being investigated by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">For example, it may be \u201cimpermissibly suggestive\u201d to depict \u201conly the defendant wearing a shirt of the color described by witnesses.\u201d <em>Jarrett v. Headley, </em>802 F.2d 34, 41 (2d Cir.1986). In a situation like that, the array contains only one person (the one the police suspect to be the perpetrator) depicted with a highly relevant characteristic. On the other hand, a purely innocuous distinction in a photo, by itself, may suggest nothing of relevance. Thus, it matters very little \u201cthat all of the photographs in the array be uniform with respect to a given characteristic\u201d in a case where, for example, the \u201cdifferences in the hair styles of those pictured have nothing to do with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>description\u201d the witness gave the authorities. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>546 F.2d 1275, 1280 (5th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Put another way, if a victim claimed she was shot by a man wearing a hat, it might be unduly suggestive for a photo array to include only one man (the one the police suspect to be the shooter) wearing a hat. The same would be true if the police told the victim, prior to viewing the array, that their lead suspect was a man wearing a hat. But, if the identification was not \u201cbased on the fact\u201d that the victim \u201cremembered that [the attacker] had worn a hat,\u201d there is nothing \u201cimpermissibly suggestive\u201d about a suspect being \u201csingled out to wear a hat.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Alabama, </em>399 U.S. 1, 6, 90 S.Ct. 1999, 2002, 26 L.Ed.2d 387 (1970).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Such a coincidence might suggest only that the man likes hats, not that he is the prime suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Applying these principles, we find Smith\u2019s first argument\u2014 challenging his slightly elongated photo\u2014implicates no due process concerns. The resized photo did not <em>suggest </em>to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>victim that the long-faced person was one of the assailants. She said nothing to the officers about one of her assailants having a long or narrow face. Nor can it be generalized that young men with elongated faces are more often than not criminals. The detective, moreover, did not hint that the investigation implicated a long-faced man.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">In short, Smith\u2019s assertion that his photo stood out because none of the other pictures were elongated does not prove that this innocuous feature <em>suggested </em>to the victim that the long-faced male attacked her. As a result, Smith did not demonstrate in the trial court that the police \u201carranged suggestive circumstances\u201d leading the victim to identify him as the \u201cperpetrator of a crime.\u201d <em>Perry, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 132 S.Ct. at 720.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">(ii) The Detective\u2019s Statement about Suspects</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">Smith also asserts the detective \u201cimplied to the witness that the suspect was shown in the photo array.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 18. \u201cAlthough he did not tell her \u2018in so many words\u2019 that there was a suspect\u2019s photo in the array,\u201d Smith concedes, the detective \u201ccertainly implied it strongly.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">We do not disagree with Smith\u2019s characterization of the evidence on this point. The detective told the victim he had conducted an investigation and implied that photographs of several suspects would appear in the photo array. The detective did not tell her, however, where the photos were placed among the four pages of photos. Nor did the detective suggest specifically \u201cwhich persons in the pictures were under suspicion.\u201d <em>Simmons, </em>390 U.S. at 385, 88 S.Ct. at 972. Like the trial court, we find these circumstances insufficient to exclude the witness\u2019s identification of Smith\u2019s photo.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">It is true that the chance of misidentification is \u201cheightened if the police indicate to the witness that they have other evidence that one of the persons pictured committed the crime.\u201d <em>Drewry v. Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 186, 190, 191 S.E.2d 178, 181 (1972) (quoting <em>Simmons, </em>390 U.S. at 383, 88 S.Ct. at 971). But this one fact, by itself, does not warrant the outright exclusion of the evidence. To be sure, \u201cthe mere fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>that the police officer wanted [the victim] to view the pictures carried with it, necessarily and unavoidably, the implication that the officer believed the guilty party might be among those pictured.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Hill v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 683, 697, 347 S.E.2d 913, 921 (1986). Thus, an officer\u2019s \u201cexpressed ... belief that [the] assailant was among those depicted in the photographs\u201d cannot be deemed \u201cimpermissibly suggestive.\u201d <em>Drewry, </em>213 Va. at 190, 191 S.E.2d at 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">As Professor LaFave has observed, many courts have \u201crejected challenges where the officer simply stated that the array included \u2018a suspect,\u2019 \u2018inasmuch as a witness would assume that to be the case.\u2019 \u201d Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 7.4(e), at 957 n. 90 (3d ed.2007); <em>see also Commonwealth v. Watson, </em>455 Mass. 246, 251, 915 N.E.2d 1052, 1057 (2009) (holding photo array not unduly suggestive merely because the police said \u201cthat the array included the photograph of a suspect\u201d); <em>Gatewood v. State, </em>158 Md.App. 458, 476, 857 A.2d 590, 600 (Md.Ct.Spec.App.2004) (holding \u201csuggestion] that [the suspect\u2019s] photograph was in the array\u201d was not impermissibly suggestive because the witness \u201ccould reasonably expect that the array shown to him would have contained a suspect\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The failure of investigators to follow best practices may be effectively attacked by \u201ccross-examination at trial which exposes to the jury the method\u2019s potential for error.\u201d <em>Simmons, </em>390 U.S. at 384, 88 S.Ct. at 971; <em>Watson, </em>915 N.E.2d at 1059 (refusing to constitutionalize \u201cbetter practice\u201d guidelines). The constitutional exclusion is warranted only if the procedure \u201cwas <em>so impermissibly suggestive </em>as to give rise to a <em>very substantial </em>likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u201d <em>Simmons, </em>390 U.S. at 384, 88 S.Ct. at 971 (emphasis added). The \u201cvery substantial likelihood\u201d standard cannot be met simply because \u201cthe identification procedure employed may have in some respects fallen short of the ideal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 385-86, 88 S.Ct. at 972.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Here, the victim had no way of knowing which of the photographed individuals were being investigated by the police. The four-page photo array consisted of twenty-four pictures of different men. Each page displayed pictures of six men of the same race, approximate age, and similar skin color. The possible implication that one or more of these individuals were under suspicion is hardly grounds for declaring the entire exercise corrupted by police misconduct. Every victim knows the police strive to find suspects and, for this reason, probably include some or all of those suspects in the photo array seeking to either confirm or dispel their suspicions. This is, after all, the whole point of the exercise. To be sure, a \u201cwitness ordinarily expects to be asked to make an identification of someone who either fits the description of a suspect or is suspected to have been involved in the reported crime.\u201d <em>Watson, 455 </em>Mass. at <em>252-53, 915 </em>N.E.2d at 1058 (citation omitted); <em>see also </em>LaFave, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 7.4(e), at 957 n. 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">\u201cWhile it might have been better if the officer had not expressed his belief that [the] assailant was among those depicted in the photographs,\u201d the \u201cstatement of the police officer\u201d to the victim did not make the photo array \u201cimpermissibly suggestive.\u201d <em>Drewry, 213 </em>Va. at 190, 191 S.E.2d at 181. For these reasons, we agree with the trial court that the officer\u2019s implied statement to the victim that the suspects were among the four pages of pictures was not so impermissibly suggestive as to taint the victim\u2019s identification of Smith as one of her attackers.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">Indicia of Reliability of the Victim\u2019s Identification</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">We also do not believe the elongated photo of Smith created \u201ca very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u201d <em>Perry, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 132 S.Ct. at 720 (quoting <em>Simmons, </em>390 U.S. at 384, 88 S.Ct. at 971). When \u201cindicia of reliability\u201d are \u201cstrong enough to outweigh\u201d any impermissible suggestion, due process leaves it to the factfinder to \u201cultimately determine its worth.\u201d <em>Id.; see, e.g., McCary v.

The detective said the victim was a \u201chundred percent\u201d sure that Smith was one of her assailants. App. at 45. We thus agree with the trial court that the distortion in Smith\u2019s photograph was \u201cminor in effect and of no consequence,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 65, and that the reliability of the victim\u2019s identification went to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Because the trial court did not err by denying Smith\u2019s motion to suppress the victim\u2019s identification of him from the photo array, we affirm his convictions for forcible sodomy and abduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b160-12\">.
