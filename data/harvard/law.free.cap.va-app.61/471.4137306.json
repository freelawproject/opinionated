On appeal, Moter contends the evidence failed to prove his guilt. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">When presented with a sufficiency challenge on appeal, we review the evidence in the \u201clight most favorable\u201d to the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth v. Hudson, </em>265 Va. 505, 514, 578 S.E.2d 781, 786 (2003). This principle requires us to \u201cdiscard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences to be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Parks v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 492, 498, 270 S.E.2d 755, 759 (1980) (emphasis and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">The background for Moter\u2019s present offenses began in 2006 when he was convicted of stalking C.V. At the time, Moter was 37 years old and C.V. 19. From then until now, Moter has claimed he and C.V. dated and had a sexual relationship. At trial, C.V. testified she never dated Moter or had sex with him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">During the 2006 stalking episodes, Moter scratched C.V.\u2019s car with a sexually explicit message. <em>See </em>App. at 114. He later wrote C.V.\u2019s name and address on a stop sign near her home, using a similar vulgarity to describe C.V. to her neighborhood. <em>Id. </em>at 138. The terms of his suspended sentence forbade him from having any further contact with the victim. But even after his initial conviction, Moter continued to make unwanted contact with C.V. He called her \u201cat all hours [of] the night\u201d and sent letters \u201cin the mail\u201d as well as numerous emails. <em>Id. </em>at 112. In his letters, Moter persistently used vulgar sexual references. <em>Id. </em>at 121. C.V. did not reply to any of Moter\u2019s communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">In 2007, Moter pled guilty to a second incident of stalking C.V. and also pled guilty to sending her a letter threatening death or bodily injury. <em>Id. </em>at 35. Moter had sent C.V. a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>message saying he would \u201cput a knife in [her] back\u201d if she attended a particular Christmas Eve concert. <em>Id. </em>at 166. This time, the court sentenced Moter to five years in prison for the felonious threat and twelve months for the second stalking offense. <em>Id. </em>at 35. The court imposed the time for the stalking conviction and suspended four of the five years on the felonious threat conviction. <em>Id. </em>Once again, the sentencing court conditioned Moter\u2019s suspended sentence on complying with the court\u2019s order to have no contact with C.V.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">After a brief respite, Moter continued his prior pattern of harassment. He wrote C.V. a letter on November 1, 2009, recounting his prior scratching of her car with \u201cbad words\u201d and \u201cleaving evil phone messages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 383. He claimed she needed to \u201cown up to [her] part in this business\u201d and understand \u201chow much [she] made [him] suffer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 385. He also mentioned that a prior girlfriend had accused him of rape. He claimed that on \u201cour first date ... my penis was <em>in you. </em>Did I rape you when you said no? IN YOU.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 386 (emphasis in original). Moter added that his \u201cjust met\u201d girlfriend and his prior \u201clive-in girlfriend\u201d had both been raped, <em>id. </em>at 387, but he did not mention the identity of the rapists. Throughout the letter, Moter accused C.V. of lying about their relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">C.V. testified that the letter \u201c[t]errified\u201d her. <em>Id. </em>at 121. The most disturbing parts, she said, were the \u201crandom\u201d remarks \u201cabout ex-girlfriends he had that have been raped\u201d and the \u201cdetail about the raping.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 122. It was \u201cbone chilling to me,\u201d C.V. testified. <em>Id. </em>Unnerved by Moter\u2019s actions, C.V. testified: \u201cI was amazed it [was] still going on. I mean here I am seven years later and he\u2019s been to jail again and again and nothing is stopping him. Nothing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 118. After she contacted the authorities, Moter was convicted of violating the terms of his prior suspended sentences and received another brief term of incarceration, along with another round of re-suspended sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">About a year later, between November 20 and 25, 2010, Moter sent more than forty computer-generated messages to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>C.V. via her Facebook account. The first message on November 20 read in part: \u201cOur secret? You know I won\u2019t tell!! ... I\u2019ll give you a baby.... I\u2019ll be your sugar daddy and spoil you ... make me your backdoor man.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 393. Another message on November 22 stated in part: \u2018You really think you don\u2019t owe me an apology after lying under oath and lying to the police about partying with me, having my cock rubbed by you and rubbed on your puss.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 130, 394. Moter then began one of his twisted concurrent themes: He threatened to charge C.V. with perjury if she continued to refuse to \u201cwrite back.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">A message sent on the following day, November 23, read in part: \u201c[Y]ou ought to beg me to suck my dick after lying to put me in prison. What were you thinking? Your 24 now. Not a kid and I want an answer please.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 407. Another message continued the same theme: \u201cI feel good except for lack of sex (and depression related to that).. I am ready for just about anything.... I hope your the hottest girl in all of downtown. I\u2019m sure some men think you are. I do. Not really. I used to think you\u2019d be super orgasmic and really hot but I wonder now.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 408.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This message was followed by another one on the same day, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\">I guess I should keep taking a little Xanax everyday for now. If the jail had not of forced me to stop taking it ... I would not have sent you \u201cthreat\u201d e-mail years ago.... [and] wrote on your stopsign-\u2014-{it was a flank attack by the way-stonewall/hooker}.... You and your boyfriend are probly just right for each other. I\u2019m sure that Victoria\u2019s Secret stuff gets your cooter wet.... Honestly I just don\u2019t think that your that hot and when I was your age I was doing better. So there. Stalk that. Bitch.... I have chicks to fuck and buds to smoke, little miss sappy pants, but when I jack off ... i think of you taking a fat ... cock exploding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>cum all in you and flooding your pussy with sperm, my hot slut wife. Now that is hot. Put your stuff on for your boy bitch.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 412. The series of similar messages continued for the next two days. His messages included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-5\">I know your into the next Howie who really will cut your head off like his next girl got it.... I could see [C.V.] heading down the wrong road.... Death Cab for Cutie for REAL... .please don\u2019t call the cops... .deal with this on your own please. Call me. Text me here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 413 (November 23) (capitalization in original). \u201cIt\u2019s well known your a leapfrog. Leaping from cock to cock, stopping to piss once in a while.... haha.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 421 (November 24). \u201c[Y]our day is coming. God is real and people like you learn that the hard way. It\u2019s called Karma and yours is catching you.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 422 (November 24).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-7\">You lucky, [C.V.] THAT i AM NOT A VINDICTIVE PSYCHO WHO IS OUTSIDE your window right now ready to take revenge on you----I only want justice in the courtroom. Otherwise I would come straight to your house and gave you justice in one minute long ago.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 423 (November 24) (capitalization in original).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-10\">My favorite is the one Bop told me____ He said after I wrote on the stopsign you came up to him and his buddys and said, \u201cI want ... cock.\u201d He said the[y] fucked you in the backseat of his car ... and that they hit you in the ass. Ha ha!.... Got the jungle fever I heard. Love is real and not fade away ... Bop Bop Bop mBop!</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 425 (November 24).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-13\">At trial, Moter took the stand in his own defense. He admitted he had stopped taking Xanax, a form of \u201canxiety medication,\u201d causing him to become \u201ckind of manic.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 227. He had also been taking \u201cvicodin\u201d and \u201coxycodone\u201d for a back injury. <em>Id. </em>at 228. He acknowledged his use of capitalization in some of his messages, specifically the one which said, \u201cYou lucky, [C.V.] THAT i AM NOT A VINDICTIVE PSYCHO WHO IS OUTSIDE your window right now ready to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>take revenge on you,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 423, but claimed the capitalization was just a \u201ctypo,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">At trial, Moter\u2019s counsel conceded Moter had an \u201cintent to harass\u201d C.V. with his messages. <em>Id. </em>at 173 (motion to strike after Commonwealth\u2019s case); <em>see also id. </em>at 134 (concession during evidentiary phase of trial); <em>id. </em>at 192 (trial court noting defense \u201cconceded the intent\u201d); Oral Argument Audio at 12:24 (repeating concession on appeal). Moter\u2019s counsel nonetheless argued the messages were neither obscene nor threatening.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Sitting as factfinder, the trial court disagreed. Finding \u201cthe emails of November 22, 23, and 24 are obscene and threatening,\u201d the court convicted Moter of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-152.7:1 and the terms of his prior suspended sentence. In refusing to re-suspend his sentence yet again, the court concluded: \u201cOnly prison can protect [the victim] and help Mr. Moter.\u201d App. at 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">On appeal, Moter challenges the sufficiency of the evidence. As a matter of law, he argues, his messages to C.V. do not violate Code \u00a7 18.2-152.7:1. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">A. The Text and Context of Code \u00a7 18.2-152.7:1</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">Code \u00a7 18.2-152.7:1 is remarkably clear: \u201cIf any person, with the intent to coerce, intimidate, or harass any person, shall use a computer or computer network to communicate obscene, vulgar, profane, lewd, lascivious, or indecent language, or make any suggestion or proposal of an obscene nature, or threaten any illegal or immoral act, he shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.\u201d Upon a showing of the required <em>mens </em>rea\u2014an intent to coerce, intimidate, or harass\u2014the statute criminalizes the sending of computer messages that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-10\">\u2022 communicate obscene, vulgar, profane, lewd, lascivious, <em>or </em>indecent language,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-11\">\u2022 <em>or </em>make any suggestion or proposal of an obscene nature,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-12\">\u2022 <em>or </em>threaten any illegal or immoral act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>The <em>actus reas </em>portion of Code \u00a7 18.2-152.7:1 includes three disjunctive elements. Any one of the three, standing alone, is sufficient to violate the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">The Virginia Supreme Court held in <em>Barson v. Commonwealth, </em>284 Va. 67, 726 S.E.2d 292 (2012), that the first disjunctive element\u2014an \u201cobscene, vulgar, profane, lewd, lascivious, <em>or </em>indecent\u201d communication\u2014really means only an obscene communication. Merely vulgar, profane, lewd, or lascivious communications, <em>Barson </em>held, do not violate Code \u00a7 18.2-152.7:1, thereby effectively excising those terms from the statute. <em>Barson, </em>284 Va. at 74, 726 S.E.2d at 296 (reversing conviction for a merely \u201cvulgar\u201d communication).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">To be truly obscene, <em>Barson </em>added, the communication must also violate another statute, Code \u00a7 18.2-372, Virginia\u2019s codification of the First Amendment\u2019s pornography exception recognized in <em>Miller v. California, </em>413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973). Under this statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">The word \u201cobscene\u201d where it appears in this article shall mean that which, considered as a whole, has as its dominant theme or purpose an appeal to the prurient interest in sex, that is, a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement, excretory functions or products thereof or sadomasochistic abuse, and which goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters and which, taken as a whole, does not have serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Code \u00a7 18.2-372.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">The second disjunctive element of Code \u00a7 18.2-152.7:1\u2014 suggesting or proposing something of an \u201cobscene nature\u201d\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>also presumably requires a court to employ the pornography definition of obscenity under the reasoning of <em>Barson. </em>And, because obscenity under <em>Barson </em>requires an \u201cappeal to the prurient interest in sex\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-372, the second element of Code \u00a7 18.2-152.7:1 apparently involves a suggestion or a proposal to share in the accused\u2019s prurient sexual interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The third disjunctive element\u2014a communication that threatens \u201cany illegal <em>or </em>immoral act\u201d\u2014does not require any proof of obscenity. An illegal act violates the criminal code; an immoral act violates society\u2019s social code reflecting its collective sense of moral propriety. Either act satisfies the third showing under Code \u00a7 18.2-152.7:1. It is \u201cimmaterial\u201d whether a communication is obscene if it involves \u201cthreats to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>commit illegal or immoral acts, where the threat is made with the intent to coerce, intimidate or harass any person.\u201d <em>Rives v. Commonwealth, </em>284 Va. 1, 2-4, 726 S.E.2d 248, 249-50 (2012) (distinguishing <em>Batson </em>and interpreting identical statutory language in Code \u00a7 18.2-427).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">B. Appellate Standard op Review</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Though the interpretation of statutory terms involves questions of law, whether a particular communication \u201cappeals to the \u2018prurient interest\u2019 \u201d and \u201cis \u2018patently offensive\u2019 \u201d are \u201cessentially questions of fact.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>413 U.S. at 30, 93 S.Ct. at 2618. Thus, as with all other factual issues on appeal, we do not ask \u201cwhether the materials <em>are </em>obscene, but, rather, whether the materials <em>create a jury issue </em>as to obscenity\u201d\u2014 that is, whether a \u201creasonable trier of fact\u201d could come to that conclusion. <em>Allman v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 104, 111-12, 596 S.E.2d 531, 535 (2004) (citation omitted), <em>relied on by Barson, </em>284 Va. at 70-74, 726 S.E.2d at 294-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The same can be said for the question whether a communication threatens an \u201cimmoral act\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-152.7:1. The existence of a threat, as well as the immorality of the threatened act, must be decided by factfinders who have the opportunity to see and hear the \u201cliving record,\u201d <em>James v. Commonwealth, </em>53 Va.App. 671, 677, 674 S.E.2d 571, 574 (2009) (citation omitted), revealed during the adversarial process of a courtroom trial. That vantage point into the truth simply does not exist on appeal. Limited to transcripts and after-the-fact arguments, we are institutionally incapable of \u201creweigh[ing] the evidence\u201d and presiding <em>\u201cde novo </em>over a second trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Finally, it makes no difference that a trial judge, rather than a jury, sits as factfinder. In a bench trial, a trial judge\u2019s \u201cmajor role is the determination of fact, and with experience in fulfilling that role comes expertise.\u201d <em>Haskins v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 1, 11, 602 S.E.2d 402, 407 (2004) (citation omitted). For this reason, we examine trial court factfinding \u201cwith the highest degree of appellate deference.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number><em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 605, 608, 688 S.E.2d 229, 231 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">C. Evidentiary Sufficiency in this Case</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The trial court found that Moter\u2019s emails constituted computer harassment under Code \u00a7 18.2-152.7:1. We believe a rational factfinder could easily come to that conclusion. Mot-er\u2019s emails express \u201can appeal to the prurient interest in sex\u201d and include multiple \u201cshameful\u201d sexual suggestions that go \u201csubstantially beyond customary limits\u201d as these terms are used in Code \u00a7 18.2-352. Many of his emails make a \u201csuggestion or proposal\u201d of an obscene nature, and several implicitly threaten \u201cillegal or immoral\u201d acts. Code \u00a7 18.2-152.7:1.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">We think so, not merely because of the literal text of each of the emails, but because of the long and tortuous context in which Moter communicated them. At the time of these specific offenses, C.V. had <em>already </em>been victimized by Moter on multiple occasions over several years. Moter twice pled guilty to stalking C.V. He threatened to stab her, scratched her car with profanities, wrote similar profanities on her neighborhood stop sign, and sent multiple messages laced with profane vulgarities. <em>See </em>App. at 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">It was in this sordid context that Moter reinitiated contact with C.V. in 2010 with a torrent of more than forty messages over just a few days. Nearly all of the messages repeated Moter\u2019s prurient appeals to sex and asserted his persistent, but false, claim that he and C.V. had been sexual partners. Underlying this false claim was an implied threat: If C.V. did not apologize for refusing to acknowledge their sexual relationship and thereafter express her willingness to continue it, she would pay a price.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">The implication underlying Moter\u2019s messages was unmistakable: He talked about having his \u201ccock rubbed by [C.V.] and rubbed on [her] puss,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 130, 394 (November 22), and told her, \u201c[Y]ou ought to beg me to suck my dick,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 407 (November 23). He followed up with: \u201cStalk that. Bitch.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 141, 412 (November 23). \u201cDeath Cab for Cutie for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>REAL.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 413 (November 23) (capitalization in original). \u201cYou lucky, [C.V.] THAT i AM NOT A VINDICTIVE PSYCHO WHO IS OUTSIDE your window right now ready to take revenge on you.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 423 (November 24) (capitalization in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">In short, given Moter\u2019s prior offenses against C.V., his November 2010 messages cannot be explained away as anything other than a torrent of harassing obscenities and deranged threats of harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Ample evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that Moter was guilty of computer harassment under Code \u00a7 18.2-152.7:1. We thus affirm his convictions and the accompanying revocation of the suspension on his earlier felony sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b517-10\">. For purposes of protecting the victim\u2019s privacy, we identify her only by her initials.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b519-8\">. Throughout this opinion, we quote Moter's messages as written, without noting his misspellings and grammatical errors. And because of the nature of Moter\u2019s convictions, we regrettably must repeat his statements verbatim without sanitizing his profanities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b522-9\">. The \"article\u201d mentioned in Code \u00a7 18.2-372 is Article 5 of Chapter 8 of Title 18.2. The computer harassment statute appears in Article 7.1 of Chapter 5 of Title 18.2. <em>Barson </em>held this to be a distinction without a difference. <em>Barson, </em>284 Va. at 72-74, 726 S.E.2d at 295-96.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b522-10\">. <em>Barson </em>did not explain why the first disjunctive element, itself stated in the disjunctive, must be collapsed into the single word \"obscene.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>Instead, <em>Barson </em>adopted the reasoning of a prior panel opinion from our Court, <em>Allman v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 104, 596 S.E.2d 531 (2004). As then-Judge McClanahan later explained, however, <em>Allman</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7a\">wrongly imported pure <em>First Amendment </em>free speech principles to limit the proscription of this harassment statute to only words of intimidation that \u201cappeal to the prurient interest in sex,\u201d i.e., words that meet the definition of \u201cobscene\u201d for purposes of <em>First Amendment </em>analysis. The statute in this case (Code \u00a7 18.2-152.7:1), like the one at issue in <em>Allman </em>(Code \u00a7 18.2-427), proscribes intimidating, harassing conduct\u2014not merely speech. The words used to exhibit such conduct are not protected speech under the <em>First Amendment. ... </em>And \u201c[i]ntimidation in the constitutionally proscribable sense of the word is a type of true threat.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 360. Because the statute here and in <em>Allman </em>address threatening and harassing conduct, the definition of \u201cobscene\u201d under a pure <em>First Amendment </em>free speech analysis does not apply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHc\"><em>Airhart </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>No. 1219-05-2, 2007 WL 88747, *3, 2007 Va.App. Lexis 11, *10 (Va.Ct.App. Jan. 16, 2007) (McClanahan, J., concurring); <em>see also Barson, </em>284 Va. at 77, 726 S.E.2d at 297-98 (Russell, J., concurring) (\u201cwe do not consider the <em>Miller </em>test to be constitutionally mandated when applied to statutes regulating harassing conduct\u201d).
