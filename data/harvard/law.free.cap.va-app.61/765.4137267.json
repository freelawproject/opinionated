(FRI) to reimburse the Commonwealth for payments made to FRI. Contesting this reimbursement order, FRI appealed to the circuit court under the Virginia Administrative Process Act (YAPA), Code \u00a7\u00a7 2.2-4000 through -4033, claiming DMAS\u2019s request was arbitrary and capricious. The circuit court rejected FRI\u2019s arguments, as do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">DMAS administers the federal and state funded Medicaid Program. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 32.1-323 through -331.17. DMAS entered into an agreement with FRI to provide intensive in-home care services to Medicaid-eligible individuals in Virginia. These services include, among other things, crisis interventions in the homes of at-risk youths with mental, medical, or behavioral health problems. <em>See </em>12 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 30-50-130(B)(5)(a). Due to the specialized needs of the patients receiving these services, DMAS regulations mandate that a professional participating in the program must be either \u201can LMHP or a QMHP,\u201d 12 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 30-60-61(A)(9), defined as a \u201cLicensed Mental Health Professional\u201d or a \u201cQualified Mental Health Professional.\u201d 12 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 30-50-226(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">The qualification pertinent to this case is the QMHP, which DMAS regulations define as \u201ca clinician in the human services field who is trained and experienced in providing psychiatric or mental health services to individuals who have a psychiatric diagnosis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A QMHP must be a physician, a psychiatrist, a psychologist, a qualified social worker, a registered nurse, or a \u201c[mjental health worker\u201d who meets particular criteria listed in the regulation. 12 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 30-50-226(A)(l) to (6). Except for certain registered or certified workers, all mental health workers must have varying levels of \u201cclinical experience,\u201d 12 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 30-50-226(A)(6)(a) to (f), ranging from one to four years.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>According to the DMAS regulation, \u201cclinical experience\u201d is \u201cpractical experience in providing direct services to individuals with mental illness or mental retardation or the provision of direct geriatric services or special education services. Experience may include supervised internships, practicums, and field experience.\u201d 12 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 30-50-226(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">In 2000, and again in 2007, DMAS and FRI entered into agreements authorizing FRI to participate in the DMAS program. The agreements stated that DMAS would pay FRI for its services on the conditions that FRI \u201ckeep such records as [the Virginia Medical Assistance Program (VMAP) ] determines necessary ... regarding payments claimed for providing services under the State Plan\u201d and \u201ccomply with all applicable state and federal laws, as well as administrative policies and procedures of VMAP as from time to time amended.\u201d App. at 655-56. DMAS also provided FRI with a Community Mental Health Rehabilitative Services Manual, which stated: \u201cProviders will be required to refund payments made by Medicaid if they are found to have billed Medicaid contrary to law or regulation, failed to maintain any record or adequate documentation to support their claims, or billed for medically unnecessary services.\u201d DMAS Community Mental Health Rehabilitative Services Manual ch. VI, at 2 (rev. June 6, 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">Following a utilization review by a DMAS auditor, DMAS requested reimbursement for services provided by four FRI employees who lacked sufficient periods of clinical experience at the time of the services billed and were thus unqualified mental health workers. As the enabling statute requires, DMAS placed the burden of proof on FRI to demonstrate the qualifications of its workers. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 32.1-325.1(C). After considering the evidence in the administrative record, DMAS concluded in the final agency decision that FRI did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that its employees were properly qualified as QMHPs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>FRI appealed the final agency decision to the circuit court. The court entered an order affirming DMAS\u2019s decision to obtain reimbursement for all four FRI employees. The court\u2019s order stated that DMAS\u2019s interpretation of 12 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 80-50-226 \u201ccannot require providers to satisfy an unwritten standard.\u201d App. at 305. The court apparently believed, however, that DMAS\u2019s interpretation did not violate this principle\u2014for the very next sentence of the order upheld DMAS\u2019s decision finding all four FRI employees unqualified.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">On appeal, FRI argues the circuit court should have found DMAS\u2019s decision \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d because DMAS imposed unwritten \u201cdocumentation requirements\u201d upon FRI to prove the clinical experience of its four employees. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 2. FRI adds that the circuit court\u2019s final order (which includes a statement that DMAS cannot enforce unwritten standards) demonstrates why its holding (which finds DMAS properly requested reimbursement for the four unqualified FRI workers) was plainly wrong. <em>Id. </em>On several levels, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">A. VAPA &amp; the Limited Nature of Judicial Review</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Under the VAPA, the circuit court reviews an agency\u2019s action in a manner \u201cequivalent to an appellate court\u2019s role in an appeal from a trial court.\u201d <em>Mattaponi Indian Tribe v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 690, 707, 601 S.E.2d 667, 676 (2004) (citations omitted), <em>aff'd in relevant part sub nom. Alliance to Save the Mattaponi v. Commonwealth, </em>270 Va. 423, 621 S.E.2d 78 (2005). \u201cIn this sense, the General Assembly has provided that a circuit court acts as an appellate tribunal.\u201d <em>Laurels of Bon Air, LLC v. Med. Facilities of Am. LIV Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>51 Va.App. 583, 591, 659 S.E.2d 561, 565 (2008) (quoting <em>Gordon v. Allen, </em>24 Va.App. 272, 277, 482 S.E.2d 66, 68 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">The circuit court has no authority under VAPA to reweigh the facts in the agency\u2019s evidentiary record. VAPA authorizes the court to \u201creject the agency\u2019s findings of fact only if, considering the record as a whole, a reasonable mind would <em>necessarily </em>come to a different conclusion.\u201d <em>Mattaponi Indian Tribe, </em>43 Va.App. at 706, 601 S.E.2d at 675 (emphasis in original) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cNor can the court substitute its own judgment for the agency\u2019s on matters committed by statute to the agency\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>discretion.\u201d <em>Boone v. Harrison, </em>52 Va.App. 53, 62, 660 S.E.2d 704, 708 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Instead, \u201cwhen the appellant challenges a judgment call on a topic on which \u2018the agency has been entrusted with wide discretion by the General Assembly,\u2019 we will overturn the decision only if it can be fairly characterized as \u2018arbitrary or capricious\u2019 and thus a \u2018clear abuse of delegated discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Citland, Ltd. v. Commonwealth ex rel. Kilgore, </em>45 Va.App. 268, 275, 610 S.E.2d 321, 324 (2005) (citation omitted). \u201cThis standard recognizes the larger premise that, before any legal question can be answered, an <em>a priori </em>question must first be asked\u2014who has the authority to decide. It is the one question that precedes all others.\u201d <em>Boone, </em>52 Va.App. at 62, 660 S.E.2d at 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\"> We generally review legal questions <em>de novo. </em>That is certainly the case when we interpret statutes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But we take a very different approach to interpreting administrative regulations. When authorized by the General Assembly to issue regulations, an agency acts securely within its delegable authority to interpret those regulations if it does so reasonably and in a manner consistent with the legislative directive. We thus afford DMAS \u201cgreat deference\u201d in its administrative \u201c \u2018interpretation and application of its own regulations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Finnerty v. Thornton Hall, Inc., </em>42 Va.App. 628, 634 n. 2, 593 S.E.2d 568, 571 n. 2 (2004) (quoting <em>Dep\u2019t of Med. Assistance Servs. v. Beverly Healthcare, </em>41 Va.App. 468, 481, 585 S.E.2d 858, 865 (2003)); <em>cf. Bd. of Supervisors v. State Bldg. Code Tech. Review Bd., </em>52 Va.App. 460, 466, 663 S.E.2d 571, 574 (2008) (noting limits to such deference).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>B. The Circuit Court\u2019s Final Order</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">With these principles framing our review, we next turn to the language of the circuit court\u2019s final order. FRI reads in it a fatal inconsistency. According to FRI, the order endorses FRI\u2019s main argument that DMAS was enforcing \u201cdocumentation requirements\u201d not clearly stated in its regulations. Despite this purported endorsement, the order rules in DMAS\u2019s favor on the merits with respect to all four FRI employees. FRI argues we should affirm the circuit court\u2019s reasoning and reverse its holding. We think just the opposite is true. It seems to us the better approach is to affirm the court\u2019s holding and ignore its allegedly inconsistent reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">To begin with, we are not at all confident of FRI\u2019s reading of the court\u2019s statement that DMAS\u2019s interpretation of 12 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 30-50-226 \u201ccannot require providers to satisfy an unwritten standard.\u201d App. at 305. FRI reads the statement to mean that DMAS improperly held FRI to an unwritten standard. The next sentence of the order, however, upholds DMAS\u2019s decision in full. Perhaps the court meant only to voice its agreement with FRI\u2019s theory in the abstract, while disagreeing that it applied to this case. Viewed through this contextual lens, the court simply said: \u201cYes, as a general principle, DMAS cannot apply an unwritten standard to FRI; but the court does not believe DMAS did so in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\"> We acknowledge the conceptual gap between what the court said and what it did seems rather wide, particularly considering the statement of facts adopted by the court. <em>See supra </em>n. 2. Mitigating that concern, however, is the basic tenet that an appellate court \u201creviews judgments, not statements in opinions.\u201d <em>California v. Rooney, </em>483 U.S. 307, 311, 107 S.Ct. 2852, 2854, 97 L.Ed.2d 258 (1987) (per <em>curiam) </em>(citation omitted); <em>see also Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842 n. 8, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2781 n. 8, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). When the issue on appeal involves a matter of law reviewed <em>de novo, </em>the \u201cquestion before an appellate Court is, was the judgment correct, not the ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>on which the judgment professes to proceed.\u201d <em>McClung v. Silliman, </em>19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 598, 608, 5 L.Ed. 340 (1821).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">In this case, the question before us is exactly the same as the one before the circuit court: Did DMAS interpret or apply its regulations in a manner that arbitrarily and capriciously required FRI to reimburse DMAS for prior Medicaid payments for the four unqualified employees? We can answer this legal question without attempting to tease out of the circuit court\u2019s statements various enigmatic meanings allegedly favorable or disfavorable to its holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">C. DMAS Regulations <em>&amp; </em>Final Agency Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">DMAS regulations define a QMHP as \u201ca clinician in the human services field who is <em>trained </em>and <em>experienced </em>in providing psychiatric or mental health services to individuals who have a psychiatric diagnosis.\u201d 12 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 30-50-226(A) (emphasis added). The syntax of this definition leaves no doubt as to its meaning: The requisite training and experience must be gained prior to the employee\u2019s services being billed to DMAS. DMAS interprets this regulation to permit on-the-job training so long as it involves true clinical experience as defined in 12 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 30-50-226(A).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">DMAS applied these definitions to the four disputed FRI employees and found that each lacked the required amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>clinical experience to be qualified as a QMHP at the time the services were rendered. This decision should not stand, FRI contends, because underlying it are unwritten \u201cdocumentation requirements\u201d nowhere spelled out in the regulations. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 9. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">To us, the record shows nothing more than DMAS looking for contemporaneous written evidence to support FRI\u2019s claim that its employees had <em>bona fide </em>clinical experience before being billed as QMHPs. It is understandable DMAS would do so. FRI provided DMAS with multiple, inconsistent versions of the employees\u2019 resumes and copies of their diplomas and first-aid certifications. To the extent any supervised on-the-job training occurred, none of it was adequately documented. We can hardly fault DMAS for considering the presence or absence of documentary evidence relevant to its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Perhaps not, FRI argues in the alternative, but FRI should have been given prior notice of DMAS\u2019s need for documentary proof of the employees\u2019 training and qualifications. We question the factual assumption behind this assertion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At the formal hearing, FRI\u2019s executive program director acknowledged that DMAS requested \u201csome records from these employees,\u201d App. at 423, and suggested FRI actually had <em>more </em>documentation available: \u2018We could have\u2014we were willing to drive a truck up, if needed, and bring the whole shebang, but we weren\u2019t told to, unfortunately.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">At any rate, it strikes us as common sense that a decision-maker would want to examine available documents that might affirm or disaffirm a claimant\u2019s position. DMAS\u2019s alleged failure to make this obvious point clear to FRI did not violate due process principles. <em>See generally Program Suppliers v. Librarian of Cong., </em>409 F.3d 395, 402 (D.C.Cir.2005) (noting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>that \u201c[w]hile due process may require that parties receive notice and an opportunity to introduce relevant evidence,\u201d there is no case \u201cholding that due process requires agencies to give advance notice of what evidence they intend to credit\u201d); <em>accord ICO Global Commc\u2019ns (Holdings) Ltd. v. F.C.C., </em>428 F.3d 264, 268 (D.C.Cir.2005) (\u201c[T]here is no due process violation if a regulated party acting in good faith is able to identify, with ascertainable certainty, the standards with which the agency expects parties to conform.\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">We also find no basis for FRI\u2019s complaint that DMAS\u2019s alleged \u201cdocumentation requirements,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 9, produced insupportable factual conclusions. DMAS found that one employee held a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Criminal Justice and had prior work experience at QVC, Pizza Hut, and the YMCA before joining FRI. The employee claimed to have been a youth counselor while in high school. DMAS reviewed this work background and concluded: \u201cThere is no job description or employment history that would establish [three] years of clinical experience. There is no record of clinical supervision.\u201d App. at 162. Moreover, DMAS found FRI\u2019s \u201cfile documentation was self-serving and non-verifiable,\u201d and thus FRI \u201cfailed to carry the burden of proving that [this employee] satisfied the qualifications of a QMHP.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">The other three employees fared no better. For one, FRI relied upon his prior work as a volunteer at a church and community center, but no evidence (written or unwritten) suggested he provided any direct services to individuals with mental retardation or illness. For another employee, FRI cited his prior experience as a high school English teacher and a dorm resident assistant in college, but no evidence proved either position involved counseling students with mental health diagnoses. FRI\u2019s final employee had a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Sociology, a term of service with the United States Army Reserves, and leadership experience in a cadet organization. But, as with the other employees, no evidence proved her background met the definition of \u201cclinical experience\u201d sufficient to be deemed a QMHP.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>FRI had the burden of proving the qualifications of each employee. Given the paucity of evidence presented by FRI, we cannot hold the record as a whole compels a \u201creasonable mind\u201d to <em>\u201cnecessarily </em>come to a different conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boone, </em>52 Va.App. at 62, 660 S.E.2d at 708 (emphasis in original) (citation omitted). As we have said before, \u201cDMAS possesses the requisite experience and competence necessary to determine the reimbursement due qualified providers for their reasonable costs incurred while delivering health care services.\u201d <em>Fralin v. Kozlowski, </em>18 Va.App. 697, 701, 447 S.E.2d 238, 241 (1994). None of DMAS\u2019s findings in this case shake our confidence in this principle of factfinding deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">In short, DMAS did not enforce unwritten documentation requirements by simply noting the presence or absence of written evidence offered in support of FRI\u2019s claim that all four employees were qualified as QMHPs. Nor did DMAS act irrationally by determining that FRI did not establish their qualifications by a preponderance of the evidence. We thus affirm the circuit court\u2019s judgment upholding DMAS\u2019s final agency decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b813-6\">. The audit, informal factfinding conference, and formal review by the administrative hearing officer preceded the final agency decision issued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>by the Acting Director of DMAS. <em>See generally Beverly Health &amp; Rehab. </em>v. <em>Metcalf, </em>24 Va.App. <em>584, </em>588-89, 484 S.E.2d 156, 158-59 (1997) (describing DMAS's administrative appeal process). In this case, the Acting Director of DMAS accepted some of the hearing officer\u2019s recommended conclusions and rejected others. Under settled principles, \"the recommendation of a hearing officer is just that\u2014a recommendation, and the DMAS director may reexamine all of the hearing officer's conclusions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 591, 484 S.E.2d at 160. Under VAPA, courts review only the final agency decision. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 2.2-4027; <em>see also Avante at Roanoke v. Finnerty, </em>56 Va.App. 190, 197, 692 S.E.2d 277, 280 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b814-5\">. Over DMAS\u2019s objection, the court later signed a \u201cWritten Statement in Lieu of Transcript\u201d drafted primarily by FRI. App. at 318-19. The written statement said the court \"agreed\u201d with FRI\u2019s assertion that \"DMAS' failure to accept \u2018on the job\u2019 clinical experience as \u2018clinical experience' toward reaching qualification as a QMHP is inappropriate because it enforces an unwritten standard for which the provider had no notice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 319. Inexplicably, the written statement goes on to say: \"The Court did not rule, but necessarily following the Court\u2019s holding that DMAS could not enforce 'unwritten rules' denying 'on the job\u2019 experience as satisfying the requisite 'clinical experience\u2019 criteria, DMAS cannot demand recoupment for those services provided by clinicians that satisfied the criteria for QMHP(s) during the audit period beginning on the date that the QMHP criteria was [sic] satisfied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Two of the four workers, the statement concluded, \"satisfied the criteria of a QMHP during the audit period.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">For reasons expressed later in our opinion, <em>see infra </em>at 773-74, we look solely to the court\u2019s final order as the best evidence of its ruling. <em>See McMillion v.

As FRI concedes on appeal, however, the hearing officer reviewed each worker\u2019s employment record while at FRI for any evidence of <em>bona fide </em>clinical experience. <em>See </em>Oral Argument Audio at 10:24 to 10:34. Except for disagreeing with the hearing officer\u2019s conclusion with respect to one of the four workers, DMAS\u2019s final agency decision adopted the hearing officer\u2019s view that on-the-job training, if proven, could satisfy the clinical experience requirement.
