Specifically, appellant contends that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence failed, as a matter of law, to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>cartridges found on his person contained a propellant. For the reasons stated, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">On February 13, 2011, Richmond Police Officer Robert Kleinholz arrested appellant. While conducting a lawful search pursuant to that arrest, the officer discovered two bullets and two empty shell casings in appellant\u2019s coat.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">At trial, Kleinholz qualified as an expert in the subject of firearms and ammunition. He identified the two bullets as a .357 Magnum in poor condition and a .32 Smith &amp; Wesson in better condition. He described both bullets as \u201c[t]wo complete bullets or pieces of ammunition,\u201d intended to be fired from guns.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">On cross-examination, Officer Kleinholz stated he could not say with one hundred percent accuracy that the bullets contained gunpowder, but he said he would expect that they did have gunpowder inside them. Kleinholz did not scientifically test the bullets nor attempt to shoot them from a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">On cross-examination, Kleinholz described a cartridge as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-10\">A. You have a primer of different sizes, depending on the type of casing. And so then you would have the brass casing normally, but they do make them in nickel. And then you have the bullet stuck on the end and usually you have a propellant of gunpowder. And that\u2019s what my training, and everything I\u2019ve ever read, would suggest to me, although I\u2019ve never personally assembled ammunition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-11\">Q. That\u2019s what\u2019s inside of a cartridge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-12\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-13\">Q. And two of those are complete cartridges?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-14\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-15\">The trial court, in denying appellant\u2019s motion to strike, found that, based on Kleinholz\u2019s expert testimony, it \u201cwould <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>have to speculate to believe this bullet or the two bullets had no propellant inside.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">At the hearing on appellant\u2019s motion to reconsider, the trial court pointed to the language in Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(D) that used the word \u201cor,\u201d rather than \u201cand,\u201d in defining \u201cammunition for a firearm.\u201d The trial court concluded \u201cthere is still no law that states a propellant is necessary when the statute specifically says \u2018or propellant,\u2019 \u2018primer or propellant.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">Appellant contends Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(D) requires proof that the cartridge contains a propellant and that there is no proof of that element in this case. Appellant\u2019s sufficiency argument requires statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) prohibits any person convicted of a felony to knowingly and intentionally possess any firearm or ammunition for a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(D) provides: \u201cAmmunition for a firearm means the combination of a cartridge, projectile, primer, or propellant designed for use in a firearm other than an antique as defined in \u00a7 18.2-308.2:2.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-11\">Appellant only challenges the proof of whether the bullets contained a propellant. He does not argue that the evidence was not sufficient to prove a cartridge, projectile, or primer. Appellant contends that although the statutory language is disjunctive, i.e. \u201ccartridge, projectile, primer <em>or </em>propellant,\u201d we must read the statute to be conjunctive, i.e. \u201cand a projectile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-12\">An issue of statutory interpretation is a pure question of law. <em>Northern Virginia Real Estate v. Martins, </em>283 Va. 86, 102-03, 720 S.E.2d 121, 129 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-13\">While we acknowledge that \u201cpenal statutes are to be strictly construed against the Commonwealth, courts are nevertheless bound by the plain meaning of unambiguous statuto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>ry language and \u2018may not assign a construction that amounts to holding that the General Assembly did not mean what it actually has stated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gunn v.

Commonwealth, </em>265 Va. 268, 271, 576 S.E.2d 468, 470 (2003)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-5\">Where bound by the plain meaning of the language used, we are not permitted \u201cto add or to subtract the words used in the statute.\u201d <em>Posey v. Commonwealth, </em>123 Va. 551, 553, 96 S.E. 771, 771 (1918).

Town &amp; Country Properties, Inc., </em>240 Va. 292, 295, 396 S.E.2d 672, 674 (1990).

In giving reasonable effect to every word, we presume the legislature used the word in its ordinary sense in the absence of a specific, statutory definition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-6\"><em>Coles v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 549, 557-58, 605 S.E.2d 784, 788 (2004) (other citation omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-7\">Moreover, \u201c[o]nly when a \u2018penal statute is unclear\u2019 do courts apply the rule of lenity and strictly construe the statute in the criminal defendant\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>De\u2019Armond v.

Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 210, 214, 495 S.E.2d 822, 825 (1998)). \u201c[T]he rule of lenity serves only to resolve genuine, plausible ambiguities and \u2018does not abrogate the well recognized canon that a statute ... should be read and applied so as to accord with the purpose intended and attain the objects desired if that may be accomplished without doing harm to its language.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 35, 624 S.E.2d at 321 (quoting <em>Cartwright v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 368, 372, 288 S.E.2d 491, 493 (1982)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-8\"><em>Chapman v. Commonwealth, </em>56 Va.App. 725, 732-33, 697 S.E.2d 20, 24 (2010); <em>see also De\u2019Armond, </em>51 Va.App. at 35, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number><em>654 </em>S.E.2d at <em>321 (\u201cAnd </em>the \u2018mere possibility of articulating a narrower construction\u2019 does not by itself make the rule of lenity applicable. Nor can the rule be \u2018invoked by a grammatical possibility\u2019 that raises a manifestly \u2018implausible reading\u2019 of the legislative purpose____Despite the rule of lenity, \u2018courts are nevertheless bound by the plain meaning of unambiguous statutory language and \u2018may not assign a construction that amounts to holding that the General Assembly did not mean what it actually has stated.\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">In enacting Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(D), the General Assembly chose to use the disjunctive \u201cor,\u201d not the conjunctive \u201cand.\u201d \u201c \u2018[T]he use of the disjunctive word \u201cor,\u201d rather than the conjunctive \u201cand,\u201d signifies the availability of alternative choices.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rose v. Commonwealth, </em>53 Va.App. 505, 514, 673 S.E.2d 489, 493 (2009) (quoting <em>Lewis v. Commonwealth, </em>267 Va. 302, 314-15, 593 S.E.2d 220, 227 (2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">Here, the disjunctive term \u201cor\u201d separates the terms \u201cprimer\u201d and \u201cpropellant,\u201d meaning that primer and propellant are alternate requirements of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(D)\u2019s definition of \u201cammunition for a firearm,\u201d such that the Commonwealth need only prove a combination of any of those elements set forth in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">Essentially, appellant asks this Court to substitute the word \u201cand\u201d for \u201cor,\u201d claiming the definition of ammunition is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 is penal in nature and therefore must be construed strictly against the Commonwealth. Any ambiguity or reasonable doubt as to its meaning must be resolved in appellant\u2019s favor. <em>See Ansell v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 759, 761, 250 S.E.2d 760, 761 (1979). <em>However, </em>this rule of statutory interpretation does not allow an appellate court to reword the plain meaning of the statute. \u201c \u2018[C]ourts are not permitted to rewrite statutes. This is a legislative function. The manifest intention of the legislature, clearly disclosed by its language, must be applied. There can be no departure from the words used where the intention is clear.\u2019 \u201d <em>Supinger v. Stakes, 255 </em>Va. 198, 206, 495 S.E.2d 813, 817 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>(1998) (quoting <em>Anderson v. Commonwealth, </em>182 Va. 560, 566, 29 S.E.2d 838, 841 (1944)).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Nevertheless, appellant contends the literal acceptance of the word \u201cor\u201d in Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(D) is ambiguous when considered with the body of law that establishes the requirements to prove what constitutes a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Appellant argues that Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 is ambiguous because it is unclear from a reading of the entire statute whether ammunition must contain a propellant. In support of his argument, appellant cites <em>USAA Casualty Ins. Co. v. Alexander, </em>248 Va. 185, 194, 445 S.E.2d 145, 150 (1994), in which the Supreme Court of Virginia held that because the provisions of Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(A) and (B), when read together, were ambiguous, they would interpret them under settled rules of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">\u201c[T]he province of [statutory] construction lies wholly within the domain of ambiguity, and that which is plain needs no interpretation.\u201d <em>Winston v. City of Richmond, </em>196 Va. 403, 407, 83 S.E.2d 728, 731 (1954). \u201cLanguage is ambiguous when it may be understood in more than one way, or simultaneously refers to two or more things. If the language is difficult to comprehend, is of doubtful import, or lacks clearness and definiteness, an ambiguity exists.\u201d <em>Lee-Warren v. School Bd. of Cumberland County, </em>241 Va. 442, 445, 403 S.E.2d 691, 692 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">Appellant also cites <em>Armstrong v. Commonwealth, </em>263 Va. 573, 562 S.E.2d 139 (2002), to support his ambiguity argument. There, the Supreme Court of Virginia defined a firearm under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 as an \u201cinstrument which was designed, made, and intended to expel a projectile by means of an explosion. It is not necessary that the Commonwealth prove the instrument was \u2018operable/ \u2018capable\u2019 of being fired, or had the \u2018actual capacity to do serious harm.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 584, 562 S.E.2d at 145. Appellant concludes from this definition that the cartridge must contain a propellant because without the propellant (gunpowder), the bullet cannot fire a projectile.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Appellant argues a reading of both Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) and the definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d provided in <em>Armstrong </em>implies that ammunition must contain a propellant, but that Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(D) might suggest that propellant is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\"><em>Armstrong </em>states that the General Assembly, in enacting Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, determined that \u201ccertain individuals\u2014felons\u2014are unfit to possess firearms [including ammunition].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 582, 562 S.E.2d at 144. Thus, appellant argues, it is reasonable to infer that the legislature\u2019s concern was with the ability of felons to use dangerous weapons and that in order to be effectively used to make a firearm dangerous, a bullet must be capable of firing a projectile.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">However, we read <em>Armstrong </em>to support the trial court\u2019s findings in this case. <em>Armstrong </em>only requires the firearm to be \u201cdesigned, made, and intended to expel a projectile by means of an explosion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The firearm need not be operable. Equally, Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 defines \u201cammunition for a firearm\u201d as the \u201ccombination of a cartridge, projectile, primer, or propellant designed for use in a firearm.\u201d Appellant\u2019s ambiguity argument is essentially that because the bullet has no propellant, it is incapable of being fired. This \u201coperability\u201d argument has been rejected by <em>Armstrong </em>and its progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">The definition of firearm in <em>Armstrong </em>and the language in Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(D) emphasize the design of the firearm or ammunition. Appellant does not argue the bullets in question were not designed for use in a firearm. He merely argues that the evidence did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the bullets found in his coat contained a propellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">Here, the unchallenged evidence is that the bullets consisted of a combination of a cartridge, projectile, and primer.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">We are mindful of a rule of statutory construction that states: \u201c[Wjhenever it is necessary to effectuate the obvious intention of the legislature, disjunctive words may be construed as conjunctive, and <em>vice versa.\u201d South East Public Service Corp. v. Commonwealth, </em>165 Va. 116, 122, 181 S.E. 448, 450 (1935). However, the Supreme Court of Virginia tempered that rule by stating that \u201c[w]hen, <em>and only when, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>necessary to effectuate the obvious intention of the legislature, conjunctive words may be construed as disjunctive, and <em>vice versa.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). Thus, our inquiry is whether, in order to \u201ceffectuate the obvious intent of the legislature,\u201d we must substitute the conjunctive \u201cand\u201d for the disjunctive \u201cor.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">We must look to the intention of the legislature in enacting Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. The Supreme Court of Virginia has compared the conduct proscribed by Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, which we have already discussed, with that of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, and opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-6\">The purpose of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 ... is [not only] to deter violent criminal conduct ... but also ... to discourage criminal conduct that produces fear of physical harm. Such fear of harm results just as readily from employment of an instrument that gives the appearance of having a firing capability as from use of a weapon that actually has the capacity to shoot a projectile. The victim of a crime can be intimidated as much by a revolver that does not fire bullets as by one that does.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-7\"><em>Holloman v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 196, 198, 269 S.E.2d 356, 358 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">The legislature intended to keep firearms and ammunition out of the hands of felons. Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(D) requires the ammunition to be designed for use in a firearm. <em>Armstrong </em>defines a firearm as \u201can instrument which was designed, made, or intended to expel a projectile by means of an explosion.\u201d The emphasis in both definitions is the design, and not the operability, of the firearm or ammunition.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">Clearly, a bullet designed for use in a firearm does not need to be operable, i.e. to be capable of firing a round by the use of a propellant. If a bullet was so designed, one could remove the gunpowder, but the design would remain the same, and the bullet would still be governed by Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>We find nothing in the statute that indicates it was the \u201cobvious intention of the legislature\u201d that the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d was intended to mean \u201cand.\u201d To the contrary, such an interpretation of the definition of ammunition, i.e. the inclusion of a propellant, makes operability a required element. To find such is contrary to <em>Armstrong\u2019s </em>definition of a firearm and contrary to the Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(D) definition. Further, Officer Kleinholz testified, without objection, that a cartridge consists of a metal casing, a bullet, and usually a propellant of gunpowder. He described the two cartridges in evidence as complete cartridges. The trial court found, based on this testimony, it would have to speculate to believe the cartridges had no propellant inside. The officer\u2019s testimony supported the trial court\u2019s finding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">We conclude the legislature intended that \u201cor\u201d should have its ordinary meaning, and we therefore may not construe this disjunctive term as the conjunctive \u201cand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Appellant did not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence that the ammunition contained a combination of a cartridge, a projectile, and a primer. Therefore, because we find that proof is not necessary that the bullet also contained a propellant, we conclude the trial court did not err in convicting appellant of possession of ammunition for a firearm by a felon. We remand solely for correction of the clerical error, pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-428(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">\n<em>Affirmed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b48-12\">. We note the sentencing order recites the offense as \u201cconcealment of a weapon by convicted felon.\u201d Other orders also referred to the charge as \"concealment.\u201d However, the indictment charged that appellant did \"unlawfully and feloniously, knowingly and intentionally possess or transport ammunition for a firearm as defined in \u00a7 18.2-308.2(D) of the Code of Virginia after having been convicted of a felony, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-308.2 of the Code of Virginia (1950) as amended.\u201d Appellant was arraigned and pled <em>not </em>guilty to possession of ammunition for a firearm by a convicted felon.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-13\">We remand solely for the purpose of correcting the various orders to reflect that he was charged and convicted of possession, not concealment, of ammunition for a firearm by a felon.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b56-9\">.
