On appeal, he contends the trial court erred in admitting evidence of two prior Maryland convictions for robbery because these convictions were not for offenses \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to those listed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1. We agree. Thus, we reverse appellant\u2019s convictions for robbery, a third or subsequent offense under that code section, and remand for a new trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Appellant robbed two different banks in Spotsylvania County in November 2010 and was apprehended while fleeing from the scene of the second robbery. After being arrested and advised of his rights pursuant to <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), appellant confessed to the second robbery and also said he had served time in Maryland for \u201cprior robberies.\u201d The bank tellers in both Spotsylvania County robberies identified appellant as the perpetrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">Appellant was indicted for two counts of robbery, third or subsequent offense. The Commonwealth notified appellant of its intent to rely on two prior Maryland convictions for robbery to prove the predicate offenses. Appellant moved to exclude the prior Maryland convictions, but the trial court ruled the records of those convictions would be admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">At trial, the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence proved appellant committed the two charged Spotsylvania County robberies. The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence also established that appellant was convicted in Maryland in 1983 for the 1982 robbery of a movie theater manager, against whom he used a \u201cdangerous and deadly weapon\u201d to steal $3,500 in U.S. currency. It also proved appellant was convicted in Maryland in 1992 for the 1992 robbery of a McDonald\u2019s employee, against whom he used a \u201cdangerous and deadly weapon\u201d to steal $2,000 in U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>currency. Based on that evidence, appellant was convicted of robbery, a third or subsequent offense, and pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1, he was sentenced to a mandatory term of imprisonment for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">Following appellant\u2019s conviction and sentencing, he noted the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Generally, \u201c[w]e review a circuit court\u2019s decision to admit or exclude evidence under an abuse of discretion standard and, on appeal, will not disturb [that] decision ... absent a finding of abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>Herndon v. Commonwealth, </em>280 Va. 138, 143, 694 S.E.2d 618, 620 (2010). However, \u201c \u2018[a circuit] court by definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.... The abuse-of-discretion standard includes review to determine that the discretion was not guided by erroneous legal conclusions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Porter v. Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 203, 260, 661 S.E.2d 415, 445 (2008) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 100, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 2047-48, 135 L.Ed.2d 392, 414 (1996)). Therefore, to the extent admissibility rests upon the interpretation of a statute, that interpretation is a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>Crawford v. Commonwealth, </em>281 Va. 84, 97, 704 S.E.2d 107, 115 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Appellant was convicted and sentenced pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1, which provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-8\">Any person convicted of two or more separate acts of violence ... and who has been at liberty ... between each conviction, shall, upon conviction of a third or subsequent act of violence, be sentenced to life imprisonment and shall not have all or any portion of the sentence suspended, provided it is admitted, or found by the jury or judge before whom he is tried, that he has been previously convicted of two or more such acts of violence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1(A). The statute further provides that \u201c[f]or the purposes of this section, <em>\u2018act of violence </em>\u2019 means[, <em>inter </em>alia,] ... [r]obbery under \u00a7 18.2-58.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>297.1(A)(i)(e). Finally, the statute provides that necessary predicate convictions \u201cshall include convictions under the laws of any state or of the United States for any offense <em>substantially similar </em>to those listed under \u2018acts of violence\u2019 if such offense would be a felony if committed in the Commonwealth.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1(B) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">No Virginia appellate court has previously determined what qualifies as an offense \u201csubstantially similar to those listed under \u2018acts of violence\u2019 \u201d for purposes of Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1. However, \u201c[t]he validity of using other Code sections as interpretive guides is well established. The Code of Virginia constitutes a single body of law, and other sections can be looked to where the same phraseology is employed.\u201d <em>King v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 708, 710, 347 S.E.2d 530, 531 (1986). Therefore, in determining what this \u201csubstantially similar\u201d language means in Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1, we consider how this same language in other statutes has been interpreted. \u201cFinally, a court must strictly construe a penal statute against the Commonwealth and limit its application to cases falling clearly within the statute.\u201d <em>Courtney v. Commonwealth, </em>281 Va. 363, 369, 706 S.E.2d 344, 347 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Virginia\u2019s appellate courts have set out several salient principles relevant to our analysis of whether the offense of robbery in Maryland is substantially similar to the offense of robbery in Virginia. First, the Commonwealth bears the burden of proving an out-of-state conviction was obtained under laws substantially similar to those of the Commonwealth. <em>Shinault v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 269, 271, 321 S.E.2d 652, 654 (1984). If the Commonwealth shows substantial similarity, the burden shifts to the defendant to produce \u201cevidence of dissimilarity.\u201d <em>Rufty v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 836, 839, 275 S.E.2d 584, 586 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Proving substantial similarity between two states\u2019 laws requires showing more than \u201ca general likeness.\u201d <em>Shinault, </em>228 Va. at 271, 321 S.E.2d at 654. However, the laws need not be substantially similar \u201cin every respect.\u201d <em>Cox v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 328, 330-31 <em>&amp; </em>n. 2, 411 S.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>444, 445-46 &amp; n. 2 (1991) (holding Code \u00a7 18.2-270\u2019s requirement of \u201csubstantial[ ] similarity]\u201d is <em>\u201cessentially the same </em>\u201d as \u201csubstantial ] conformity]\u201d required by the habitual offender provisions of Code \u00a7 46.2-351 and applying substantial similarity decisions to decide a substantial conformity case (emphasis added)); <em>see also Turner v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 851, 860 n. 4, 568 S.E.2d 468, 472 n. 4 (2002) (recognizing Virginia case law has equated substantial similarity and substantial conformity and applying the test in <em>Cox, </em>which involved an issue of substantial conformity, to decide a substantial similarity case). \u201cIn making this determination, we look to the elements of the two [offenses] rather than to the offender\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Ayers, </em>17 Va.App. 401, 402, 437 S.E.2d 580, 581 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Key to our analysis here is the established principle that a crime in another state is not \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to the most closely corresponding crime under Virginia law if the other state\u2019s law \u201cpermits convictions for acts which could not be the basis for convictions under [the Virginia law at issue].\u201d <em>Cox, </em>13 Va.App. at 330-31, 333, 411 S.E.2d at 446, <em>quoted with approval in Turner, </em>38 Va.App. at 860-62, 568 S.E.2d at 472-73 (holding the crime of housebreaking in violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) was not \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to any relevant Virginia statute because \u201ca person could be convicted of \u2018Housebreaking\u2019 under the UCMJ without evidence of elements indispensable to violations of [the relevant Virginia statutes]\u201d). <em>Compare Medici v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 223, 230, 532 S.E.2d 28, 32 (2000) (\u201c[W]e need only compare the Virginia rape statute with the subsection of the California statute under which Medici was charged and convicted.\u201d), <em>overruled on other grounds, </em>270 Va. 325, 333, 619 S.E.2d 71, 76 (2005), <em>with Cox, </em>13 Va.App. at 331, 411 S.E.2d at 446 (in applying the elements test to a prior conviction under a city ordinance, holding that if the record of the prior conviction \u201cdoes not identify the specific [subdivision] of the ordinance,\u201d the court \u201cmust examine the entire [ordinance] to see if it permits convictions not permitted under [the Virginia statute]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>For example, another state\u2019s DUI statute is not substantially similar to Virginia\u2019s where Virginia\u2019s contains a rebuttable presumption of intoxication based on blood alcohol content, and the other state\u2019s statute contains a conclusive presumption based on that same information. <em>Shinault, </em>228 Va. at 271-72, 321 S.E.2d at 654; <em>see Cox, </em>13 Va.App. at 329, 331, 411 S.E.2d at 445, 446 (holding a West Virginia DUI ordinance was \u201csubstantially broader [than the related Virginia statute], encompassing additional offenses,\u201d and, thus, that it was not substantially conforming). Because the defendant could have been convicted, under the other state\u2019s statute, of behavior which would not have been a crime in Virginia, the other statute is not substantially similar. <em>Cox, </em>13 Va.App. at 330-31, 411 S.E.2d at 446; <em>see Turner, </em>38 Va.App. at 860-62, 568 S.E.2d at 472-73; <em>see also United States v. Thomas, </em>367 F.3d 194, 197-99 (4th Cir.2004) (reaching the same conclusion under the Assimilative Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13, \u201cwhich assimilated Virginia\u2019s DWI statutes\u201d in a fourth-offense \u201cDWI\u201d case committed on federal property in Virginia, because the Maryland statute under which the appellant sustained his three prior convictions, like the North Carolina statute in <em>Shinault, </em>involved a conclusive presumption rather than a rebuttable one like Virginia\u2019s); <em>cf. State v. Rajo, </em>245 P.3d 219, 220-21 &amp; n. 3 (Utah Ct.App.2010) (holding that in \u201cthe inverse of the <em>Thomas </em>[situation]\u201d\u2014where the in-state DUI statute under which the defendant was convicted was broader than the out-of-state statute, such that the defendant <em>could </em>have been convicted in-state for the behavior which resulted in his out-of-state conviction\u2014the statutes were substantially similar for purposes of sentencing enhancement); <em>State v. Schmoll, </em>144 Idaho 800, 172 P.3d 555, 559 n. 1 (Idaho Ct.App.2007) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">We consider appellant\u2019s 1983 and 1992 Maryland convictions for robbery with a deadly weapon in light of these principles. In Virginia, the offense of robbery is a common law crime. <em>E.g., Commonwealth v. Jones, </em>267 Va. 284, 286, 591 S.E.2d 68, 70 (2004). Robbery was also a wholly common law crime in Maryland at the time of appellant\u2019s commission of, and conviction for, the relevant predicate offenses in that state. <em>E.g., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number><em>Smith v. State, </em>412 Md. 150, 155 n. 1, 985 A.2d 1204, 1207 n. 1 (2009).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Virginia defines robbery as \u201c \u2018the taking, with intent to steal, of the personal property of another, from his person or in his presence, against his will, by violence or intimidation.\u2019 \u201d <em>George v. Commonwealth, </em>242 Va. 264, 277, 411 S.E.2d 12, 20 (1991) (quoting <em>Pierce v. Commonwealth, </em>205 Va. 528, 582, 138 S.E.2d 28, 31 (1964)). Maryland defines the common law component of robbery as \u201c \u2018the felonious taking and carrying away of the personal property of another, from his person or in his presence, by violence, or by putting him in fear.\u2019 \u201d <em>Darby v. State, </em>3 Md.App. 407, 413, 239 A.2d 584, 588 (Md.Ct.Spec.App.1968) (quoting William L. Clark &amp; William L. Marshall, <em>A Treatise on the Law of Crimes </em>\u00a7 12.09, at 781 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>(Melvin F. Wingersky ed., 6th ed.1958)). In both states, the punishment for robbery is statutory. <em>E.g., </em>Va.Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-58, 19.2-297.1; <em>Darby, </em>3 Md.App. at 411-13, 239 A.2d at 588 (citing Md.Code Ann.Crim. Law \u00a7 486). Both states also include robbery with a deadly weapon as a species of robbery. <em>See </em>Va.Code \u00a7 18.2-58; Md.Code Ann.Crim. Law \u00a7 488; <em>Darby, </em>3 Md.App. at 411-15, 239 A.2d at 588-89 (indicating \u201cthe crime was robbery [at common law] whether or not the violence or putting in fear was by means of a dangerous or deadly weapon\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Appellant concedes on brief that Maryland\u2019s basic definition of robbery is \u201csimilar\u201d to Virginia\u2019s. He nevertheless contends a distinct difference exists in the development of the common law in these two states which prevents the offense of robbery in Maryland from being \u201csubstantially similar,\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1, to the offense of robbery in Virginia. He points to the requirement of Virginia law that the intent to steal must have existed before or at the time the force or violence was used. He contends Maryland law, by contrast, does not require that the intent to steal precede or co-exist with the violence. Instead, he argues, it permits a conviction for robbery even if the intent to steal is formed only <em>after </em>the force or violence, as an \u201cafterthought,\u201d as long as it occurs as part of the same general events and coexists with the later taking. We agree with appellant\u2019s claim that the offenses are not substantially similar, such that reversal of his convictions is required.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">In Virginia, the common law makes clear that proof of an intent to steal which arises merely as an afterthought to the application of force, rather than prior to or concurrently with it, is insufficient to prove robbery. In <em>Branch v. Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number><em>wealth, </em>225 Va. 91, 300 S.E.2d 758 (1983), the Court noted \u201ca temporal correlation among the[ ] elements\u201d of robbery and held \u201cthe offense is not robbery unless the [intent to steal] was conceived <em>before or at the time </em>the violence was committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 94-95, 300 S.E.2d at 759 (emphasis added). Because the evidence in <em>Branch </em>\u201cnegate[d] any inference that [the defendant] had conceived an intent to rob at the time he shot his victim,\u201d for which he was convicted of second-degree murder, the Court held the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to support his conviction for robbery. <em>Id. </em>at 93, 95-96, 300 S.E.2d at 758, 760.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">We applied the holding of <em>Branch </em>in <em>Shepperson v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 586, 454 S.E.2d 5 (1995), which involved a first-degree murder conviction, ruling that \u201c[i]f [the defendant] killed [the victim] intending to steal his property, the theft was robbery. If [the defendant] killed [the victim] only for a purpose unrelated to theft, and <em>as an afterthought </em>decided to steal his property, the theft was larceny.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 592, 454 S.E.2d at 8 (emphasis added) (citing <em>Branch, </em>225 Va. at 95-96, 300 S.E.2d at 759-60).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">In Maryland, by contrast, the state\u2019s highest court has repeatedly made clear that \u201c[i]f the force precedes the taking, the intent to steal need not coincide with the force.\u201d <em>Stebbing v. State, </em>299 Md. 331, 356, 473 A.2d 903, 915 (1984). That court has expressly adopted \u201cthe majority rule,\u201d which it described as providing that robbery does not \u201c \u2018require ... the defendant\u2019s violence-or-intimidation acts be done for the very purpose of taking the victim\u2019s property\u2019 \u201d and that it is \u201c \u2018enough that he takes advantage of a situation which he created for some other purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 353-54, 473 A.2d at 914 (quoting Wayne R. LaFave &amp; Austin W. Scott, <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 94, at 701-02 (1972)). <em>See generally </em>3 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Substantive Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 20.3(e), at 191-93 (2d ed.2003 &amp; Supp.2012-2013) (discussing common law positions regarding \u201cafterthought\u201d robbery and the impact of statutory modifications). Applying these principles in <em>Stebbing, </em>the court held that even \u201cif the evidence in the instant case compelled the conclusion that [the defendant\u2019s] intent in sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>duing and choking [the victim] was <em>only </em>to assist in rape and sodomy, and that the intent to steal was not formed until <em>after </em>the force had resulted in [the victim\u2019s] death, the taking and asportation of [the victim\u2019s] belongings would still be robbery.\u201d 299 Md. at 352-53, 473 A.2d at 913-14 (emphases added); <em>see also Ball v. State, </em>347 Md. 156, 189, 699 A.2d 1170, 1185 (1997) (characterizing <em>Stebbing </em>as holding that the \u201ctaking and asportation of property constitutes robbery even where [the] intent to steal is not formed until after [the] application of force resulting in death\u201d). The court clarified further that it did not link its decision on this issue to the fact that the case involved a murder. <em>Stebbing, </em>299 Md. at 356, 473 A.2d at 915. To the contrary, the court observed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-5\">[T]here must be an intent to steal at the time of the taking. If the force precedes the taking, the intent to steal need not coincide with the force. It is sufficient if there be force followed by a taking with intent to steal as part of the same general occurrence or episode. <em>Even if </em>the force results in death, a taking and asportation after death is nevertheless robbery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-6\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). In so stating, the court made clear that the offense is robbery <em>whether or not </em>the force results in death.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Applying these principles again in <em>Metheny v. State, </em>359 Md. 576, 755 A.2d 1088 (2000), Maryland\u2019s highest court specifically referred to the occurrence as an \u201cafterthought\u201d robbery, explaining as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-8\"><em>Stebbing </em>is an exception to the general requirement that the intent to commit a crime accompany a forbidden act. This [\u201cafterthought\u201d] exception ... is justified, in part, because a felon who applies force to neutralize a victim should be held responsible for that action if the felon <em>later </em>decides to take advantage of the situation by robbing the victim. In essence, we have allowed, in such circumstances, for a constructive concurrence of the force and intent to steal at the time of the taking.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 606, 617-19, 755 A.2d at 1105, 1111 (emphasis added) (citation omitted). The court therefore affirmed the robbery conviction of the defendant, who raped and killed the victim, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>buried the body, and then \u201cburied her clothing and purse at a separate location.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Allen v. State, </em>158 Md.App. 194, 241-42, 857 A.2d 101, 129 (Md.Ct.Spec.App.2004) (discussing Metheny), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>387 Md. 389, 875 A.2d 724 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">These cases confirm appellant\u2019s assertion that the crime of robbery in Maryland is not \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to the crime of robbery in Virginia. In Maryland, in cases not involving capital or felony murder, a defendant can be convicted of an afterthought robbery.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Allen, </em>158 Md.App. at 241-42, 857 A.2d at 129; <em>Metheny, </em>359 Md. at 606, 617-19, 755 A.2d at 1105, 1111; <em>Stebbing, </em>299 Md. at 356, 473 A.2d at 915.

Thus, based on a comparison of the elements of the crimes in these two states, appellant could have been convicted in Maryland of behavior which would not have been a crime in Virginia,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which compels the conclusion that the offenses were not substantially similar for purposes of Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1. <em>See Turner, </em>38 Va.App. at 860, 568 S.E.2d at 472; <em>Cox, </em>13 Va.App. at 330-31, 411 S.E.2d at 446.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">For these reasons, we reverse appellant\u2019s convictions for robbery, a third or subsequent offense pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1, and remand for a new trial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b256-9\">. Appellant contends the Maryland conviction documents were inadmissible for three additional reasons: because they (1) constituted testimonial hearsay in violation of his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation; (2) did not constitute orders of conviction under Code \u00a7 19.2-307; and (3) failed to meet the authentication requirements of Code \u00a7 8.01-389. Because we hold the prior Maryland convictions were for crimes not substantially similar to those in Code \u00a7 19.2-297.1 and, thus, were improperly admitted on this ground, we need not consider appellant's other assignments of error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b261-5\">. Although Maryland's highest court continues to define robbery as a common law crime, it recognizes that the state legislature has acted to expand the definition of robbery beyond its common law roots. <em>Smith, </em>412 Md. at 155, n. 1, 985 A.2d at 1207 n. 1; <em>Allen v. State, </em>158 Md.App. 194, 239, 857 A.2d 101, 128 (Md.Ct.Spec.App.2004) (noting statutory robbery offense came into existence as of October 1, 2000), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>387 Md. 389, 875 A.2d 724 (2005); <em>see </em>2000 Md. Laws ch. 288 (in the portion of the code addressing robbery, adding definitions of \"deprive\u201d and \"obtain\u201d) (codified at Md.Code Ann.Crim. Law \u00a7 486(a)); <em>see also </em>2002 Md. Laws ch. 26, \u00a7 2 (recodifying this title of the Maryland Code and clarifying how the 2000 amendments apply to the offense of robbery). The Maryland Code now provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Any\">Robbery.\u2014\"Robbery\u201d retains its judicially determined meaning except that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">(1) robbery includes obtaining the services of another by force or threat of force; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\">(2) robbery requires proof of intent to withhold the property of another:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-8\">(i) permanently;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-9\">(ii) for a period that results in the appropriation of a part of the property\u2019s value;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-10\">(iii) with the purpose to restore it only on payment of a reward or other compensation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-11\">(iv) to dispose of the property or use or deal with the property in a manner that makes it unlikely that the owner will recover it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-12\">Md.Code Ann.Crim. Law \u00a7 3-401(e) (2002). Because this expanded definition of robbery did not take effect until well <em>after </em>appellant\u2019s Maryland convictions for robbery, we evaluate the offense of robbery as it was defined in Maryland <em>prior </em>to that statutory expansion. Unless otherwise specified, all subsequent references to the Maryland Code are to the language of the statutes as they existed during the 1983-to-1992 time frame.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b262-7\">. Although Maryland prescribes a more severe punishment for the commission of robbery with a deadly weapon, <em>compare </em>Md.Code Ann. Crim. Law \u00a7 486 (now \u00a7 3-402), <em>with </em>Md.Code Ann.Crim. Law \u00a7 488 (now \u00a7 3-403), this fact has no substantive impact on our analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b262-8\">. Therefore, we need not consider appellant's claim that the statutes are not substantially similar because Maryland law, in contrast to Virginia law, permits conviction where a defendant uses force or violence merely to retain property already stolen.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b265-6\">. In <em>Metheny </em>and <em>Allen, </em>Maryland\u2019s highest court adopted what it referred to as \"the majority view\u201d with regard to felony and capital murder, holding that a robbery committed merely as an afterthought failed to establish the requisite causal connection to the murder necessary to support a conviction for felony or capital murder. <em>Metheny, </em>359 Md. at 615-20, 628-33, 755 A.2d at 1110-12, 1117-19 (capital murder); <em>see Allen, </em>387 Md. at 398, 400, 875 A.2d at 730, 732 (felony murder).

Neither <em>Pope </em>nor <em>Briley, </em>both of which involved capital murder convictions, supports the position the Commonwealth advances.

It matters not that this rule was not articulated in Maryland\u2019s common law until 1984, the year following appellant's first predicate robbery conviction in that state.
