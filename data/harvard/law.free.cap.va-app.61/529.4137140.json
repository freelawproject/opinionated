Appellant argues on appeal that \u201cthe trial court had no authority to impose 6 months of incarceration as the court had previously imposed only ninety days of incarceration and failed to re-suspend any of that sentence as required under Code \u00a7 19.2-306.\u201d For the following reasons, we affirm the trial court\u2019s order entered on December 5, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b575-14\">On February 22, 2006 appellant pled guilty to one count of felony attempted abduction (Count III), in violation of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-47 and 18.2-26, and one count of felony abduction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>(Count II), in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-47. Appellant also entered a guilty plea pursuant to <em>North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970), on one count of burglary (Count I), in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-90. On July 10, 2006 appellant was sentenced by Judge Stanley P. Klein to twenty years incarceration with eighteen years suspended for Count I, five years incarceration with three years suspended for Count II, and five years incarceration with three years suspended for Count III. The sentences were ordered to run consecutively. Appellant was placed on five years of intensive probation upon his release from incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">On April 15, 2011 appellant was brought before Judge Michael F. Devine on an allegation that he violated the terms of his probation. Appellant admitted the violation, and Judge Devine revoked ninety days of appellant\u2019s previously suspended sentence on Count III. The order did not address the suspended sentences for Counts I and II. The order referred to them only in its summary of appellant\u2019s convictions and sentences. The April 20, 2011 final order reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-6\">In consideration, the Court ORDERED that ninety (90) days of the previously suspended sentence on Count III is revoked and ordered into execution. The Court further ORDERED that ANDREW MCQUAY JACOBS serve ninety (90) days, on Count III, incarceration in the Fairfax Adult Detention Center.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-7\">The Court further ORDERED that the Defendant\u2019s probation is extended to December 31, 2021.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">On November 18, 2011 another probation violation hearing was held before Judge Devine, who found that appellant violated the terms of his probation again. The revocation order, upon which this appeal was brought, was issued on December 5, 2011 and reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-9\">[T]he Court revoked the entirety of the previously suspended sentence on Count I and re-suspended all but six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>(6)[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] of that sentence for a period of five (5) years from today\u2019s date of November 18, 2011.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-5\">The Court further ORDERED that the entirety of the previously suspended sentences on Counts II and III are revoked and the Court re-suspended the entirety of the sentences imposed on Counts II and III for a period of five (5) years from today\u2019s date of November 18, 2011.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-6\">The Court further ORDERED that the Defendant is placed on intensive probation for a period of five (5) years from today\u2019s date of November 18, 2011.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">Appellant argues on appeal that the trial court had no authority to impose six months of active incarceration in its December 5, 2011 revocation order because he claims that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>trial court, in its prior April 20, 2011 revocation order, imposed only ninety days of active incarceration and did not expressly re-suspend any of that sentence (for Count III) or the remaining suspended sentences (for Counts I and II). Appellant asserts that, if the trial court intended to re-suspend any part of appellant\u2019s sentence in the April 20, 2011 revocation order, then Code \u00a7 19.2-306 required the trial court to expressly do so. Thus, appellant contends that, by the time of the November 18, 2011 revocation hearing, there was not any remaining suspended sentence available to be revoked. Consequently, appellant argues that the trial court\u2019s December 5, 2011 revocation order, which resulted from that hearing and which is the basis of this appeal, was erroneous.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">We observe, as an initial matter, that appellant claims that the trial court\u2019s April 20, 2011 revocation order affected his sentences on all three counts\u2014even though the plain language of the April 20, 2011 order only references Count III. Counts I and II are never mentioned in the April 20, 2011 order (except in the summary of the prior history of the case). However, the Attorney General\u2019s brief on appeal to this Court <em>also </em>accepts the premise the April 20, 2011 order implicitly affects the sentences for Counts I and II.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Even if we were to assume without deciding that those sentences are included within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>scope of that order, we conclude that the trial court did not err here.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">In revocation appeals, the trial court\u2019s \u201cfindings of fact and judgment will not be reversed unless there is a clear showing of abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 81, 86, 402 S.E.2d 684, 687 (1991). The evidence is considered in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, as the prevailing party below. <em>See, e.g., Giles v. Commonwealth, </em>277 Va. 369, 375, 672 S.E.2d 879, 883 (2009). To the extent that appellant\u2019s assignment of error raises a question of statutory interpretation, that question is reviewed <em>de novo </em>on appeal. <em>See id. </em>at 373, 672 S.E.2d at 882.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">\n<em>Revocation and Re-suspension of a Sentence under Code \u00a7 19.2-306</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Code \u00a7 19.2-306(0 states, in pertinent part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-7\">If the court, after hearing, finds good cause to believe that the defendant has violated the terms of suspension, then ... (ii) if the court originally suspended the execution of the sentence, the court <em>shall </em>revoke the suspension and the original sentence shall be in full force and effect. The court may again suspend all or any part of this sentence and may place the defendant upon terms and conditions or probation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">Neither the text of Code \u00a7 19.2-306(C) nor the case law interpreting it establishes that the trial court abused its discretion here. We disagree with appellant\u2019s argument that the April 20, 2011 order\u2019s lack of an explicit re-suspension of the balance of the remaining sentence constituted reversible error.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is evident that the trial court implicitly interpreted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>the April 20, 2011 revocation order in its subsequent December 5, 2011 revocation order, showing that the trial court actually intended in its April 20, 2011 order to re-suspend the balance of the remaining available sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">We hold that the trial court\u2019s implicit interpretation of its April 20, 2011 revocation order is not an abuse of discretion, and is supported by this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Leitao v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 435, 573 S.E.2d 317 (2002), which controls the issue before us and provides a framework for our analysis of Code \u00a7 19.2-306(C). As in <em>Leitao, </em>the trial judge here construed its revocation order in the only manner possible\u2014given that a trial court simply lacks any authority to \u201cshorten the original suspended sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 438, 573 S.E.2d at 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">\n<em>The Decision in Leitao</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">In 1996, the trial court sentenced Leitao to six years in prison, suspended all but six months of the sentence, and placed him on probation for two years. <em>Id. </em>at 437, 573 S.E.2d at 318. The trial court later found in 1997 that Leitao violated his probation, revoked his suspended sentence, \u201cordered him to serve 12 months in jail, re-suspended the balance of the sentence, and placed the defendant on probation.\u201d Leitao was found again in 1999 to have violated probation, and the court order \u201crevoked the sentence and probation, ordered him to serve one year of the original sentence, and placed him on probation for two years upon his release.\u201d When Leitao was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>found to have violated probation in 2002, the trial court revoked his suspended sentence and probation and ordered him to serve the balance of the original sentence. <em>Id. </em>Specifically, the trial court stated: \u201cWhen the suspension was revoked\u201d in 1999, \u201cthe sentence would have gone into effect automatically. And then ... the Court placed him back on probation and [by implication] re-suspended the sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 438, 573 S.E.2d at 318-19 (alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">Similar to appellant\u2019s argument here, Leitao argued on appeal to this Court that, because the trial court did not explicitly re-suspend the sentence after revoking the sentence in the 1999 order, there was no suspended sentence in 2002 for the trial court to suspend. <em>Id. </em>at 437-38, 573 S.E.2d at 318. This Court disagreed and \u201cdeferred] to the trial court\u2019s interpretation of its own order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 438, 573 S.E.2d at 319 (citing <em>Fredericksburg Constr. Co. v. J.W. Wyne Excavating, </em>260 Va. 137, 144, 530 S.E.2d 148, 152 (2000); <em>Rusty\u2019s Welding Serv., Inc. v. Gibson, </em>29 Va.App. 119, 129, 510 S.E.2d 255, 260 (1999)). This Court concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in interpreting the 1999 order, reasoning that \u201c[t]he only logical interpretation of the 1999 order is the one the trial court adopted.\u201d <em>Leitao, </em>39 Va.App. at 438, 573 S.E.2d at 319. This Court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANn\">\n<em>The absence of an explicit recitation re-suspending the balance of the original sentence did not implicitly discharge the remaining sentence; it implicitly re-suspended the balance that the defendant had not served.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-5\">\u2756 * * <em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-6\">The 1999 order revoked the suspended sentence, and sentenced the defendant to serve one year of the original sentence. The time not served remained suspended subject to revocation if the defendant violated the terms of probation. When the defendant did violate those terms, the trial court could revoke that suspension and order the defendant to serve the ... balance of his original sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 438-39, 573 S.E.2d at 319 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">Although the circumstances of this case differ somewhat from those in <em>Leitao, </em>in that the trial court here implicitly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>(rather than explicitly) interpreted the intent of the April 20, 2011 revocation order in its subsequent December 5, 2011 revocation order, the distinction between an implicit interpretation and an explicit interpretation certainly is not dispositive here. Consistent with <em>Leitao, </em>the trial court here, in its December 5, 2011 order, gave the \u201conly logical interpretation\u201d of the April 20, 2011 order\u2014i.e., that the April 20, 2011 order brought about the implicit re-suspension of sentence. <em>See id. </em>at 438, 573 S.E.2d at 319. As in <em>Leitao, </em>the \u201conly logical interpretation\u201d of the earlier revocation order is that \u201cthe absence of an explicit recitation re-suspending the balance of the original sentence did not implicitly discharge the remaining sentence; it implicitly re-suspended the balance that the defendant had not served.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">\n<em>Revocation Orders Cannot Simply Negate or Erase Previously Entered Final Sentences</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Appellants argument on appeal here suffers from the same faulty premise that the defendant in <em>Leitao </em>presented. Specifically, appellant\u2019s argument presupposes that the trial court somehow had the authority in its April 20, 2011 order to shorten the length of appellant\u2019s original sentence. This assumption is erroneous and would lead to an absurd interpretation of a trial court\u2019s authority under Code \u00a7 19.2-306. \u201c \u2018[A] statute should never be construed so that it leads to absurd results.\u2019 \u201d <em>Auer v. Commonwealth, </em>46 Va.App. 637, 651, 621 S.E.2d 140, 147 (2005) (quoting <em>Branch v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 836, 839, 419 S.E.2d 422, 424 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">It is plain common sense that, while a trial court has the authority to change the conditions of probation, it does not\u2014as appellant suggests\u2014have the authority to modify an original sentence more than 21 days after the final sentencing order has been entered. <em>See </em>Rule 1:1; <em>cf. </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-303 (providing an exception that is inapplicable here). It would be absurd to hold, as appellant would have us hold, that a trial court can simply erase a sentence that has been entered in a final order, with a single swipe of a pen, merely because the trial judge did not explicitly re-suspend a sentence in an order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>from a revocation hearing. A trial court could not even shorten a final sentence if it wanted to do so\u2014i.e., if the defendant was on especially good behavior.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A trial court certainly cannot shorten a defendant\u2019s sentence by accident\u2014 or because the defendant\u2019s bad behavior has brought him before a court in a revocation proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Simply put, a trial court cannot shorten a defendant\u2019s sentence that has already been meted out regardless of how good his behavior is. Therefore, it would defy all logic for a court to be able to reduce and even wipe out a suspended sentence when the defendant\u2019s bad behavior is the very reason for bringing him back before the court in a revocation proceeding.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">This Court\u2019s decision in <em>Leitao </em>directly addresses this point. This Court in <em>Leitao </em>held that \u201c[cjontrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, the 1999 order <em>could not shorten the original suspended sentence.\u201d </em>Leitao, 39 Va.App. at 438, 573 S.E.2d at 319 (emphasis added) (citing Rule 1:1). <em>See also Alsberry v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 314, 318, 572 S.E.2d 522, 524 (2002) (\u201c[T]he issue at a revocation proceeding is not what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>sentence to impose upon the defendant for his prior criminal conviction, but whether to continue all or any portion of a previously imposed and suspended sentence due to the defendant\u2019s failure to abide by the terms of his probation.\u201d). Likewise, the trial court here could not shorten appellant\u2019s original sentence in the April 20, 2011 order, the December 5, 2011 order, or in any other order entered after the trial court surrendered jurisdiction over the final sentencing order for the underlying offenses that was entered on July 10, 2006. It is clear that \u201c[w]hen a court revokes the suspension of execution of sentence, \u2018the original sentence shall be in full force and effect.\u2019 \u201d <em>Leitao, </em>39 Va.App. at 438, 573 S.E.2d at 319 (quoting Code \u00a7 19.2-306). Thus, we hold that the remaining balance of appellant\u2019s original sentence did not simply disappear when the trial court in the April 20, 2011 order revoked a portion of his suspended sentence and implicitly re-suspended the remainder of the suspended sentence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">\n<em>The Trial Court Properly Interpreted its Order in Light of Controlling Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">In addition, we consider the trial court\u2019s interpretation of its April 20, 2011 order in light of the well-settled principle of law that a \u201cjudge is presumed to know the law and to apply it correctly in each case.\u201d <em>Groves v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 57, 61-62, 646 S.E.2d 28, 30 (2007). Thus, we presume that Judge Devine was aware that the April 20, 2011 revocation order \u201ccould not shorten the original suspended sentence.\u201d <em>Leitao, </em>39 Va.App. at 438, 573 S.E.2d at 319. We also presume that Judge Devine knew the procedure set forth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>in Code \u00a7 19.2-306(C), and applied it, albeit implicitly, by re-suspending the remaining suspended sentence from the original July 10, 2006 order in the April 20, 2011 revocation order.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">In support of this conclusion, we also note that the April 20, 2011 revocation order clearly imposed a probationary period, and at that time there remained a great deal of unserved time from the original sentence. This Court has explained that a probationary period is meaningless without a suspended sentence available for imposition upon a violation of the terms of probation. <em>See Hartless v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 172, 175, 510 S.E.2d 738, 739 (1999) (\u201c[Probation depends for enforceability upon the existence of a term of sentence suspension.\u201d); <em>see also Leitao, </em>39 Va.App. at 438, 573 S.E.2d at 319 (\u201cProbation was meaningless if no sentence remained for the court to impose if the defendant violated the terms imposed.\u201d). Under this Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Hartless </em>and <em>Leitao, </em>the trial court\u2019s decision to order a probationary period would have been utterly meaningless if the trial court did not also intend to impose a suspended sentence in the April 20, 2011 revocation order.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">The trial court did not err when it entered the December 5, 2011 revocation order because its earlier revocation order from April 20, 2011 simply could not have negated any of the original suspended sentences from appellant\u2019s underlying July 2006 convictions. Thus, with time remaining to be served in appellants suspended sentences, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it entered the December 5, 2011 revocation order. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s order entered on December 5, 2011, and remand for the limited purpose of correcting the clerical mistake in that order. <em>See supra </em>at 533 n. 2, 738 S.E.2d at 521 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">\n<em>Affirmed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b577-9\">. There is a scrivener's error in the December 5, 2011 order, which states: \"[T]he Court revoked the entirety of the previously suspended sentence on Count I and re-suspended all but <em>six (6) </em>of that sentence for a period of five (5) years from today\u2019s date of November 18, 2011.\u201d (Emphasis added). The order omitted the word \"months\u201d after \"six (6).\u201d However, it is clear that the trial court intended to state \"six (6) months\u201d because at the probation revocation hearing on November 18, 2011 (from which the December 5, 2011 order resulted), the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-10\">So I don\u2019t know what more motivation I can give you. I gave you 90 days back the last time. <em>This time it\u2019s going to be six, months. </em>I'm going to revoke the entirety of your sentence on the burglary charge. That\u2019s eighteen years. I\u2019m going to revoke the previously suspended three years on the abduction charge. I'm going to revoke the attempt\u2014the prior three years, minus 90 days, on the abduction charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-11\">So I have no-revoked all the time that was previously imposed. <em>I will resuspend all of that time except for six months.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-12\">(Emphasis added). Moreover, the assignment of error granted states: The trial court had no authority to impose <em>six months </em>of incarceration as the court had previously imposed only ninety days of incarceration and failed to re-suspend any of that sentence as required under Virginia Code 19.2-306. (Emphasis added). Accordingly, while we affirm the trial court\u2019s December 5, 2011 order, we also remand this matter for the limited purpose of correcting this clerical mistake. The corrected December 5, 2011 order should state in pertinent part: \"the Court revoked the entirety of the previously suspended sentence on Count I and re-suspended all but six (6) months of that sentence for a period of five (5) years from today\u2019s date of November 18, 2011.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b578-5\">.

Furthermore, the Attorney General's brief also contends that the trial court in the December 5, 2011 order \"rightly determined the April 2011 order re-suspended the remainder of the sentences in Count III <em>and all of the sentences in Counts I and II.\" </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b579-10\">.

As this Court has explained, only the Governor has the authority to pardon or commute sentences:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-8\">The Governor, moreover, has the exclusive constitutional power to \"grant reprieves and pardons\u201d after conviction. <em>See </em>Va.

In addition, the implication of appellant's argument is that, where the trial court issued a final sentencing order, and subsequently revoked the originally suspended sentence for Count III (without expressly ordering the re-suspension of Counts I, II, or III), then not only does the suspended sentence for Count III disappear, but so do the suspended sentences for Counts I and II\u2014which were never even mentioned in the April 20, 2011 revocation order (Counts I and II were only mentioned in that orders summary of the prior history of the case). This is a completely absurd result.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b584-7\">. To hold otherwise would undermine the rehabilitative goals behind the imposition of suspended sentences (by letting some defendants escape accountability mechanisms like supervised probation based on a clerical error) and, further, would make trial courts more reluctant to impose suspended sentences. <em>See Grant v.
