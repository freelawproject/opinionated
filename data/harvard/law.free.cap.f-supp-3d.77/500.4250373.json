Summary.. \u2022 525</p>\n<p id=\"b540-29\">I. Introduction and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b540-30\">1. This multidistrict litigation arises from the April 20, 2010, blowout, explosions, fire, and subsequent oil spill involving the mobile offshore drilling unit DEEPWATER HORIZON (sometimes referred to as \u201cHORIZON\u201d) and the well, known as Macondo, it had drilled in the Gulf of Mexico approximately fifty miles from the Louisiana coast.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-33\">2. Presented here is an abridged version of the procedural history for this mul-tidistrict litigation. The reader is directed to the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law for the Phase One trial (\u201cPhase One Findings\u201d) for a more thorough account of the procedural history.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>3. The Court has' held thus far two major trial proceedings. Further trials are planned, including, a \u201cPenalty Phase\u201d scheduled to begin on January 20, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">4. The \u201cPhase One\u201d trial was held between February 25, 2013 and April 17, 2013 and consisted of twenty-nine trial days. It addressed fault determinations relating to the loss of well control, the ensuing explosion and fire, the sinking of the HORIZON, and the initiation of the release of oil. After the Phase One trial, the parties submitted memoranda, responses, and proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">5. A \u201cPhase Two\u201d trial was then held from September 30, 2013 to October 18, 2013 and consisted of twelve trial days. Phase Two was divided into two segments: \u201cSource Control\u201d and \u201cQuantification.\u201d Source Control concerned issues pertaining to the conduct or omissions relative to stopping the discharge of hydrocarbons. The Quantification segment addressed the amount of oil actually released into the Gulf of Mexico. As with the Phase One trial, the parties submitted post-trial mem-oranda, responses, and proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">6. On September 4, 2014, the Court issued the Phase' One Findings,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which were revised slightly and re-issued on September 9, 2014.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> BP subsequently moved to amend the Phase One Findings or for a new trial, which the Court denied on November 13, 2014.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-14\">7. The Phase One Findings made numerous factual and legal determinations, only a few of which are mentioned here.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-15\">8. With respect to the United States\u2019 action for civil penalties under the Clean Water Act\u2019s (\u201cCWA\u201d)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> against BP Exploration <em>&amp; </em>Production, Inc. (\u201cBPXP\u201d),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the Court found that the discharge of oil was the result of BPXP\u2019s gross negligence and willful misconduct. Consequently, the Court concluded that BPXP was subject to a higher maximum penal amount than would apply in the absence of such conduct. However, the Court did not determine the actual penal amount in the Phase One Findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-16\">9. The Phase One Findings also made fault allocations under general maritime law. The Court attributed 67% of the fault for the blowout, explosion, and oil spill to two BP entities, BPXP and BP America Production Company (\u201cBPAPC\u201d). Transocean (meaning Transocean Holdings LLC, Transocean Deepwater Inc., and Transocean Offshore Deepwater Drilling Inc.) and Halliburton (meaning Halliburton Energy Service, Inc. and Halliburton\u2019s Sperry division) bore 30% and 3% of the fault, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-17\">10. Athough the Phase One Findings found that certain BP employees acted recklessly, which would normally warrant punitive damages under general maritime law, the Court concluded that, under the circumstances, Fifth Circuit precedent barred the imposition of punitive damages against BPXP and BPAPC. The Phase One Findings found that Transocean\u2019s and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>Halliburton\u2019s misconduct did not exceed ordinary negligence; thus, these parties also did not face punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">11. The Court turns now to the issues presented in the Phase Two trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">II. Source Control Segment</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">A. Parties to the Source Control Segment</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">12. The Source Control segment was tried as a bench trial that began on September 30, 2013, and concluded on October 3, 2013. Participants were the \u201cAligned Parties\u201d on one side and the BP entities on the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">13. The Aligned Parties consisted of private plaintiffs and claimants-in-limitation (represented by the Plaintiffs\u2019 Steering Committee or \u201cPSC\u201d), the States of Alabama and Louisiana, the Transocean entities (Transocean Offshore Deepwater Drilling Inc., Transocean Holdings LLC, Transocean Deepwater Inc., and Triton Asset Leasing GmbH), and Halliburton Energy Services, \u00ednc.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">14.

There is no dispute that the source control effort between May and September 2010 was a massive and complex undertaking. BP\u2019s entire Gulf of Mexico resources became focused on the response, which included subsea, surface, and onshore intervention efforts. The response saw collaboration between BP as the designated responsible party, numerous Government agencies, major oil and gas companies such as Exxon, Shell, and Chevron, oil and gas service companies, and members of academia. Ultimately, BP spent over $1.6 billion on source control.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-18\">214. As reflected in the Stipulated Facts, the Macondo well was successfully shut in on July 15, 2010, 86 days after the blowout began on April 20, via a capping stack that was landed on top of the LMRP.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-19\">215. The Aligned Parties contend there were two major flaws relative to source control that delayed the successful capping of the well. First, the Aligned Parties claim that BP consciously disregarded the need to prepare for a subsea blowout in deepwater, despite the foreseeability of such an event. Second, the Aligned Parties assert that BP intentionally misrepresented the rate at which hydrocarbons flowed from the well, which caused decision-makers to attempt source control methods that had no chance of success, namely, Top Kill, while abandoning other methods that were viable, namely, BOP-on-BOP.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-20\">216. The Aligned Parties do not agree entirely over what consequences should flow from these alleged failures. The PSC, Alabama, and Louisiana urge that BP\u2019s source control failures warrant the imposition of punitive damages on BP, including the parent entity, BP p.l.c., particularly when the Phase Two evidence is considered with the Phase One evidence. Transocean and Halliburton argue a different point: that BP\u2019s source control errors made it a superseding cause of the oil spill, which exculpates Transocean and Halliburton of their Phase One liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>217. BP contested all of these positions with counter-evidence and arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">i. <em>BP\u2019s Oil Spill Response Plan</em></p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">218. Federal regulations required that BP, as the leaseholder and designated operator of the Macondo well, submit an oil spill response plan to the MMS for approval.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The plan had to demonstrate that BP could \u201crespond quickly and effectively whenever oil is discharged from [its] facility.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The MMS further required that the plan \u201c[b]riefly describe the general procedures that have been developed and instituted ... to ensure that the source of the discharge is controlled as soon as possible after a spill occurs.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The MMS had to approve BP\u2019s oil spill response plan before drilling operations could commence.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">219. When the blowout occurred, BP had a spill response plan in place that contained more than 500 pages. Nevertheless, this plan said very little about source control for a blowout in deepwater. It focused instead on containment and collection of oil once it reached the surface.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">220. BP\u2019s deepwater source control plan amounted to three points: (1) attempt to shut in the well by using ROVs to activate the DEEPWATER HORIZON\u2019S BOP, (2) drill a relief well, and (3) stand up a team of experts to address the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">221. As Dr. Tony Hayward, the Group CEO of BP p.l.c. at the time of the blowout, explained, BP had identified a subsea deepwater blowout as one of the highest risks for the company.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> BP considered the BOP to be the \u201clast line of defense\u201d against a deepwater blowout.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> In the event the BOP failed to stop a deepwater blowout, BP\u2019s only existing plan to kill a subsea deepwater blowout was to drill a relief well, which could take on the order of three months.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-16\">222. BP did not have access to a pre-built capping stack prior to the blowout. During the response, BP fabricated several intervention techniques including the cofferdam, RITT, numerous top hats, and the capping stack.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-17\">223. The Aligned Parties assert that the evidence reflects that if BP had properly prepared for a deepwater blowout, with a capping stack available on April 20, 2010, the well could have been shut in within 24 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-18\">224. The scientific principles and materials necessary for designing and creating capping stacks were available prior to the HORIZON/Maeondo blowout and known to BP. As BP\u2019s counsel acknowledged during trial, \u201c[W]hile it was feasible and practical to have a type of capping device, for deepwater operations, there were no capping stacks specifically designed for deep-water blowouts.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The technology to build a capping stack was available, and it would have saved time if BP had built or at least planned for a deepwater capping stack prior to the blowout.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A2o\">225. Nevertheless, federal regulations did not specifically require companies to have, or to have access to, a prebuilt deep-water capping stack before the HORIZON/Macondo blowout. Indeed, prior to drilling the Macondo well, BP had submitted its oil spill response plan to the MMS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>for review and approval, and the MMS approved same.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">226. The evidence shows that it was not industry practice to have a pre-built capping stack prior to the HORIZON/Ma-condo blowout.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">227. The Court finds that BP\u2019s oil spill response plan, including the limited source control aspects, complied with federal regulations and industry practice existing at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">ii. <em>BP\u2019s Flow Rate Misrepresentations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">228. There is no dispute that BP lied about the amount of oil that flowed from the well. The evidence shows that BP repeatedly told <em>government </em>officials that its best estimate for flow rate was 5,000 barrels of oil per day, while BP\u2019s internal documents showed there was little basis for this estimate and actual flow rates were significantly higher. Indeed, BP pled guilty to obstruction of Congress, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505, for making such misrepresentations in response to a Congressional Committee inquiry. BP has admitted that it .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-8\">falsely suggested, in its May 24, 2010 letter [to a Committee of the United States House of Representatives], that the Unified Command\u2019s flow rate estimate of 5,000 .barrels of oil per day (\u201cBOPD\u201d) was the \u201cmost scientifically informed judgment\u201d and that subsequent flow rate estimates had \u201cyielded consistent results.\u201d In fact, as set forth above, BP had multiple internal documents with flow rate estimates that were significantly greater than 5,000 BOPD that it did not share with the Unified Command.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">229. Nevertheless, it has not been shown that BP\u2019s misrepresentations regarding flow rate delayed the capping of the well or otherwise adversely affected source control efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-12\">230. When it came to source control, BP could not act unilaterally. The Unified Command<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> had the ultimate approval authority for source control operations. BP would propose possible source control solutions, but the decision to move forward with any of them rested with the federal Government. The Government also had its own scientists who independently evaluated data and BP\u2019s proposals.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-13\">231. The Aligned Parties contend that BP\u2019s misrepresentations and omissions regarding flow rate led to the prioritization of Top Kill over other source-control methods, especially BOP-on-BOP. In other words, the Government would not have approved Top Kill had BP not underestimated the flow rate, claim the Aligned Parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-14\">232. Top Kill was an effort to kill the well by pumping mud and bridging material into the HORIZON\u2019S BOP with the intent to force mud down the wellbore and preclude flow from the reservoir. It consisted of two elements: (1) injecting various bridging materials into the BOP to restrict flow (\u201cJunk Shot\u201d), and (2) immediately pumping mud into the BOP to overcome the momentum of the flow (\u201cMomentum Kill\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-15\">233. Contrary to the Aligned Parties\u2019 contentions, the weight of the evidence does not show that Government decision-makers relied on BP\u2019s flow rate misrepresentations when they approved Top Kill.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-16\">234. For example, Dr. Marcia McNutt, director of the Government\u2019s Flow Rate Technical Group testified that no one in the Government had any confidence in BP\u2019s 5,000 barrels per day estimate.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>Thomas Hunter, Co-Director of the Federal Science Team, testified that the 5,000 barrels per day estimate \u201cdid not make a significant difference in our engagement of the top kill, because ... our conclusions was we didn\u2019t know what the flow was.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Admiral Mary Landry, the Federal On-Scene Coordinator from April 23, 2010 until June 1, 2010, testified that the Government was aware that multiple uncertainties surrounded the 5,000 barrels per day estimate and that the- Government\u2019s Flow Rate Technical Group was stood .up to provide a more accurate estimate.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">235. Furthermore, it has not been shown that implementing Top Kill before other alternatives was an unreasonable action under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">236. Top Kill had fewer risks than other alternatives, partic\u00falarly the BOP-on-BOP procedure. For example, a key concern during source control was wellbore integrity. If a particular intervention created too much pressure in the wellbore, burst disks in the well casing could.rupture. This could lead to a casing broach and underground blowout (where hydrocarbons escape into the surrounding rock formation rather than travelling up the well, BOP, and riser segment) and perhaps a surface broach (where hydrocarbons migrate through the seafloor to the sea), making the situation worse. It was determined that these risks were greater with the BOP-on-BOP option than with Top Kill.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">237. Another benefit to Top Kill was that if the procedure failed, it would still be possible to attempt a BOP-on-BOP operation. On the other hand, if the Unified Command pursued a BOP-on-BOP operation first and it was not successful, attempting Top Kill would be more difficult, perhaps impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">238. The Aligned Parties also contend that BP knew that Top Kill could not succeed if the float rate exceeded 15,000 barrels of oil per day and that BP knew that the flow rate exceeded this limit. The weight of the evidence also does not support this argument. While 15,000 barrels of oil per day may have been the limit for a procedure that relied on only Momentum Kill, the Junk Shot aspect of Top Kill made success a possibility even if flow was above 15,000 barrels of oil per day. Notably, one of the Top Kill attempts appeared to work momentarily, but ultimately failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">239. The Aligned Parties further claim that BP\u2019s flow rate misrepresentations continued after Top Kill when it told the Government that Top Kill failed because the well\u2019s burst disks had previously ruptured and mud was .pumped out the well instead of all the way down the production casing. This, claim the Aligned Parties, caused Government decision-makers to abandon entirely the BOP-on-BOP capping procedure and focus instead on containment. The Aligned Parties assert that if BP had revealed the real reason Top Kill failed \u2014 that the flow of oil was too great and the flow path too large \u2014 the Government would have moved forward with BOP-on-BOP and capped the well much sooner.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">240. Again, the weight of the evidence does not support the Aligned Parties\u2019 arguments. BP presented three explanations for why Top Kill failed, one of which was related to flow from the well. Although BP pushed the burst disk theory as the only \u201cplausible\u201d explanation and the other two as merely \u201cpossible,\u201d the evidence does not show that BP was dishonest in its evaluation and explanation. Furthermore, the Government\u2019s scientists independently analyzed the Top Kill data <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>and, though they believed alternate explanations were more likely, could not rale out the burst disk theory. Ultimately, both BP arid the Government determined that the well integrity concerns were too great to attempt the BOP-on-BOP procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">241. At bottom, there were several risks associated with the BOP-on-BOP procedure that either did not exist or could be mitigated with other options. The Court finds that, given the information known at the time, there were genuine concerns that attempting BOP-on-BOP shut in could make matters substantially worse. Moreover, it cannot be said that the decisions made and actions taken post-blowout were unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">D. Conclusions<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">242. As set forth in Part Il.C.ii., it has not been shown that BP\u2019s flow rate misrepresentations delayed or adversely affected source control, nor has it been shown that BP\u2019s post-blow out source control actions were unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">243. This leav\u00e9s the issue of BP\u2019s source control planning, discussed in Part Il.C.i.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">244. As noted above, the Court finds that BP\u2019s source control plan complied with then-existing federal regulations and industry practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">245. The Aligned Parties urge that compliance with a federal regulation and industry custom does not necessarily prove that one- has met the legal standard or preclude a finding of gross negligence, recklessness, etc. This view is correct in the abstract. For example, it is possible for an entire industry to unduly delay in adopting new and available devices.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Still, compliance with federal regulations and industry custom is a relevant consideration that tends to weigh against culpability-</p>\n<p id=\"b558-12\">246. There is evidence that arguably could lead a factfinder to conclude that BP was negligent in its source control preparation. However, simple negligence is not at issue here. Consequently, the Court does not determine whether or not BP was negligent in its source control preparation.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-13\">247. Instead, the questions the Court must resolve are (1) whether, considering both the Phase One and Phase Two evidence, any of the BP entities engaged in such extreme, extra-negligent conduct that would warrant punitive damages, or (2) whether BP\u2019s source control conduct makes it a superseding cause of the oil spill or otherwise warrants additional fault allocated to BP.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-14\">248. As to the first question, the Court finds that punitive damages are not warranted. The Court finds that BP was not grossly negligent, reckless, willful, or wanton in its source control planning. A major factor in this determination is the fact that BP\u2019s source control plan complied with federal regulations and industry practice. And while the Court does not determine whether or not BP\u2019s source control plan was merely negligerit, even if the Court found that BP was negligent in its source control planning, that finding would not combine with the Phase One conclusions to result in a finding of extra-negligent conduct beyond which has already been found.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-15\">249. The Court similarly concludes that BP\u2019s conduct does not make it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>a superseding cause of the oil spill, nor does BP\u2019s conduct warrant a reallocation of comparative fault among BP, Trans-ocean, and Halliburton.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">250. In short, the evidence in the Source Control segment does not change the Court\u2019s conclusions from Phase One.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">III. Quantification Segment</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">251. The CWA imposes a civil penalty upon \u201c[a]ny person who is the owner, operator, or person in charge of any vessel, onshore facility, or offshore facility from which oil ... is discharged in violation of paragraph (3).... \u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The maximum amount of this civil penalty is determined in part by the volume of oil discharged.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> More specifically, the CWA multiplies the number of barrels<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> of oil by a certain dollar value<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> to arrive at the maximum penal amount. The Court must also consider certain equitable factors before determining the final amount of the CWA penalty.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-14\">252. On February 22, 2012, the Court ruled on motions for partial summary judgment and held that BPXP and Ana-darko Petroleum Corporation are liable for civil penalties under the CWA, because they co-owned an offshore facility \u2014 the Macondo well \u2014 from which oil discharged.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-15\">253. The. purpose of the Quantification segment was for the parties to present evidence on the amount of oil that actually released into the Gulf of Mexico due to the DEEPWATER HORIZON/Macondo well incident. The Quantification segment was tried as a bench trial beginning on October 7, 2013 and concluding on October 18, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"ANd\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>254. The parties to the Quantification segment were the United States as plaintiff and BPXP and Anadarko Petroleum Corporation as defendants. BPXP and Anadarko Petroleum Corporation are collectively referred to as \u201cBP\u201d for purposes of the Quantification segment.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">255. The parties stipulated that during the spill response 810,000 barrels of oil were collected without contacting any ambient sea water (\u201cCollected Oil\u201d). Thus, while the parties present estimates of the total volume of oil that left the reservoir, they agree that 810,000 barrels should not be used to calculate the statutory maximum penalty under the CWA.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">256.The testifying experts presented widely varying estimates of the cumulative discharge and used different techniques to reach their conclusions. Most experts who opined on the cumulative discharge provided both a range of possible estimates and a \u201cbest estimate.\u201d Others provided only a range. The testifying experts\u2019 estimates are listed here<footnotemark>44</footnotemark>:</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b560-19\">257. Ultimately, the United States proposed that 5.0 million barrels of oil exited the reservoir, resulting in a net discharge of 4.19 million barrels once adjusted for the Collected Oil.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-20\">258. BP estimated that 3.26 million barrels of oil released from the reservoir, resulting in a net discharge of 2.45 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-21\">259. BP and the United States also presented competing theories of how the rate of discharge changed over the course of the spill.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-23\">260.BP theorized that the discharge began at a relatively low rate, as compared to the United States\u2019 estimates, and that the rate of discharge increased over time. BP proposed that cement in the well, certain BOP components, and the riser kink above the LMRP initially created restrictions that impeded the flow of oil. As these restrictions eroded \u2014 which, according to BP, occurred gradually over a period of at least 35 days \u2014 the rate of discharge steadily increased. By mid-May, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>BP estimates the flow rate was between 24,900 and 34,900 barrels of oil per day. On July 15, the final day of the spill, BP estimates oil was flowing around 45,000 barrels of oil per day.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">261. The United States presented the competing theory that neither the cement nor the riser created significant obstacles to flow. As to the components within the BOP that did. impede flow, the United States believes these restrictions eroded rapidly and did not provide any significant resistance after a few days. The United States contended instead that the primary factor affecting the rate of discharge was reservoir depletion, meaning the rate of discharge was highest near the beginning of the spill period \u2014 when the reservoir was highly pressurized \u2014 and slowly declined over time. For example, the United States estimates that the rate of discharge was roughly 60,000 barrels of oil per day on or around May 27, which decreased to around 53,000 barrels of oil per day by mid-July.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">262. The evidence pertaining to the Quantification segment was voluminous, dense, highly technical, and conflicting. The Court received not only live testimony, but also reviewed the parties\u2019 expert reports, deposition excerpts submitted in lieu of live testimony, post trial memoran-da, and proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">263. Both sides presented evidence to support their cumulative flow estimates, and each mounted effective attacks on the other\u2019s calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">264. There is no way to know with precision how much oil discharged into the Gulf of Mexico. There was no meter counting off each barrel of oil as it exited the well. The experts used a variety of methods to estimate the cumulative discharge. None of these were perfect. Because data from the well is limited, every expert had to make some assumptions while performing his calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">265. The Court will use Dr. Martin Blunt\u2019s testimony to illustrate the type of evidence and arguments presented during the Quantification segment.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">266. Dr. Blunt, one of BP\u2019s experts, used a material balance analysis to arrive at a cumulative discharge estimate of 3.26 million stock tank barrels. Under this analysis, cumulative flow (Np) is the product of three variables: initial volume of oil connected to the well (N); compressibility of the. rock and fluids in the reservoir (c); and change in reservoir pressure (Ap):</p>\n<p id=\"b561-12\"><em>Np </em>= <em>N </em>x c x <em>Ap</em></p>\n<p id=\"b561-13\">267. Dr. Blunt calculated N to be 112 million stock tank barrels. To arrive at this number, Dr. Blunt first determined the total volume of oil in the entire reservoir, which he derived from seismic data collected before the well was drilled. He then evaluated what portion of the total oil was actually connected to the well and not compartmentalized by geologic faults or sedimentary discontinuities. To do this, Dr. Blunt estimated the size of the connected area, which he determined by analyzing the distance at which a pressure signal from the well hits boundaries of the reservoir. The pressure signal analysis depends heavily on permeability \u2014 the ability of oil to flow in the reservoir formation \u2014 another variable that had to be determined. After determining the size of the connected area, Dr. Blunt calculated how much oil was in that area, as opposed to outside the connected area. Dr. Blunt then used a single-stage flash process to convert his estimate for connected oil from reservoir barrels to stock tank barrels.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>268. Compressibility, c, describes How easy or hard it is for a body to change its size and shape when acted upon by pressure. The more compressible the rock, the greater the cumulative discharge under the material balance analysis. Dr. Blunt\u2019s value for c was 6.35 microsips. To reach this number, he relied on compression testing performed on rotary sidewall core samples extracted from the reservoir.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">269. Change in pressure, Ap, is the difference between the initial measured reservoir pressure and the final reservoir pressure. If everything is held constant, the greater the change in the pressure, the more oil was released. The initial pressure was measured on April 12, 2010. After a well is shut in, pressure will build up until it equalizes, providing final pressure. Final pressure was not measured in this instance because pressure was still building when the well was cemented, cutting off the ability to monitor pressure. Therefore, Dr. Blunt estimated the final equilibrium pressure by using pressure readings taken at the capping stack following shut in and then predicting the additional increase in pressure after the well was cemented. Because pressure at the capping stack (located near the seafloor) is different from the pressure at the reservoir, Dr. Blunt also had to convert the capping stack pressure readings to down-hole values. Ultimately, Dr. Blunt determined Ap to be 1,367 psi.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">270. The United States criticized several aspects of Dr. Blunt\u2019s calculation and presented a competing version of the material balance analysis through its expert, Dr. Kelkar, who used different values for some of the inputs. The United States attacked, among other things, Dr. Blunt\u2019s inputs for permeability, rock compressibility, and fluid separation (the manner in which reservoir barrels are converted to stock tank barrels).<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Of these, compressibility was perhaps the most contested issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">271. The United States\u2019 used 12 micro-sips as its value for compressibility, noting that BP relied on this number during the response and represented it to be the \u201cmost likely\u201d case. The United States further contended that the rock core testing that generated the 6.35 value was flawed and unreliable. The United States pointed out that of the 44 rock samples collected from the Macondo well, 21 were in such a fragile state they could not be used for rock mechanics testing; therefore, only the \u201cstrongest\u201d cores were tested, leading to a sampling bias that underestimated compressibility. Ultimately, only three of these samples were actually tested for compressibility, constituting less than one percent of the reservoir\u2019s thickness at the Macondo well, claimed the United States. Moreover, the United States argued that the orientation of the cores in the lab tests did not match the orientation of compaction in the reservoir, a consequence of using rotary sidewall cores to collect reservoir samples. Because the Macondo reservoir is anisotropic \u2014 meaning the physical properties of the rock has different values depending on the direction in which it is measured \u2014 the tests likely under-predicted compressibility. The United States asserted that conventional (or whole) coring is the most accurate method in the industry to take rock samples and the only method appropriate for compressibility testing. The United States raised other arguments about the compressibility testing which are not recounted here.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">272. Again, the Court presents this discussion to illustrate the type of evidence and arguments presented at trial. Each side ably demonstrated the shortcomings of the other\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>273. After weighing all of the evidence and considering all of the arguments, the Court finds that 4.0 million barrels of oil released from the reservoir. After deducting the Collected Oil from this amount per the parties\u2019 stipulation, the Court finds for purposes of calculating the maximum possible civil penalty under the CWA that 3.19 million barrels of oil discharged into the Gulf of Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">IV. Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">274. BP was not grossly negligent, reckless, willful, or wanton in its source control planning and preparation. Assuming without deciding that BP\u2019s source control plan was negligent, that finding would not alter any of the fault determinations from Phase One.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">275. It has not been shown that BP\u2019s flow rate misrepresentations delayed the capping of the well or otherwise adversely affected source control. It has not been shown that the post-blowout source control decisions or actions were unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">276. In short, nothing from the Source Control segment alters the Court\u2019s findings and conclusions from Phase One.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">277.
