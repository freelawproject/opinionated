By decision and order on motion of this Court dated March 31, 2011, that branch of the motion was held in abeyance and was referred to the panel of Justices hearing the appeals for determination upon the argument or submission of the appeals.</p>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"parties\" id=\"b343-6\">Upon the papers filed in support of the motion, the papers filed in opposition thereto, and upon the submission of the appeals, it is</p>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b343-7\">Ordered that the motion is denied as academic.

By resolution adopted on May 27, 2003, the Town Board denied their petition for a special use permit. Thereafter, Costco commenced a proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 78 challenging the denial of its permit application. At the conclusion of that proceeding, the Supreme Court vacated the denial of the special use permit and remitted the matter to the Town Board for the purpose of complying with the State Environmental Quality Review Act (ECL 8-0101 <em>et. seq. </em>[hereinafter SEQRA]).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">On September 21, 2004, the Town Board, as lead agency, issued a positive declaration under SEQRA on the Costco Project. After Costco revised its draft environmental impact statement (hereinafter DEIS) three different times in response to written comments from the Town Board and its consultants, the DEIS was accepted by resolution dated November 14, 2006. A public hearing was held on the DEIS on January 9, 2007, and the public comment period closed on January 31, 2007. Thereafter, Costco made three separate submissions of a final environmental impact statement (hereinafter FEIS) between May 2007 and April 2009 to the Town Board. Despite those submissions and the passage of a substantial period of time, the Town Board has not filed a FEIS for the Costco Project. Costco and the present owner of the subject property commenced this CPLR article 78 proceeding, inter alia, to compel the Town Board \u00e1nd the Town of Oyster Bay (hereinafter together the Town) to file a FEIS, to complete SEQRA review of the Costco Project, and to take final action upon the applications for a special use permit and site plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Contrary to the Town\u2019s contentions, the Supreme Court properly determined that the Town\u2019s failure to act pursuant to the applicable local code provision <em>(see </em>Code of Town of Oyster <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>Bay \u00a7 110-9 [I]), as well as the applicable SEQRA provision <em>(see </em>6 NYCRR 617.9 [a] [5]) requiring it to \u201cprepare or cause to be prepared and . . . file a final EIS, within 45 calendar days after the close of any hearing or within 60 calendar days after the filing of the draft EIS, whichever occurs later,\u201d warranted mandamus relief <em>(id.; see Matter of Mamaroneck Beach &amp; Yacht Club, Inc. v Fraioli, </em>24 AD3d 669, 671 [2005]; <em>Matter of 2433 Knapp St. Rest. Bar v Department of Consumer Affairs of City of N.Y., </em>150 AD2d 464, 465 [1989]).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-3\">The Town\u2019s remaining contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">Since the Town\u2019s appendix was inadequate <em>(see </em>CPLR 5528 [a] [5]; Rules of App Div, 2d Dept [22 NYCRR] \u00a7 670.10.2 [c] [1]), Costco is entitled to recover from the Town the expense of printing, serving, and filing its supplemental appendix <em>(see </em>CPLR 5528 [e]; <em>Wenger v Alidad, </em>265 AD2d 322, 324 [1999]; <em>Fidelity N.Y. v Madden, </em>212 AD2d 572, 573-574 [1995]). Angiolillo, J.P, Florio, Leventhal and Cohen, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
