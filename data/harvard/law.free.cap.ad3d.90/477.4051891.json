Under the circumstances, Family Court providently exercised its discretion in denying respondent\u2019s request for a dispositional hearing after the finding of abandonment <em>(see Matter of \u201cMale\u201d G., </em>30 AD3d 337, 338 [2006], <em>lv denied </em>7 NY3d 711 [2006]). Respondent\u2019s belated argument that she is engaged in services and has an alternative plan for the children is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">Family Court properly denied the maternal grandmother\u2019s custody petition. The children had not expressed a desire to see the mother\u2019s side of the family, and the grandmother has no preemptive statutory or constitutional right to custody <em>(Matter of Peter L., </em>59 NY2d 513, 520 [1983]).
