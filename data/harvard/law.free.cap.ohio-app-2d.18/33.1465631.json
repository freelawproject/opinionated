J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ai\">The defendant, James S. Pyle, Jr., was tried and convicted of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, and he has appealed to this court from the judgment and sentence thereafter entered in the Municipal Court of Piqua.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-16\">The only question of any consequence in the appeal is whether the principles enunciated in <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436, are applicable where the accused is charged with the offense of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-17\">This question was answered affirmatively in the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>of <em>Piqua </em>v. <em>Hinger, </em>13 Ohio App. 2d 108. And while still recognizing that efficient law enforcement and orderly-judicial administration militate against the application of <em>Miranda </em>to offenses which do not provide for confinement in a penal institution, we remain of the opinion that the artificial distinction between felonies and misdemeanors in Ohio is not a realistic basis for the application or nonapplication of the rules prescribed in the <em>Miranda case. </em>In other words, the activation of the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination should be based upon criteria which is more stable and discernible than the theoretical difference between confinement in the county jail and confinement in the state penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">In the present case, the arresting officer was permitted to testify over objection as to <em>incriminating statements </em>made by the accused. Hence, the judgment will be reversed, and the cause certified to the Supreme Court of Ohio as being in conflict with the case of <em>Columbus </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>9 Ohio App. 2d 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b54-6\">Crawford and Sherer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
