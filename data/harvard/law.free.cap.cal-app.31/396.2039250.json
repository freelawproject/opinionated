The appellant moved to strike out the plaintiff\u2019s cost bill. From the order in each case denying the motion the appeal is prosecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>It is conceded that the action concerning as it does the water rights of the parties in a certain river in Fresno County, is an action in the nature of a suit to quiet title to real property. It falls, therefore, so far as regards costs within the provisions of section 1022 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which declares that \u201cCosts are allowed of course to the plaintiff, upon a judgment in his favor, in the following cases: ... 5. In an action which involves the title or possession of real estate. ...\u201d While it is true that the plaintiff did not receive all that it asked for in its complaint, nevertheless it recovered a judgment for part of its demand, and is therefore entitled to costs <em>(Hoyt </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>149 Cal. 722, 731, [87 Pac. 569] ; <em>F. A. Hihn Co. </em>v. <em>City of Santa Cruz, </em>24 Cal. App. 365, [141 Pac. 391].) In each ease the appellant in its answer also claimed the right to divert certain quantities of water from said river, and also alleged that its rights in that regard were prior to those of the plaintiff. It also recovered judgment for part of what it claimed, and perhaps it was entitled to its costs; but as to this it is sufficient to say that that question is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The order in each of the cases above entitled denying appellant\u2019s motion to strike out plaintiff\u2019s cost bill is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
