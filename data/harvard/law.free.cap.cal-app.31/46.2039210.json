App. 505, [97 Pac. 216], citing that case, it was said: \u201cThe contention that the lien is not of equitable cognizance because created by law cannot be considered. Such a distinction would destroy all equitable jurisdiction to carry out the provisions of the code. The remedy for the enforcement of the lien is clearly an equitable one. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b76-11\">The jurisdiction is in the supreme court (Const., sec. 4, art. VI), and the case is therefore transferred to that court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
