The law in this country on the point is well settled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>and completely summarized in Vol. IV Re-statement of the Law of Torts, Sec. 768:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-4\">\u201c(1) One is privileged purposely to cause a third person not to enter into or continue a business relation with a competitor of the actor if</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-5\">(a) the relation concerns a matter involved in the competition between the actor and the competitor, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-6\">(b) the actor does not employ improper means, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-7\">(c) the actor does not intend thereby to create or continue an illegal restraint of competition, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-8\">(d) the actor\u2019s purpose is at least in part to advance his interest in his competition with the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-9\">(2) The fact that one is a competitor of another for the business of a third person does not create a privilege to cause the third person to commit a breach of contract with the other even under the conditions stated in Subsection (1).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">It is clear from the complaint that plaintiff and defendant were business rivals dealing in the same products and that defendant\u2019s purpose was, at least, in part \"to advance his interest in his competition\u201d with plaintiff. It does not appear that defendant, in indulging in the alleged unfair practices was \u201ccreating or continuing an illegal restraint of competition\u201d, or that the customers being solicited by defendant were under contract with plaintiff. It follows, therefore, that unless defendant employed \u201cimproper means\u201d in soliciting business from plaintiff\u2019s customers, this action must fall. The improper means stated in the complaint consisting of statements by defendant relating to plaintiff\u2019s secret connection with another corporation of which its customers would not have approved and (2) imputations of plaintiff\u2019s financial irresponsibility. The complaint fails to allege that the statements were false. In this connection the law seems to be settled that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>unless the words constituting the persuasion complained of are false, then no action will lie. <em>Vol. IV Restatement of Torts, Sec. </em>767, <em>p. </em>65; <em>Vol. </em>30 <em>Am.Jur.
