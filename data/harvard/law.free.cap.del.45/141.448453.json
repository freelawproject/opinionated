In my opinion it has. <em>Dillon v. Board of Pension Commis</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number><em>sioners, </em>18 <em>Cal. </em>2d 427, 116 <em>P. </em>2d 37, 136 <em>A. L.

W. </em>2d 870.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Plaintiff relies upon a line of authorities which superficially support his position. Upon closer examination, however, the facts of these cases reveal that, prior to the bringing of petitioner\u2019s suit to recover his pension, his right thereto had been established. <em>Dryden v. Board of Pension Commissioners, 6 Cal. </em>2d 575, 59 <em>P. </em>2d 104; <em>Donnellan v. O\u2019Dwyer, </em>189 <em>Misc. </em>121, 67 <em>N. Y. </em>S. 2d 642. This distinguishing feature is clearly apparent, and is commented on at length, in the Dillon case, 116 P. 2d at page 40, 136 A. L. R. 800. See also 189 <em>Misc. </em>121., 67 <em>N. Y. S. 2d at page </em>650.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> What the result would be here had Plaintiff established his right to a pension within three years of his retirement and then failed to institute an action to recover an installment for more than three years thereafter is a question not raised by this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">For the reasons just stated I have no alternative but to grant-the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b159-12\">.
