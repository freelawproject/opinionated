In an action on a foreign judgment pronounced in open court on May 3, 1894, but not signed and entered of record until June 18, 1894, where the plaintiff on a former trial to meet an objection of the defendant that the judgment should have been declared on as of May 3, instead of June 18, amended his declaration accordingly, the defendant will not be heard on a subsequent trial to object that the judgment should have been declared on in the amended declaration as of June 18.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AUbs\">2. An objection by the defendant, in an action on a foreign judgment, that the judgment sued on was not a final one, in that it provided that the costs should be thereafter taxed by the clerk, is untenable, as the taxation of costs is a mere clerical matter, incidental to and not an essential part of the judgment; <em>following </em>Adrianee v. Heiskell, 8 App. D. C. 240; especially where the record of the foreign proceedings shows that the costs were actually taxed and entered on the judgment record subsequent to the date of the judgment.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AHm\">3. In an action on a foreign judgment for a specified sum and costs, in the transcript of the record of which is included a certificate of \u00a1taxation of the costs, it is not error to refuse to allow the defendant to testify that the costs were erroneously taxed; as the record speaks for itself and cannot be contradicted or amended in that way.</syllabus>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b290-14\">No. 1175.</docketnumber>\n<otherdate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"A9-\">Submitted January 23, 1903.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A2U\">Decided February 4, 1903.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-15\">Hearing on an appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia in an action on a foreign judgment.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"ANF\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>The Court in the opinion stated the case as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-5\">\u2022 Joseph P.

The master reported, and on December 16, 1893, on his recommendation, Barber was appointed trustee in the place of Clark, and, pending exceptions to the account, Clark was ordered to pay over to Barber the sum of $5,000, but without prejudice to his rights upon the hearing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-7\">Because of objections to the decree sued on, on account of variance, and because it is not final, it is here set out in full as recorded in the transcript:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-8\"><em>\u201c(Final Judgment on Further </em>Directions.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-9\">\u201c In the High Court of Justice, Common Pleas Division. \u201c Before the Honorable Mr. Justice Street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-10\">\u201c In Court, Thursday, the 3rd Day of May, A.

It is submitted that as between the date of May 3, upon which plaintiff below declared, and June 18, the date the transcript shows judgment was entered, the prior date related merely to an interlocutory step in the proceedings, and accordingly there being a variance between the date in the declaration and the transcript introduced in evidence, the court erred in overruling defendant\u2019s objections thereto. <em>Gulick </em>v. Loder, 14 N. J. L. 572; <em>Howard </em>v. Cousins, 7 How. (Miss.) 114; <em>Silver Lake Bank </em>v. Hardin, Wright (Ohio), 430; Piggott on Foreign Judgm., p. 54; Freeman on Judgm., Sec. 1; Greenl. Ev. (14th ed.), Sec. 70.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-19\">2. The transcript offered in evidence was not a complete transcript, and the judgment therein was not final since the record failed to disclose the taxation of costs in favor of the defendant below. The costs of the plaintiff below ar'e <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>here taxed and made a part of the judgment, but such is not true of the defendant\u2019s costs. In other words the clerk has arbitrarily nullified that portion of the decree adjudging costs to the defendant, by neglecting to tax the costs to which he was entitled, and accordingly the record is incomplete, and until they are taxed it is not final, since the rights of the parties are not therein settled. <em>Re Henderson, </em>15 App. Cas. 1, 10; Black on Judgm. (ed. 1891), Sec. 3, p. 8; <em>People </em>v. Pirfenbrink, 96 Ill. 68; <em>Boyken </em>v. <em>State, </em>3 Yerg. (Tenn.) 426; <em>Chapin </em>v. <em>Broder, </em>16 Cal. 403; <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>37 Minn. 461; <em>Hays </em>v. <em>May\u2019s Heirs, </em>1 J. J. Marsh. (Ky.) 498; <em>Keystone Iron Co. </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>132 U. S. 93; <em>Young v. Smith, </em>15 Pet. (U. S.) 287; <em>Lodge </em>v. <em>Twell, </em>135 U. S. 232. The general rule is that where a copy of the record of a judgment is required, it must be of the whole record so that the court may determine the legal effect of the whole of it which might be quite different from that of a part. Black on Judgm., Secs. 877, 961, p. 125; <em>Vail </em>v. <em>Iglehart, </em>69 Ill. 332, 335; <em>Edmiston </em>v. <em>Schwartz, </em>13 Serg. &amp; R.

Ev. 824; Freeman on Judgm., Sec. 412; <em>McMillan </em>v. <em>Ritchie, </em>2 Allan (N. B.) 242; 2 Black on Judgm., Sec. 845. Furthermore, the court having ordered the taxation of appellant\u2019s costs, any judgment entered upon such order is necessarily incomplete until this has been done, or some showing is made that the question has been disposed of by the proper court officer, as is stated by Black, Sec. 143, p. 142. <em>Bock </em>v. <em>Little, </em>24 Miss. 463; <em>Reid </em>v. <em>Dunlin, </em>5 Ala. 205; <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Gesendorff, </em>44 Ind. 358.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b295-5\"><em>Mr. W.

The transcript shows that the judgment was pronounced in open court on May 3,1894, but was not signed and entered of record until June 18, 1894.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Wien offered in evidence, tie defendant objected on tie ground of variance in that it was declared upon as rendered May 3, when in fact it lad been rendered on June 18, 1894. Tie exception to tie admission of tie proof contains the following recital: \u201c Tie presiding justice upon consideration tlat tie defendant lad theretofore, at a former trial of tlis cause lad February 26, 1900, objected tlat there was a variance between the said transcript and the plaintiff\u2019s amended declaration filed in tlis cause on tie 18tl day of March, 1897, which amended declaration declared on a decree of tie High Court of Justice \u2014 Common Pleas Division, signed and entered on tie 18th day of June, 1894, whereas tie final decree was signed on tie 3d day of May, 1894, which objection of the said defendant was then sustained, and tie plaintiff amended his declaration to conform to tie objection of tie defendant and tie ruling of the court, overruled said objection and allowed tie transcript to be read.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">We are of tie opinion tlat tie court was right in overruling tie objection for tie reasons given. Having induced the court on a former trial to rule tlat tie judgment should lave been pleaded as of May 3, 1894, instead of June 18, and tie plaintiff laving conformed to tlat ruling by amending bis declaration to meet tie objection, tie defendant ought not now to be heard to complain of an error, if in fact it be one, tlat was tie result of lis own suggestion and persuasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">2. Tie second assignment of error is founded on tie objection that tie judgment sued upon was not final. We are of opinion tlat it lacked no substantial element of finality. Every essential question at issue was effectually disposed of, including tie award of costs. Tlat these costs lad to be taxed by tie clerk or master, according to tie terms of tie decree, is immaterial. Tie taxation of costs is incidental to the decree and not an essential part of it. <em>Adriance </em>v. <em>Heiskell, </em>8 App. D. C. 240, 245. As was said in tlat case: <em>\u201c </em>Indeed it not infrequently happens tlat judgment is rendered for some specific sum found to be due and for costs thereafter to be taxed by tie clerk, such taxation of costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>being merely a clerical matter to be performed by the clerk rather than the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-3\">Moreover, the transcript, the exemplification of which bears the final date of March 2,1897, shows that the costs adjudged to the plaintiff had been taxed and certified by the taxing officer on November 26, 1895, and then entered on the judgment record.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">3. It is to be presumed that the taxing officer obeyed the explicit directions contained in the decree and certified the balance of costs due by the defendant, after making the required allowances for him and setting them off against those adjudged to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">It was not error, therefore, as has been contended under the last assignment, to refuse to permit the defendant as a witness to testify to the amount of costs due him and show that the same had not been properly entered to his credit in the certificate of taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The record speaks for itself and cannot be contradicted, or amended in that way.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Having found no error in the proceedings on the trial, the judgment will be affirmed, with costs. It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">\n<em>'Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
