The record is not before us, and it does not appear that any \u25a0appeal was taken and perfected, by the entry of an appeal within the time prescribed, and the giving of a bond. If the purpose of the petitioner is to compel the court below to enter an appeal, and to accept a bond to prosecute such \u2022appeal to this court, this is not the proper proceeding to accomplish that object. The petition, therefore, must be dis-. missed, and it is so ordered.</p>\n<author id=\"b439-10\">By the Court:</author>\n<judges id=\"b439-11\">R. H.
