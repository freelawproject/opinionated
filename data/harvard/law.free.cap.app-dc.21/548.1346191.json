Proof by the plaintiff of ordinary negligence on the part of the defendant, or want of sufficient care to avoid the accident, will support a declaration in an action to recover damages for personal injuries, charging gross and wanton negligence; there being, in law, no degrees of negligence, and \u201c gross <em>\u201d </em>being a word of description and not of definition.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b564-11\">2.

Atchison, which has been on trial before you in this court for several days, it is necessary for the court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>give yoa in charge yonr duties so far as the law is concerned, and in the first place, in order to understand exactly your duty, it is necessary that yon should have well in mind what this case is, and it is better presented to you, perhaps, by a careful reading of the material parts of the declaration which has been filed by the plaintiff in this case. It is as follows Here the court read the declaration, and then, proceeded:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-5\">\u201c To this defendant has interposed a plea of not guilty which malees it necessary for the plaintiff, before she can claim any verdict in her favor at your hands, to prove substantially the averment of this declaration by a preponderance of the testimony. There is another question to be noted, which I will bring to your notice before I close my charge. You must be satisfied, gentlemen of the jury, of the principal facts, the material facts, that are charged in this declaration, to wit, that the defendant\u2019s servant entered these premises without the knowledge of the plaintiff, and opened a trap-door which was not customarily used for any purpose in connection with the household affairs, and that the plaintiff, having no knowledge of the presence of the defendant, without any warning that he was present and had opened this door, in the course of her usual business and occupation, entered this porch where this trap-door was, and stepped into it \u2014 that it was open and she stepped into it \u2014 that it had been opened by the servant of the defendant. You must be satisfied from the circumstances and facts which are produced in evidence here in relation to this occurrence, that the defendant, in committing these acts, of opening the door and leaving it open, under the circumstances acted carelessly and did not observe ordinary care and prudence with reference to the safety of the plaintiff and others who might be liable to be injured by its being left in that condition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-6\">\u201c'And you must be satisfied, gentlemen, that the plaintiff herself was not guilty of negligence which directly contributed to her injury, to the injury which she received on that occasion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-7\">\u201c It is for the plaintiff to prove that the defendant was negligent, or rather the defendant\u2019s servant was negligent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>and that in consequence he did not observe ordinary care and prudence in the matters which I have brought to your attention \u2014 it is for the plaintiff to prove that fact, the negligence of the defendant which contributed directly, or which directly caused, the injirry to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b571-5\">\u201c If the proof shall show, in your judgment, that the defendant\u2019s servant was negligent, it is, however, incumbent upon the defendant to prove that the plaintiff was also negligent, and that, her negligence contributed directly to the result \u2014 to her injury \u2014 of which she complains. If you shall be satisfied that the defendant\u2019s servant was negligent, and that his negligence contributed to cause, in part at least, the injuries which the plaintiff received on that occasion, yet if you are also convinced that the plaintiff was also negligent in regard to her own safety and did not observe ordinary care and prudence in her conduct, by reason of which she was injured it will be your duty to return a verdict for the defendant; because if both parties are negligent, both the plaintiff and the defendant are negligent, the law will not undertake to apportion damages, nor to allow a jury to attempt to apportion damages, imposing a part upon the defendants, and a part upon the plaintiff, who has been injured, and in such case the verdict must be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b571-6\"><em>\u201c\u2022 </em>You must, then, be satisfied, gentlemen, before you can return a verdict for the plaintiff, that the defendant was guilty of negligence, of not exercising ordinary care and prudence in the premises, and you must also be satisfied that it was not the plaintiff\u2019s fault, that is that her want of care and diligence upon her own part with reference to her own safety was not such as ordinary persons, persons of ordinary care and prudence, would have observer!, and that therefore she was not guilty of contributing to her own injury; for, as I have said, if you are satisfied of that fact, you must return a verdict for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b571-7\">\u201c But if you shall find that the defendant has been guilty of negligence, through his employee or servant, in not exercising ordinary care and prudence, and that the plaintiff has not been guilty of any want of prudence \u2014 if under the cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>cumstances any person of ordinary cai\u2019e and prudence would not have done differently from what she did do \u2014 it would be your duty to return a verdict for the plaintiff for whatever damages, in your judgment, plaintiff has suffered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-5\">. \u201c Some special instructions will be given you upon that subject further along. Some prayers have been offered on behalf of the plaintiff, which the court has sanctioned, and will give-to you in charge.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-6\">Here the coart read the plaintiff\u2019s prayers and those of the defendant which had been granted. With reference to the defendant\u2019s fifth prayer the court said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-7\"><em>\u201c </em>You will understand, gentlemen, that the facts referred to here in this instruction relate to the facts which the court has advised you it is necessary for the plaintiff to establish before she can recover a verdict at your hands, and the import of this instruction is that if the plaintiff has failed to establish any one of these material facts by a preponderance of the evidence, the defendant is entitled to a verdict.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-8\">\u2022 In explanation of plaintiff\u2019s fifth prayer the court further instructed the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-9\">\u201c If the jury find for the plaintiff, that is upon the several matters which I have called to your attention, and which I have told you the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence \u2014 if you find for the plaintiff upon these contested matters \u2014 then it will be your duty to consider what the amount of your verdict shall be, and you may consider her bodily suffering and pain, and also her mental pain resulting from her physical injuries, and determine from those matters \u2014 from the consideration of those matters as they are presented by the testimony \u2014 the amount which, in your judgment she ought to recover as damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-10\">\u201c I believe, gentlemen of the jury, that there has been no' evidence offered of any injury occasioned to plaintiff by the expenditure of money for sustenance or physician\u2019s bills or medicine or anything of that kind, and of course you can render no verdict for those causes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-11\">\u201c There is also another matter to which it is proper I should call your attention. Something has been said here in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>course of the testimony by counsel, perhaps, and possibly some expression from the witnesses, that plaintiff was accustomed to do her son\u2019s housework, to be his housekeeper, and that since the time of her injury she has not been able to perform that duty, and that she has been unable to labor otherwise as she was accustomed to do before her injury. It is perhaps proper enough that that should be mentioned for the purpose of showing what her condition, has been, the extent of her injury, how it has affected her bodily or mentally since the time of the injuiy, but it is not proper to be an item of pecuniary indemnity to the plaintiff on account of this injury, that her son has lost her services, the services which he was accustomed to have; damages for any injury that may have resulted to her son or to anybody else besides herself, by reason of her having received these injuries, cannot be awarded. It is only such damages as are set forth in the prayer of the plaintiff which 1 have read to you and given to you as the law governing the case, so far as damages are concerned. That is, as I will remind you, that they must be confined exclusively \u2014 if your verdict is for the plaintiff, when you reach the question of damages if you reach that at all \u2014 if you shall find for the plaintiff you are to take into consideration the sufferings, including bodily pain in consequence of such injuries, and also the mental suffering and pain attendant upon and the natural incidents of, such bodily suffering, the character and extent of her physical disabilities, and whether the injury .is permanent or otherwise; and you should award such damages, within the limits of the sum claimed in the declaration, as will fairly and reasonably compensate the plaintiff for the personal injuries suffered by her; that is, the bodily and mental sufferings of the plaintiff occasioned by this injury.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-5\">Counsel for the defendant here said: \u201c Now I ask your honor to say to the jury in your own language that if they find from a preponderance of the evidence that Mr. Wills the son knew of the presence of the workman upon the premises, and of his entering in and upon the trap-door, they are to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>consider that knowledge of the son in reaching their conclusion upon the question of the negligence of the defendant\u2019s servant in opening the trap-door, and that that is to be considered whether they find that Mrs. Wills knew of it or not.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-5\">To which the court replied: <em>\u201c </em>Yes, provided \u2014 they must find, however, in order to affect the plaintiff with the knowledge of the son, that the son had notice of the fact that the party had entered and left the trap-door open and unguarded.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-6\">Thereupon counsel for the defendant objected to the following portion of the charge by the court, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-7\">\u201c You must then be satisfied, gentlemen, before you can return your verdict for the plaintiff, that the defendant was guilty of negligence, of not exercising ordinary care and prudence in the premises.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-8\">But the court overruled the objection, to which ruling counsel for the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-9\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff for sixteen hundred dollars. \u2014 Reporter.]</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b574-10\"><em>Mr. John Bidout </em>and <em>Mr. Bates Warren </em>for the appellant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b574-11\">1. Inasmuch as the declaration alleges that the appellee\u2019s injuries were occasioned by the <em>\u201c gross and wanton negligence </em>of the appellant\u2019s servant in failing to give any warning or notice of the fact that he had entered the premises and opened the trap-door and left the same open, and carelessly allowed said trap-door to remain open,\u201d it was incumbent upon the appellee to prove the case as alleged and proof of merely ordinary negligence was a fatal variance. It can readily be seen that a defendant preparing to meet a charge of \u201c gross and wanton negligence \u201d is most grievously surprised to be held liable at the trial under proof and instructions which predicate liability of merely <em>ordinary negligence.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b574-12\">The rule, firmly imbedded in the judicial system of this country, that the <em>allegata </em>must correspond with the probata, is founded in natural justice and so elementary that citation of authority is really unnecessary, but the following cases are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>cited because they so very clearly and forcibly sustain our contention. <em>Steam Navigation Co. </em>v. <em>Dandridge, </em>8 Gill &amp; J. 194; <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>53 U. S. App. 291; <em>Louisville &amp; N. RR. Co. </em>v. <em>Hurt, </em>101 Ala. 34; <em>Lewin </em>v. <em>Memphis, etc., RR. Co. </em>v. <em>Overton, </em>117 Ind. 253; <em>Montgomery </em>v. <em>Muskegon Co., </em>88 Mich. 634; <em>Brenstein </em>v. <em>Mattson, </em>10 Daly (N. Y.) 336; <em>Kinsman </em>v. <em>State, </em>77 Ind. 132; <em>Hoke </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>26 Md. 453; <em>Norris </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>33 Md. 56; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Crichton, </em>33 Md. 103; <em>Philips </em>v. <em>Smoot, 1 </em>Mackey, 478; <em>Arrick </em>v. <em>Fry, </em>8 App. Dec. 125.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b575-5\">In the case first cited -will be found a statement by Chief Judge Dorsey of the law of variance which, like all his opinions, is most instructive. The other cases cited, especially the Alabama, Indiana, and Michigan cases, correspond almost exactly with the case at bar.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b575-6\">The suit is not against the alleged wrongdoer himself, and there was no proof of such previous authorization from, or cooperation by the defendant, the employer, as to bring him within the rule as laid down in <em>Lake Shore Ry. </em>v. <em>Prentice, </em>147 U. S. 101, and the large verdict rendered no doubt largely resulted from this erroneous idea of the jury, and this in a case where the proof fell far short of showing even ordinary negligence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b575-7\">2. The appellee having affirmatively alleged the exercise of ordinary care on her part, and that she acted without any carelessness or negligence, was bound to prove it. She negatives this allegation by her testimony that <em>\"she opened the door and did not look,\" </em>yet the court not only by its instructions relieved her of the burden of proving her allegation but refused appellant\u2019s first and third prayers. Even assuming that in this jurisdiction contributory negligence is a matter of defense, and that exercise of ordinary care need not be averred, yet when it is averred we submit that it must be proved. Even if it be held that though averred it need not be proved, yet when, as in this case, the want of ordinary care was absolutely disproved by plaintiff\u2019s own evidence that \" <em>she did not look,\" </em>the defendant was entitled to have his first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>prayer granted. These contentions are supported by <em>Wheelock </em>v. <em>Boston, etc., RR. Co., </em>105 Mass. 203; <em>Gaffney </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>150 Mass. 479; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Ramsburg, </em>49 Minn. 341, and many other cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b576-5\">3. The objection to the admission of the testimony of the witness Benjamin F. Wills concerning his custom as to giving warning when the trap-door was to be opened, which is raised by the fourth assignment of error, is founded upon the contention that it was obviously irrelevant. The proof showed that the workman Burnett was in the trap-door opening in a stooping posture, so filling the opening as to make it impossible for the appellee to fall into the opening, and the issue was whether it was gross and wanton negligence for the appellant to have the trap-door open without further warning or barricade than Burnett\u2019s body practically filling the opening, and this at 9 o\u2019clock, a. m. The testimony of Wills could not in any wise enlighten <em>this issue, </em>and yet without limiting the effect of this evidence it was allowed to go to the jury generally; and they, beyond doubt, drew from it an inference injurious to the appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b576-6\">4. The injuries alleged in the declaration are: <em>\u201c </em>Fracture of her right arm near the shoulder and severe and painful bruises about her left knee, right eye, and head,\u201d yet the court allowed the physician to testify to an injury to the <em>shoulder joint </em>not averred in the declaration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b576-7\">It appears by the physician\u2019s testimony that the fracture had long since united and healed, and that the other injuries averred were merely temporary; and it is also apparent that the only inconvenience now suffered is from what he calls <em>\u201c </em>restriction in the shoulder joint.\u201d If this testimony had been excluded, as it should have been, it is obvious that the verdict would have been, if not for the defendant, most materially reduced, the result of this ruling being that the appellee was permitted to recover mainly for an injury not even hinted at in the declaration.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b576-8\"><em>Mr. P.

And though several assignments of error are made, only three or four questions \u2022are pressed in argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">1. The first of these questions urged is, that inasmuch as the declaration alleges that the plaintiff\u2019s injuries were occasioned by the <em>gross and wanton </em>neglig'ence of the defendant\u2019s servant in failing to give any warning or notice of the fact that he had entered the premises and opened the trap-floor and left the same open, and carelessly allowed the same to remain open, it was incumbent upon the plaintiff to give affirmative proof of the case as alleged, and that proof of ordinary negligence only was a fatal variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">There are some decisions that have held in accordance with the contention of the defendant in this case. But the great weight of authority, and especially of recent decisions, is \u2022clearly against the contention of the defendant in this case. The distinction between negligence and gross negligence, carelessness and gross carelessness, is to a great extent merely verbal; it is simply negligence with a strong adjective of \u2022qualification or description. There can be, legally speaking, no degrees of negligence on the part of the defendant, any more than there can be degrees of due care on the part of the plaintiff; for, in respect to the same transaction, the presence \u25a0of the one element of conduct implies the absence of the other. Any negligence therefore which is legally sufficient to charge the defendant with liability, is, in a legal sense, gross negligence ; and the question whether the defendant is to be charged therewith, as being a question of fact, must depend upon the circumstances of the case; as must also the question whether the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care, or, in other words, not guilty of contributory negligence. The term negligence is a relative term, and conduct which may be negligent in one condition of circumstances may bear a very dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>ferent construction in another. Buswell, Law, Personal Injuries, 127-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">In the case of <em>Grill </em>v. <em>General Iron Screw Collier Co., </em>L. R. 1 C. P. 600 (cited with approval by the Supreme Court of the United States, in <em>Milwaukee R. Co. </em>v. <em>Arms, </em>91 U. S. 489, 494), Mr. Justice Miller said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-6\">\u201c Confusion has arisen from regarding <em>1 </em>negligence \u2019 as a positive instead of a negative word. It is really the absence of such care as it was the duty of the defendant to use. \u2018 Gross \u2019 is a word of description, and not of definition; and it would have been only introducing a source of confusion to use the expression \u2018gross negligence\u2019 instead of the equivalent\u2014 a want of due care and skill.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">And as said by the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of <em>Milwaukee R. Co. </em>v. <em>Arms, supra, \u201c \u2018 </em>Gross negligence \u2019 is a relative term. It is doubtless to be understood as-meaning a greater want of care than is implied by the term \u2018 ordinary negligence;\u2019 but after all, it means the absence of the care that was necessary under the circumstances. In this sense the collision in controversy was the result of gross negligence, because the employees of the company did not use the care that was required to avoid the accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">The question of the degrees of negligence, as sometimes attempted to be applied, was very fully discussed and shown to be impracticable, by Mr. Justice Curtis, in the case of <em>The Steamboat New World </em>v. <em>King, </em>16 How. 469, referred to in 91 U. S. 494, from which we have quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">It is clear, therefore, that the allegation in the declaration that the injury complained of was occasioned by the <em>gross and wanton negligence </em>of the defendant\u2019s employee did not impose upon the plaintiff any other or greater burden of proof than to show that the employee of the defendant did not use the care that was required to avoid the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-11\">2. It is next contended, that inasmuch as the plaintiff has alleged in her declaration that- she received the injuries while in the exercise of ordinary care on her part, and that she was not guilty of any carelessness or negligence in causing the injury, she was bound to furnish affirmative proof in support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>of this allegation. This is the rule in some jurisdictions, but it is not the rule here. The allegation is not a material one to be made in the declaration, but being made, the natural instinct of self-preservation would stand in the place of positive evidence to support the allegation, until evidence by proof of contributory negligence furnished by the defendant, or that may be gathered from the evidence introduced by the plaintiff in proving the cause of action alleged in the declaration, overcomes this presumption in behalf of the plaintiff. Tbis rule has been applied in many cases; and it was applied in the case of <em>Massoth </em>v. <em>Delaware &amp; Hudson Canal Co., </em>64 N. Y. 524, which has been followed in subsequent cases. In that case the court was asked to rule tbat there was no affirmative testimony to show that the injured person looked to see where be was going as be approached tbe crossing; tbis ruling was refused, and tbe court held tbat the presumption tbat tbe injured person would look out for bis own safety might well control tbe case, and tbat it was right to leave tbe question of contributory negligence to the jury, as was fairly done in tbe present case, by tbe fourth instruction granted at tbe instance of tbe def endant. Tbe rule tbat prevails in tbis jurisdiction is, tbat tbe <em>onus </em>of proof is upon tbe plaintiff to establish bis case, by proof of the negligence of tbe defendant, the injuries resulting therefrom, and bis case is made out. If there be circumstances wbicb convict him of contributory negligence, tbe defendant must prove them and thus defeat the action. Irrespective of statute law on tbe subject, tbe burden of proof upon tbat subject does not rest upon tbe plaintiff to show himself free of blame, tbat is to say, tbe want of care on tbe part of tbe plaintiff is matter of defense, to be proved by tbe defendant. <em>Railroad Company </em>v. <em>Gladmon, </em>15 Wall. 401, 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">It follows tbat there is no ground for reversal in tbe second error assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">3. Tbe objection to tbe admissibility of tbe testimony of tbe witness Wills, [tbe appellee\u2019s son] as to bis custom in giving notice or warning to the family when tbe trap-door was to be opened, tbat they might avoid tbe danger of falling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>through it, is the subject of the third error assigned. We perceive no serious ground for the objection to this evidence. The testimony may not have been of any very direct importance ; but with the knowledge of the fact of such habitual notification, the plaintiff, in the absence of such notice, may have supposed that the trap-door remained closed as usual, and that it was therefore safe for her to step out of the room door on to the porch. It was a circumstance that could do no injury to the defendant, in view of the positive testimony of the plaintiff, that she did not know, and had no reason to suppose, that the trap-door was open.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">4. The next assignment of error presents a question of supposed variance between allegation and proof. The declaration alleges that the plaintiff sustained certain serious and permanent injuries, to wit, a fracture of the right arm near the shoulder, and several other serious bruises, etc.; and the proof in respect to the fracture of the arm showed that the fracture was just below the shoulder joint, and that the effect of the injury extended to and affected the joint and produced restriction thereof. We are at a loss to discover any reasonable ground for the objection to the evidence, because of any supposed variance. The fracture was just below the joint, ar.d the effect of the fracture produced the restriction of the joint, spoken of by the physician. The plaintiff was certainly entitled to give proof as to the nature of the fracture and of all the consequences produced thereby. It was not necessary that the declaration should have shown by allegation that the shoulder joint had been affected as a consequence of the fracture of the arm just below the joint. There is no ground for the error assigned in respect to this supposed variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">o. The fifth assignment of error relates to the prayers that were ruled upon by the court below. But the objections taken to the prayers granted at the instance of the plaintiff, and to the refusal to grant those offered by the defendant, are disposed of in what we have said in respect of the previous assignments of error. Upon careful examination, we find no error of which the defendant can complain, in any of the rulings of the court in disposing of the prayers for instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>tion, nor in that portion of the court\u2019s charge to the jury to which exception was taken by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Finding no error in the rulings of the court the judgment must be affirmed; and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
