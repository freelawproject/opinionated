In this respect there is no distinction between a probate homestead and one selected under the provisions of title 5 of division 2 of the Civil Code.

The statute regulating the matter does not require that they should ever have constituted his residence. The finding of the court is, that the property set apart is suitable and proper for a homestead, and that was a sufficient basis for the order setting it apart.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">It would seem, therefore, that a homestead, such as the one here set apart, \u201c'may be carved out of any property left by the decedent which is capable of being made a homestead.\u201d <em>(In re Bowman, supra, </em>citing <em>Estate of Busse, </em>35 Cal. 310.)</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">We do not understand the case of <em>In re Noah, </em>73 Cal. 590 (in which the opinion was written by the learned judge who concurred in what was said in <em>In re Bowman, supra), </em>to be in conflict with what is here said. It was there decided that premises could be set apart as a homestead if there was a house or \u201cedifice\u201d thereon \u201cwhich could be used as a dwelling-house,\u201d even if not occupied as such at the time the order setting it apart was made. It is there said, also, that it must be property \u201cwhich could have been selected as a homestead during the continuance of the marriage.\u201d But there is nothing in this record to show but what the premises here involved could have been selected as a homestead during the marriage, and could have been used as a dwelling-house.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">The appellant has abandoned all other contentions except the one discussed above. We advise that the order be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Belchee, 0. 0., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">Hayne, 0., took no part in the decision.</p>\n<author id=\"b515-10\">The Court.</author>\n<p id=\"Ael3\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion, the order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
