We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 llOSa(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-13\">We review factual determinations, including whether a petitioner is eligible for asylum, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Acewicz v. INS, </em>984 F.2d 1056, 1061 (9th Cir.1993). We must uphold the BIA\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary result. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-14\">Because the record does not compel the conclusion that Campos-Mena was persecuted or has a well-founded fear of persecution on account of actual or imputed political opinion, the BIA\u2019s conclusion that he did not establish eligibility for asylum is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See id. </em>at 482-83 (holding that guerrillas\u2019 forced recruitment is not persecution on account of political opinion unless the guerrillas acted \u201cbecause of\u2019 the applicant's political opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"Ae1\">It follows that Campos-Mena failed to satisfy the more stringent standard required to establish eligibility for withhold-mg of deportation. <em>See Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1429 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b624-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b624-23\">. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\"HRIRA\") repealed 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a and replaced it with a new judicial review provision codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. See IIRIRA \u00a7 306(c)(1), Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (Sept. 30, 1996), <em>as amended by </em>Act of Oct. 11, 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-302, 110 Stat. 3656. However, because the new review provision does not apply to petitioners whose deportation proceedings commenced before April 1, 1997, this court continues to have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a. See IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
