He contends that the district court erred in calculating his sentence by adding two levels under Section 4Al.l(d) of the Sentencing Guidelines by reason of his being on parole at the time of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-22\">Defendant had been previously convicted in New York State courts, had been placed on parole for purposes of deportation, and remained on parole at the time he was found illegally in the United States. We find no merit in defendant\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-23\">Defendant also contends in a pro se brief (1) that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel failed to argue at trial, as defendant allegedly requested, that he was denied counsel in the underlying deportation proceedings, and (2) that his sentence pursuant to the penalty provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is illegal under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We decline to entertain the former contention because it depends on communications between the defendant and his trial attorney that are not matters of record. <em>See United States v. Workman, </em>80 F.3d 688, 700-01 (2d Cir.1996). The latter contention lacks merit because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Supreme Court in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), held that 1326(b) \u201cdoes not set out a separate offense but rather is a penalty provision with respect to \u00a7 1326(a),\u201d and because the <em>Ap-prendi </em>decision expressly declined to overrule the holding of <em>Almendarez-Torres. See United States v. Latorre-Benavides, </em>241 F.3d 262, 263-64 (2d Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 121 S.Ct. 201, 149 L.Ed.2d 10143 (2001).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
