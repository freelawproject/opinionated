Cir. R. 27(f) and to dismiss Alvin R. Nash\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Nash has not responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-7\">The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims dismissed as untimely Nash\u2019s September 15, 2000 appeal of the February 14, 2000 decision of the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals. Nash appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-8\">Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292, not every decision entered by the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims is appealable. Section 7292(a) provides that a party may only seek review of a decision of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims with respect to the validity or interpretation of any statute or regulation relied on by the court in making its decision. Further, except to the extent that an appeal presents a constitutional issue, this court may not review \u201c(A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2). If an appellant\u2019s case does not meet these criteria, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d) requires this court to dismiss the appeal. <em>See In re Bailey, </em>182 F.3d 860 (Fed.Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-9\">In his informal brief, Nash discusses the merits of his underlying ease but does not address the timeliness of his notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. Because Nash .does not challenge any part of the decision of the Veterans Court, Nash\u2019s appeal must be dismissed. <em>See Livingston v. Derwinski, </em>959 F.2d 224, 225-26 (Fed.Cir.1992); 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d); <em>Albun v. Brown, </em>9 F.3d 1528 (Fed.Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-11\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b946-12\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b946-13\">(1) The Secretary\u2019s motion to waive the requirements of Fed. Cir. R. 27(f) is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-14\">(2) The Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-15\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
