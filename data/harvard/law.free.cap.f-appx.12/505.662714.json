The district court construed the contractual documents, reviewed the medical reports, and concluded that Paul Revere had not \u201cwrongfully terminated\u201d her benefits for disability by arbitrarily nullifying a longer benefit period for a physical cause of disability and substituting a shorter benefit period for a mental cause of disability. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-15\">Dames worked as an office manager at Image Builder Software, Inc. After complaining that she was sexually harassed at work, Dames sought medical attention from Dr. Barbara Graham, an internist. Dr. Graham concluded that Dames was experiencing insomnia and \u201csituational depression\u201d due to \u201csevere psychological stressors\u201d at work. She recommended a six-week leave of absence and prescribed Paxil, an anti-depressant medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-16\">While continuing on leave, Dames again visited Dr. Graham, who diagnosed: \u201cInsomnia secondary to severe psychological stressors. Her situational depression is deepening.\u201d She recommended that Dames begin treatment with a mental therapist and continue taking anti-depressants.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-17\">In October 1995, Dames made a claim for disability benefits under her employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>er\u2019s disability insurance policy issued by Paul Revere. Dames\u2019s claim form stated that her disability stemmed from \u201cinsomnia/stress.\u201d In connection with the claim, Dr. Graham diagnosed situational depression, and cited \u201cDSM-IV code 309\u201d, which covers \u201cadjustment disorders with depressed mood.\u201d Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.) at 623. Paul Revere notified Dames of its \u201cconditional approval\u201d of her request for long-term disability benefits, and began paying benefits from October 31,1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">In November 1995, Dames complained of numbness and tingling in her left pinky finger and left anterior shin. Neurologist Bradley Bergquist examined Dames and diagnosed a \u201cleft ulnar neuropathy,\u201d a disease of the left ulnar nerve. Dr. Graham agreed that \u201cshe has an ulnar neuropathy\u201d and that she still suffered from insomnia and situational depression. She extended Dames\u2019s leave of absence from work through the end of November. On November 13, 1995 Dames visited another neurologist, Dr. David Dine. She complained of numbness and itchiness in her left arm and leg, blurred vision, and headaches. Dr. Dine made no diagnosis. When Dames did not return to work after her medical leave of absence expired, Image Builder fired her.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">In December 1995, Dames began treatment with Carylee Eaton, a clinical social worker. Dames reported that she was feeling inadequate, angry and depressed, and that she slept poorly and had nightmares about her employer. She also reported pain in her left hand and leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">In February 1996, Paul Revere conditionally approved Dames\u2019s claim for disability benefits, and paid benefits to March 1, 1996. Paul Revere told Dames that its approval of her claim was subject to the policy\u2019s 24-month limit on benefits for disability \u201ccaused or contributed to by a psychiatric disorder.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Dames did not then dispute the conditional approval for the 24 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">In April 1996, Dr. Guy Paltrow performed a psychiatric evaluation of Dames, who complained of insomnia, headaches, loss of appetite, nausea, sparkles before her eyes, and a history of numbness in her left arm and leg. After a comprehensive evaluation and several tests, Dr. Paltrow diagnosed Dames with \u201cPost Traumatic Stress Disorder.\u201d Dr. Paltrow stated that Dames\u2019s psychiatric symptoms rendered her unable to perform one or more of the important duties of her job. He recommended psychiatric treatment. This report was consistent with psychiatric disability but did not discuss the effect of Dames\u2019 physical problems on her disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">During 1996 and 1997, Dames continued to see Dr. Paltrow. Dr. Paltrow sent a statement to Paul Revere monthly. Each statement contained the same diagnosis: (1) post-traumatic stress disorder and (2) psychological factors affecting medical condition. None of the statements attributed Dames\u2019 disability to physical sources. One narrative statement from January 1997 mentioned Dames\u2019 arm and leg pains, but did not diagnose their sources or state that they made her disabled. Paltrow\u2019s July 1997 report to the State of Oregon Depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>ment of Human Resources reiterated the diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">A month before the expiration of the 24-month benefit period, Dames for the first time claimed that she also had a physical disability. She said that she had been experiencing left arm, hand, and leg pain since August 1995, and had sought treatment for the problems before she was fired in November 1995. She stated that she had been unable to get treatment or a diagnosis thereafter due to her lack of medical insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">In October 1997, Paul Revere notified Dames that her benefits were being terminated, and Dames appealed. She wrote to Paul Revere that she was disabled by fi-bromyalgia.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> She included a report from Dr. Gary Sultany confirming that she had fibromyalgia, but expressing no opinion whether fibromyalgia was disabling.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">A rheumatologist, Dr. Barkhuizen examined Dames in October 1997. In his \u201cassessment\u201d of her condition, he wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-7\">This patient has widespread pain, multiple somatic complaints and multiple tender points compatible with the fibro-myalgia syndrome. A clearly stressful event preceded many of her symptoms associated with the sexual harassment and law suit. She has a significant element of the restless leg syndrome and has had major difficulties in functioning related to chronic pain, fatigue, and cognitive difficulties as well as multiple somatic complaints.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Again, a medical consultant had examined her but did not discuss whether her condition was disabling. He recommended a treatment plan that included stretching, exercise, and psychiatric treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-11\">Paul Revere denied Dames\u2019s appeal. It said that, assuming she had fibromyalgia in addition to her psychiatric disorders, her disability had been \u201ccaused or contributed to by a psychiatric disorder.\u201d Thus, the policy\u2019s 24-month limit applied. The policy stated that Paul Revere had \u201cfull, final, conclusive, and binding authority to construe and interpret [the policy]... as may be necessary to make any and all decisions and determinations under such policies. A decision of the Claims Administrator shall not be overturned unless it is arbitrary and capricious or unless there is no rational basis for the decision.\u201d This language is identical to that used in <em>Grosz-Salomon v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., </em>237 F.3d 1154, 1161 (9th Cir.2001), where we approved the abuse of discretion standard in the administration of similar ERISA plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-12\">The district court correctly held that the policy conferred discretion on Paul Revere, and reviewed the decision to deny benefits for abuse of discretion. On cross motions for summary judgment, Dames submitted an affidavit from Dr. Paltrow, which stated that she suffered from \u201ccomorbidity.\u201d (Both the depression and the pain from the fibromyalgia). He explained that \u201c[c]omorbidity is a concomitant but unrelated pathologic or disease process; usually used in epidemiology to indicate the coexistence of two or more disease processes.\u201d He stated that Dames\u2019s comorbidity involved PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder) and fibromyal-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>gia. But this report stated nothing about which malady caused her disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The court granted Paul Revere\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied that of Dames. It held that Paul Revere had acted within its discretion, because evidence supported its conclusion that Dames\u2019s disability was caused or contributed to by a psychiatric disorder. The evidence did not support Dames\u2019s theory that her fibromyalgia was disabling.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">In Dames\u2019s reply brief on appeal, and supplemental excerpts of record, she introduces a medical report by the Chairman of the Division of Arthritis and Rheumatic Diseases at Oregon Health Sciences University, Dr. Robert Bennett, which the district court had excluded as untimely. Paul Revere moved in this court to strike the report, because Dames did not appeal the district court\u2019s decision to exclude it. We grant the motion. As highly qualified as Dr. Bennett may be, his report was part neither of the administrative record in the Paul Revere review nor of the district court record, and accordingly is not before us. We note, however, that it would not have changed the result if it had been considered by the district court, because, again, it is another doctor\u2019s opinion that Dames was suffering from fibromyalgia, but it was silent on the cause of disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b534-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
