We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">On June 8, 1992, Hickman was arrested in New York City in connection with a conspiracy to distribute cocaine. Pursuant to a court order entered June 18, Hickman was removed to the District of Vermont. On July 7, the Government moved for a 45-day extension of time to file an indictment, and, on July 16, the district court granted a 20-day extension pursuant to \u00a7 3161(h)(8)(B)(iii). The indictment was filed on August 4. Hickman and his co-defendants proceeded to trial and were convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">On direct appeal, Hickman\u2019s co-defendants \u2014 but not Hickman himself \u2014 argued that their right to a speedy trial pursuant to \u00a7 3161(b) was violated. This court rejected the claim, <em>see United States v. Washington, </em>48 F.3d 73, 77 (2d Cir.1995), and affirmed the convictions of all of the defendants. <em>See id. </em>at 81. It stated that the extension was \u201creasonably related to the needs of the case,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 77 (internal quotation marks omitted), and that the complaint \u201cthat the extension enabled the government to conduct a more thorough grand jury investigation than it could have conducted otherwise ... does not satisfy the required showing of prejudice.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-14\">Hickman then filed the present \u00a7 2241 petition, contending that the speedy trial clock was not tolled by the district court\u2019s 20-day extension because the district court did not act in accordance with \u00a7 3161(h)(8)(A). Hickman also argues that \u00a7 2241 is the proper vehicle by which to bring his claim because \u00a7 2255 provides an inadequate or ineffective remedy. The district court denied Hickman\u2019s petition, concluding that (1) the indictment was not open to collateral attack in a \u00a7 2255 motion, and (2) the unavailability of review did not render \u00a7 2255 an ineffective or inadequate remedy such that Hickman may utilize \u00a7 2241. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-17\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b71-18\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for a writ of <em>habeas corpus de novo. See Lurie v. Wittner, </em>228 F.3d 113, 121 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-19\">Because Hickman did not raise the speedy trial issue on direct appeal or in a <em>habeas petition </em>pursuant to \u00a7 2255, he can only succeed under \u00a7 2241 if the remedy under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. A court must consider a prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition when \u201cthe petitioner cannot, for whatever reason, utilize \u00a7 2255, and ... the failure to allow for collateral review would raise serious constitutional questions.\u201d <em>Triestman v. United States, </em>124 F.3d 361, 377 (2d Cir.1997). Serious constitutional questions arise if a person who could prove his actual innocence on the existing record \u2014 and who could not have effectively raised his claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>of innocence at an earlier time \u2014 was denied access to a writ of <em>habeas corpus. See Id. </em>at 377-80. The district court notwithstanding, Hickman might well have been able to raise the speedy trial issue in a timely \u00a7 2255 petition. <em>See United States v. Ousley, </em>100 F.3d 75, 76 (7th Cir.1996) (implying that a \u00a7 3161 speedy trial violation may be brought under \u00a7 2255). Moreover, Hickman does not assert that he is actually innocent. Accordingly, he has failed to show that his case raises serious constitutional questions, and \u00a7 2241 does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">On appeal, Hickman argues, for the first time, that he did not raise the speedy trial issue on direct appeal due to ineffective assistance of counsel. Generally, this court does not review on appeal claims that were not first raised in the district court, <em>see Sales v. Harris, </em>675 F.2d 532, 540 (2d Cir.1982). In any event, Hickman\u2019s ineffective assistance claim would ordinarily be cognizable under \u00a7 2255 and cannot, in the circumstances of this case, be raised under \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">We have considered all of Hickman\u2019s claims and found them to be without merit. We therefore AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
