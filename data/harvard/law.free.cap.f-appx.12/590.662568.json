Hamdan appeal pro se a decision of the United States Tax Court upholding the Commissioner of Internal Revenue\u2019s determination of income tax deficiencies for tax year 1989, and an accuracy-related penalty under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6662(a) for negligence. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7482. We review for clear error the factual findings of the Tax Court, <em>Wolf v. Commissioner, </em>4 F.3d 709, 712 (9th Cir.1993), and the Tax Court\u2019s finding that the Hamdans were negligent, <em>Custom Chrome, Inc. v. Commissioner, 217 </em>F.3d 1117, 1121 (9th Cir.2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">The Hamdans have failed to establish that the \u201cprofit participation fee\u201d was an ordinary and necessary business expense, and have failed to sufficiently document the travel and automobile deduction. We conclude that the Tax Court did not clearly err in finding that the Hamdans did not establish that the \u201cprofit participation fee\u201d and travel and automobile expenses were ordinary and necessary business expenses deductible under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 162(a). See <em>INDOPCO, Inc., v. Commissioner, </em>503 U.S. 79, 83, 112 S.Ct. 1039, 117 L.Ed.2d 226 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">With regards to Hamdan\u2019s advances to Hamdan Project Development, the lack of any documentation of the terms of repayment or security agreement on the amount of money advanced does not support a finding that these advances were deductible as worthless loans. We conclude that the Tax Court did not clearly err in finding that the advances made to Hamdan Project Development by the Hamdans were capital contributions and not loans. <em>See Hardman v. United States, </em>827 F.2d 1409, 1411-12 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-11\">We conclude that the Tax Court did not clearly err in finding the Hamdans negligent and assessing them an accuracy-related penalty under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6662(a). <em>See Custom Chrome, Inc., </em>217 F.3d at 1128.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-12\">The Hamdans\u2019 contentions regarding 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1244 and an unnamed section of the Internal Revenue Code were raised for the first time on appeal. Because the Hamdans have not made a showing of exceptional circumstances, we will not consider these arguments. <em>See El Paso City of Tex. v. Am. W. Airlines, Inc. (In re Am. W. Airlines, Inc.), 217 </em>F.3d 1161, 1165 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b619-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
