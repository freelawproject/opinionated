Mau-rey claims that he was fired and not rehired as the director of a federally funded program at USC because of his race and in violation of his employment contract. After various pre-trial proceedings, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants. Maurey timely appealed, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2000). We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Because the parties are familiar with the facts of this case, we recount them here only where necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">1. Recusal</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Maurey sought to recuse the presiding judge, Judge Manella, based on Judge Ma-nella\u2019s affiliations with USC Law School. Pursuant to court rules, Maurey\u2019s recusal motion was referred to another district court judge, Judge King, for decision. Judge King refused to recuse Judge Ma-nella.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">We review for an abuse of discretion Judge King\u2019s refusal to recuse Judge Manella. <em>United States ex rel. Hochman v. Nackman, </em>145 F.3d 1069, 1076 (9th Cir.1998). As discussed below, Judge King did not abuse his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">Judge King correctly determined that the facts that Judge Manella (1) is an alumna of USC Law School, (2) donated small yearly contributions to the law school, (3) participated in a law school fundraiser by donating her presence at an auctioned-off meal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (4) served as a guest judge at USC Law School\u2019s moot court competition, amount to no more than ordinary involvement of an alumna with her alma mater and do not call into question her impartiality. <em>See Hochman, </em>145 F.3d at 1076 (finding similar affiliations to be \u201cminimal alumni contacts\u201d that did not call into question the judge\u2019s impartiality); <em>see also Lunde v. Helms, </em>29 F.3d 367, 370 (8th Cir.1994) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-12\">Judge King noted that Judge Manella\u2019s membership on USC Law School\u2019s Board of Councilors was more than ordinary alumni contact with her alma mater. However, by itself, the existence of such a relationship does not show that Judge Ma-nella has a financial interest in or is a fiduciary of USC. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(b)(4). As Judge King correctly observed, Maurey makes no \u201callegations that Judge Manella\u2019s role on the Board of Councilors entangled her with any USC, or even Law School, financial interests that are related to this suit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-13\">Judge King did not abuse his discretion in refusing to recuse Judge Manella from presiding over Maurey\u2019s case against USC and Dean Blakely.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-14\">2. Maurey\u2019s Request to Reopen Discovery</p>\n<p id=\"b560-15\">After discovery was closed and after the defendants had filed them motions for summary judgment, Maurey\u2019s attorney asked the district court to reopen discovery so that he could depose certain witnesses. The district court rejected the request, finding that Maurey\u2019s attorney had not been diligent in pursuing discovery. We review for an abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s refusal to reopen discovery before ruling on summary judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>ment. <em>Conkle v. Jeong, </em>73 F.3d 909, 914 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Maurey bears the burden of showing the necessity for more time and why the previously allotted time was insufficient. <em>See id. \u201cWe </em>will only find that the district court abused its discretion if the movant diligently pursued its <em>previous </em>discovery opportunities, and if the movant can show how allowing <em>additional </em>discovery would have precluded summary judgment.\u201d <em>Byrd v. Guess, </em>137 F.3d 1126, 1135 (9th Cir.1998) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Judge Manella\u2019s finding that Maurey\u2019s attorney was not diligent in conducting discovery is amply supported by the record. Among other things, Judge Manella already extended the discovery deadline once from January 31 to February 22, 1999. Despite this extension, and despite several offers from defense counsel, Maurey\u2019s attorney failed to depose within the extended deadline the witnesses he now deems critical.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">3. Evidentiary Rulings During Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">In ruling on defendants\u2019 summary judgment motions, the district court (a) considered the declaration of EDA official Leonard Smith, and (b) refused to consider the recanted declaration of Thomas McClure, the head of the critical peer review team. We review for an abuse of discretion these types of evidentiary rulings. <em>See Kennedy v. Collagen Corp., </em>161 F.3d 1226, 1227 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">a. Leonard Smith\u2019s Declaration</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">According to Maurey, Leonard Smith\u2019s declaration was unlawful and inadmissible because EDA regulations prevent EDA officials, like Smith, from giving testimony absent the express consent of the EDA General Counsel. We disagree. Even if Smith violated EDA internal regulations by providing a declaration without the consent of the EDA General Counsel or other authorized official, <em>see </em>15 C.F.R. \u00a7 15.13, his declaration is not inadmissible. In fact, the regulations clearly state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-12\">If an employee is unaware of the regulations in this subpart and provides expert or opinion testimony regarding official DOC information, subjects or activities without the aforementioned consultation, the witness shall, as soon after testifying as possible, inform the General Counsel ... that such testimony was given and provide a written summary of the expert or opinion testimony provided.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-13\">15 C.F.R. \u00a7 15.16. Accordingly, the \u201cremedy\u201d for Smith\u2019s alleged failure to obtain the consent of the EDA General Counsel is for Smith to inform the EDA General Counsel that he gave a declaration and provide a summary of that declaration. <em>See id. </em>The declaration need not be stricken. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b561-14\">b. Thomas McClure\u2019s Declaration</p>\n<p id=\"b561-15\">Maurey next claims that the district court should have considered Thomas McClure\u2019s declaration, even though it had been sent by mistake, because \u201c[a]t worst, Mr. McClure\u2019s request to withdraw his declaration created a triable issue as to what his testimony \u2014 and hence the true facts of this case \u2014 really are.\u201d Without belaboring the point, it is clear that well before the summary judgment hearing, McClure made it abundantly lucid to everyone involved, including Maurey\u2019s counsel, that his secretary faxed the declaration by mistake. A court need not consider such a declaration. <em>See United States v. Holst, </em>897 F.Supp. 474, 475 (D.Or.1995) (noting that witness \u201chas withdrawn that declaration and [the court] need not address it further\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>4. Summary Judgment Decisions</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">The district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on Maurey\u2019s reverse race discrimination and breach of contract claims. We review de novo the district court\u2019s grants of summary judgment. <em>Nidds v. Schindler Elevator Corp., </em>113 F.3d 912, 916 (9th Cir.1996). The test is whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party (Maurey), there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">a. Race Discrimination Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">In race discrimination cases, the Supreme Court has developed a three-part test for courts to apply: (1) the plaintiff must first prove a prima facie case of race discrimination; (2) if the plaintiff meets this burden, the burden of production shifts to the defendants to offer a legitimate, nondiseriminatory reason for their actions; (3) the plaintiff must then produce evidence which raises a genuine factual issue as to whether defendant\u2019s reasons are merely a pretext for racial discrimination. If plaintiff\u2019s evidence is lacking, summary judgment is proper for defendant. <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973); <em>Nidds, </em>113 F.3d at 916-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Maurey demonstrated a prima facie case of discrimination, which is questionable, we agree with Judge Manella that defendants offered a legitimate, nondiseriminatory reason for firing and not rehiring Maurey as the director of the University Center\u2014 Maurey\u2019s poor performance. Contrary to Maurey\u2019s characterization, the Peer Review Report was critical of Maurey and his director capabilities. The report initially describes the Center as \u201ca one-man program\u201d with Maurey being that man, and then maligns the Center for its lack of a \u201cstrategic plan,\u201d its \u201cfractious approach to community and economic development,\u201d and its failure to \u201cunderstand [the] purpose of [the] EDA University Center Program.\u201d Further, Leonard Smith of the EDA instructed Dean Blakely to put together a \u201cfresh team\u201d for the new Center because the old Center\u2019s performance, under Maurey\u2019s directorship, had not been up to par. The critical peer review report and Smith\u2019s instructions provided to defendants a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for not rehiring Maurey as the director of the Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">Maurey responds that Dean Blakely\u2019s alleged history of anti-white animus shows that defendants\u2019 non-discriminatory reason is merely pretextual. Among other things, Maurey claims that Dean Blakely described Maurey to another USC official, Dean David Shawaker, as having \u201ctwo strikes against him in economic development. First, he isn\u2019t black or Hispanic. Second, he lacks demonstrated credentials.\u201d However, Dean Shawaker testified that \u201cDean Blakely was making a dispassionate observation about the community, which still harbors some racial bias, rather than expressing a racist bias in himself.\u201d Similarly, Dean Blakely declared that his comment to Dean Shawaker only reflected complaints he had received from the community about Maurey. Maurey offered no evidence to rebut the contextual gloss provided by Deans Blakely and Shawaker, and thus he failed to raise a <em>genuine </em>issue of material fact regarding pretext. <em>See Nidds, </em>113 F.3d at 916-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">Furthermore, Maurey\u2019s allegations in no way impugn the credibility of the peer review report itself. Judge Manella summed it up best:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>The Peer Review Report was conducted by competent professionals who were affiliated neither with Blakely nor with USC. Maurey produces no evidence showing the defendants \u201ccooked up\u201d the report in order to fire him. In fact, Maurey does not attack the credibility of the report at all, and presents no evidence from which a reasonable factfin-der could conclude that the true reason Maurey was not rehired was anti-white animus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">In sum, Maurey\u2019s allegations of racial bias, wholly without evidentiary support, are insufficient to show pretext, and thus do not defeat the defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion. <em>See Wallis v. J.R. Simplot Co., </em>26 F.3d 885, 890-91 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">b. Breach of Contract Claim</p>\n<p id=\"AMM\">Maurey admits that he signed an at-will employment agreement with USC in 1992. However, he argues that USC administrators made several comments that led him to believe he could only be fired for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">California case law forecloses Maurey\u2019s argument. The California Supreme Court recently noted that \u201cmost cases applying California law ... have held that an at-will provision in an <em>express written agreement, </em>signed by the employee, <em>cannot </em>be overcome by proof of an implied contrary understanding.\u201d <em>Guz v. Bechtel Nat\u2019l, Inc., </em>24 Cal.4th 317, 100 Cal.Rptr.2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089, 1103 (2000). Maurey\u2019s assertion that USC officials intimated that he could be fired only for cause cannot create an implied contract in the face of the written, signed at-will employment contract. <em>See id.; see also Starzynski v. Capital Pub. Radio, </em>88 Cal. App.4th 33, 105 Cal.Rptr.2d 525, 529 (2001) (\u201c[P]laintiffis assertion that his supervisor gave him oral assurances of continued employment cannot create an implied contract in the face of the written acknowledgment signed by plaintiff that his employment was at-will.\u201d). Given Maurey\u2019s failure to show actionable discrimination, his at-will employment agreement ends our inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">5. Dismissal on the Pleadings</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">Maurey\u2019s sixth claim for relief, entitled \u201cBreach of Contract,\u201d alleged that USC breached its employment contract with Maurey by firing him without good cause. Maurey\u2019s seventh claim for relief, entitled \u201cBreach of Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing,\u201d alleged that the employment contract between Maurey and USC contained an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which USC breached when it fired Maurey. The district court dismissed on the pleadings Maurey\u2019s seventh claim because it was duplicative of the sixth.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss Maurey\u2019s seventh cause of action, <em>see Farjardo v. County of Los Angeles, </em>179 F.3d 698, 699 (9th Cir.1999), and in doing so, we look to California cases for guidance in determining whether Maurey\u2019s two state law claims are duplicative.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">Maurey argues that his claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith is distinct from his claim for breach of contract because \u201c[a]n employee whose express contract claims are barred by the \u2018at-will\u2019 doctrine may still have a bad faith claim.\u201d The California Supreme Court has cl\u00e9arly rejected Maurey\u2019s argument, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-13\">[I]nsofar as the employer\u2019s acts are directly actionable as a breach of an implied-in-fact contract term, a claim that merely realleges that breach as a violation of the covenant is superfluous. This is because ... the remedy for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>breach of an employment agreement, including the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied by the law therein is <em>solely contractual. </em>In the employment context, an implied covenant theory affords no separate <em>measure of recovery </em>such as tort damages. Allegations that the breach was wrongful, in bad faith, arbitrary, and unfair are unavailing; there is not tort of \u201cbad faith breach\u201d of an employment contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-4\"><em>Guz, </em>100 Cal.Rptr.2d 352, 8 P.3d at 1112 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Thus, the district properly dismissed on the pleadings Maurey\u2019s claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b559-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b560-9\">. We note that when Judge Manella participated in the USC Law School fundraiser, she was not a federal district court judge. Rather, she was the United States Attorney for the Central District of California. Accordingly, we are not asked to opine on whether <em>judicial </em>participation in such fundraising efforts is consistent with the Code of Conduct for United States Judges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b560-16\">. We reject also Maurey's claim that he was denied due process because Judge King is himself an alumnus of USC Law School. First, Maurey identifies nothing about Judge King\u2019s relationship with USC Law School that amounts to more than ordinary alumnus involvement with his alma mater. <em>See Hoch-man, </em>145 F.3d at 1076. Second, the fact that Maurey\u2019s recusal motion was referred to an independent judge supports our conclusion that Maurey was afforded due process.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
