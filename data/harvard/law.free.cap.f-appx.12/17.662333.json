After careful review of the record, in particular the parties\u2019 summary judgment submissions, we conclude that his claims of error lack merit. We affirm, essentially for the reasons given by the district court in its Order dated October 31, 2000. We make only the following additional comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">We see no need to determine whether the district court erroneously declined to consider certain claims on the ground that they had been dismissed pursuant to a prior order by a magistrate judge. As the record establishes, summary judgment on these claims in favor of defendants would have been warranted, in any event. There was no factual basis for the claim that defendants had violated Michaud\u2019s First Amendment rights when his then estranged wife, Linda Michaud, who was the custodial parent, sent him away from her father\u2019s residence without letting him visit his children on June 13,1996. In an affidavit, Michaud informed the district court that his visitation hours on the day in question concluded at 5 p.m., and defendants\u2019 affidavits establish that he arrived at his father-in-law\u2019s house at approximately 5:20 p.m. That is, the undisputed facts establish that Michaud had no right to visit with his children at the time in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">In addition, there was no factual basis for the claim that defendants made false reports to an assistant state attorney general, thereby obtaining, without probable cause, his authorization to wiretap Michaud\u2019s telephone conversation with his wife on June 13, 1996. During discovery, defendants gave sworn responses to Michaud\u2019s interrogatories, stating unequivocally that they had never knowingly made false reports to the attorney general\u2019s office. In responding to defendants\u2019 interrogatories, Michaud declined to even identify the defendants\u2019 alleged falsehoods. Accordingly, summary judgment in defendants\u2019 favor was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-12\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
