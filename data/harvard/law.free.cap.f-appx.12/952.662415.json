Cir. R. 27(f) and to dismiss DeForrorra Locust\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Locust opposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-8\">The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims dismissed as untimely Locust\u2019s 2000 appeal of a 1996 Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals decision. Locust appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292, not every decision entered by the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims is appealable. Section 7292(a) provides that a party may only seek review of a decision of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims with respect to the validity or interpretation of any statute or regulation relied on by the court in making its decision. Further, except to the extent that an appeal presents a constitutional issue, this court may not review \u201c(A) a challenge to a \"factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2). If an appellant\u2019s case does not meet these criteria, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d) requires this court to dismiss the appeal. <em>See In re Bailey, </em>182 F.3d 860 (Fed.Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-10\">In his response to the motion to dismiss, Locust states that he is entitled to \u201cdefault judgment.\u201d Locust does not challenge the basis of the Veterans Court\u2019s decision, lack of jurisdiction due to the untimely filing of his notice of appeal. Because Locust is not challenging the validity or interpretation of a statute or regulation, or asserting a constitutional issue, this court\u2019s limited jurisdiction does not permit review. <em>See Livingston v. Derwinski, </em>959 F.2d 224, 225-26 (Fed.Cir.1992); 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d); <em>Albun v. Brown, </em>9 F.3d 1528 (Fed.Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-12\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b981-13\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b981-14\">(1) The Secretary\u2019s motion to waive the requirements of Fed. Cir. R. 27(f) is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-15\">(2) The Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-16\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
