We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>No. CR-90-135-JFM (D.Md. Dec. 8, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-12\">Wilson also asserted in the district court that he should be resentenced in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Although the district court did not specifically address this claim, we find that Wilson is not entitled to relief because the claim is \u201cnot authorized by \u00a7 3582(c), for it is unrelated to any change in the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>241 F.3d 546, 548 (7th Cir.2001). As a result, Wilson\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>argument \u201cis instead the sort of contention usually raised by motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We recently held, however, that <em>Apprendi </em>is not retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review. <em>United States v. Sanders, </em>247 F.3d 139, 146 (4th Cir.2001). Thus, we reject Wilson\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-13\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
