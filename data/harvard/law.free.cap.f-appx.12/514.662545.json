Because the parties are familiar with the facts and procedural history of the case, we will not recount it here. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Cunaca\u2019s motion pursuant to Fed. R.Crim.P. 29(c) for a mistrial based on juror misconduct. When addressing potential misconduct, \u201cit is within the trial judge\u2019s discretion to determine whether and when to hold an evidentiary hearing on such allegations. If the judge orders an investigative hearing, it is within his discretion to determine its extent and nature.\u201d <em>United States v. Hendrix, </em>549 F.2d 1225, 1227-28 (9th Cir.1977). Furthermore, the defendant must show prejudice: \u201cThe test is whether or not the misconduct has prejudiced the defendant to the extent that he has not received a fair trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Klee, </em>494 F.2d 394, 396 (9th Cir.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">We need not decide whether the trial judge should have conducted a hearing upon receiving the juror\u2019s note because any error in declining to do so was harmless. At the post-trial hearing, the juror in question testified that she believed the jury truly deliberated, and that more than one vote was taken before the jury reached its verdict. Here, as in <em>Klee, </em>\u201cthe juror\u2019s [testimony] does not assert that any of the jurors relied upon any evidence outside of the record in reaching their verdict, nor does it assert that any of the jurors actually decided upon the defendant\u2019s guilt before the case was submitted to them.\u201d In short, there is no evidence that any preliminary juror discussions affected the verdict or deprived the defendant of a fair trial. Absent prejudice, the defendant cannot prevail on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">Assuming, without deciding, that the district court erred in admitting testimony concerning the computer referral of Cunaca\u2019s car to secondary inspection, any error was harmless. The evidence was cumulative of documentary evidence admitted without objection. More importantly, Cunaca makes no showing-nor could he-that the error more probably than not contributed to the conviction. <em>United States v. Lui </em>941 F.2d 844, 848 (9th Cir.1991). Proof of guilt was overwhelming.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b543-12\">The district court did not clearly err in denying Cunaca\u2019s request for a \u00a7 3B1.2 minor role adjustment. USSG \u00a7 3B1.2 (providing for a two-level downward adjustment if the defendant played only a \u201cminor role\u201d in the criminal enterprise). The district court based its denial on the following facts: (1) Cunaca had lied about where he had purchased his car; (2) Cunaca had driven over 16,000 miles in the car between April and November; (3) Cunaca had over $300 in cash on his person when he was apprehended; and (4) the quantity and purity of the drugs in Cunaca\u2019s car, which indicated that Cunaca was a known and trusted courier. Under these circumstances, the denial of a minor role adjustment was not clearly erroneous. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Hursh, </em>217 F.3d 761, 770 (9th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Lui, </em>941 F.2d 844, 849 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b542-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
