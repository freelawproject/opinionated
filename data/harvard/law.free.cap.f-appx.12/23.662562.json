(\u201cClemons\u201d) and Sidney J. Bernstein, Inc. (\u201cSJB\u201d). The court found that MM failed to establish a prima facie case on its negligence and <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court also excluded expert testimony proffered by appellants because it found that the testimony was \u201cspeculation ... premised on speculation.\u201d <em>Mink Mart, Inc. v. Reliance Ins. Co., </em>65 F.Supp.2d 176, 181 (S.D.N.Y.1999). MM appeals only from that part of the judgment dismissing its <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-17\">On the morning of July 28, 1992, water dripping from the ceiling of Mink Mart\u2019s fur vaults damaged the furs and skins contained therein. MM claims that the damage flowed from leaks in the air conditioning units on the tenth floor, located directly above the ninth-floor vaults. Clemons, the building\u2019s landlord, and SJB, its managing agent, contend that the source of the damage was the stoppage and overflow of a bathroom sink on the tenth floor. MM claims that Clemons and SJB would be liable for damage caused by leaks in the air conditioning units.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-18\">In order to establish a <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>claim, the plaintiff must show three elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>1) the event must be of a kind which ordinarily does not occur in the absence of someone\u2019s negligence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-5\">2) it must be <em>caused </em>by an agency or instrumentality within the exclusive control of the defendant; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\">3) it must not have been due to any voluntary action or contribution on the part of the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-7\"><em>Ebanks v. New York City Transit Auth., </em>70 N.Y.2d 621, 623, 518 N.Y.S.2d 776, 512 N.E.2d 297 (1987) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">The district court found that MM failed to \u201ccome forward with evidence showing that there was an air-conditioner leak.\u201d <em>Mink Mart, </em>65 F.Supp.2d at 182. The only \u201cevidence\u201d put forth by MM\u2014 other than the expert testimony excluded by the district court, which exclusion MM does not challenge on appeal \u2014 to suggest that the air-conditioners were the \u201cagency or instrumentality\u201d that caused the water damage were invoices from Winston Mechanical Corporation showing that air-conditioner repairs had been made on July 27, 1992 and August 5, 1992. However, the July 27 invoice indicated that all operating and safety controls were tested on that date, and did not report any leaks, nor did the August 5 invoice report any leaks. Moreover, MM nowhere suggests that any other leakage event occurred either before or after the date of the water damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">MM speculates in its appellate brief that Winston Mechanical\u2019s replacement of a condensing unit on July 27 caused damage to pipes feeding water to the air conditioning units, resulting in the water discharge. Although <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>\u201cpermits the inference that an unusual occurrence re-suited from defendant\u2019s negligence,\u201d <em>Weeden v. Armor Elevator Co., </em>97 A.D.2d 197, 468 N.Y.S.2d 898, 903 (2d Dep\u2019t 1983), liability \u201cmust rest on more than speculation, guess or surmise.\u201d <em>Cooke v. Bernstein, </em>45 A.D.2d 497, 359 N.Y.S.2d 793, 797 (1st Dep\u2019t 1974). Because MM\u2019s causation argument is purely conjectural and enjoys no support in the record, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment against MM on its <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-12\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b52-12\">. Mink Mart settled its claims with Reliance prior to issuance of the opinion below, and Reliance then joined Mink Mart's suit against Clemons and SJB.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b52-19\"><em>. </em>It is undisputed that Clemons and SJB would not be liable if the damage flowed from the bathroom sinks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b53-10\">. As MM failed to establish the second element of the <em>res ipsa </em>test, it is unnecessary to address the test's remaining prongs.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
