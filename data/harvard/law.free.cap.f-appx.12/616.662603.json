We review due process claims de novo.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review credibility findings for substantial evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Minor inconsistencies, however, \u201care not an adequate basis for an adverse credibility finding.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-23\">The BIA denied Kaur due process by affording little evidentiary weight to copies of documents Kaur submitted. Kaur testified that she sent the originals to the INS just before an INS deadline. She produced a return receipt. The INS could not locate the originals and there was nothing else filed in Kaur\u2019s file around the date of the return receipt. Kaur\u2019s file, however, contained materials for another asylum applicant that had been mis-filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-24\">The evidence compels a finding that the INS lost the originals Kaur sent. Penalizing Kaur for the INS\u2019 loss by attributing little weight to the only supporting evidence she could produce at that point\u2014 copies \u2014 violated Kaur\u2019s right to due process and prejudiced her ease.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Substantial evidence does not support the BIA\u2019s decision that Kaur\u2019s testimony was not credible. Most of the apparent inconsistencies in Kaur\u2019s testimony were the result of translation difficulties. We have held that \u201cmistranslation or miscommunication [is] not a sufficient basis for an adverse credibility finding.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The inconsistencies not attributable to translation difficulties are small and Kaur offered reasonable explanations for them. Again, we have previously held that \u201cinconsistencies of less than substantial importance for which a plausible explanation is offered cannot form the sole basis for an adverse credibility finding.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">We conclude that Kaur\u2019s due process rights were violated, that substantial evidence does not support the BIA\u2019s finding that Kaur\u2019s testimony lacked credibility, and that the evidence presented by Kaur compels a finding of eligibility for asylum. Moreover, we conclude that Kaur has met the standard for withholding of deportation. Consequently, we GRANT Kaur\u2019s petition for review and REMAND this case to the BIA with instructions to grant her application for withholding of deportation and to present this matter to the Attorney General for the exercise of his discretion under Section 1158(b) in a manner consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b645-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b645-17\">. <em>Perez-Lastor v.
