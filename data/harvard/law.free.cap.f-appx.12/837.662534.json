R.34.1(G). Plaintiffs motion for oral argument is therefore denied and the case is ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">Plaintiff Richard Lee Martinez, a Colorado state inmate, appeals the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing his civil rights action brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The district court determined that Mr. Martinez\u2019s claims were legally frivolous and dismissed them pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). Mr. Martinez seeks leave to proceed on appeal without prepayment of fees; that request is granted. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a). The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">Mr. Martinez is an inmate at the Colorado State Penitentiary. He sued the Mont-rose Sheriffs Department because it provided information to his current custodian that he had engaged in violence and verbal abuse of other inmates and jail staff while he was detained at the Montrose County Jail. Based on that information, he was placed in administrative segregation at the penitentiary, where he has remained for over two and one-half years. He claims that his due process rights were abridged because defendant never held a hearing on the allegations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He further contends that placement in administrative segregation subjected him to cruel and unusual punishment. He also asserts that the district court should have granted him a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-10\">We review de novo district court\u2019s decision to dismiss a complaint under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. <em>Perkins v. Kan. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>165 F.3d 803, 806 (10th Cir.1999). Because Mr. Martinez is representing himself, his pleadings will be liberally construed. <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-11\">Mr. Martinez has named as the defendant, the Montrose Sheriffs Department, but he is no longer in their custody. His claims relate to his confinement at the Colorado State Penitentiary, which is not a party to this case. The district court correctly held that in order to state a claim against the Montrose Sheriffs Department, Mr. Martinez was required to show that the municipality\u2019s (here, Montrose County) harmful acts resulted from a policy or custom adopted or maintained with objective deliberate indifference to his constitutional rights. <em>See Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 690-91, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). He must also show that the policy or custom was the \u201cmoving force\u201d behind the injury alleged and he must demonstrate \u201cthe requisite degree of culpability and ... a direct causal link between the municipal action and the deprivation of federal rights.\u201d <em>Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs v. Brown, </em>520 U.S. 397, 404, 117 S.Ct. 1382, 137 L.Ed.2d 626 (1997); <em>see also Myers v. Okla. County Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs, </em>151 F.3d 1313, 1318 (10th Cir.1998) (for \u00a7 1983 liability against county, plaintiff must allege a constitution<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>al violation by an employee and that municipal policy or custom was moving force). Because Mr. Martinez failed to allege that a policy, custom, or practice of Montrose County denied him a pre-segregation hearing, his complaint does not make the required causal link. Consequently, he failed to state a claim under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\">Furthermore, Mr. Martinez has failed to state a claim either (1) that he was denied due process by being placed in administrative segregation, or (2) that his placement in administrative segregation violates his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. His complaint is about the conditions at the penitentiary, so even if Mr. Martinez stated a claim, he has not sued the party who can give him relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">For the reasons stated above, we hold that Mr. Martinez has \u201cfail[ed] to state a claim on which relief may be granted.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). No evidentiary hearing was required. Plaintiffs request to proceed in forma pauperis is granted, but he is reminded that he remains obligated to make monthly payments toward the full filing fee for this appeal when he has or receives any credit to his account. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b)(1) &amp; (2). No exception is made for dismissed appeals. <em>Cf. Jennings v. Natrona County Det. Ctr. Med. Facility, </em>175 F.3d 775, 780-81 (10th Cir.1999). His motion for oral argument is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">This appeal counts as a \u201cstrike\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). \u201cThe district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint and our dismissal of the appeal therefore count as two strikes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">Because we determine that \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) applies, we must \u201cdismiss the case.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2). Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b866-8\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir.R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b866-12\">. The record reflects, however, that a hearing was held at the penitentiary before plaintiff was placed in administrative segregation there.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
