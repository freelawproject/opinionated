The district court adopted the Sentencing Guidelines calculation of the U.S. Probation Service, to which there was no objection from Mr. Helbach. Mr. Hel-bach\u2019s counsel did present arguments in support of a motion for a downward departure and engaged in an extended colloquy with the court about those factors. Rec., Yol. II, Doc. 30 at 1-47. Nonetheless, the court rejected Mr. Helbach\u2019s arguments for a downward departure and sentenced him to 24 months in prison, as was the recommendation of the presentence report. <em>Id. </em>at 48-58. Mr. Helbach\u2019s counsel filed a timely notice of appeal and has subsequently filed a brief in this case pursuant to Tenth Circuit Rule 46.4(B)(1) and <em>An-ders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Counsel also moved for leave to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\"><em>Anders </em>holds that \u201cif counsel finds his case to be wholly frivolous, after a conscientious examination of it, he should so advise the court and request permission to withdraw.\u201d <em>Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396. Counsel must also submit a brief \u201creferring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The appellant must be furnished with a copy of counsel\u2019s brief and must be allowed time to raise \u201cany points that he chooses; the court ... then proceeds, after a full examination of all the proceedings, to decide whether the case is wholly frivolous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the court finds the case frivolous, it may grant counsel\u2019s request to withdraw and dismiss the appeal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b734-10\">In his brief, counsel for Mr. Helbach has identified only one potentially appealable issue for our consideration. That issue is whether the district court erred in refusing to exercise its discretion to sentence Mr. Helbach to a term of imprisonment less than that suggested by the Sentencing Guidelines. More properly, the issue is whether this Court has jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s refusal to depart downwards from the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-11\">\u201cWe have jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s refusal to depart downward only when \u2018the district court refused to depart because it erroneously interpreted the Guidelines as depriving it of the power to depart based on the proffered circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Rowen, </em>73 F.3d 1061, 1063 (10th Cir.1996)(quoting <em>United States v. Barrera-Barron, </em>996 F.2d 244, 245 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 937, 114 S.Ct. 358, 126 L.Ed.2d 321 (1993)). We have held that a district court\u2019s failure to explicitly acknowledge its discretion does not make a sentence improper because we assume the district court is aware of its discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>In the case at hand, the court was fully aware of its discretion under the Sentencing Guidelines. During the sentencing of Mr. Helbach, the court specifically noted that although it chose not to depart downward based on the factors presented to the court by Mr. Helbach, \u201cI have the authority to impose or to consider a downward departure.\u201d Rec., vol. II, doc. 30 at 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Because the district court clearly understood its power to depart downwards, this Court has no jurisdiction over the instant appeal. Under the standards of <em>Anders, </em>we hold that Mr. Helbach\u2019s appeal is wholly without merit. We therefore grant counsel leave to withdraw and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b734-8\"> After examining appellant's brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir.R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, or collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir.R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
