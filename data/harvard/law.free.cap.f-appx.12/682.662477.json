Crudup (\u201cCrudup\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action. On November 5, 1998, Lawton Police Officer Darrell Southerland (\u201cSoutherland\u201d) stopped Crudup\u2019s vehicle on suspicion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>Crudup was driving with a suspended license. (Doc. 10, Ex. A at 4.) Southerland circled the vehicle and noticed the butt of a revolver visible under the front passenger\u2019s seat. <em>(Id. </em>at 8.) Southerland arrested both Crudup and his passenger for unlawful possession of a firearm. (Doc. 45 at 2.) Southerland submitted an offense report to the Comanche County District Attorney\u2019s office, and an assistant district attorney filed a charge against him for being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of Okla.Stat. title 21 \u00a7 1283. (Doc. 38 at Ex. 2.) Following a preliminary hearing, Judge Mark Smith (\u201cJudge Smith\u201d) held that there was probable cause to bind Crudup over for trial. <em>(Id. </em>at Ex. 3.) A jury subsequently acquitted Crudup. (Doc. 46 at 2-3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Crudup sued Southerland, Comanche County District Attorney Robert Schulte (\u201cSchulte\u201d), Judge Smith, and the City of Lawton, Oklahoma, alleging they deprived him of his civil rights in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. (Doc. 17.) A magistrate judge, liberally construing Crudup\u2019s pro se complaint, concluded that he had alleged acts of malicious prosecution, simple negligence, and negligent entrustment. (Doc. 46 at 3.) Adopting a Report and Recommendation prepared by the magistrate, the district court dismissed the actions against the City of Lawton and Southerland for failure to state a claim. The district court dismissed the remaining claims against Judge Smith and Schulte, holding they were entitled to absolute immunity from liability. (Doc. 46; Doc. 50.) For substantially the reasons relied upon by the district court, we now AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">A. <em>City of Lawton, Oklahoma</em></p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">The district court dismissed Crudup\u2019s complaint against the City of Lawton under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. We review the dismissal of a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) de novo. <em>See Hunt v. Uphoff, </em>199 F.3d 1220, 1223 (10th Cir.1999).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-8\">Dismissal of a pro se complaint for failure to state a claim is proper only where it is obvious that the plaintiff cannot prevail on the facts he has alleged and it would be futile to give him an opportunity to amend. In determining whether dismissal is proper, we must accept the allegations of the complaint as true and we must construe those allegations, and any reasonable inferences that might be drawn from them, in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Further, we must liberally construe the allegations of a pro se complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-9\"><em>Perkins v. Kansas Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>165 F.3d 803, 806 (10th Cir.1999) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-10\">The district court construed Crud-up\u2019s claim against Lawton as resting solely on its status as Southerland\u2019s employer, and dismissed the complaint reasoning that a city cannot be hable for the acts of its employees under \u00a7 1983 because of respondeat superior alone. (Doc. 46 at 5.) <em>See Board of County Comm\u2019rs v. Bryan County, Oklahoma, </em>520 U.S. 397, 405, 117 S.Ct. 1382, 137 L.Ed.2d 626 (1997); <em>Monell v. New York City Dep\u2019t of Soc. Serv., </em>436 U.S. 658, 690-91, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). We agree, and therefore affirm the district court\u2019s order dismissing Crudup\u2019s claim against the City of Lawton.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-11\">B. <em>Defendant Southerland</em></p>\n<p id=\"b712-12\">Southerland did not raise the affirmative defense of qualified immunity, and therefore we proceed to the merits of Crudup\u2019s claim. Crudup\u2019s claims against Southerland are based on a conclusory allegation that Southerland stopped Crudup \u201cto harass [him] for something other than a routine traffic stop.\u201d (Doc. 17 at 1110). In subsequent filings, Crudup was more specific, alleging that Southerland\u2019s actions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>were motivated by racial bias.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>(See, e.g., </em>Doc. 20.) Based on these allegations, the district court construed Crudup\u2019s complaint as an attempt to predicate his \u00a7 1983 claim on an allegation of malicious prosecution. (Doc. 46 at 3.) Crudup also alleged that Southerland was negligent in failing to ascertain whether Crudup had a valid driver\u2019s license before initiating contact. Finally, Crudup alleged a claim of \u201cnegligent entrustment\u201d against Souther-land. (Doc. 17 at 6,1122.)</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">To the extent Crudup\u2019s claims are based on negligence, the district court correctly dismissed them on the ground that negligence cannot serve as the basis for a \u00a7 1983 claim. <em>See Woodward v. City of Worland, </em>977 F.2d 1392, 1399 (10th Cir.1992) (\u201cThe Supreme Court has made it clear that liability under \u00a7 1983 must be predicated upon a \u2018deliberate\u2019 violation of constitutional rights by the defendant. It cannot be predicated upon negligence.\u201d (citations omitted).)</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">This circuit has held a plaintiff may state a claim under \u00a7 1983 for a deprivation of Fourth Amendment rights to be free of unreasonable seizure on the basis of defendant\u2019s malicious prosecution of a plaintiff. <em>See Taylor v. Meacham, </em>82 F.3d 1556, 1561-62 (10th Cir.1996). \u201c[0]ur circuit takes the common law elements of malicious prosecution as the \u2018starting point\u2019 for the analysis of the \u00a7 1983 mali-clous prosecution claim, but always reaches the ultimate question, which it must, of whether the plaintiff has proven a <em>constitutional </em>violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1561 (emphasis in original). In other words, the evidence ultimately must show that Crudup was subjected to an unreasonable seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">The elements of malicious prosecution in Oklahoma are: \u201c(1) the bringing of the original action by the defendant; (2) its successful termination in favor of the plaintiff; (3) want of probable cause to bring the action; (4) malice; and (5) damages.\u201d <em>Parker v. City of Midwest City, </em>850 P.2d 1065, 1067 (Okla.1993). In <em>Taylor, </em>we assumed that a wrongful arrest may be a first step leading toward malicious prosecution. <em>See </em>82 F.3d at 1564 n. 8 (citing <em>Albright v. Oliver, </em>510 U.S. 266, 279 n. 5, 114 S.Ct. 807, 127 L.Ed.2d 114 (1994) (Ginsburg, J., concurring)). As the district court recognized, however, <em>Taylor </em>held that a judge\u2019s conclusion that there is sufficient evidence to bind the defendant over for trial after a preliminary hearing breaks the chain of causation between the officer\u2019s actions and any violation of a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff\u2019s fourth amendment rights. <em>See Taylor, </em>82 F.3d at 1564. Similarly, even accepting that Southerland\u2019s actions gave rise to a cognizable \u00a7 1983 claim for malicious prosecution, in this case Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>Smith\u2019s finding of probable cause to bind Crudup over for trial is fatal to the claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">C. <em>Defendants Smith and Schulte</em></p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The district court, after considering affidavits submitted by the defendants and giving Crudup an opportunity to respond with additional evidence, granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, holding that both Schulte and Judge Smith were entitled to absolute immunity from liability on these claims. (Doc. 46 at 6.) We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standards as the district court in determining whether genuine issues of material fact exist, and, if not, whether the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Simms v. Oklahoma ex rel. Dep\u2019t of Mental Health &amp; Substance Abuse Servs., </em>165 F.3d 1321, 1326 (10th Cir.1999). We liberally construe a pro se litigant\u2019s pleadings in conducting our review, <em>see Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), but we do not consider materials or arguments not presented to the district court, <em>see Myers v. Oklahoma County Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs, </em>151 F.3d 1313, 1319 (10th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">We agree with the district court that Judge Smith is entitled to summary judgment on grounds of absolute judicial immunity. \u201cA judge will not be deprived of immunity because the action he took was in error, was done maliciously, or was in excess of his authority; rather he will be subject to liability only when he has acted in the clear absence of all jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 356-57, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978) (citations and quotations omitted). Crudup has not alleged any action taken by Judge Smith that occurred either outside of his judicial capacity or in the clear absence of jurisdiction, and therefore he is immune from \u00a7 1983 liability in this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">We likewise affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Comanche County District Attorney Robert Schulte. First, the evidence shows that Schulte was not personally involved in Crudup\u2019s prosecution, and was aware of the case only in his capacity as the prosecuting attorney\u2019s supervisor. (Doc. 38, Schulte Affidavit at 1i 9.) Thus, whatever claims Crudup might have alleged against the assistant district attorney prosecuting his case, the record contains no evidence that would support \u00a7 1983 liability on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>part of Schulte. <em>Cf. Smith v. Maschner, </em>899 F.2d 940, 950-51 (10th Cir.1990) (respondeat superior alone will not support \u00a7 1983 liability); <em>Coleman v. Turpen, </em>697 F.2d 1341, 1346 n. 7 (10th Cir.1982) (\u201cProsecutor Turp\u00e9n, to be hable [under \u00a7 1983], must have been personally involved in the deprivation.\u201d). Further, Schulte enjoys broad immunity for actions taken in his capacity as a prosecutor. <em>See Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 431, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976) (\u201c[I]n initiating a prosecution and in presenting the State\u2019s case, the prosecutor is immune from a civil suit for damages under \u00a7 1983.\u201d). This immunity extends to all activities that are \u201cintimately associated with the judicial ... process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 430-31, 96 S.Ct. 984; <em>see also Scott v. Hern, </em>216 F.3d 897, 908 (10th Cir.2000). In this case, all of the actions said to have given rise to Crudup\u2019s alleged constitutional injuries were intimately associated with the prosecution\u2019s role in bringing criminal charges against Crudup, and therefore they fall within this grant of immunity. <em>Cf. Imbler, </em>424 U.S. at 428-29, 96 S.Ct. 984 (prosecutor is immune from \u00a7 1983 liability for malicious prosecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">D. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">For the forgoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of Crudup\u2019s claim against the City of Lawton and Southerland for failure to state a claim. We further AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the remaining defendants. We DENY, however, a motion appended to Southerland\u2019s and the City of Lawton\u2019s answer brief alleging Crudup\u2019s appeal was frivolous and seeking double costs pursuant to Fed. R.App.P. 38.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b711-11\"> After examining appellant's brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir.R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This Order and Judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir.R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b713-7\">. In his brief on appeal, Crudup asserts that the district court failed to consider a violation of the Equal Protection Clause as a possible ground for relief. It is true that the district court did not specifically address this argument in its order. The only allegations in Crudup\u2019s complaint that might support such a claim, however, are a conclusory statement that Southerland first approached Crudup \"to harass the Plaintiff for something other than a routine traffic stop,\u201d and a statement that Crudup had filed a disciplinary complaint against Southerland shortly after the arrest alleging he discriminated against Crudup on the basis of race. (Doc. 17 at 3, \u00b6\u00b6 10, 12.) These allegations are at best vague and conclusory, and are thus insufficient to give rise to a claim under the Equal Protection Clause. <em>Cf. Northington v. Jackson, </em>973 F.2d 1518, 1521 (10th Cir.1992) (although court should liberally construe pro se plaintiff\u2019s complaint, \"the court should not assume the role of advocate, and should dismiss claims which are supported only by vague and conclusory allegations.\")</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b714-6\">. The district court correctly noted that Crud-up alleged a police officer gave peijured testimony during his preliminary hearing, and that <em>Taylor </em>is arguably distinguishable on that basis. (Doc. 46 at 14 n. 8; Doc. 45, Affidavit at 1-2.) We agree with the district court, however, that Cradup's blanket statement to that effect, without identifying either the content of the false testimony, the witness who offered the testimony, or the stage of the proceedings in which it was offered, is insufficient to give rise to a genuine question of material fact on this issue. <em>Cf. Northington, </em>973 F.2d at 1521 (court should dismiss claims which are supported only by vague and con-clusory allegations).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b714-7\">. Cradup\u2019s affidavit alleges that Judge Smith conducted an ex parte meeting with the assistant district attorney prosecuting Cradup's case, and subsequently imposed an excessive and financially ruinous bond on him. (Doc. 45, Attached Affidavit.) We have noted, however, that \"judges enjoy absolute immunity from liability under \u00a7 1983 \u2014 even when the judge allegedly conspires with private parties .\" <em>Hunt v. Bennett, </em>17 F.3d 1263, 1267 (10th Cir.1994) (citing <em>Dennis v. Sparks, </em>449 U.S. 24, 28-32, 101 S.Ct. 183, 66 L.Ed.2d 185 (1980)). Therefore, even if we were to conclude that Cradup's allegation was sufficient to raise a triable question of fact as to whether Judge Smith conspired with the assistant district attorney, this would not materially change our analysis of this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
