Upon careful review of the record, we conclude the revocation and resulting sentence were correct, and we reject each of Arrasmith\u2019s arguments. Specifically, we reject Arrasmith\u2019s unsupported arguments that the district court did not have jurisdiction over each of his alleged violations, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3231, 3237(a); and that the probation officer was required to immediately report his violations to the district court. Further, we conclude the district court\u2019s finding that Arrasmith had violated his supervised release conditions was adequate and supported by the record, particularly by evidence that Arrasmith had used drugs and failed to comply with drug testing. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) and (g)(3); <em>United States v. Stephens, </em>65 F.3d 738, 741 (8th Cir.1995) (defendant knowingly and willfully failed to comply with drug-treatment condition of supervised release when he failed to attend counseling sessions and submit urine specimens). We reject as meritless Arrasmith\u2019s argument regarding disclosure of a mental health report. We construe Arrasmith\u2019s remaining arguments as ineffective-assistance claims which would be better addressed in a collateral proceeding. <em>See United States v. Martin, </em>59 F.3d 767, 771 (8th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-20\">Accordingly, we affirm. We deny Ar-rasmith\u2019s pending motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-21\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b452-16\">. The HONORABLE GARY A.
