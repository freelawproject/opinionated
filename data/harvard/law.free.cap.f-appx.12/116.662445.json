Having reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion, we conclude that the district court did not err in holding that Jenkins was not disabled under the ADA. The court properly relied on our decisions in <em>Williams v. Channel Master Satellite Sys., Inc., </em>101 F.3d 346, 349 (4th Cir.1996), and <em>Halperin v. Abacus Tech. Corp., </em>128 F.3d 191, 200 (4th Cir.1997), to hold that Jenkins\u2019s lifting restriction is not a significant restriction on her ability to perform a major life activity. Jenkins\u2019s efforts to distinguish those holdings are not convincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-16\">Nor does the record support Jenkins\u2019s claim that her employer regarded her as having a disability under the ADA, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 12101(2)(C). <em>See Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., </em>527 U.S. 471, 489, 119 S.Ct. 2139, 144 L.Ed.2d 450 (1999). Therefore, we affirm the ruling of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
