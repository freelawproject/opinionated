Batts, <em>Judge, </em>to a charge of conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. The court sentenced Noguera principally to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment, the bottom of the range prescribed by Sentencing Guidelines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>(\u201cGuidelines\u201d); in a departure from the Guidelines, the district court ordered that the sentence be served concurrently with the 100-odd months remaining on a sentence Noguera was already serving. On appeal, Noguera contends that the district court mistakenly believed it had no authority to grant a 24-month downward departure from the applicable Guidelines range. For the reasons that follow, we dismiss the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">A district court\u2019s refusal to grant a downward departure is not reviewable except for an error of law, such as the court\u2019s mistaken belief that it has no authority to depart on the basis requested. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Clark, </em>128 F.3d 122, 124 (2d Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Haynes, </em>985 F.2d 65, 68 (2d Cir.1993). When the court has granted a departure, its refusal to depart to a greater extent is similarly unreviewable. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Hargrett, </em>156 F.3d 447, 450 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 1048, 119 S.Ct. 607, 142 L.Ed.2d 547 (1998); <em>United States v. Moon, </em>926 F.2d 204, 207, 210 (2d Cir.1991). Given the district court\u2019s repeated references in this case to its discretion, and to 151 months as the appropriate minimum prison term for Noguera\u2019s offense, we cannot conclude that the court failed to reduce Noguera\u2019s sentence further because it believed it had no power to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Noguera was convicted of conspiring to engage in narcotics trafficking while she was serving a term of imprisonment for another narcotics conspiracy offense. In such circumstances, the Guidelines provide that \u201cthe sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run consecutively to the undischarged term of imprisonment.\u201d Guidelines \u00a7 5G1.3(a). Consistent with this provision, Noguera was originally sentenced in May 1999 to a 151-month prison term, to be served consecutively to her preexisting sentence. The May 1999 sentence was vacated, with the consent of the government, on the basis that the court had not understood that it had the power to grant a downward departure on the ground that Noguera had been subjected to abuse by a prison guard. At a sentencing hearing commenced on October 11, 2000, the court stated that it had decided to grant Noguera a departure by making the 151-month prison term for the present offense concurrent with her undischarged prison term; in addition, because Nogu-era\u2019s sentencing, originally scheduled for May 1997, had been delayed for some 24 months as a result of adjournments requested by her attorney, the court wished to deem Noguera\u2019s service of the 151-month sentence to have commenced in May 1997. <em>(See </em>Sentencing Hearing Transcript, October 11, 2000 (\u201cOctober 11 S.Tr.\u201d), at 26-29.) The parties promptly informed the court, however, that its proposed retroactive commencement of sentence was impermissible, <em>see generally United States v. Labeille-Soto, </em>163 F.3d 93, 98-99 (2d Cir.1998), and the court invited further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">Noguera then urged the court to compensate for its lack of authority to backdate commencement of the sentence to May 1997 by shortening the prison term from 151 months to 127 months. The court declined to do so, stating, \u201cMy difficulty with that, of course, is that the reasons that I set forth on the record for why I was doing what I was doing would not permit me to do that. I think the 151 months stands. So that if I can\u2019t nunc pro tune it to '97, then it will be 151 months to '99.\u201d (October 11 S.Tr. at 34.) \u201cI have pretty much stated the reasons that I have found a discretionary departure for concurrent sentence appropriate and have found that a downward departure based on the cases is not.\u201d (October 11 S.Tr. at 41.) The court adjourned the hearing, asking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>the parties to devise a way of structuring the sentence to simulate a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>1997 commencement, but</p>\n<blockquote id=\"An\">\u201cwithout making a finding for a downward departure, which quite frankly I cannot do. I have tried. I cannot do it. <em>It is not because I don\u2019t have the discretion. It is because I have looked at the facts, I have looked at the case law, and I do not believe that it is appropriate to have a downward departure for that basis.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-4\"><em>(Id. </em>(emphasis added).)</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">When the sentencing hearing resumed a week later, the government stated that once the court decided to depart under Guidelines \u00a7 5K2.0, it could structure that departure any way it wanted, whether by making the sentences concurrent, or decreasing Noguera\u2019s offense' level, or both. <em>(See </em>Sentencing Hearing Transcript, October 18, 2000 (\u201cOctober 18 S.Tr.\u201d), at 12-13.) The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-6\">If I wasn\u2019t clear last week \u2014 I thought that I was, but I obviously wasn\u2019t \u2014 I intend to depart under 5K2.0 because of the fact pattern here which I do not believe was taken into account by the Sentencing Commission, and I plan on doing it \u2014 believe me, I take very seriously the fact that the defendant committed a very serious crime while in prison, which is why <em>I don\u2019t think that an offense level departure is appropriate, which is why I think the sentence of 151 months is appropriate. </em>But because of the peculiar and unique circumstances here, I find that the discretion to exercise or to impose a concurrent as opposed to a consecutive sentence is appropriate, and I intend to do that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aj\">(October 18 S.Tr. at 14 (emphasis added).)</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Noguera points to an ensuing statement by the government that \u201cthere is no further way\u201d to shorten Noguera\u2019s sentence and the court\u2019s response, \u201cI agree with you\u201d (October 18 S.Tr. at 15), as support for her contention that \u201c[tjhere is a substantial risk that the district court misapprehended the extent of its power to reduce Noguera\u2019s 151-month sentence to achieve the desired degree of concurrency.\u201d (Noguera brief on appeal at 28.) This argument inappropriately views that statement by the district court in isolation. The court\u2019s agreement that there was no further way to shorten Noguera\u2019s sentence must be read in tandem with the court\u2019s statement, in the same colloquy, that it believed \u201c151 months is appropriate\u201d (October 18 S.Tr. at 14). Plainly, the import of that statement was that the requested shorter term of 127 months would be inappropriate. And given the court\u2019s repeated references to its discretionary powers, including the statement that its refusal to go below 151 months\u2019 prison time \u201cis not because I don\u2019t have the discretion\u201d (October 11 S.Tr. at 41), we see no indication that the district court mistakenly believed it lacked authority to depart to a greater extent than the more than 100-month departure it effected by making the present sentence concurrent. Accordingly, the court\u2019s refusal to grant a greater departure is not reviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">We have considered all of Noguera\u2019s arguments in support of appealability and have found them to be without merit. The appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">We note that, although the offense to which Noguera pleaded guilty was narcotics conspiracy in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, the judgment recites her offense as one under \u201c18\u201d U.S.C. \u00a7 846, a clerical error that will no doubt be corrected by the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
