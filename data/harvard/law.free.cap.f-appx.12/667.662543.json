He was sentenced to 121 months on the Hobbs Act counts and an additional thirty years for the other counts, to run consecutively. This appeal raises one issue: Does the Hobbs Act exceed Congress\u2019s power to regulate under the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const, art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3? Exercising jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">Toles asserts that the constitutionality of the Hobbs Act must be reevaluated in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decisions regarding Congress\u2019s power to regulate interstate commerce under the Commerce Clause. <em>See United States v. Morrison, </em>529 U.S. 598, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 1748-54, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000) (holding that Congress exceeded its authority under the Commerce Clause by enacting the federal civil remedy of the Violence Against Women Act); <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 567, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995) (holding that Congress exceeded its authority under the Commerce Clause by making it a federal offense for any individual to knowingly possess a firearm in a school zone). Specifically, he claims that the prior decisions of this Court upholding the Hobbs Act under the Commerce Clause \u201ccannot survive the combined effect of <em>Lopez </em>and <em>Morrison </em>unless robbery is considered an \u2018economic activity\u2019 as defined in Commerce Clause jurisprudence.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 17.) We review that challenge de novo. <em>United States v. Wilks, </em>58 F.3d 1518, 1519 (10th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">In the period between briefing and oral argument, this Court decided <em>United States v. Malone, </em>222 F.3d 1286 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 121 S.Ct. 605, 148 L.Ed.2d 517 (2000). In <em>Malone </em>we considered whether a district court erred in instructing a jury that only a de minimis effect on interstate commerce is necessary to meet the jurisdictional requirement of the Hobbs Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Examining our prior jurisprudence in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decisions, including <em>Lopez </em>and <em>Morrison, </em>we expressly concluded that the Hobbs Act regulates economic activity and was enacted pursuant to Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause powers. <em>Id. </em>at 1295 (\u201cUnlike the statutes at issue in <em>Morrison </em>and <em>Lopez, </em>the Hobbs Act regulates economic activity.\u201d). As a result, Toles\u2019s challenge to his Hobbs Act convictions must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-13\">We hold that enactment of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951 was a constitutional exercise of Congress\u2019s authority to regulate interstate commerce. Accordingly, we AFFIRM Toles\u2019s convictions under that statute.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b696-8\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This Court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir.R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b696-15\">. The Hobbs Act reads, \"Whoever in any way or degree ... affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce, by robbery ... shall be fined ... or imprisoned ..., or both.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a). \"The term 'robbery' means the unlawful taking or obtaining of personal <em>property....\u201d Id . </em>at \u00a7 1951(b)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
