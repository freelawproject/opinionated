Greenberg, Senior Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b631-14\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-15\">The facts and procedural history need no recitation, being familiar to the parties. The question for our decision is whether the following acts or omissions of Craig J. Porter\u2019s court-appointed lawyers rendered their assistance ineffective, requiring that his guilty pleas to tax and bankruptcy fraud be vacated: (1) Doug Stringer\u2019s advice as to the consequences of a guilty plea; (2) John Ransom\u2019s failure to move to withdraw Porter\u2019s guilty pleas prior to sentence; (3) Ransom\u2019s failure to obtain a ruling on his objection to a psychiatric report provided to the district court in the pre-sentence report; and (4) Ransom\u2019s failure, on Porter\u2019s appeal from sentence, to raise a handful of the foregoing errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-19\">The overarching principle governing this appeal in which counsel\u2019s effectiveness is challenged is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-20\">First, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u201ccounsel\u201d guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-21\"><em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Where, as here, the <em>Strickland </em>formulation is applied to counsel\u2019s effectiveness with respect to a plea agreement its second element</p>\n<p id=\"b631-22\">focuses on whether counsel\u2019s constitutionally ineffective performance affected the outcome of the plea process. In other words, in order to satisfy the \u201cprejudice\u201d requirement, the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"AdY\"><em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 59, 106 S.Ct. 366, 370, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-23\">In any event, \u201cjudicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>deferential,\u201d there is \u201ca strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of acceptable professional assistance,\u201d and competence is to be judged without the benefit of hindsight. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065. The attorney is presumed competent and the client bears the burden of showing otherwise. <em>United States v. Cronic, </em>466 U.S. 648, 658, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 2046, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">For the most part we are exercising de novo review on this appeal. <em>See United States v. Chacon-Palomares, </em>208 F.3d 1157, 1158 (9th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Alvarez-Tautimez, </em>160 F.3d 573, 575 (9th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Myers, </em>32 F.3d 411, 413 (9th Cir.1994). However, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>See United States v. Guess, </em>203 F.3d 1143, 1145 (9th Cir.2000). After an exacting review of the many alleged instances of his attorneys\u2019 ineffectiveness, we are satisfied that Porter received effective assistance of counsel. Consequently, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of his motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. We, however, remand the matter to the district court for initial consideration of Porter\u2019s request that the Goranson report be stricken from the presentence report.</p>\n<p id=\"AQf\">AFFIRMED IN PART AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b631-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
