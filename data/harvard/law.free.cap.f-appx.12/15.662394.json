The plaintiffs \u2014 the former employee, his wife, and their conjugal partnership \u2014 sued under, inter alia, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 <em>et </em>seg., and in due course, the employer moved for summary judgment, Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). The plaintiffs failed to file an opposition. The district court nonetheless studied the matter, wrote a thoughtful opinion, and granted the motion for <em>brevis </em>disposition. <em>Jimenez Colon v. Black &amp; Decker (PR) LLC, </em>Civ. No. 99-1871 (D.P.R. Aug. 9, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">Shortly thereafter, the plaintiffs filed a motion for relief from judgment, Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b), in which they invoked subsection (1) of the rule and claimed that their failure to oppose the summary judgment motion resulted from excusable neglect. They averred that they (mistakenly) believed that they had filed a motion to reopen discovery \u2014 the motion had, in fact, been filed in a different case \u2014 and that this motion would have assured deferral of any consideration of summary judgment. The defendant objected to the Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">The district court wrote a second opinion, finding neglect, but also finding an absence of excusatory circumstances. <em>Jimenez Colon v. Black &amp; Decker (PR) LLC, </em>Civ. No. 99-1871 (D.P.R. Oct. 3, 2000). For that reason, the court refused to set aside its earlier judgment. <em>See id. </em>This appeal ensued. In it, the plaintiffs challenge only the court\u2019s denial of their Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-11\">We need not tarry. We previously have acknowledged that when a trial judge adroitly takes the measure of a case, applies correct legal standards, and formulates a convincing rationale, \u201can appellate court should refrain from writing at length to no other end than to hear its own words resonate.\u201d <em>Lawton v. State Mut. Life Assur. Co., </em>101 F.3d 218, 220 (1st Cir.1996); <em>accord Cruz-Ramos v. Puerto Rico Sun Oil Co., </em>202 F.3d 381, 383 (1st Cir.2000); <em>Ayala v. Union De Tronquistas, Local 901, </em>74 F.3d 344, 345 (1st Cir.1996); <em>Holders Capital Corp. v. California Union Ins. Co. (In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig.), </em>989 F.2d 36, 38 (1st Cir.1993). This is such an instance. The district court\u2019s lucid opinion refusing to relieve the plaintiffs from the judgment is unimpugnable. Consequently, we affirm the judgment below substantially on the basis of that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-12\">We add only a few brief comments. First, contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 importunings, the district court followed the appropriate legal regime, <em>see Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019shp, </em>507 U.S. 380, 393-94, 113 S.Ct. 1489, 123 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993); <em>Mirpuri v. ACT Mfg., Inc., </em>212 F.3d 624, 630-31 (1st Cir.2000), and, for aught that appears, applied that regime in a sensible fashion. Second, given the many shortcomings in the plaintiffs\u2019 position \u2014 they took a lackadaisical approach toward discovery; sat for several weeks on the documents that they now say justify further discovery; filed nothing within the allotted period for responding to the defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion; and, when they belatedly prepared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>the motion to reopen discovery, failed to file it in the papers of this case \u2014 we scarcely can fault the district court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiffs\u2019 neglect was inexcusable.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">If more were needed \u2014 and we doubt that it is \u2014 the standard of review applicable to the denial of a motion which invokes Rule 60(b)(1) is for abuse of discretion. <em>Lepore v. Vidockler, </em>792 F.2d 272, 273-74 (1st Cir.1986). In this area, the scope of the court\u2019s discretion is considerable. Even if one concedes, favorably to the plaintiffs, that a factfinder might consider their neglect pardonable, there is nothing in the record that either compels such a finding or that undermines the district court\u2019s contrary assessment. There was, therefore, no abuse of the court\u2019s wide discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">We need go no further. The plaintiffs have not shown an entitlement to relief from the judgment. The order appealed from is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
