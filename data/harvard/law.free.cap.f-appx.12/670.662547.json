Townsend, appearing pro se and in forma pauperis, appeals from the district court order denying and dismissing her petition for habeas corpus. Because this proceeding arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, she does not need a certificate of appealability. <em>Montez v. McKinna, </em>208 F.3d 862, 867 (10th Cir.2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-11\">Ms. Townsend was a deputy accounting and finance officer at San Vito Air Station in Italy. In a court-martial on August 18-19, 1994, Ms. Townsend pled guilty to stealing and conspiring to steal $479,700 in United States and Italian currency in violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. R. doc. 9, Ex. A &amp; C. She was also convicted of stealing and conspiring to steal a U.S. Treasury check in the amount of $21,257.64. <em>Id., </em>Ex. C. Ms. Townsend was sentenced to eight years of confinement, a pay grade reduction to E-l, a dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of pay and allowance, and a fine of $175,000 or an additional five years of confinement if she did not pay the fine. <em>Id., </em>Ex. A. Because Ms. Townsend failed to pay the fine, she received five additional years confinement, <em>id., </em>Ex. D, because she was unwilling, rather than unable, to pay the fine. <em>Id., </em>Ex. C at 4-5. The military judge found that she had scattered her assets and made no good faith attempt to recover the stolen money. <em>Id. </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-15\">Ms. Townsend\u2019s conviction was affirmed on direct appeal by the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals (\u201cAFCCA\u201d) and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces denied further review. <em>Id., </em>Ex. E &amp; F. Her petition for collateral relief was denied by the AFCCA. <em>Id., </em>Ex. K. Ms. Townsend then petitioned the district court for a writ of habeas corpus. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241.'</p>\n<p id=\"b699-16\">Ms. Townsend claimed three grounds for relief in her petition; (1) the convening authority\u2019s lack of authority to execute the contingent period of confinement; (2) the military circuit judge\u2019s failure .to consider alternative methods of payment or punishment in the contingent confinement hearing; and (3) the illegality of contingent confinement. R. doc. 1, at 7-9. Upon consideration of the respondent\u2019s answer, Ms. Townsend\u2019s traverse, and other related pleadings which followed, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>court denied Ms. Townsend\u2019s petition. R. doc. 18, at 6. The district court held that because Ms. Townsend\u2019s first claim \u201cwas reviewed by the [AFCCA] when it decided her action for writ of coram nobis ... this matter was fully and fairly litigated before the military court and that no basis for habeas corpus jurisdiction exists.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4-5 (citing <em>Townsend v. United States, </em>No. 98-03, 1999 WL 85560, at *3-4 (A.F. Ct.Crim.App. Feb.5, 1999); <em>Lips v. Commandant, United States Disciplinary Barracks, </em>997 F.2d 808, 811 (10th Cir.1993)). As for Ms. Townsend\u2019s second claim, the district court concluded that Ms. Townsend \u201cadvances no compelling legal basis for her claim that the findings of the military judge should be set aside due to a failure to consider some alternative, unspecified means of payment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. The district court reasoned that Ms. Townsend\u2019s \u201cability to pay the fine was given full and fair consideration in the court-martial,\u201d and found \u201cno substantial constitutional dimension in this claim which might merit extraordinary relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Dodson v. Zelez, </em>917 F.2d 1250 (10th Cir.1990)). The district court rejected Ms. Townsend\u2019s third claim because \u201ccontingent confinement [is] authorized by Rule 1003(b)(3) of the Rules for Courts Martial, [and] may not be disturbed on habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6 (footnote omitted). Ms. Townsend now petitions this court and asserts each of the aforementioned claims as a basis for habeas corpus relief. Pet\u2019r Br. at 3, 4,11.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of Ms. Townsend\u2019s petition de novo. <em>Hunnicutt v. Hawk, </em>229 F.3d 997, 1000 (10th Cir.2000). We have reviewed the record, the district court order, and Ms. Townsend\u2019s brief on appeal and agree with the district court\u2019s resolution of Ms. Townsend\u2019s claims. We only add that Ms. Townsend\u2019s sentence must stand because the military judge found that Ms. Townsend\u2019s failure to pay the fine was her fault. <em>Bearden v. Georgia, </em>461 U.S. 660, 668-69, 103 S.Ct. 2064, 76 L.Ed.2d 221 (1983). Ms. Townsend\u2019s argument that her alternative sentence violates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3572(e) is unavailing. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3572(e) is not applicable to sentencing under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3551(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b699-17\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir.R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
