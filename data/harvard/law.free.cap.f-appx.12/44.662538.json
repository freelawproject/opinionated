Hoffman of Simsbury (\u201cNorthrop\u201d) </em>and <em>Hoffman of Simsbury v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number><em>Katzke (\u201cHoffman\u201d)</em>\u2014were consolidated for trial. The facts underlying these cases are as follows. In July 1995, Mark Strauss was the business and finance manager of Hoffman of Simsbury (\u201cHoffman\u201d), a car dealership. Strauss was authorized, in connection with prospective car sales by Hoffman, to obtain credit reports on prospective purchasers of cars from Trans Union. On or about July 3, 1995, Strauss requested and obtained Northrop\u2019s consumer credit report from Trans Union. Northrop had no business dealings with Hoffman that would have provided Strauss with a legitimate reason to obtain her credit report.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">On September 25, 1995, Northrop applied to Mortgage Master for a mortgage to refinance the existing mortgage on her home. Northrop had a locked interest rate at 5.875% that would expire on November 1, 1995. Pursuant to the application process, Mortgage Master ran a credit check on Northrop, discovered Hoffman\u2019s credit check, and asked Northrop to explain the basis for Hoffman\u2019s inquiry. When Northrop inquired of Hoffman, she was informed that the relevant computer records had been destroyed. Subsequently, the locked interest rate on Northrop\u2019s mortgage application expired and she withdrew her application.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">On January 19, 1996, Northrop initiated <em>Northrop </em>alleging violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (\u201cFCRA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681 et seq., and the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (\u201cCUTPA\u201d), Conn. GemStat. \u00a7 42-lla et seq.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to Northrop, Larry Katzke \u2014 an employee of American Honda Motor Co. and a friend of Northrop\u2019s husband Noel Collier, against whom Northrop had initiated divorce proceedings \u2014 asked Hoffman, under false pretenses, to obtain her credit report in order to help Collier in his divorce action. Northrop alleged that Katzke\u2019s and Hoffman's actions interfered with her efforts to obtain a mortgage and caused her emotional distress and humiliation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">On June 25, 1998, Hoffman initiated <em>Hoffman. </em>In its complaint, Hoffman alleged that on or about July 3,1995, Katzke contacted Strauss and asked him to run a credit check on Northrop because she and her husband were considering purchasing a car. In requesting Northrop\u2019s credit report, therefore, Strauss acted pursuant to Katzke\u2019s request. Moreover, according to Hoffman, Katzke misrepresented the true reason for his request, resulting in damages to Hoffman including harm to its reputation, defense of the action commenced by Northrop and potential damages to Northrop. Accordingly, Hoffman sought $100,000 in damages plus reimbursement for all expenses incurred in connection with the Northrop litigation and any damages assessed against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-12\">A consolidated jury trial began on September 28, 1999.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On September 29, 1999, the jury returned a verdict awarding Northrop $100,000 in compensatory damages (divided evenly between Hoffman and Katzke), $500,000 in punitive damages (di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>vided evenly between Hoffman and Katz-ke), and nothing for emotional distress. With respect to <em>Hoffman, </em>the jury found that Hoffman had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) Katzke made false representations to Hoffman; (2) Katzke intended to induce Hoffman to rely on his false representations; (3) Hoffman relied upon the false representations<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>; and (4) Hoffman suffered injury as a result of Katzke\u2019s actions. The verdict form asked the jury to write down an amount of \u201cactual damages\u201d to be awarded. When the jury first returned, it had entered the words \u201clegal fees\u201d in the blank space left for actual damages. The District Court instructed the jury to return to their deliberations and to enter a specific amount in damages. Thereafter, the jury entered \u201c$25,000\u201d in the appropriate space.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Following the verdict, with respect to <em>Northrop, </em>Hoffman and Katzke moved for judgment as a matter of law (\u201cJMOL\u201d) under Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b) or, in the alternative, for a new trial or remittitur. Northrop moved for costs and attorneys\u2019 fees totaling $63,860.52. With respect to <em>Hoffman, </em>Katzke moved for JMOL, and Hoffman filed a motion for additur, asking the District Court to increase the damages awarded in its favor to the full amount of damages awarded against it in <em>Northrop </em>as well as full attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">In an unpublished Memorandum of Decision filed March 15, 2000, the District Court found, <em>inter alia, </em>that Northrop had provided no evidence at trial that Hoffman\u2019s credit check or her alleged inability to explain it to Mortgage Master had interfered with her ability to obtain her mortgage. Based on these findings, the District Court granted Hoffman and Katz-ke JMOL with respect to compensatory damages under both FCRA and CUTPA. The Court concluded that \u201ca reasonable jury could not find that Northrop [sic] proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Hoffman\u2019s credit report request interfered with her efforts to obtain a mortgage on her residence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">The District Court also reduced the punitive damages awarded by the jury to $50,000 against Hoffman and $75,000 against Katzke, ordering remittitur of the sums in excess of that award. The Court noted that although actual damages are not a prerequisite to punitive damages under FCRA, \u201c[t]he plaintiff was unable to establish an actual compensatory loss.\u201d Moreover, it concluded that the jury\u2019s award of punitive damages, which it labeled \u201can advisory opinion,\u201d was excessive \u201cin view of the fact that the content of the plaintiff\u2019s credit report was only verbally communicated to a single party, and in further view of the fact that there was no proof as to any unfavorable record being placed in the plaintiffs credit report.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">Finally, the District Court awarded Northrop $54,962 in costs and attorneys\u2019 fees, to be split between Hoffman and Katzke.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">In <em>Hoffman, </em>the District Court entered judgment in favor of Hoffman in the amount of $25,000. By an endorsement order, entered March 17, 2000, the District Court denied Hoffman\u2019s motion for addi-tur.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-11\">Because the District Court\u2019s Amended Judgment misstated the damages in <em>Northrop, </em>the court entered a Second Amended Judgment on July 18, 2000. With respect to <em>Hoffman, </em>the court\u2019s Second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Amended Judgment ordered that Hoffman receive \u201c$25,000 <em>in punitive damages.\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">In the appeal before us of <em>Northrop, </em>Northrop challenges the District Court\u2019s grant of JMOL to Hoffman and Katzke insofar as it eliminated the jury\u2019s compensatory damages award and reduced the jury\u2019s punitive damages award. Northrop also appeals the Court\u2019s decision to grant her a lesser amount of costs and attorneys\u2019 fees than she requested. Hoffman cross-appeals, claiming that the District Court erred in denying it JMOL on liability and \u2014 in light of the fraud perpetrated by Katzke on Hoffman \u2014 allowing any punitive damages to stand against it, or, in the alternative, in failing to grant it a new trial. Defendant Katzke also cross-appeals, claiming that the District Court erred in not granting him JMOL on liability and punitive damages, and also claiming that the District Court erred in awarding Northrop any attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">In the appeal before us of <em>Hoffman, </em>Hoffman claims that the District Court erred in not increasing the jury\u2019s award to cover all of the damages assessed against Hoffman in <em>Northrop </em>as well as Hoffman\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees. Katzke cross appeals, claiming (1) that the jury\u2019s award of legal fees must be reversed because, at trial, Hoffman abandoned all claims other than those for indemnification; (2) that the District Court\u2019s judgment converting the jury\u2019s award into punitive damages must be reversed; and (3) that Hoffman is not entitled to indemnification as it failed to prove the elements for indemnification under Connecticut law and, moreover, any relief sought would constitute an unconstitutional additur.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">I. Compensatory Damages in <em>Northrop</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">In ruling on a motion for JMOL, \u201cthe trial court is required to consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the party against whom the motion was made and to give that party the benefit of all reasonable inferences that the jury might have drawn in his favor from the evidence. The court cannot assess the weight of conflicting evidence, pass on the credibility of the witnesses, or substitute its judgment for that of the jury.\u201d <em>Tolbert v. Queens College, </em>242 F.3d 58, 70 (2d Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). A district court may grant a judgment as a matter of law only if no reasonable jury could find for the non-moving party. <em>See Stagl v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>117 F.3d 76, 79 (2d Cir.1997). We apply the same standard in reviewing the grant of a Rule 50(b) motion. <em>See Tolbert, </em>242 F.3d at 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">Northrop challenges the District Court\u2019s decision to eliminate compensatory damages on two grounds: First, she claims that the District Court erred in granting defendants JMOL on compensatory damages based on Rule 50(b) motions that raised different issues than had been raised in defendants\u2019 Rule 50(a) motions; and second, she claims that the District Court applied the wrong standard in striking the jury\u2019s award of compensatory damages. With respect to Northrop\u2019s first claim, we have noted that \u201c[generally a party is not entitled to [JMOL pursuant to Rule 50(b)] on any ground that he has not raised in a motion for a [JMOL pursuant to Rule 50(a)] ... and the [Rule 50(a)] motion must have \u2018state[d] the specific grounds therefor.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith v. Lightning Bolt Prods., Inc., </em>861 F.2d 363, 367 (2d Cir.1988) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a)). \u201cRelief from this requirement is only available to prevent a manifest injustice.\u201d <em>Bas-kin v. Hawley, </em>807 F.2d 1120, 1130 (2d Cir.1986) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, \u201cwhen the party moving for JMOL fails to articulate its motion with sufficient specificity, the non-moving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>party must object in order to preserve the issue for appeal.\u201d <em>Marfia v. T.C. Ziraat Bankasi, </em>147 F.3d 83, 87 (2d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">In the instant case, Northrop claims that the District Court erred in eliminating compensatory damages pursuant to defendants\u2019 Rule 50(b) motions when their Rule 50(a) motions, delivered orally to the District Court, raised only issues of liability and not issues of sufficiency of evidence with respect to damages. This argument is without merit. Northrop never objected to the specificity of defendants\u2019 motions before the District Court; accordingly, she did not preserve this matter for appeal. Moreover, each defendant\u2019s Rule 50(a) motion alleged that there was no evidence of any violation of FCRA or CUTPA. This is, in essence, the ground on which the District Court granted defendants\u2019 Rule 50(b) motions with respect to compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">With respect to Northrop\u2019s second claim, the District Court applied the proper standard in considering JMOL (\u201ca reasonable jury could not find that Northrop [sic] proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Hoffman\u2019s credit report request interfered with her efforts to obtain a mortgage\u201d), and the District Court correctly concluded that plaintiff failed to adduce any evidence of \u201cactual damages sustained as a result of [defendants\u2019] activities,\u201d as required by FCRA. <em>Casella v. Equifax Credit Info. Servs., </em>56 F.3d 469, 473 (2d Cir.1995). In fact, asked directly at trial whether \u201cthe Hoffman inquiry cause[d] you to be denied a mortgage,\u201d Northrop responded \u201cno.\u201d She added that \u201cI could not respond to Mortgage Masters\u2019 question. I can\u2019t tell you where I was as far as the process goes.\u201d Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of JMOL on the issue of compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">II. Punitive Damages in <em>Northrop</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">At the time of the incident in question, section 1681n of FCRA permitted the award of \u201csuch amount of punitive damages as the court may allow\u201d where \u201cuser[s] of information ... willfully fail to comply with any requirement imposed under [FCRA].\u201d <em>Northrop I, </em>134 F.3d at 47. To show willful noncompliance, a plaintiff must show that a defendant \u201cknowingly and intentionally committed an act in conscious disregard for the rights of others, but need not show malice or evil motive.\u201d <em>Bakker v. McKinnon, </em>152 F.3d 1007, 1013 (8th Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>accord Cushman v. Trans Union Corp., </em>115 F.3d 220, 226 (3d Cir.1997); <em>Yohay v. City of Alexandria Employees Credit Union, Inc., </em>827 F.2d 967, 972 (4th Cir.1987). Actual damages are not a statutory prerequisite to punitive damages. <em>See Yohay, </em>827 F.2d at 972 (citing authorities). Punitive damages are a question for the jury, subject to the court\u2019s duty to review excessive verdicts. <em>See Collins v. Retail Credit Co., </em>410 F.Supp. 924, 933-34 (E.D.Mich.1976); <em>see also Yohay, </em>827 F.2d at 972.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">On appeal, Northrop argues that the District Court misconstrued the statutory language permitting \u201csuch amount of punitive damages <em>as the court may allow </em>\u201d to mean that the jury\u2019s punitive damages determination was merely \u201cadvisory\u201d and, thus, that it erroneously reduced the amount of punitive damages awarded by the jury. We address the reduction of punitive damages below. On cross-appeal, each defendant argues that the District Court erred in not eliminating all punitive damages pursuant to Rule 50(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">Construing all the evidence in the light most favorable to Northrop, and giving Northrop the benefit of all reasonable inferences that the jury might have drawn in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>her favor from the evidence, we affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of JMOL to both Hoffman and Katzke. With respect to defendant Hoffman, a reasonable jury could have found that Strauss willfully violated Northrop\u2019s rights under FCRA by requesting her credit report even though he knew that his request was not connected with an automobile sale by Hoffman to Northrop \u2014 the only condition under which he was authorized to ask Trans Union to run a credit check. With respect to defendant Katzke, a reasonable jury could have found that he willfully violated Northrop\u2019s rights under the FCRA by asking Hoffman to run a credit check on Northrop, although Katzke knew (but did not communicate to Hoffman) that there was no legitimate reason to do so. Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of JMOL to both defendants on punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">III. Reduction of Punitive Damages and Remittitur in <em>Northrop</em></p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">When no constitutional challenge is raised, we review a district court\u2019s decision to reduce punitive damages for abuse of discretion. <em>See Cooper Indust., Inc. v. Leatherman Tool Group, </em>532 U.S. 424, 121 S.Ct. 1678, 1684, 149 L.Ed.2d 674 (2001); <em>Tingley Sys. v. Norse Sys., Inc., </em>49 F.3d 93, 96 (2d Cir.1995). The purpose of punitive damages under FCRA and CUTPA is deterrence. <em>See Tingley, </em>49 F.3d at 96; <em>Yohay, </em>827 F.2d at 972. In <em>Tingley, </em>we affirmed the district court\u2019s reduction of a jury\u2019s award of punitive damages -under CUTPA, noting that \u201cno evidence showed why the high figure [awarded by the jury] was necessary, or even appropriate, to serve this goal,\u201d and \u201cthe reduction of the award did not allow [defendant] to escape without penally.\u201d <em>Tingley, </em>49 F.3d at 96. However, we also held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Azj\">[i]f a district court finds that a verdict is excessive, it may order a new trial, a new trial limited to damages, or, under the practice of remittitur, may condition a denial of a motion for a new trial on the plaintiff\u2019s accepting damages in a reduced amount. It is not among the powers of the trial court, where the jury has awarded excessive damages, simply to reduce the damages without offering the prevailing party the option of a new trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-8\"><em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">In the instant case, the District Court erred in reducing the damages without offering Northrop \u2014 who contests the reduction \u2014 the option of a new trial. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the District Court insofar as it ordered remittitur in accordance with its reduction of the jury\u2019s award of punitive damages, and remand this matter to the District Court to offer Northrop the option of a new trial and, if appropriate, to order a new trial or a new trial limited to damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">IV. Attorneys\u2019 Fees in <em>Northrop</em></p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">\u201cAny person who willfully fails to comply with any requirement imposed\u201d by the FCRA is liable \u201cin the case of any successful action to enforce any liability under this section, [for] the costs of the action together with reasonable attorney\u2019s fees as determined by the court.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681n(a) (formerly \u00a7 1681n(3)). We review a district court\u2019s determination of attorneys\u2019 fees for abuse of discretion, and are \u201chighly deferential to the district court,\u201d recognizing that \u201cthe district court, which is intimately familiar with the nuances of the case, is in a far better position to make certain decisions than an appellate court, which must work from a cold record.\u201d <em>Matthew Bender &amp; Co. v. West Publ\u2019g, Co., </em>240 F.3d 116, 121 (2d Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>We hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in awarding plaintiff attorneys\u2019 fees or in awarding her fees of an amount slightly less than she requested, pursuant to the Court\u2019s own calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">V. <em>Hoffman </em>Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">On appeal, Hoffman unambiguously asserts that it makes \u201cno claim of indemnification, but rather a claim for misrepresentation with the damages measured by indemnification.\u201d Accordingly, Hoffman argues that indemnification law \u2014 under which Katzke attacks its claim \u2014 does not control its common law fraud claim. Construing Hoffman\u2019s action as a common law fraud action, we vacate the judgment of the District Court granting Hoffman damages against Katzke since Hoffman produced no evidence of actual damages resulting from Katzke\u2019s misrepresentation, other than the cost of the punitive damages assessed against it in <em>Northrop. See Paiva v. Vanech Heights Constr. Co., </em>159 Conn. 512, 515, 271 A.2d 69 (1970) (holding that showing injury is an essential element of an action for fraud based on false representation). Since those punitive damages were based on Hoffman\u2019s willful conduct, there is no legal basis for requiring Katzke to repay Hoffman for that cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">We have considered Hoffman\u2019s arguments on appeal, and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">VI. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">For the reasons set forth above, we hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">(1) AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court (a) insofar as it granted JMOL to defendants Hoffman and Katzke on compensatory damages in <em>Northrop, </em>(b) insofar as it denied JMOL to defendants Hoffman and Katzke on punitive damages and liability in <em>Northrop, </em>and (c) insofar as it granted Northrop attorneys\u2019 fees in <em>Northrop;</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">(2) VACATE the judgment of the District Court (a) insofar as it reduced punitive damages and ordered remittitur with respect to defendants Hoffman and Katzke in <em>Northrop, </em>and (b) insofar as it granted damages to Hoffman in <em>Hoffman; </em>and</p>\n<p id=\"b80-12\">(3) REMAND for the District Court to offer Northrop a new trial in light of its reduction of punitive damages in <em>Northrop </em>and, if appropriate, to order a new trial solely on the issue of defendants\u2019 liability or damages thereon.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b75-7\">. Northrop\u2019s state claim is entirely premised on her federal claim since her complaint alleges, <em>inter alia, </em>that \"the willful and wanton action of the Defendants in violation of federal statutes constitute unfair and/or deceptive trade practices as prohibited by [CUTPA].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b75-8\">. Northrop originally sued Jeffrey Hoffman, Hoffman's president, as well. He is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b75-13\">. The District Court initially granted defendants' motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim. However, in an opinion filed November 21, 1997, we vacated the District Court\u2019s dismissal and remanded. <em>See Northrop v. Hoffman of Simsbury, Inc., </em>134 F.3d 41 (2d Cir.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b76-6\">. Interrogatory 9, which addresses reliance, is poorly written, obscuring which party is supposed to have relied on Katzke's misrepresentations, as follows: \u201cDo you find that the plaintiffs, Hoffman of Simsbury and Jeffrey Hoffman, have proven by a preponderance of the evidence, that Lariy Katzke and/or American Honda, relied upon the false representations to the Hoffman plaintiffs?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
