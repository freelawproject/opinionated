H.P. Hood &amp; Sons, </em>596 F.2d 70, 72 (2d Cir.1979) (per curiam). The district court in this case declined to find that All Dental had shown the requisite likelihood of success on the merits, and focused instead on the serious question for litigation. However, the only \u201cserious question\u201d identified by the court referred to a patent not at issue in this case. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52 requires that, when granting a preliminary injunction, \u201cthe court shall ... set forth the findings of fact and conclusions of law which constitute the grounds of its action.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>Given what the district court gave us to work with, we are unable to affirm the preliminary injunction based on the record before us. We are particularly unwilling to do so in the present case, in which the factual recitations describe nothing but efforts by Advantage to inform potential in-fringers of the patentee\u2019s rights, <em>see </em>35 U.S.C. \u00a7 287(a), which efforts are not themselves illegal. We find it unfortunate that the parties were unable to have the obvious problems with the preliminary injunction resolved short of appeal to this court. Indeed, we do not understand how All Dental-and particularly All Dental\u2019s prominent and experienced counsel-expected to present a successful defense of the district court\u2019s action. We therefore <em>vacate </em>the preliminary injunction and <em>remand </em>for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">Costs to Advantage.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
