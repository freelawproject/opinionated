We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(a), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition de novo. See <em>Dows v. Wood, </em>211 F.3d 480, 484 (9th Cir.2000). Cruz bears the burden of showing that the state court adjudication of the merits of his claim \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 1523, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000); <em>Van Tran v. Lindsey, </em>212 F.3d 1143, 1153-54 (9th Cir.2000) (defining \u201cunreasonable application\u201d as involving situations where the state court has committed clear error).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-12\">Cruz contends that his right to due process was violated when the Arizona trial court, at his trial for first degree murder, allowed the reading of jury instructions as to the lesser included offenses of second degree murder and manslaughter, over his objection. We reject Cruz\u2019s contention because a lesser-included offense instruction is available in equal measure to the defense and to the prosecution. <em>Schmuck v. United States, </em>489 U.S. 705, 109 S.Ct. 1443, 103 L.Ed.2d 734 (1989). We, therefore, cannot say that the trial court\u2019s decision to include the lesser offense instructions over Cruz\u2019s objection was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of federal law. <em>Id; Williams, </em>120 S.Ct. at 1523.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b566-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
