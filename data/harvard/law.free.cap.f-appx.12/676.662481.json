The cases are therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-15\">General Background</p>\n<p id=\"b705-16\">Petitioner Patrick C. Lynn was convicted in a Kansas state court in November 1996 of aggravated kidnaping, aggravated burglary, aggravated sodomy, and rape, and was sentenced to state prison in January 1997. Lynn has not completed the state court appeal process. In fact, the Kansas Court of Appeals has remanded his case to the state district court for resen-tencing. Nevertheless, Lynn, acting pro se, has filed the three above-captioned ha-beas cases in federal court, as well as numerous and unsuccessful civil actions in federal and state courts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The habeas cases are before this court on Lynn\u2019s applications for certificates of appealability (COA). As a matter of judicial efficiency, we have companioned the cases for purposes of disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>Case No. 00-3158</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">Although <em>Lynn v. McClain, </em>No. 00-3158, 2001 WL 328672, is styled as a habe-as action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1651, 2241, 2254, it does not directly challenge the constitutionality of Lynn\u2019s criminal proceedings. In his petition, Lynn sought relief from judgments entered in his federal and state civil rights cases, based on a contention of newly-discovered evidence of fraud on the part of a state court judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">The district court carefully parsed Lynn\u2019s claims and determined that: (1) it lacked habeas jurisdiction because Lynn was not in custody under the conviction or sentence under attack, <em>see Maleng v. Cook, </em>490 U.S. 488, 490, 109 S.Ct. 1923, 104 L.Ed.2d 540 (1989); (2) absent habeas jurisdiction, the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine barred federal review of the state civil judgments, <em>see Dist. of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 486, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>Rooker v. Fid. Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 415-16, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923); and (3) a habeas action may not be used either (a) to attack 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), which limits a prisoner\u2019s ability to proceed in forma pauperis in civil actions after the dismissal of three such actions on the grounds that they were frivolous, malicious, or failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or (b) to evade restrictions imposed in Lynn\u2019s cases filed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The court therefore denied all requested relief and dismissed the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">To qualify for a COA, a movant must make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2), showing that his issues are debatable among jurists of reason, subject to a different resolution on appeal, or deserving of further proceedings. <em>See Montez v. McKinna, </em>208 F.3d 862, 869 (10th Cir.2000). Here, we conclude that Lynn has failed to make the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny his request for a COA and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">Case No. 00-3338</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">In <em>Lynn v. Nelson, </em>No. 00-3338, filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, Lynn sought ha-beas corpus review of alleged constitutional error in his criminal trial. He also requested a stay of the resentencing proceeding, contending that the assigned state court judge would not provide him with a fair and unbiased hearing. The district court determined that federal intervention in ongoing state proceedings was not warranted. It therefore denied the stay motion and dismissed the habeas petition without prejudice, pending exhaustion of state court remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">\u201cBefore a federal court may grant habeas relief to a state prisoner, the prisoner must exhaust his remedies in state court. In other words, the state prisoner must give the state courts an opportunity to act on his claims before he presents those claims to a federal court in a habeas petition.\u201d O'Su<em>llivan v. Boerckel, </em>526 U.S. 838, 842, 119 S.Ct. 1728, 144 L.Ed.2d 1 (1999). It is evident from a review of the record that Lynn has not satisfied the federal exhaustion requirement. Accordingly, we deny the request for a COA and dismiss the appeal. We also deny Lynn\u2019s \u201cEmergency Motion for a Stay of State Proceedings and Motion for Order Compelling New State Judge or Remand for Evidentiary Hearing.\u201d His \u201cMotion to Consider or Consolidate to Criminal Case Appeal\u201d is denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">Case No. 01-3036</p>\n<p id=\"b706-12\">In <em>Lynn v. Cleaver, </em>No. 01-3036, Lynn renewed his request for habeas corpus review of his criminal case and a stay of the state resentencing proceeding. The district court again denied relief on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>grounds that he failed to exhaust state court procedures. Lynn\u2019s appeal of this ruling was filed February 22, 2001. Although the time has not yet expired for the filing of appellant/petitioner\u2019s opening brief and application for a COA, we have determined that the appeal is so meritless that there is no need to await further filings. Lynn\u2019s continued assertion of the same issues and arguments constitutes abuse of the judicial process. We consider the notice of appeal to be a request for certificate of appealability, <em>see </em>Fed.R.App.P. 22(b)(2), and deny the request. The appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Lynn\u2019s filings in these appeals are repetitive, frivolous, and malicious. We note that his past civil filings have subjected him to the \u201cthree strike\u201d provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Unless Lynn is in \u201c \u2018imminent danger of serious physical injury,\u2019 \u201d he is no longer entitled to proceed in for-ma pauperis in civil actions in federal court. <em>See White v. Colorado, </em>157 F.3d 1226, 1232 (10th Cir.1998) (quoting \u00a7 1915(g)). This prohibition does not apply to habeas proceedings. <em>See United States v. Simmonds, </em>111 F.3d 737, 741 (10th Cir.1997). However, we caution Lynn that continuing to \u201c \u2018engage[ ] in a pattern of litigation activity which is manifestly abusive,\u2019 \u201d <em>Howard v. Mail-Well Envelope Co., </em>150 F.3d 1227, 1232 (10th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>Winslow v. Hunter (In re Winslow), </em>17 F.3d 314, 315 (10th Cir.1994)), will result in additional filing restrictions, applicable to any type of civil case.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-11\">The appeals are DISMISSED and all outstanding motions are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b705-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir.R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b705-13\">.
