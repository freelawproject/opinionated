The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-24\">Petitioner Lester L. Newton, a Colorado state prisoner convicted by a jury of various counts of burglary, kidnaping of a sexual assault victim, aggravated robbery, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>and assault, seeks a certificate of appeala-bility (COA) to challenge the district court\u2019s order denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A) (no appeal unless COA issued). We deny issuance of a COA and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">The following is a summary of the underlying facts as stated in the decision of the Colorado Court of Appeals disposing of Newton\u2019s direct appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-5\">[Newton] and three other armed men forced entry into the home occupied by the man and woman victims. Over the next several hours, they bound, beat, and terrorized the victims, while ransacking the house in search of money they believed to be present. The woman victim was taken to another bedroom where one of the men groped her genitalia and sodomized her with the barrel of his gun.... The robbers left after taking cash, jewelry and other items.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AE4\">Appellant\u2019s App. vol. A, at 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">On appeal, petitioner argues he is entitled to habeas relief on the following grounds: (1) during jury selection, the prosecution excused a prospective juror on the basis of race, in violation of <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986); (2) the prosecution willfully withheld exculpatory evidence from the defense, in violation of <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963); (3) the trial court improperly allowed a police detective to testify that Newton was guilty and the victims were credible; and (4) the trial court\u2019s overt hostility to Newton and his attorney deprived him of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">This case is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA). Before a COA will issue, petitioner must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). To do so, he must demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">The district court held that petitioner had not exhausted his claims relating to the police detective\u2019s testimony and the trial court\u2019s hostility because he had not provided the state courts with a fair opportunity to apply controlling federal legal principles. As the district court correctly stated, these claims are proeedurally barred unless petitioner shows cause and prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justice. <em>Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 750, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991). In his reply brief, for the first time petitioner made an argument that he had exhausted these claims. We do not consider claims presented for the first time on appeal, <em>Walker v. Mather (In re Walker), </em>959 F.2d 894, 896 (10th Cir.1992), and we generally do not consider claims presented for the first time in a reply brief, <em>Codner v. United States, </em>17 F.3d 1331, 1332 n. 2 (10th Cir.1994). Accordingly, we decline to consider petitioner\u2019s exhaustion arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">We have carefully reviewed the briefs and the appendix. For substantially the same reasons underlying the district court\u2019s June 29, 2000 order of dismissal, we conclude that petitioner \u201chas failed to raise issues that are debatable among jurists, or that a court could resolve the issues differently, or that the questions deserve further proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Sistrunk, </em>111 F.3d 91, 91 (10th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>The application for issuance of a COA is denied. Appeal DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b715-7\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir.R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
