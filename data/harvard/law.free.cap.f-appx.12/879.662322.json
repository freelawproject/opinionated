The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-20\">In this diversity case, plaintiff Tina Armstrong is appealing the district court\u2019s entry of judgment in favor of defendant La Quinta Inns, Inc. under Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a). Our jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-21\">Plaintiff checked into a La Quinta Inn in Amarillo, Texas, on the afternoon of June 28, 1998. Plaintiff alleges that, after she located her room and was leaving the room to return to her car to get her luggage, an unknown man pushed her back into the room and sexually assaulted her. Plaintiff subsequently filed a diversity action against defendant in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico. Plaintiff asserted a premises liability claim against defendant under Texas law alleging that defendant was negligent in failing to provide adequate security at the hotel and that defendant\u2019s negligence was a cause of the sexual assault.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-22\">Plaintiffs case proceeded to trial before a jury on June 7, 8, and 9, 2000. At the conclusion of plaintiffs case-in-chief, the district court found that no reasonable juror could conclude, under Texas law, 'that defendant should have foreseen that a sexual assault or other similar violent crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>was likely to occur at the hotel. Relying on the decision of the Texas Supreme Court in <em>Timberwalk Apartments, Partners, Inc. v. Cain, </em>972 S.W.2d 749 (Tex.1998), the district court therefore granted defendant\u2019s motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a) for judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">Plaintiff argues on appeal that she put forth sufficient evidence of prior criminal activity, both at the hotel and in the immediate vicinity, to establish a prima facie case of foreseeability under <em>Timberwalk. </em>We have conducted a de novo review of the district court\u2019s decision to grant defendant judgment as a matter of law, and we affirm for substantially the same reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s memorandum opinion dated June 13, 2000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b907-17\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir.R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b907-23\">. Because the district court's jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a)(1), we must apply state law to the substantive issues on this appeal. See <em>Peck v. Horrocks Eng\u2019rs, Inc., </em>106 F.3d 949, 952 (10th Cir.1997). The district court applied Texas law to plaintiff's substantive claims, and the parties have not challenged the applicability of Texas law on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b908-16\">. Plaintiff also argues that the district court erred in: (1) refusing to allow her liability expert to supplement his expert report and testify regarding defendant\u2019s security manual; (2) refusing to allow into evidence certain deposition testimony from defendant's corporate security director; and (3) refusing to allow into evidence certain deposition testimony concerning drug use on the hotel premises in March of 1998. We hold that the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings were not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
