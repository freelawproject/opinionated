Vaksdal entered a guilty plea to conspiracy to transport, receive, or distribute child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(1), (a)(2), and (b)(1), and was sentenced to a term of 103 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, he challenges his sentence. He argues that, under the holding of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the district court\u2019s enhancement of his offense level is unconstitutional. Because Vaksdal did not raise the <em>Apprendi </em>issue before the district court, we review his claim only for plain error, <em>United States v. Hishaw, </em>235 F.3d 565, 574 (10th Cir.2000), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-23\"><em>\u201cApprendi </em>enunciates the following rule of constitutional law: \u2018Other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime <em>beyond the prescribed statutory maximum, </em>must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>235 F.3d 1231, 1235 (10th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>at 2362-63) (emphasis added). Thus, <em>Apprendi </em>principles apply only to cases that involve the imposition of a sentence more severe than the statutory maximum for defendant\u2019s offense. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Sullivan, </em>242 F.3d 1248 (10th Cir.2001) (holding that <em>\u201cApprendi </em>does not apply to sentencing factors that increase a defendant\u2019s guideline range but do not increase the statutory maximum\u201d); <em>United States v. Meshack, </em>225 F.3d 556, 576 (5th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 121 S.Ct. 834, 148 L.Ed.2d 716 (2001), <em>amended in part, </em>244 F.3d 367 (5th Cir.2001) (holding that <em>Apprendi </em>is not violated where a non-jury factual determination is used to enhance a sentence within the minimum statutory range).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">In Vaksdal\u2019s ease, the district court added additional levels to his base offense level determined pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2G2.2(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Vaksdal disputes the constitutionality of (1) two levels because the pornographic material involved a prepubescent minor or a minor under the age of 12 years, <em>see </em>\u00a7 2G2.2(b)(l); (2) five levels for engaging in a pattern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of minors, <em>see </em>\u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4); and (3) two levels because the abused or exploited minors were vulnerable victims, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l). These nine additional levels were imposed based upon facts set out only in the Presentence Investigation Report, and not in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">The statutory maximum provided by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(1), (a)(2), and (b)(1) for Vaksdal\u2019s offense is fifteen years; the sentence imposed upon Vaksdal was 103 months. In light of the fact that Vaksdal\u2019s sentence fell within the statutory maximum sentence, there is no <em>Apprendi </em>violation here. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b697-18\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir.R. 36.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-24\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to grant the parties\u2019 request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. See Fed.R.App.P. 34(f); 10th Cir.R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b698-8\">.
