(\u201cMcDaniel\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), petitions for review of an order of respondent National Labor Relations Board (\u201cNLRB\u201d or the \u201cBoard\u201d) ordering the Company to pay Leon Balsam $36,896.82 in lost wages and to pay $6,082.92 to the Pension Fund of Local 259, International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, AFL CIO (the \u201cUnion\u201d) on Balsam\u2019s behalf, as remedies for the Company\u2019s discriminatory discharge of Balsam in violation of the National Labor Relations Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), <em>see McDaniel Ford, Inc., </em>1997 WL 34912, 322 NLRB 956 (Jan. 28, 1997) (finding that McDaniel violated 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(3), by unlawfully discharging Balsam for union activities), <em>aff'd, McDaniel Ford, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>No. 97-4095 (2d Cir. Aug. 27, 1997) (enforcing the Board\u2019s order against McDaniel in its entirety). McDaniel contends principally that the backpay award improperly compensated Balsam for time for which he received unemployment compensation or time during which he was unable to work, and that the order that the Company make a payment to the Union was based on the erroneous premise that Balsam was a member of the bargaining unit covered by the Union. The NLRB cross-petitions for enforcement of its order. Finding no merit in McDaniel\u2019s contentions, we enforce the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-15\">\u201cThe gross backpay due an employee who has been wrongfully discriminated against is the amount that will restore the situation as nearly as possible, to that which would have obtained but for the illegal discrimination.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Ferguson Electric Co., </em>242 F.3d 426, 431 (2d Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). Backpay awards serve, <em>inter alia, </em>to deter employers from engaging in unfair labor practices. <em>See id. </em>It has long been recognized that it is within the Board\u2019s discretion to refuse to deduct from such an award amounts the victimized employee received as unemployment compensation. <em>See, e.g., NLRB v. Gullett Gin Co., </em>340 U.S. 361, 365-66, 71 S.Ct. 337, 95 L.Ed. 337 (1951). We see no abuse of discretion in the refusal to make such a deduction with respect to Balsam.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Nor is there merit in McDaniel\u2019s challenge to the Board\u2019s findings with respect to Balsam\u2019s ability to work and his membership in the bargaining unit with which the Company has a collective bargaining agreement. Once the Board\u2019s General Counsel has established the gross amount of back pay, \u201c \u2018the burden shifts to the employer to establish facts which would negative the existence of liability ... or which would mitigate that liability.\u2019 \u201d <em>NLRB v. Ferguson Electric Co., </em>242 F.3d at 431 (quoting <em>NLRB v. Browne, </em>890 F.2d 605, 608 (2d Cir.1989) (internal quotation marks omitted)). The Board\u2019s findngs of fact are conclusive if, in light of the record as a whole, they are supported by \u201c \u2018substantial evidence,\u2019 \u201d <em>NLRB v. G&amp;T Terminal Packaging Corp., </em>246 F.3d 103, 114 (2d Cir.2001) (quoting 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(f)); \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d means \u201cmore than a mere scintilla,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion,\u201d <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 477, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951) (internal quotation marks omitted). Further, the particular remedy selected by the Board for an unfair labor practice \u201cis subject to limited judicial review, and \u2018will not be overturned if it may fairly be said to have as its purpose ends that will effectuate the policies of the Act.\u2019 \u201d <em>NLRB v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Buffalo, Inc., </em>191 F.3d 316, 324 (2d Cir.1999) (quoting <em>Manhattan Eye Ear &amp; Throat Hospital v. NLRB, </em>942 F.2d 151, 156 (2d Cir.1991)); <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c) (authorizing the Board to issue orders requiring such action \u201cas 'will effectuate the policies of [the Act]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The record before the Board in the present matter contained evidence that Balsam in fact worked during all but one of the quarters for which backpay was awarded, working in every quarter after he found work following his discharge by McDaniel. Indeed, Balsam worked for McDaniel upon his reinstatement after adjudication of the merits of this unfair labor practice. Despite Balsam\u2019s having been discharged by one employer on account of sickness, therefore, there was substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s finding that Balsam was not unable to work at the pertinent times.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The record as to the nature of Balsam\u2019s duties also amply justified the Board\u2019s finding that he was a utility employee who was a member of the bargaining unit represented by the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">McDaniel\u2019s additional contention that the Board should have allowed it to submit documents after the conclusion of the hearing provides no basis for refusing to enforce the Board\u2019s order. Several adjournments had been granted at the request of the Company\u2019s attorney, and it was not an abuse of discretion to deny yet another such request. Nor, given the fact that the Company sent a representative to the hearing, has any reason been presented why the documents in question could not have been offered by that representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">We have considered all of McDaniel\u2019s contentions in support of review and in opposition to the Board\u2019s petition for enforcement and have found them to be without merit. The petition for review is denied; the petition for enforcement is granted. The order of the Board is enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
