We have reviewed the district court\u2019s opinion accepting the recommendation of the magistrate judge and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal substantially on the reasoning of the district court. <em>Jones v. Wannamaker, </em>No. CA-1238-2-18AJ (D.S.C. Oct. 31, 2000).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b143-11\"><em> </em>The district court denied relief based partially on the interpretation of \u00a7 2254(d)(1) announced in <em>Green v. French, </em>143 F.3d 865 (4th Cir.1998). The Supreme Court overruled that aspect of <em>Green, </em>however, in <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). We have reviewed Jones' appeal in light of <em>Williams </em>and conclude that the state post conviction court's decision was not contraiy to, and did not involve an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court. <em>Id. </em>at 409-10.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
