The facts and prior proceedings are known to the parties; they are not restated herein except as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-24\">Petitioners, natives and citizens of Mexico, entered the United States without inspection in July 1990. On November 8, 1996, they were served with Orders to Show Cause (\u201cOSC\u201d) why they should not be deported as aliens having entered the United States without inspection. In a decision dated May 29, 1997, an Immigration Judge pretermitted Petitioners\u2019 applications for suspension of deportation because Petitioners had failed to meet the continuous physical presence requirement before being served with the OSC and thus were statutorily ineligible for suspension. On appeal, the BIA affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-25\">Petitioners contend that they were eligible for suspension of deportation and challenge the BIA\u2019s decision that the \u201cstop-time rule\u201d \u2014 a new continuous physical presence requirement set forth in the Ille<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>gal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 3009-625 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d) \u2014 bars such relief in their case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Petitioners\u2019 arguments challenging the application of the stop-time rule are foreclosed by our decision in <em>Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510 (9th Cir.2001). The Board therefore correctly concluded that the stop-time rule applied to their application.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">PETITIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b622-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b623-18\">. The Immigration Judge properly applied the stop-time rule to Petitioners because her order pretermitting Petitioners' application for suspension of deportation was issued subsequent to the April 1, 1997, effective date of IIRIRA. <em>See Astrero v. INS, </em>104 F.3d 264, 266 (9th Cir.1996) (holding that IIRIRA's effective date is April 1, 1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
