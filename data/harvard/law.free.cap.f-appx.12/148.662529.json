Goolsby\u2019s counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Although Goolsby was informed of his right to file a supplemental brief, he has not done so. His attorney raises only one issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-25\">Goolsby contends the district court erred in determining the amount of drugs upon which Goolsby\u2019s sentence was based. This Court reviews for clear error the district court\u2019s factual finding concerning the amount of drugs attributable to a defendant for sentencing purposes. <em>See United States v. Randall, </em>171 F.3d 195, 210 (4th Cir.1999). Because Goolsby en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>tered into a stipulation regarding the amount of drugs attributable to him, which the district court found to have a reasonable factual basis, we find the district court did not clearly err. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>29 F.3d 172, 174 (4th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Gilliam, </em>987 F.2d 1009, 1013 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>this court has reviewed the record for reversible error and found none. We therefore affirm. We deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw at this time. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests a petition be filed, but counsel believes such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
