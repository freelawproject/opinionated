The Secretary of Veterans Affairs responds and moves to dismiss as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-18\">A review of the certified list reflects that the Veterans Court dismissed Cortes-Castillo\u2019s case in an order dated July 7, 2000. A motion for reconsideration was filed on July 21, 2000. On August 8, 2000, the Veterans Court denied Cortes-Castillo\u2019s motion for reconsideration and entered judgment. Cortes-Castillo\u2019s notice of appeal was received on November 17, 2000, or 98 days after entry of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-20\">Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(a), review of a final decision by the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims \u201cshall be obtained by filing a notice of appeal ... within the time and in the manner prescribed for appeal to the United States courts of appeal from United States district courts.\u201d In district court cases involving the United States, the time period for filing a notice of appeal is within sixty days after entry of judgment. Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1). \u201cThe time for appeal is \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kraft, Inc. v. United States, </em>85 F.3d 602, 604 (Fed.Cir.1996), quoting <em>Budinich v. Becton Dickinson &amp; Co., </em>486 U.S. 196, 203, 108 S.Ct. 1717, 100 L.Ed.2d 178 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-21\">Cortes-Castillo argues that he did not believe that the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims had decided all of his pending motions until issuance of the mandate on October 11, 2000. However, under the federal rules, the notice of appeal in this case was due within 60 days after the entry date of judgment by the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, i.e., October 10, 2000, and not the date of the mandate. Because the notice of appeal was received on November 17, 2000, 38 days late, this court must dismiss Cortes-Castillo\u2019s appeal as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-22\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b974-23\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b974-24\">(1) Cortes-Castillo\u2019s motion to treat his \u201cbrief of appellant\u201d as his response to the order to show cause is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>(2) The Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.
