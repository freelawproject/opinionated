Newcomb appeals the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to Newcomb\u2019s former employer on his claim filed pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e to 2000e-17 (West 1994 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 2000). We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error. Although we conclude that Newcomb established a prima facie case of discrimination, he faded to rebut the legitimate, non-discriminatory reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>proffered by the employer for its decision to promote several women and not to promote Newcomb. <em>See Evans v. Technologies Applications &amp; Serv. Co., </em>80 F.3d 954, 959- 60 (4th Cir.1996); <em>Carter v. Ball, </em>33 F.3d 450, 458 (4th Cir.1994). Specifically, the employer justified its actions by asserting that the employees who were promoted had better management and interpersonal skills than Newcomb. Newcomb presented no evidence, other than his own assessment of his qualifications, to establish that the employer\u2019s proffered reason for its decision was a pretext for discrimination; his self-assessment is simply insufficient to carry the day. <em>Evans, </em>80 F.3d at 960- 61. Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
