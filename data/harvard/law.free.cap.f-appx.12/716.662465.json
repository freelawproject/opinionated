The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-16\">Petitioner was serving an indeterminate sentence in the Colorado penal system when he escaped from the Colorado State Hospital. While on the lam, he was convicted of child molestation in California, where he served time and was later paroled. California then returned him to the custody of the Colorado Department of Corrections. Petitioner filed a habeas corpus petition with the federal district court of Colorado, arguing that Colorado has no authority to further incarcerate him in light of a \u201cdischarge\u201d letter he had received from the Colorado State Hospital at some point after his escape. The court denied the habeas petition and Petitioner\u2019s subsequent requests for a certificate of appealability and leave to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal. Petitioner appeals all three district court orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-17\">Throughout these proceedings, Petitioner\u2019s claims appear to have been treated as though brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Given the nature of his claims, however, we note that, technically, they should have proceeded under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 as an attack on the execution of his sentence. <em>See Montez v. McKinna, </em>208 F.3d 862, 865 (10th Cir.2000). Either way, the consequences are the same in the instant case: Petitioner must obtain a certificate of appealability prior to being heard on appeal. <em>See id. </em>at 868-69. A court will issue a certificate \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Petitioner could do so by demonstrating that his claims warrant fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>ther proceedings, \u201csubject to a different resolution on appeal,\u201d or are debatable among reasonable jurists. <em>Montez, </em>208 F.3d at 869. We agree with the district court that Petitioner has failed to make the necessary showing. Accordingly, we DENY Petitioner\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability and DISMISS his ha-beas appeal. Petitioner\u2019s application to proceed in forma pauperis is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b745-14\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir.R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
