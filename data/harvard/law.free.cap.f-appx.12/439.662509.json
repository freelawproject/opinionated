(Taxpayer) appeals the tax court\u2019s ruling upholding the Commissioner of Internal Revenue\u2019s decision that Taxpayer\u2019s Employee Stock Ownership Plan did not qualify under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 401(a), and thus, the Taxpayer\u2019s related Employee Stock Ownership Trust was not exempt from income tax. Contrary to Taxpayer\u2019s argument that it paid \u201cmanagement fees\u201d to its founder, Eugene Van Roekel, as an employee and not as an independent contractor, the tax court\u2019s order notes Taxpayer\u2019s concession that Van Roekel was an independent contractor and the scant record before this court does not indicate that Taxpayer ever sought to prove otherwise. Indeed, the treatment of the management fees on the Taxpayer\u2019s and Van Roekel\u2019s tax returns show Van Roekel was an independent contractor. Having considered the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude the Taxpayer\u2019s argument is foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See Howard E. Clendenen Inc. v. Commissioner, </em>207 F.3d 1071 at 1072-73, 1075 (8th Cir.2000). We affirm on the basis of the tax court\u2019s opinion. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
