Specifically, Chambers contends that sovereign immunity extends to public officials performing \u201cdiscretionary\u201d functions associated with their offices and that his duties as county engineer are \u201cclearly\u201d discretionary functions as that term is understood under Kentucky law. This issue was not squarely before us when we decided the appeal, and we regard the issue as waived. Chambers may not belatedly raise this issue in a petition for rehearing. <em>Costo v. United States, </em>922 F.2d 302 (6th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-24\">Nowhere in his brief before this Court does Chambers argue that he is immune because his duties as county engineer are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>discretionary. Relying on <em>Franklin Cty., Ky. v. Malone, </em>957 S.W.2d 195 (1997),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Chambers\u2019 argument on appeal focused on whether there was \u201cpersonal, active negligence on the part of Chambers.\u201d Final Brief of Defendants at 8. Our opinion used the framework set forth in <em>Malone </em>and in the parties\u2019 briefs for analyzing tort liability of county employees. We held that there was enough evidence of negligence on the part of Chambers to make summary judgment inappropriate and therefore reversed the district court\u2019s judgment as to Chambers. Opinion at 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Nor does it appear from the record before us that the issue of whether Chambers\u2019 duties were discretionary or ministerial was clearly raised below. The district court also analyzed Chambers\u2019 conduct under the same standard used by the Kentucky Supreme Court in analyzing the conduct of the county jailer in <em>Malone </em>and it granted summary judgment to Chambers because it found \u201cno active personal wrongdoing\u201d and no evidence that Chambers exercised less than ordinary care in selecting his employees. Memorandum Opinion of the District Court at 6 (Mar. 18, 1999). The opinion of the district court did not address whether Chambers\u2019 duties were discretionary or ministerial.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">In sum, the issue of whether Chambers\u2019 duties are discretionary in nature was not raised by the parties or the court below, and it was not squarely presented to this Court either. Chambers cannot now claim that he is immune because his duties are discretionary. The Petition for Rehearing is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b314-6\">. The proper construction of <em>Malone </em>is the subject of current debate in the Kentucky courts. <em>See, e.g., Bd. of Claims of Ky. v. Banks, </em>31 S.W.3d 436, 438 (Ky.Ct.App.2000) (discussing whether <em>Malone </em>is authority for finding waiver of immunity for counties and noting split in cases since the decision in <em>Malone); Turner v. Newport Bd. of Ed., </em>No. 1999-CA-001766-MR, 2000 WL 1364429, at *3 (Ky.Ct.App. Sept. 22, 2000) (proper interpretation of <em>Malone </em>subject of \"great debate\u201d and noting that <em>Malone </em>distinguishes between official immunity for <em>state </em>employees and <em>county </em>employees by utilizing a different analysis in determining liability of each).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
