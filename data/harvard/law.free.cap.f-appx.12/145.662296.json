Peyton seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying his motion filed under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2000). We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error with respect to most of Peyton\u2019s claims.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> However, we note that Peyton\u2019s affidavit successfully created a genuine issue of material fact with respect to counsel\u2019s advice regarding the propriety of a guilty plea. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The district court erred in dismissing this claim without a hearing. Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings, Rule 8; <em>Raines v. United States, </em>423 F.2d 526, 529 (4th Cir.1970). Accordingly, although we affirm substantially on the reasoning of the district court with respect to all other claims, we vacate the portion of the district court\u2019s order dismissing Peyton\u2019s claim relating to the sufficiency of counsel\u2019s advice regarding a guilty plea. We remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this holding. We grant Peyton\u2019s motion to file a supplemental brief and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b173-15\"> We have considered and rejected the possibility of reversible error in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Apprendi v.
