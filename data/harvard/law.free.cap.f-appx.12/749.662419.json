The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Appellant Orville Dwyer, a federal inmate appearing <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s decision dismissing his motion to vacate, set aside or correct his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. We deny Mr. Dwyer\u2019s request for a certificate of appeal-ability and dismiss his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Mr. Dwyer pled guilty to conspiracy to possess, with intent to distribute, 100 kilograms or more of marijuana; he did not appeal his five-year sentence. In his \u00a7 2255 motion, Mr. Dwyer raised several grounds for review of his conviction and sentence, including allegations of governmental misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel. Mr. Dwyer based part of his governmental misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel claims on his assertion that the prosecution and Drug Enforcement Administration agents withheld information identifying one of his co-defendants, Mr. Williams, as a confidential informer.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">The district court assigned the matter to a magistrate judge who issued an exhaustive twenty-four page report, consisting of multiple findings of fact, a comprehensive review of the issues presented and applicable law, and a recommendation for dismissal of Mr. Dwyer\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. Specifically, the magistrate judge found nothing in the record to substantiate Mr. Dwyer\u2019s conclusory allegation that Mr. Williams acted as a confidential informant or that the government concealed this fact. Instead, the magistrate judge found the presentence report unambiguously characterized Mr. Williams as a target of the investigation and that Mr. Dwyer clearly accepted the factual basis of that report at his sentencing hearing. After a <em>de novo </em>review of the magistrate judge\u2019s report and Mr. Dwyer\u2019s objections thereto, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s findings and recommended disposition, and dismissed Mr. Dwyer\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">On appeal, Mr. Dwyer raises the same assertion of governmental misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel based on the government\u2019s failure to identify Mr. Williams, known as \u201cFrenchie,\u201d as a confidential informer. By not identifying Mr. Williams as a confidential informer, Mr. Dwyer asserts drug enforcement agents provided false statements. In turn, Mr. Dwyer claims his trial counsel acted ineffectively by failing to ascertain that these drug enforcement agents gave false statements or defend Mr. Dwyer\u2019s case using this outrageous conduct as a defense. Mr. Dywer reasons that if his counsel had \u201cvigorously pursued the true fact that it was not a real reverse-sting and utilized the fictitious information supplied by agents,\u201d the result of his proceeding \u201cwould have been different.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">\u201cIn reviewing the denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion, we review the district court\u2019s legal rulings <em>de novo </em>and its findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Cockerham, </em>237 F.3d 1179, 1181 (10th Cir.2001). In this case, the magistrate judge found nothing in the record to substantiate Mr. Dwyer\u2019s self-serving allegation that Mr. Williams acted as a confidential informant or that the government concealed this fact. Our review of the record, including the Drug Enforcement Administration agents\u2019 reports, leads us to the same conclusion. While one of the reports identifies Mr. Williams as also being known as \u201cFren-chie,\u201d nothing identifies Mr. Williams as a confidential informer. Thus, we cannot say the magistrate judge\u2019s finding of fact, and the district court\u2019s adoption thereof, is clearly erroneous. Because the factual predicate supporting Mr. Dwyer\u2019s allegations of governmental misconduct and inef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>fective assistance of counsel is unsubstantiated, his legal arguments supporting those allegations likewise lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">In order for this court to grant a certificate of appealability, Mr. Dwyer must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d as required under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2258(c)(2). He fails to do so. Accordingly, for the reasons stated herein, and for substantially the same reasons provided in the May 4, 2000 Magistrate Judge\u2019s Findings and Recommended Disposition, and the district court\u2019s June 23, 2000 Order Adopting Magistrate Judge\u2019s Findings and Recommended Disposition and Dismissing Action with Prejudice, we deny Mr. Dwyer\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability and DISMISS his appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b777-16\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir.R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
