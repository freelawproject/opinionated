The case is, therefore, ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-24\">Roland Hall filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against the Geary County Board of County Commissioners and the Geary County Sheriff. He alleged that these defendants violated his Fourth Amendment rights by arresting him without probable cause. He also sought damages for physical pain and suffering and mental anguish allegedly caused by insect bites that he obtained while in custody of the Geary County Sheriff\u2019s Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-25\">Invoking 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), the district court dismissed Mr. Hall\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. It reasoned that Mr. Hall\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim was barred by the two-year statute of limitations for \u00a7 1983 actions filed in Kansas. <em>See </em>Rec. doe. 5, at 2 (Dist. Ct. Order, filed July 24, 2000) (citing <em>Hamilton v. City of Overland Park, </em>730 F.2d 613 (10th Cir.1984)). The court noted that the allegedly improper arrest occurred in March 1998 but that Mr. Hall did not file this action until May 31, 2000. As to Mr. Hall\u2019s insect bites, the court concluded that they did not constitute the kind of injury necessary to establish an Eighth Amendment claim \u2014 \u201c \u2018the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain\u2019 that is grossly disproportionate to the crime underlying the inmate\u2019s incarceration or resultfs] in a deprivation of basic human needs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3 (quoting <em>Rhodes v. Chapman, </em>452 U.S. 337, 346-47, 101 S.Ct. 2392, 69 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">On appeal, Mr. Hall argues that the district court erred in dismissing his Fourth Amendment claim. He maintains that the two-year statute of limitations did not begin to run until the conclusion of his trial in August 1998 and that, as a result, he filed his claim within the limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">We are not persuaded by Mr. Hall\u2019s argument. In <em>Beck v. City of Muskogee Police Department, </em>195 F.3d 553, 558 (10th Cir.1999), this circuit applied \u201cthe general rule that causes of action relating to an allegedly illegal arrest arise at the time of arrest.\u201d Mr. Hall has failed to establish that any exception to that rule is applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of Mr. Hall\u2019s complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s dismissal counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. S 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b883-15\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir.R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b884-15\">. Mr. Hall does not challenge the district court's dismissal of his Eighth Amendment claim, and we therefore do not address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
