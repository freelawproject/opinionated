The court has determined that the issues presented occa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>sion no need for an opinion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 36; D.C.Cir. Rule 36(b). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s order filed May 24, 2000, be affirmed. Appellant\u2019s application for a writ of habeas corpus filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 constitutes an attack on the validity of his conviction and sentence. A challenge to a conviction or sentence must be brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 in the court that imposed the sentence unless it is shown that the remedy is inadequate or ineffective. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Appellant has not made the requisite showing. Furthermore, even when a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 habeas remedy is available to a federal prisoner, he must seek the writ in the district where his custodian is found. <em>See Guerra v. Meese, </em>786 F.2d 414 (D.C.Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after disposition of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
