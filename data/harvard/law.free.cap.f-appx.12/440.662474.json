The Honorable Richard G. Kopf, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the District of Nebraska, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b469-9\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">Thorson, Inc. sued First Community Insurance Company (FCIC) on a public contractor\u2019s payment bond furnished by FCIC. This is a case that is in federal court because of our jurisdiction in cases in which the plaintiff is a citizen of one state and the defendant a citizen of another. The outcome is governed by the substantive law of Minnesota.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">Thorson commenced its action within the limitation period provided in the bond, but not within the statutory limitation period provided in Minn.Stat. \u00a7 574.31 (1998). The District Court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> denied FCIC\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding that Minn.Stat. \u00a7 574.26 (1998) does not preclude parties from providing a longer limitation period in their bond than that provided by the statute, that the limitation period provided in the bond governs the question whether Thorson\u2019s lawsuit was timely filed, and, applying that limitation period to the undisputed facts, that the lawsuit was timely. The parties having agreed that Thorson was entitled to summary judgment if its lawsuit was timely, the court granted Thorson\u2019s motion for summary judgment. In addition to entering judgment for Thorson on the bond, the District Court awarded Thorson attorney fees and costs pursuant to Minn.Stat. \u00a7 574.26 subd. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-16\">FCIC appeals. Responding to the issues FCIC raises, we first hold that the District Court did not err as a matter of law by finding that the savings clause in the bond did not incorporate the relevant statute to supersede the longer period of limitation provided in the bond. Having reviewed the matter de novo, we are satisfied the District Court correctly read <em>Nelson Roofing &amp; Contracting, Inc. v. C.W. Moore Co., </em>310 Minn. 140, 245 N.W.2d 866 (Minn.1976), and properly interpreted Minnesota law. As to attorney fe\u00e9s and costs, we believe the amounts awarded Thorson are not excessive, especially in view of the success achieved by Thorson\u2019s attorneys. In short, we discern no abuse of the District Court\u2019s broad discretion in its determination of the quantum of attorney fees and costs to be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-17\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b469-19\">. The Honorable Richard H. Kyle, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
