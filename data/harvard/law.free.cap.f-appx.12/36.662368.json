Platt, <em>Judge), </em>it is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b64-26\">ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Plaintiff-appellant Lucille Kelly (\u201cKelly\u201d), pro <em>se, </em>appeals from a judgment of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Thomas C. Platt, <em>Judge), </em>denying Kelly\u2019s motion for summary judgment, granting defendant-appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment, and dismissing Kelly\u2019s complaint in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">On appeal, Kelly argues that the district court erred by concluding that she was not denied due process when the Board of Education\u2019s delegated hearing officer failed to provide her with a copy of his recommendation that she be terminated prior to the Board of Education\u2019s final decision to terminate her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. See Quinn v. Green Tree Credit Corp., </em>159 F.3d 759, 764 (2d Cir.1998). Even when viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Kelly and drawing ah reasonable influences in her favor, <em>see id. </em>at 764-65, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Kelly\u2019s due process claim because she had an adequate remedy under state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">There is no state law or regulation prohibiting a hearing officer from providing a party with a copy of the hearing officer\u2019s recommendation. Thus, the hearing officer\u2019s decision to withhold a copy of his recommendation from Kelly was a random and unauthorized act, as opposed to a decision based on a municipal policy. We have held that an Article 78 proceeding is an adequate post-deprivation remedy in cases in which the claim of due process is based on a random, unauthorized act of a state employee. <em>See Hellenic Am. Neighborhood Action Comm. v. City of New York, </em>101 F.3d 877, 880-81 (2d Cir.1996). Therefore, Kelly\u2019s procedural due process claim is viable only if the post-deprivation remedies available to her under state law were inadequate. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">Kelly brought an Article 78 proceeding in New York State court, which was dismissed because she did not provide the required notice to the defendants under N.Y. Education Law \u00a7 3813(1). \u201cArticle 78 of the New York Civil Practice Law ... provides both a hearing and a means of redress for petitioners,\u201d and \u201cconstitutional issues can be decided in Article 78 proceedings.\u201d <em>Hellenic Am. Neighborhood Action Comm., </em>101 F.3d at 881. The fact that Kelly failed to properly utilize the post-deprivation process available to her under state law does not alter the fact that Article 78 provided her an adequate post-deprivation remedy under the circumstances of this case. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
