Parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>are accorded sixty days after entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App.P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (I960)). As to the first two orders, entered August 23, 2000, and September 7, 2000, respectively, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because Walker\u2019s notice of appeal, filed December 9, 2000, was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Walker also challenges in his informal brief the court\u2019s orders entered December 20, 2000, and January 26, 2001, respectively. Although an informal brief may be construed as a notice of appeal, <em>see Smith v. Barry, </em>502 U.S. 244, 248, 112 S.Ct. 678, 116 L.Ed.2d 678 (1992), the brief was filed beyond the sixty-day appeal period as to the December 20, 2000, order and, therefore, is likewise untimely. Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1). Hence, as to the Walker\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s first three orders, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Walker, however, has noted a timely appeal of the court\u2019s January 26, 2001, order denying his second motion for reconsideration. As to that order, we have reviewed the district court\u2019s order and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See United States v. Walker, </em>No. CR-80-46; CA-00-2090-Y (D.Md. filed Jan. 26, 2001, entered Jan. 30, 2000). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
