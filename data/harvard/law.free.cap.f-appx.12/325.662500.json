Louis MONK, Jr., Defendant-Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"Afp\">No. 01-1165.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b353-13\">United States Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b353-15\">June 11, 2001.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Before KEITH, BATCHELDER, and MOORE, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b354-4\">The defendant, charged with bank fraud and interstate transportation of counterfeit securities, appeals the denial of his motion for pretrial release under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3164. This panel unanimously agrees that the facts and legal arguments are adequately presented in the briefs and record, and that the decisional process would not be significantly aided by oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 9(a); 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The Speedy Trial Act provides that the trial of a defendant detained pending trial \u201cshall commence not later than ninety days following the beginning of such continuous detention.\u201d 18 U.S.C. 3164(b). The statute provides that \u201c[n]o detainee ... shall be held in custody pending trial after the expiration of such ninety-day period required for the commencement of his trial.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3164(c). \u201cThe periods of delay enumerated in section 3161(h) are excluded in computing the time limitation specified in this section.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3164(b). The excludability of the delays set out in \u00a7 3161(h) is automatic. <em>Henderson v. United States, </em>476 U.S. 321, 327, 106 S.Ct. 1871, 90 L.Ed.2d 299 (1986); <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>887 F.2d 651, 656-58 (6th Cir.1989). The standard of review of the district court\u2019s denial of release based on an alleged violation of the Speedy Trial Act is de novo, although the district court\u2019s findings of facts are reviewed for clear error. <em>See United States v. Murphy, </em>241 F.3d 447, 453 (6th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 121 S.Ct. 2013, 149 L.Ed.2d 1014 (2001); <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>887 F.2d at 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">The defendant has not demonstrated that more than ninety non-excludable days have transpired between April 13\u2014 the date he consented to pretrial detention \u2014 and December 7, 2000. <em>See United States v. Murphy, supra. </em>Therefore, the district court\u2019s order denying release is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
