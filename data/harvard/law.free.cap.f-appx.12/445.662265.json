Priest claims that the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) made improper credibility assessments against him and that the ALJ asked an improper hypothetical question of the vocational expert. We affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-26\">Our review is limited to determining whether the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence. <em>John</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number><em>son v. Chater, </em>108 F.3d 178, 179 (8th Cir.1997). After reviewing the record as a whole, it is clear that the ALJ\u2019s decision to discredit Priest\u2019s subjective claims of pain and disability are supported by substantial evidence and that the hypothetical question put to the vocational expert was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">We pause only to clarify one aspect of the ALJ\u2019s decision. Citing <em>Ostronski v. Chater, </em>94 F.3d 413 (8th Cir.1996), the ALJ correctly noted that a claimant\u2019s apparent lack of motivation to work can be an appropriate basis to discredit his complaints. <em>Id. </em>at 419. However, in his decision the ALJ\u2019s only stated reason for concluding Priest had minimal motivation for work was the record of Priest\u2019s annual income. The ALJ noted, \u201chis annual earnings have never exceeded $17,000 per year and for most years they were under $10,000. He had zero earnings in 1991 and 1992. With such earnings the claimant would have minimal motivation to work.\u201d It is improper to infer lack of motivation to work based solely on a review of a claimant\u2019s earnings records. This is especially true where the range of salaries cited by the ALJ is above what a minimum wage earner working forty hours a week, fifty-two weeks a year would earn annually.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When examining subjective claims of pain or other symptoms, it is appropriate for the Commissioner \u2014 in the course of giving full consideration to all evidence relating to subjective complaints \u2014 to consider a claimant\u2019s inconsistent work history and/or apparent lack of motivation for work. <em>See Polaski v. Heckler, </em>739 F.2d 1320, 1322 (8th Cir.1984). However, there are too many variables affecting a claimant\u2019s annual income \u2014 such as hourly wages, availability of jobs in claimant\u2019s area, or family care and other competing obligations \u2014 to allow inferences about worker motivation (or an inconsistent work record) without additional information. The ALJ may have considered such factors in addition to the annual income amounts when determining claimant possessed minimal motivation to work and there may even have been additional evidence in the record to support such a conclusion, but the written opinion gives no indication that such was the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Even discounting this aspect of the ALJ\u2019s opinion, however, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Priest\u2019s subjective claims of disabling pain lacked credibility. Therefore, we affirm on the basis of the magistrate judge\u2019s extensive opinion. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b473-27\">. The Honorable Lewis M. Blanton, United States Magistrate Judge for the Eastern District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b474-5\">. A closer examination of the record reveals that Priest's annual income over the past nineteen years breaks down as follows: for nine years he earned above minimum wage full-time pay; for one year his income was equal to that amount; for five years his income was approximately two-thirds that amount; for two years, during which time he claims he was caring for his parents, he had no income; and for two years he had reported income of less than $2,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
