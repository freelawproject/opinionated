The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Roy Dale Banks, an inmate proceeding <em>pro se </em>and <em>in forma pauperis, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil rights complaint. In his complaint, Banks named as defendants various justices of the Kansas Supreme Court who had participated in handing down the following three decisions: <em>State v. Colbert, 244 </em>Kan. 422, 769 P.2d 1168 (Kan.1989); <em>State v. Davis, </em>227 Kan. 174, 605 P.2d 572 (Kan.1980); and <em>State v. Robertson, </em>225 Kan. 572, 592 P.2d 460 (1979). Banks alleged that these judicial decisions imposed an unconstitutional subjective standard for evaluating the dangerous-weapon element of aggravated robbery. He sought a declaratory judgment that this test violated clearly established constitutional rights and an injunction to prevent further usage of the subjective standard to the offense of aggravated robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">The district court dismissed Banks\u2019 complaint as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). To the extent that Banks\u2019 complaint stated a freestanding challenge to the decisions Usted above, none of which involved Banks, the district court noted that it lacked Article III jurisdiction to consider the complaint. On the other hand, to the extent that Banks was instead contending that the application of these decisions caused him to be unconstitutionally convicted of aggravated robbery, the district court noted that Banks\u2019 remedy lies in a petition for writ of habeas corpus filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. <em>See Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 489, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973) (holding that \u00a7 2254 habeas corpus petition is the exclusive remedy where a state prisoner challenges the fact or duration of his confinement).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">On appeal, Banks merely reasserts the same arguments he advanced in the district court. It is absolutely clear, however, that Banks lacks standing to lodge a generahzed challenge to the defendants\u2019 application of a subjective standard to the dangerous-weapon element of aggravated robbery. <em>See Schaffer v. Clinton, </em>240 F.3d 878, 882 (10th Cir.2001) (setting forth elements of standing). Banks does allege in his appellate brief that the \u201c \u2018subjective test\u2019 had a direct infringement to plaintiffs aggravated robbery conviction.\u201d This assertion of injury in fact merely serves to demonstrate the district court\u2019s conclusion that Banks\u2019 sole remedy Ues in a \u00a7 2254 habeas corpus petition. <em>See Preiser, </em>411 U.S. at 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">In light of the district court\u2019s clear explanation of the controlling law in its order of dismissal, this court concludes that Banks\u2019 appeal is frivolous. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). Both the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint and this court\u2019s dismissal of the appeal count as strikes under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Jennings v. Natrona County Det. Ctr., </em>175 F.3d 775, 780 (1999). Banks is hereby warned that if he accrues one more strike, he will be precluded from proceeding <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any further civil proceedings unless he is under \u201cimminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Banks is further notified that despite this court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal, he remains obligated to continue making partial payments until his appellate filing fee is paid in full. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1915(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">For those reasons set out above, this appeal is hereby DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b901-14\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir.R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
