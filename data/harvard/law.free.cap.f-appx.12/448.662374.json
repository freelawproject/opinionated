The Honorable Andrew W.

Under the terms of the agreement, Doolin pleaded guilty to one count of distributing cocaine, <em>see 21 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (1994), and he agreed to cooperate and provide truthful information to the government. In return, the government agreed to file, in its sole discretion, a substantial-assistance downward-departure motion under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5K1.1 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-19\">Doolin ultimately provided some helpful information to the government, but the government did not file the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. Doolin filed a motion with the District Court for a hearing to consider whether the government acted in bad faith when it failed to submit the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. The District Court denied Doolin\u2019s motion without a hearing and sentenced him to 151 months of imprisonment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>five years of supervised release. Doolin argues that the District Court erred in concluding that the government was not obligated to move for a downward departure based upon his substantial assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">\u201cThe district court generally lacks authority to award a substantial-assistance departure in the absence of a government motion.\u201d <em>United States v. Licona-Lopez, </em>163 F.3d 1040, 1042 (8th Cir.1998). \u201cThe court can, however, grant the departure in the absence of a motion if it finds that the refusal was irrational, in bad faith, or based on an unconstitutional motive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Doolin argues, as he did in the District Court, that the government acted in bad faith when it failed to submit the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. Doolin fails, however, to provide any evidence of bad faith. <em>See United States v. Johnston, </em>973 F.2d 611, 614-15 (8th Cir.1992) (holding that a bare allegation of bad faith is insufficient to require an inquiry into the government\u2019s decision not to file \u00a7 5K1.1 motion), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 1068, 113 S.Ct. 1019, 122 L.Ed.2d 165 (1993). Doolin\u2019s recitation of his cooperation with the government does not present the \u201crare \u2018egregious case\u2019 \u201d that justifies a downward departure without a government motion. <em>United States v. Davila, </em>964 F.2d 778, 786 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 964, 113 S.Ct. 438, 121 L.Ed.2d 358 (1992). Accordingly, this claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Doolin also argues that the government violated his due process rights when it failed to submit the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion on the premise that it would consider offering a substantial-assistance motion after sentencing under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b). The record shows, however, that the government believed that Doolin\u2019s assistance was not substantial enough at the time of sentencing to warrant a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, as it was permitted to do under the plea agreement. And contrary to Doolin\u2019s argument, the District Court did not postpone ruling on Doolin\u2019s motion or impermissibly conflate its disposition with a future 35(b) motion. It simply denied Doolin\u2019s motion. The mere fact that the government and the court left open the possibility that the government may file a 35(b) motion after sentencing if Doolin\u2019s information \u2014 considered in its entirety \u2014 later proved to be more helpful does not amount to anything close to a preliminary showing that the government had an unconstitutional motive in opting not to file the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
