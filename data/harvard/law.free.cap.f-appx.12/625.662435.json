Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), alleging deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The district court dismissed the action for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Bates challenges that decision, arguing that no exhaustion requirement applies to his suit. Exercising jurisdiction pursuant .to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Bates\u2019s jaw was injured in a fight with another inmate, and he was brought to defendant Gregory Day, a dentist, for treatment that included surgery and two follow-up appointments. Bates still suffers from pain and numbness in his jaw, which he claims are due to inadequacies in Day\u2019s treatment. Bates also claims he informed A1 Herrera, the warden of F.C.I. Florence (where Bates is incarcerated), of the problems with his jaw. Alleging that Day and Herrera failed to provide him with adequate medical treatment, Bates filed this action seeking compensatory damages, punitive damages, and a court order requiring prison officials to provide him with appropriate dental treatment. In his complaint, Bates acknowledged that he had not exhausted the available administrative remedies. Upon receiving the complaint, the district court issued an order for Bates to show cause why his lawsuit \u201cshould not be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.\u201d (R. Doc. 10 at 1.) After Bates filed a response to the show cause order, the district court noted that he sought both money damages and in-junctive relief and, citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a), dismissed his action without prejudice for failure to exhaust his remedies relating to his claim for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">Section 1997e(a) states that \u201c[n]o action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under ... any ... Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\u201d As the district court noted, federal prison regulations establish an administrative scheme through which \u201cinmates may seek formal review of an issue which relates to any aspect of their confinement.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 542.10. We have previously determined that the administrative remedies available in 28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 542.10-542.19 do not include monetary relief. <em>See Garrett v. Hawk, </em>127 F.3d 1263, 1266 (10th Cir.1997) (\u201cThe government concedes that if an inmate seeks purely monetary damages under the procedures provided for in 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 542.10, the institution staff will reject the claim as constituting improper subject matter for administrative review....\u201d). Because monetary relief is not available under the applicable administrative review scheme, \u201cno exhaustion of administrative remedies is required\u201d for Bates\u2019s claims for compensatory and punitive damages. <em>Id. </em>at 1267.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>Although recognizing <em>Garrett\u2019s </em>holding excused exhaustion as to Bates\u2019s claims for monetary damages, the district court dismissed Bates\u2019s suit because he also sought injunctive relief \u2014 for which administrative exhaustion pursuant to \u00a7 1997e(a) is required. In so holding, the district court failed to consider <em>Miller v. Menghini </em>213 F.3d 1244 (10th Cir.2000), in which a prisoner brought a civil rights complaint seeking both monetary and injunctive relief. In <em>Miller, </em>we held that under those circumstances a district court should not dismiss the entire action, but rather should dismiss only the portion of the suit seeking injunctive relief. <em>See id. </em>at 1246.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">In light of <em>Miller, </em>we REVERSE the district court\u2019s dismissal of Bates\u2019s claims for monetary relief and REMAND those claims for further proceedings. We AFFIRM the dismissal of Bates\u2019s claim for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b654-7\"> The case is unanimously ordered submitted without oral argument pursuant to Fed. R.App.P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir.R. 34.1(G). This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The Court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir.R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
