We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s order and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See High v. Drug Enforcement Agency, </em>No. CA-00-5H (E.D.N.C. May 30, 2000).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-18\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b124-16\"> Although the district court's judgment is marked as \"filed\u201d on May 25, 2000, the district court's records show that it was entered on the docket sheet on May 30, 2000. Pursuant to Rules 58 and 79(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, it is the date that the order was entered on the docket sheet that we take as the effective date of the district court's decision. <em>See Wilson v. Murray, </em>806 F.2d 1232, 1234-35 (4th Cir.1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
