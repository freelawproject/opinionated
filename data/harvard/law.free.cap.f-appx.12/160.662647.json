The district court granted the Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment, which was based on the doctrine of collateral estoppel. Because a genuine issue of material fact ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>ists regarding whether Appellants received notice and the opportunity to be heard in the toxic tort action, we vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Appellees began representing Appellants in March 1994 in a toxic tort action that Appellants filed in West Virginia state court against Ashland Oil, Incorporated (the \u201cState Court Action\u201d). <em>Holland v. Ashland Oil, Inc., </em>Civil Action No. 91-C-631. On November 11, 1994, Ashland Oil propounded Interrogatories and Requests for Production on each individual Plaintiff/Appellant in the State Court Action. Ashland Oil subsequently agreed to extend the Plaintiffs\u2019/Appellants\u2019 time to respond to the discovery until December 31, 1994, and later to January 5, 1995. Between November 11, 1994 and January 5, 1995, neither Plaintiffs/Appellants nor Appellees made much progress in responding to the discovery requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">On February 1, 1995, Ashland Oil filed a Motion to Compel against the Plaintiffs/Appellants and Appellees for failing to respond to discovery. Ashland Oil served the motion on Appellees. Appellants assert, and Appellees do not deny, that they personally did not receive copies of the motion. Nothing in the record suggests that Ashland Oil filed or served a Notice of Motion setting the Motion to Compel for hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">On February 3, 1995, Appellees filed a Motion and Notice of Motion to Withdraw. The Notice of Motion stated that the matter would be heard on February 9, 1995, and that it was served on each Plaintiff/Appellant. The Motion referred to \u201cirreconcilable differences between plaintiffs\u2019 counsel and the clients\u201d, but stated that it would not provide specifics for fear of violating the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">On February 4, 1995, Appellees responded to Ashland Oil\u2019s Motion to Compel on their own behalf, but not on Appellants\u2019 behalf. Appellees\u2019 response stated that Appellees were filing it \u201con [their] own behalf because [Ashland Oil\u2019s] motion requests that sanctions be assessed against counsel for plaintiffs in addition to plaintiffs themselves\u201d and because \u201c[o]n February 3, 1995, plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys filed a motion to withdraw as plaintiffs\u2019 counsel!.]\u201d Appellees\u2019 response further stated that \u201csome of the irreconcilable differences that have arisen between plaintiffs and their counsel relate to issues raised by defendant in its motion to compel[.]\u201d Ap-pellees also stated that they, \u201c[without success ... attempted to resolve those irreconcilable differences.\u201d The certificate of service accompanying the response stated that Appellees served the motion on Ashland Oil and all individual Plaintiffs/Appellants on February 4. Appellants, though, claim they never received a copy of Appellees\u2019 response to the Motion to Compel.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">At a February 9, 1995 hearing in the State Court Action, Appellees filed a Memorandum in Support of their Motion to Withdraw. This Memorandum related purported financial disagreements between the Plaintiffs/Appellants and Appellees, as well as difficulties Appellees purportedly experienced in receiving information from the Plaintiffs/Appellants sufficient to respond to Ashland Oil\u2019s discovery requests. Appellees\u2019 Memorandum stated that \u201c[s]ince October 1994, the plaintiffs have become increasingly less cooperative \u2014 to the point of exhibiting anger, hostility and total non-cooperation towards [Appellees] and requests for information.\u201d Appellees\u2019 Memorandum related several examples of the Plaintiffs\u2019/Appellants\u2019 purported failure to cooperate, as well as various incidents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>supporting Appellees\u2019 motion to withdraw.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">At the hearing in the State Court Action, the state court noted that several individual Plaintiffs/Appellants had submitted letters to the court opposing Appellees\u2019 motion to withdraw. The judge ordered Appellees to explain to the Plaintiffs/Appellants that their opposition to the motion to withdraw constituted a waiver of the attorney-client privilege. After a brief recess during which Appellees complied with the court\u2019s order to meet with the Plaintiffs/Appellants and explain the attorney-client privilege to them, Appellee Colapin-to reported to the court that \u201cI don\u2019t know that they fully understand\u201d that they were waiving the attorney-client privilege. Nonetheless, the court ruled that each Plaintiff/Appellant who made a written or oral objection to Appellees\u2019 Motion to Withdraw waived the attorney-client privilege. The court then heard testimony from PlaintiffyAppellant Sue Holland in response to the specific allegations made in Appellees\u2019 Memorandum in support of their Motion to Withdraw. At the start of Ms. Holland\u2019s testimony, Ashland Oil\u2019s counsel made the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-6\">Mr. Parnell: I only have one observation. ... The plaintiffs are currently in disobedience of the Court\u2019s discovery order. I can\u2019t tell who it is that has done what, but I can say to the extent that it turns out that a client, that is, a plaintiff, has wilfully failed to do things, I believe we have an interest in requesting that those parties, to the extent that they have not \u2014 either have Rule 11 sanctions or dismissal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">This statement by Ashland Oil\u2019s counsel was the first mention made at the hearing of Ashland Oil\u2019s motion to compel.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">In response to Mr. Parnell\u2019s statement, Appellee Colapinto stated that \u201cif I am adversarial to my own clients on that issue, I don\u2019t see how I can continue as counsel in this matter, and I would move to withdraw on that ground immediately.\u201d The court did not respond to Appellee Colapin-to\u2019s comment, but proceeded to question Ms. Holland.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">All of the questions asked Ms. Holland by the court related to Appellee Colapin-to\u2019s motion to withdraw. Appellee Cola-pinto declined the court\u2019s invitation to question Ms. Holland, citing a discomfort with cross-examining his own client. Mr. Parnell then cross-examined Ms. Holland for Ashland Oil on the issues raised by the motion to compel. Appellees did not object to any of Mr. Parnell\u2019s questions or participate in the questioning in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">The court then heard from Juanita Smith, another named plaintiff in the State Court Action. The court questioned her solely on issues relating to Appellee\u2019s motion to withdraw. Mr. Parnell then cross-examined Ms. Smith regarding the motion to compel. Again, Appellees did not object to any of Mr. Parnell\u2019s questions and did not otherwise .participate in the questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">After receiving Ms. Smith\u2019s testimony, the state court allowed Appellee Colapinto to make a statement in response to Ms. Holland and Ms. Smith\u2019s testimony. When Ms. Smith objected to the statement, the state court judge stated that \u201c[Appellee Colapinto] listened real patiently while you talked, ma'am. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to have to ask you to do the same, Ms. Smith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>The state court then asked Appellee Co-lapinto about Ashland Oil\u2019s Motion to Compel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-4\">Q: Is it your representation to the Court that the reason that the discovery deadlines that were agreed to and set by the Court were not complied with was, in its entirety, the responsibility of the plaintiffs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">A (Colapinto): Yes, Your Honor[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">The court did not ask the same or similar questions of Ms. Holland, Ms. Smith or any other Plaintiff/Appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">After receiving Appellant Colapinto\u2019s statement, the court allowed Ashland Oil to cross-examine Appellee Colapinto. The Plaintiffs/Appellants did not object to Ap-pellee Colapinto\u2019s testimony nor ask to question him. The record is silent as to whether the court would have allowed such objections or questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">At the end of Appellee Colapinto\u2019s testimony, the court ruled that Appellees were entitled to withdraw as counsel and dismissed the case with prejudice for the Plaintiffs\u2019/Appellants\u2019 failure to respond to discovery. On March 7, 1995, the court issued an order in accordance with its bench ruling, stating that \u201call of the Plaintiffs in this action have failed to cooperate with their counsel in compiling information that is responsive to these discovery requests and accordingly GRANTS Ashland Oil\u2019s Motion for Sanctions and ... will, therefore DISMISS WITH PREJUDICE this action[J\u201d The court further stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-9\">[t]he Plaintiffs in this action constitute the last of over 2200 Plaintiffs that were part of predecessor actions that have been pending in this court and others since as early as 1988. Since these cases have been pending before this court, approximately 700 claims have been settled and approximately 1500 claims have been dismissed on a variety of grounds, <em>inter </em>alia&gt; failure to comply with discovery deadlines. The court\u2019s position in this regard is well known to all of the counsel and all of the participants in this action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">The court concluded that \u201c[i]t is clear to this court that the failure to comply with the discovery requests ... rests with the individual Plaintiffs in this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-12\">Subsequently, Appellants filed this suit against Appellees for legal malpractice, alleging that Appellees\u2019 negligence caused the State Court Action\u2019s dismissal. Appel-lees moved for summary judgment on the basis of collateral estoppel, asserting that the state court determined that \u2014 Plaintiffs/Appellants \u2014 were the causes of the action\u2019s dismissal. On December 1, 1998, the district court denied Appellees\u2019 motion, explaining that a genuine issue of fact existed regarding whether Appellants had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue. Specifically, the district court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-13\">[wjhile the plaintiffs were present at the hearing and two of them did testify, it appears from the evidence submitted that their presence and testimony was related to the motion to withdraw. There is nothing in the evidence submitted to this court which shows that the plaintiffs were prepared to defend against a dismissal of their litigation for failure to provide discovery or that they had any opportunity to actually litigate the issue, apart from the statements of their attorneys, who were seeking to withdraw.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-14\">More than two years later, the district court reconsidered its decision. The court re-raised the collateral estoppel issue <em>sua sponte, </em>sought additional briefing, and held a January 28, 2000 hearing on the matter. The court ruled from the bench, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>[The state court] held a hearing on whether that lawyer would be permitted to withdraw or not. Those plaintiffs were present at that hearing and that lawyer asserted as one of the reasons why those plaintiffs \u2014 why he desired to withdraw was their refusal indeed to participate in the discovery process. The defendant had moved for dismissal or sanctions on that ground.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-5\">[The state court] held a hearing on that very issue and made findings of fact, one of which was that discovery had not been provided and it was the fault of the plaintiffs themselves and not their counsel, an affirmative fact that he found, and he sets forth that in his order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Based on this factual analysis, the district court held that collateral estoppel precluded Appellants from re-litigating the issue of the cause of the State Court Action\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">We review the district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling <em>de novo, </em>viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Goldstein v. The Chestnut Ridge Volunteer Fire Co., </em>218 F.3d 337, 340 (4th Cir.2000); <em>Binakonsky v. Ford Motor Co., </em>133 F.3d 281, 284-85 (4th Cir.1998). Summary judgment is appropriate if \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">In West Virginia, a plaintiff suing for legal malpractice must prove \u201c(1) the attorney\u2019s employment; (2) his neglect of a reasonable duty; and (3) that such negligence resulted in and was the proximate cause of loss to the client.\u201d <em>Keister v. Talbott, </em>182 W.Va. 745, 391 S.E.2d 895, 898 (W.Va.1990). Here, Appellants claim that Appellees\u2019 failure to respond to Ashland Oil\u2019s discovery resulted in the suit\u2019s dismissal. Appellees contend that the state court\u2019s decision that \u201cthe failure to comply with the discovery requests ... rests with the individual [Plaintiffs/Appellants]\u201d collaterally estops Appellants from prevailing in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-13\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738, federal courts must give a state court judgment the same preclusive effect as they would give the judgment under the law of the state in which the judgment was rendered. <em>Parsons Steel, Inc. v. First Alabama Bank, </em>474 U.S. 518, 106 S.Ct. 768, 88 L.Ed.2d 877 (1986). The doctrine of collateral estoppel forecloses the re-litigation \u201c \u2018of issues of fact or law that are identical to issues which have been actually determined and necessarily decided in prior litigation in which the party against whom [collateral estoppel] is asserted had a full and fair opportunity to litigate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sedlack v. Braswell Serv. Group, Inc., </em>134 F.3d 219, 224 (4th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>Ramsay v. INS, </em>14 F.3d 206, 210 (4th Cir.1994)). Under the doctrine, an issue that has been actually and necessarily determined \u201cis conclusive in subsequent suits based on a different cause of action involving a party to the prior litigation.\u201d <em>Montana v. United States, </em>440 U.S. 147, 153, 99 S.Ct. 970, 59 L.Ed.2d 210 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-14\">For collateral estoppel to apply under West Virginia law, its proponent must prove the existence of four elements: \u201c(1) the issue previously decided is identical to the one presented in the action in question; (2) there is a final adjudication on the merits of the prior action; (3) the party against whom the doctrine is invoked was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>a party or in privity with a party to a prior action; and (4) the party against whom the doctrine is raised had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the prior action.\u201d <em>Haba v. Big Arm Bar &amp; Grill, Inc., </em>196 W.Va. 129, 468 S.E.2d 915, 919 (W.Va.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Appellants\u2019 appeal implicates the second and fourth factors of the collateral estoppel inquiry. Appellants\u2019 first contention \u2014 that a dismissal for the failure to effect discovery does not constitute a final adjudication on the merits of the State Court Action \u2014 can be easily resolved, as Appellants confuse the issue that must have been adjudicated in the State Court Action. The State Court Action need not have been adjudicated on the merits, but the issue to which Appellees raise collateral estoppel must have been adjudicated on the merits. Here, that issue is whether Appellants or Appellees caused the dismissal of the State Court Action. The state court decided that issue on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Appellants\u2019 second contention is more troublesome. Appellants claim that they did not have \u201ca full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the previous forum.\u201d It is well settled that the full-and-fair-opportunity formulation generally requires that a litigant receive \u201creasonable notice of the claim against him <em>and </em>opportunity to be heard in opposition to that claim.\u201d <em>Hardy v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., </em>681 F.2d 334, 338 (5th Cir.1982) (quoting IB <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>110.411 at 1252 (2nd ed. 1982)) (emphasis added). The \u201cright to a full and fair opportunity to litigate an issue is, of course, protected by the due process clause of the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>Blonder-Tongue Labs., Inc. v. University of Illinois Foundation, </em>402 U.S. 313, 329, 91 S.Ct. 1434, 28 L.Ed.2d 788 (1971). <em>See also </em>47 Am.Jur.2d Judgments \u00a7 650 (1995) (the \u201cfull and fair\u201d formulation generally means \u201cthat a person cannot be bound by a judgment unless, he has had reasonable notice of the claim against him and opportunity to be heard in opposition to that claim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">A genuine issue of material fact exists regarding whether Appellants received notice of the Motion to Compel, which ultimately led to the dismissal of the State Court Action, and whether they received an opportunity to be heard in opposition to that motion. Regarding their lack of notice, Appellants contend that they did not receive a copy of Ashland Oil\u2019s Motion to Compel, did not receive a copy of Appellees\u2019 response to the Motion to Compel, and did not receive notice that the February 9, 1995 hearing would address the Motion to Compel. While Appellees claim they provided Appellants a copy of their response to the Motion to Compel, we must view the facts in the light most favorable to Appellants, who contend otherwise. <em>See Binakonsky, </em>133 F.3d at 284-85. Moreover, Appellees\u2019 notice of Ashland Oil\u2019s Motion to Compel cannot be imputed to Appellants under the facts of this case, see W.Va.R.Civ.P. 6 (when a party is represented by counsel, service of a motion on counsel constitutes service upon the party), where Appellees moved to withdraw and explicitly responded to the motion only on their own behalf. Thus, substantial evidence exists that Appellants knew nothing about Ashland Oil\u2019s Motion to Compel until its mention at the February 9,1995 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">Regarding Appellants\u2019 opportunity to be heard in opposition to the Motion to Compel, the undisputed evidence shows that Appellants lacked that opportunity. The state court questioned the Plaintiffs/Appellants only about Appellees\u2019 Motion to Withdraw, Plaintiffs/Appellants were not allowed to object to Appellee Colapinto\u2019s testimony, Plaintiffs/Appellants were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>offered the opportunity to question Appel-lee Colapinto, and the state court ruled on the Motion to Compel without seeking any argument on that motion from the Plaintiffs/Appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Moreover, Appellees admitted during the state court proceedings that they did not intend to represent Appellants on that motion. For example, Appellees\u2019 response to Ashland Oil\u2019s Motion to Compel stated that they were filing it \u201con [their] own behalf because defendant\u2019s motion requests that sanctions be assessed against counsel for plaintiff in addition to plaintiffs themselves.\u201d Moreover, Appellee Colapin-to stated at the February 9 hearing that \u201cif I am adversarial to my own clients on that issue [in other words, the motion to compel], I don\u2019t see how I can continue as counsel in this matter, and I would move to withdraw on that ground immediately.\u201d Thus, the undisputed evidence shows that Appellants lacked the opportunity to respond to the Motion to Compel.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is vacated and the suit remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b191-8\">. For example, Appellee alleged in the Memorandum that one plaintiff \u201cwas so angry [at Appellees] that she threatened to hire someone to kill her attorneys if, in her opinion, they got out of line.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
