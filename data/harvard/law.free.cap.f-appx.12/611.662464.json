We therefore lack jurisdiction to review that claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">By contrast, Amero\u2019s argument that he is entitled to qualified immunity because Lee failed to demonstrate a constitutional violation is a legal one properly subject to our review. We reject this argument because it conflates Lee\u2019s threshold burden with his ultimate burden. To survive a motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity, Lee does not have to demonstrate that Amero\u2019s putative reasons for firing him were pretextual. As <em>Huskey v. City of San Jose </em>makes clear, Lee merely needs to <em>\u201callege[ </em>] facts which, <em>if true, </em>would constitute a deprivation of a constitutional right,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that right must be clearly established.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Both criteria are met here. Lee stated a constitutional violation by alleging that he was \u201cfired by the defendant in December 1995 because of the defendant\u2019s racial animosity.\u201d The right not to be fired based on race has long been clearly established.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, Lee\u2019s factual assertion fulfills his threshold burden and enables him to survive summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-16\">We decline to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction over Amero\u2019s other claims. Lee is awarded his costs on appeal. Ap-pellee\u2019s request for sanctions is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-17\">AFFIRMED in part and DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b640-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b640-10\">. <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>City of Oakland, </em>145 F.3d 1087, 1091 (9th Cir.1998); <em>Collins v.
