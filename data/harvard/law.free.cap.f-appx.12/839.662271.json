The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">Plaintiff Stephen Simon appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing his claims brought pursuant to the civil enforcement provision of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We exercise jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-11\">Plaintiff sued on his own behalf and as the assignee of Humanistic Mental Health Foundation (Humanistic), which had provided medical services to an individual referred as \u201cJ.W.\u201d Plaintiff sought to recover money from defendants, who are an ERISA health insurance plan and its administrator, for the medical services provided to J.W. J.W. had assigned his claim for benefits to Humanistic, which in turn, had assigned the claim to plaintiff. The district court determined that plaintiff lacked standing to bring an ERISA action, and dismissed the case for failure to state a claim, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-14\">As a preliminary matter, we address defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss this appeal on the ground that plaintiffs appellate brief was filed late. Plaintiff served his brief within the t\u00fane allotted by this court\u2019s letter dated October 18, 2000. Under the circumstances, we will consider the merits, rather than dismiss because of \u201cminor technical defects.\u201d <em>See Denver &amp; Rio Grande W. R.R. v. Union Pac. R.R., </em>119 F.3d 847, 848 (10th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-15\">Turning to the merits, we review de novo an order dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim for relief under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, using the same standard applied by the district court. <em>See Ordinance 59 Ass\u2019n v. United States Dep\u2019t of Interior </em>Sec\u2019y, 163 F.3d 1150, 1152 (10th Cir.1998). \u201cWe accept as true all well-pleaded facts, as distinguished from conclusory allegations, and view those facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Maher v. Durango Metals, Inc., </em>144 F.3d 1302, 1304 (10th Cir.1998). Dismissal of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) will be upheld only if \u201cit appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Plaintiff asserts that he has standing to sue under ERISA\u2019s civil enforcement provision, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a). \u201c[T]he standing question ... is whether the ... statutory provision on which the claim rests properly can be understood as granting persons in the plaintiff\u2019s position a right to judicial relief.\u201d <em>Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 500, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975) (footnote omitted). Under \u00a7 1132(a), an action may be brought by a participant, a beneficiary, the Secretary of Labor, a fiduciary, or under limited circumstances, a State or employer. \u00a7 1132(a). Plaintiff claims he has standing as, or through, a beneficiary. ERISA defines a \u201cbeneficiary\u201d as \u201ca person designated by a participant ... who is or may become entitled to a benefit\u201d under an employee benefit plan. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00cd002(8). A \u201cparticipant\u201d is defined as \u201cany employee or former employee ... who is or may become eligible to receive a benefit of any type from an employee benefit plan....\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1002(7). Under the facts before us, J.W. is an ERISA \u201cparticipant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">Plaintiff does not qualify as a \u201cbeneficiary\u201d because he was not \u201cdesignated by a participant.\u201d Rather, he is the assignee of an assignee of a participant.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">\u201cERISA carefully enumerates the parties entitled to seek relief under [\u00a7 1132(a)].... \u201d <em>Franchise Tax Bd. v. Constr. Laborers Vacation Trust, </em>463 U.S. 1, 27, 103 S.Ct. 2841, 77 L.Ed.2d 420 (1983). The remedial provisions are part of a \u201ccomprehensive and reticulated statute.\u201d <em>Nachman Corp. v. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp., </em>446 U.S. 359, 361, 100 S.Ct. 1723, 64 L.Ed.2d 354 (1980). ERISA\u2019s enforcement provisions, \u201ccrafted with such evident care,\u201d indicate that Congress intended to limit the available remedies to those included in the statute. <em>Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, </em>473 U.S. 134, 145, 147, 105 S.Ct. 3085, 87 L.Ed.2d 96 (1985). Plaintiff has not established that Congress intended to grant an ERISA remedy to an assignee of an assignee of a plan participant. Accordingly, we decline to expand the remedial and enforcement provisions. Because plaintiff does not qualify as a party entitled to the ERISA civil enforcement provisions, he does not have standing to bring this action. Therefore, the district court\u2019s dismissal was correct. Other jurisdictions have also rejected on the same basis similar claims brought by plaintiff. <em>Simon v. Value Behavioral Health, Inc., </em>208 F.3d 1073, 1081 (9th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1104, 121 S.Ct. 843, 148 L.Ed.2d 723 (2001); <em>Simon v. Belwith Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>No. 00-1680, 2001 WL 111651, at *1 (6th Cir. Jan. 31, 2001) (unpublished); <em>Simon v. Quaker Oats Employee Benefit Plan, </em>No. 00-2342, 2000 WL 1657967, at *1 (7th Cir. Nov. 1, 2000) (unpublished), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 121 S.Ct. 2552, 150 L.Ed.2d 719 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-12\">Plaintiff complains that the district court did not grant him an opportunity to amend his complaint. The record reflects that he did not request such an opportunity. Therefore, no error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-13\">Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss and motion for sanctions are denied. Plaintiff\u2019s requests for oral argument and an initial en banc hearing are denied. The judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Colorado is AFFIRMED. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b868-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir.R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b868-16\">. Plaintiff refers in his appellate brief to state law, constitutional, and civil rights claims. Although his complaint mentions these claims, they are not supported by well-pleaded factual contentions and do not withstand dismissal. <em>See Hall v. Bellmon, </em>935 F.2d 1106, 1110 (10th Cir.1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
