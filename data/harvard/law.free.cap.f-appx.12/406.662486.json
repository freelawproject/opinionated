Although his complaints in the three lawsuits on appeal are incoherent, it seems Perry believes that his institute was unlawfully denied charter school status, and that the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction did not prevent or adequately sanction a private school that allegedly fired Perry based on his religious beliefs. In dismissing these actions prior to service, the district court first reasoned that Perry had \u201cfailed to articulate a valid statutory or constitutional basis\u201d for any of his claims. Next, the court concluded that the suits were frivolous because the complaints \u201ccontain allegations so bizarre, rambling, and disjointed as to defy interpretation.\u201d The court additionally barred Perry, pursuant to the dictates of <em>Support Systems Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Mack, </em>45 F.3d 185 (7th Cir.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>1995), from filing farther cases or pleadings in the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The court then determined that, despite the fact that Perry\u2019s lawsuits were frivolous, he deserved <em>informa pauperis </em>status on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">As a preliminary matter, we note that the district court should not have granted Perry <em>in forma pauperis </em>status after concluding that the lawsuits were frivolous. <em>Lee v. Clinton, </em>209 F.3d 1025, 1027 (7th Cir.2000). Nonetheless, Perry\u2019s arguments on appeal are no less incoherent than the allegations in his complaints. He offers no cogent argument, legal or otherwise, challenging the district court\u2019s dismissal of his suits or the court\u2019s order barring the filing of any future lawsuits pursuant to <em>Mack, </em>45 F.3d at 186. Yet even pro se litigants must put forward in an appellate brief some comprehensible legal argument regarding the district court\u2019s decisions. <em>Mathis v. New York Life Ins., </em>133 F.3d 546, 548 (7th Cir.1998). Because Perry has provided no arguable reason to reverse the dismissal of his frivolous complaints, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Affirmed</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
