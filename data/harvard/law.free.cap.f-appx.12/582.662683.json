We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(a), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-25\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition de novo. See <em>Dows v. Wood, </em>211 F.3d 480, 484 (9th Cir.2000). Sheppard bears the burden of showing that the state court adjudication of the merits of his claim \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 1523, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000); <em>Van Tran v. Lindsey, </em>212 F.3d 1143, 1153-54 (9th Cir.2000) (defining \u201cunreasonable application\u201d as involving situations where the state court has committed clear error).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>Sheppard contends that his right to due process was violated because he received an increased sentence based on a 1966 conviction for which no sentencing transcript exists. We disagree because clearly established federal law provides that a presumption of finality attaches to final judgments and accordingly, the mere unavailability of a transcript is insufficient to show that a defendant was denied constitutional rights. <em>Parke v. Raley, </em>506 U.S. 20, 29-30, 113 S.Ct. 517, 121 L.Ed.2d 391 (1992)(stating that <em>Boykin v. Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969) <em>does not prohibit a state court from presuming that a final judgment of conviction offered for purposes of sentence enhancement was validly obtained).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Moreover, because Sheppard\u2019s contention rests on the fact that the transcript of his plea hearing was destroyed five years after his 1966 conviction, bolstered by only his own declaration, he cannot, without more, show that his guilty plea was illegally obtained. <em>Id. </em>The district court, therefore, correctly concluded that the California court\u2019s decision, was not contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of federal law. <em>See Williams, </em>120 S.Ct. at 1523.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b610-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
