Rakoff, <em>Judge, </em>awarding defendants $38,935.76 in attorneys\u2019 fees and costs pursuant to 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 505 on account of Attia\u2019s misrepresentation, prior to judgment, that certain of his exhibits were copyrighted material when, in fact, they were not. On appeal, Attia contends principally that the district court erred in failing to find (a) that his misrepresentation was an irrelevant and technical mistake, and (b) that the misrepresentation did not cause defendants to expend any legal effort for which they should be reimbursed. We find no basis for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">In a copyright action, the district court\u2019s decision whether to award attorneys\u2019 fees may be overturned only for abuse of discretion, a highly deferential standard of review. <em>See, e.g., Matthew Bender &amp; Co. v. West Publishing Co., </em>240 F.3d 116, 121 (2d Cir.2001). An abuse of discretion may consist of an error of law or a clearly erroneous finding of fact. <em>See generally Cooter &amp; Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., </em>496 U.S. 384, 405, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">We see no error of law in the district court\u2019s decision to award costs and fees. Indeed, Attia\u2019s brief on appeal contains no citation of law on the subject of costs or attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-13\">Nor do we see any clear error in the court\u2019s factual findings. The district court found that \u201cit is beyond reasonable dispute that plaintiff misrepresented to this Court that certain exhibits submitted to the Court were plaintiff\u2019s copyrighted material when, in fact, they were not.\u201d Memorandum Order dated July 6, 2000, at 2. Following a hearing, the court found that, whether or not the misrepresentation was intentional, \u201cdefendants were required to expend substantial legal efforts in responding to plaintiffs inaccurate submissions that defendants would not otherwise have had to undertake,\u201d <em>id. </em>The district judge had presided over the earlier proceedings in this case, was familiar with the parties\u2019 contentions, and was in the best position to assess whether, and to what extent, Attia\u2019s representations that certain documents were copyrighted required any response by defendants. Attia\u2019s brief on appeal provides no basis for a conclusion that the court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-14\">Attia\u2019s contention that the award was designed simply to punish him for pursuing his rights is not supported by the record. The court denied defendants\u2019 motion for an award of more than $800,000, sought on the basis that Attia\u2019s entire action was frivolous. In determining the amount of fees and costs to be awarded, the court made findings as to the reasonable amounts of time spent in preparing papers on, and in preparing for and pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>senting oral argument with respect to, the misrepresented documents; as to the reasonableness of defendants\u2019 attorneys\u2019 billing rates; and as to the reasonable out-of-pocket expenditures occasioned by the misrepresentations. (Attia has made no challenge directed toward these particularized findings as to the components of the award.) Plainly the award was designed to compensate defendants for efforts and expenses that would have been unnecessary had it not been for Attia\u2019s misrepresentations, and such an award was well within the court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">To the extent that Attia argues that it is unfair to award attorneys\u2019 fees to defendants because they \u201cplagiari[zed]\u201d and \u201cmisappropriated his] design\u201d (Attia brief on appeal at 14), he seeks to revisit the merits of his copyright infringement action. Those arguments are foreclosed by the prior dismissal of his claims, which has been affirmed on appeal. To the extent that Attia makes additional arguments that were not made in the district court, those arguments are not properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">We have considered all of Attia\u2019s arguments that are properly before us and have found them to be without merit. We see no abuse of discretion in the award of attorneys\u2019 fees. The order of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Defendants are awarded normal costs of this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
