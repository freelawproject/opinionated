The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">Petitioner Joe Burr appeals the decision of the district court denying his petition for habeas corpus relief filed pursuant to 28 U .S.C. \u00a7 2254. The district court did not act on petitioner\u2019s application for a certificate of appealability (COA), so that application is deemed denied. <em>See </em>General Order of October 1, 1996. Petitioner\u2019s notice of appeal is treated as a renewed application for COA, Fed.R.App.P. 22(b)(2), and is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-9\">Petitioner was convicted in a state court jury trial of burglary of a vehicle, conspiracy to commit burglary, possession of burglary tools, and larceny under $250. In addition to the sentences stemming from the burglary, petitioner was also sentenced to three years\u2019 incarceration as a habitual offender. Petitioner\u2019s conviction was upheld on direct appeal, where the New Mexico Court of Appeals rejected a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. The petition for writ of certiorari to the New Mexico Supreme Court was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-11\">In a state post-conviction proceeding, petitioner again raised the sufficiency of the evidence claim and further argued that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel. Petitioner\u2019s state habeas corpus petition was also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-12\">Petitioner then sought habeas relief for these exhausted state claims in the federal district court. Petitioner\u2019s case was referred to a magistrate judge who concluded that the evidence clearly supported petitioner\u2019s conviction and that petitioner had failed to demonstrate that he had been prejudiced by the performance of his counsel. After de novo review, the district court adopted the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge and denied the petition. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-13\">Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), petitioner will not be entitled to habeas relief unless the state court\u2019s adjudication of the merits of his claims \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established\u201d Supreme Court precedent or \u201cresulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-14\">Under the \u201ccontrary to\u201d clause, a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by [the Supreme] Court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than [the Supreme] Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts. Under the \u201cunreasonable application\u201d clause, a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from [the Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>preme] Court\u2019s decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b875-5\"><em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 1523, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">Petitioner challenges the sufficiency of the evidence relied upon to convict him, characterizing the chief prosecution witness\u2019s testimony as self-serving, lacking in credibility, inconsistent, and inaccurate. As noted above, the New Mexico Court of Appeals rejected this claim on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">We have listened to the tape recordings of petitioner\u2019s trial and do not find the holding of the New Mexico court to be \u201can unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2). The prosecution\u2019s chief witness was present at the time of the burglary. He testified that, upon spotting some county road equipment parked for the night along a rural road, petitioner asked the third member of the group whether he needed a battery for his car. The witness testified that he later saw petitioner carry a large battery from a county road roller to the trank of the car the three were driving. The witness also tied petitioner to other items of stolen property.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">With regard to the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, petitioner argues mainly that counsel was deficient for failing to adequately investigate the background of the prosecution\u2019s main witness. Facts about the witness\u2019s alcoholism, however, and the fact that he had been drinking the night of the burglary were clearly brought before the jury. Petitioner quotes selectively from the defense\u2019s opening statement when he complains that counsel bolstered the main witness by telling the jury that the witness would be very believable. Counsel went on, however, to urge the jury not to believe the witness, because</p>\n<p id=\"b875-11\">the inconsistencies in his story \u201cwould not check out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b875-12\">Petitioner identifies other aspects of his counsel\u2019s performance which he argues combined to deprive him of a meaningful defense. We agree with the district court, however, that petitioner has failed to show \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-13\">The statute governing the issuance of a COA \u201cestablishes procedural rules and requires a threshold inquiry into whether the circuit court may entertain an appeal.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 482, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). No COA will be forthcoming unless \u201c \u2018the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 481, 120 S.Ct. 1595 (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2)). Because the district court rejected petitioner\u2019s claims on the merits, petitioner must now \u201cdemonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595. Petitioner has failed to make the required showing for a COA. We therefore deny petitioner\u2019s application for COA. This appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b874-10\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.
