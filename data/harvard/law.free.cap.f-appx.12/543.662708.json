INS, </em>134 F.3d 962, 966 (9th Cir.1998). To reverse the BIA\u2019s decision we must find that the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion, but compels it. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">We deny Gar aide\u2019s petition for review because the evidence does not compel the conclusion that Gar aide\u2019s alleged persecutors were or would be motivated by his real or imputed political opinions or by his membership in a particular social group. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Because the evidence does not compel a finding of eligibility for asylum, it necessarily does not compel a finding that Gar-alde has satisfied the more stringent standard for withholding of deportation. <em>See Singh, </em>134 F.3d at 971.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b572-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.

Garalde is the primary applicant for asylum; the claims of his wife and two children are derivative of his application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b572-12\">. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\"IIRIRA\u201d), Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (Sept. 30, 1996), replaced this section with a new judicial review provision codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Under IIRIRA\u2019s transitional rules, however, this new provision does not apply to proceedings initiated prior to April 1, 1997 that result in a final deportation order entered after October 30, 1996. We therefore continue to exercise jurisdiction over Garalde's action under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(1); <em>Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150-51 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
