Marbley, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Ohio, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b391-18\">On February 8, 2001, the defendant was found guilty by a jury of one count of wire fraud, seven counts of money laundering, one count of bank fraud, and one count of making false statements in connection with a bank loan. His sentencing is currently scheduled for June 29, 2001. The defendant appeals the February 21 order requiring that he be detained pending sentencing. The government argues that the court should affirm the ruling of the district court. The panel is in unanimous agreement that oral argument is not necessary because the facts and legal arguments are adequately presented in the material before the court. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 9(a) and 34(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b391-19\">Release or detention pending sentencing is governed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3143(a). The statute provides that pending the imposition of a sentence, a defendant shall be detained \u201cunless the judicial officer finds by clear and convincing evidence that the person is not likely to flee or pose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community if released\u201d on bond or on other conditions pursuant to \u00a7 3142(b) or (c). <em>See United States v. Vance, </em>851 F.2d 166, 168 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 893, 109 S.Ct. 231, 102 L.Ed.2d 220 (1988). The district court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed by this court for clear error. Legal conclusions and mixed questions of law and fact are reviewed de novo. <em>Id. </em>at 170; <em>see United States v. Hazime, </em>762 F.2d 34, 37 (6th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-20\">At the detention hearing, the trial judge found that the defendant was not truthful with either the court or Pretrial Services. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>The judge concluded that she \u201ccannot find by clear and convincing evidence that he is unlikely to flee given the fact that electronic monitoring cannot work.\u201d The defendant has not met his burden of demonstrating that this conclusion was in error. <em>See United States v. Welsand, </em>998 F.2d 1366, 1367 (8th Cir.1993) (affirming a detention order finding the defendant a risk of flight based on a violation of a prior condition of release); <em>United States v. Cas-tiello, </em>878 F.2d 554, 555-56 (1st Cir.1989) (affirming a detention order finding the defendant a risk of flight).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">The February 21 detention order is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
