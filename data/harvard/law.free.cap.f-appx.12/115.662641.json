We have reviewed the district court\u2019s order and find no reversible error. Although the district court erroneously analyzed Coward\u2019s motion under Fed.R.App.P. 4(a) (addressing the appeal periods in civil cases), its ultimate conclusion that it lacked the authority to extend the appeal period was correct. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 4(b)(1), (4) (allowing the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>court to extend the ten-day criminal appeal period by an additional thirty days). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order on other grounds. <em>See United States v. Coward, </em>No. CR-90-52-4-H (E.D.N.C. Dec. 14, 2000). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court, and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED ON OTHER GROUNDS.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
