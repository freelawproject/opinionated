The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Petitioner David E. Brovming, Jr., a state prisoner appearing pro se, seeks a certificate of appealability to appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition for writ of habeas corpus as untimely. We deny the request for a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Browning pled guilty to possession of a knife in a penal institution on March 23, 1994. He did not appeal his conviction. On February 22, 1999, he filed an application for post-conviction relief in state court, contending the conviction violated double jeopardy principles and the court abused its discretion by not following the rule announced in <em>State v. Campbell, </em>965 P.2d 991 (Okla.Ct.Crim.App.1998). His application was denied on March 23, 1999. On May 27, 1999, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the denial. The court found Browning\u2019s double jeopardy claim could have been raised on direct appeal. The court also found that <em>Campbell </em>was not to be applied retroactively (finding \u201c[a]s a general rule of law in Oklahoma, decisions of the highest court are prospective in application unless specifically declared to have retroactive effect\u201d). Record, Doc. 9, Exh. C.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">Browning filed his \u00a7 2254 petition on May 18, 2000. Respondent filed a motion to dismiss the petition as untimely under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d), and Browning filed a reply to the motion. On September 29, 2000, the magistrate court issued its report and recommendation. Browning filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s report. On October 26, 2000, the district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s report and dismissed the habeas petition as untimely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-11\">As Browning filed his habeas petition on May 18, 2000, the provisions of the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) apply. <em>See Lindh v. Murphy, </em>521 U.S. 320, 336, 117 S.Ct. 2059, 138 L.Ed.2d 481 (1997). Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1) and <em>Hoggro v. Boone, </em>150 F.3d 1223, 1225-26 (10th Cir.1998), Browning had until April 23, 1997, to file his habeas petition. He did not seek post-conviction relief in state court during the applicable limitation period and his application for post-conviction relief filed in February 1999 did not toll the running of the limitation period.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-12\">Browning\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability is DENIED. The appeal is DISMISSED. Browning\u2019s motion to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis is DENIED. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b709-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir.R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
