The district court granted summary judgment to the Fund and the Sheet Metal Workers Welfare and Benefits Board of Trustees (the \u201cBoard\u201d), finding that both the terms of ERISA and the Plan governing the Fund had been complied with. Barden appeals, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-15\">As a member of the Fund, Barden is entitled to receive the \u201creasonable and customary charges\u201d for medical services. The Board, as plan administrator, delegated responsibility for examining and paying claims to a third party, Edward B. Morris Associates, Inc. (\u201cMorris\u201d). Based on \u201cCPT codes,\u201d numeric codes used by providers to identify each type of medical service and procedure for which they are seeking payment, and data supplied to it by an outside company, Morris determines the \u201creasonable and customary charge\u201d payable on each claim submitted. No payment is made for any amount above the \u201creasonable and customary charge\u201d as determined by Morris. Dr. Robert Schu-man, a pediatric neurologist, submitted claims to the Fund for services rendered to Dakota between May 1998 and January 1999. Morris concluded that the claims exceeded the \u201creasonable and customary\u201d charges for the services, and so paid them only in part. Barden and Dr. Shuman asked Morris to reconsider, but after further review it refused to adjust the amount paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Pursuant to the terms of the Plan, Bar-den appealed Morris\u2019s decision to a Claims Review Committee, to which he both submitted written materials and made an oral presentation. The Review Committee ordered Morris to seek outside review of Barden\u2019s claims. An outside consultant determined that, although the CPT codes submitted by Dr. Shuman were correct for the services he performed, other CPT codes, allowing a greater maximum payment under the Plan, could have been used. The consultant suggested that the benefits paid for Dr. Shuman\u2019s services could justifiably be increased 20%, which the Review Committee approved. After the Review Committee denied Barden\u2019s suggestion to reconsider its decision (because Barden was not satisfied with the 20% increase), Barden filed suit in state court, seeking payment for Dr. Shuman\u2019s unreimbursed charges. The Defendants removed the case to federal court on the basis that it was a claim arising under \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">As an initial matter, the defendants ask that we ignore or strike a document entitled \u201cSupplemental Affidavit of Michael Barden\u201d that Barden attached to his opening brief. Because the affidavit is not part of the record in this case, we will simply ignore the information it contains. <em>See United States v. Levine, </em>5 F.3d 1100, 1109 n. 4 (7th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Barden first challenges the district court\u2019s finding that the defendants, through Morris, properly considered and partially denied Barden\u2019s claims for benefits. Barden argues that a higher \u201creasonable and customary\u201d charge should have been used for determining payment. When a benefit plan gives the administrator discretion in interpreting and applying the plan, as it did here, we review the administrator\u2019s decision using an arbitrary and capricious standard. <em>Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. v. Bruch, </em>489 U.S. 101, 115, 109 S.Ct. 948, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989); <em>Carr v. Gates Health Care Plan, </em>195 F.3d 292, 294 (7th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>529 U.S. 1068, 120 S.Ct. 1675, 146 L.Ed.2d 484 (2000). Under the arbitrary and capricious standard, we will overturn the administrator\u2019s decision only if it is \u201cdownright unreasonable.\u201d <em>Carr, </em>195 F.3d at 294 (quoting <em>Butler v. Encyclopedia Brittanica, Inc., </em>41 F.3d 285, 291 (7th Cir.1994)). A denial of benefits will not be set aside if it is based on a reasonable interpretation of the plan documents. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Under the Plan, only \u201cReasonable and Customary Charges\u201d for specified medical services are eligible for benefits. By basing its payment decisions on the \u201creasonable and customary charges\u201d as determined by CPT codes and outside data, Morris followed the plain language of the Plan. Morris\u2019s decision to partially deny benefits to Barden based on the CPT codes submitted by Dr. Shuman was not unreasonable, and the defendants did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in denying in part Barden\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Barden next asserts that the denial letters from Morris failed to comply with ERISA and its regulations. Pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1133, every employee plan must provide adequate notice to a participant whose claim for benefits was denied; such notice must be written in a manner calculated to be easily understood by the participant, and the plan must provide the participant with a reasonable opportunity for a full and fair review of the denial by the fiduciary of the plan. Although the denial letters sent to Barden and Dr. Shuman did not strictly comply with ERISA\u2019s mandates, they substantially complied, which is sufficient. <em>Donato v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., </em>19 F.3d 375, 382 (7th Cir.1994). The letters clearly explained why the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>claims had been partially denied: based on the definition of \u201creasonable and customary,\u201d Shuman had been paid the maximum amount allowed under the Plan. They thus supplied Barden with a \u201c \u2018statement of reasons that, under the circumstances of the case, permitted a sufficiently clear understanding of the administrator\u2019s position to permit effective review,\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Halpin v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., </em>962 F.2d 685, 690 (7th Cir.1992)), and were sufficient under ERISA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Lastly, Barden argues that the district court erred in finding that his appeal was handled properly by the Review Committee. Pursuant to 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.503-l(g), every plan governed by ERISA must establish an appeal procedure that allows the claimant to receive a \u201cfull and fair review\u201d of a denied claim by the plan\u2019s fiduciary or its designate. This appeal procedure must also allow the claimant to make a written request for review of the decision, examine pertinent documents, and submit issues and comments in writing. <em>Id. </em>As the district court found, Barden had a hearing before the Review Committee and was allowed to both present written materials and make an oral presentation. Further, after Bar-den\u2019s presentation, the Board ordered Morris to have an outside consultant review Barden\u2019s claims, and approved a 20% increase in benefits on those claims. The review procedure set up by the Fund gave Barden a full and fair review of his claims, and the district court properly granted summary judgment to the defendants on this issue. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b443-6\">. Barden also indicates that he wants this court to recommend that the Secretary of Labor fine the defendants for their alleged failure to follow the appropriate denial procedures. That is not within our powers, and at any rate a claimant is not entitled to any substantive remedy for a plan\u2019s procedural violation. <em>Wolfe v. J.C. Penney Co., </em>710 F.2d 388, 393 (7th Cir.1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
