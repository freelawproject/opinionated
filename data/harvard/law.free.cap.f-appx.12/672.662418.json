Mr. Gordon pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute cocaine base and criminal forfeiture and was sentenced to 180 months in accordance with the plea agreement and five years supervised release. The court also ordered forfeiture of several items. On direct appeal, Mr. Gordon challenged the district court\u2019s imposition of a two-level upward adjustment based upon his role in the offense pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). Because trial counsel did not object to the adjustment and it did not constitute plain error, we affirmed. <em>United States v. Gordon, </em>No. 97-7130, 1998 WL 704684, at * 2, 162 F.3d 1174 (10th Cir. Oct.2, 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-19\">In his \u00a7 2255 motion, Mr. Gordon contends that (1) the government breached the plea agreement by failing to file a substantial assistance motion pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) and Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b), (2) his plea was not intelligently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>entered into because it lacked a factual basis, and (3) defense counsel was ineffective for not objecting to the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) increase. The district court reached only the ineffective assistance claim, holding that the other claims were barred because they were not raised on direct appeal. R. Doc. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">The plea agreement provided that the government could file a substantial assistance motion within one year of sentencing. Aplt. Br. at 2. Hence, the claim is not barred because this claim could not be raised on direct appeal \u2014 the government had a year to act. On the merits, however, the claim fails. The plea agreement indicates that the filing of such a motion is discretionary, i.e. \u201cthe United States may, within one year after sentencing herein, move the Court to order relief. ... \u201d R. Doc. 7 at 7. Also, Mr. Gordon has not shown cooperation that would trigger the government\u2019s obligations. Having determined that the government did not breach the plea agreement in this regard, the relevant focus would be whether the government acted based upon an unconstitutional motive, something not claimed here. <em>United States v. Duncan, </em>242 F.3d 940 (10th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">At the change of plea hearing, Mr. Gordon admitted to \u201csmoking a little crack with the intention to sell some, keep my habit up, and that\u2019s when I made the purchase,\u201d R. Doc. 7 at 8 (quoting Tr. at 29), and that the money to obtain the items he forfeited came from crack sales and prostitution. <em>Id. </em>(quoting Tr. at 38). Mr. Gordon\u2019s admissions during the change of plea hearing are entitled to great weight, <em>see Blackledge v. Allison, </em>431 U.S. 63, 74, 97 S.Ct. 1621, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977), and a district court may rely on any part of those proceedings in determining that a factual basis exists under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(f), <em>United States v. Keiswetter, </em>860 F.2d 992, 995-96 (10th Cir.1988). Thus, Mr. Gordon\u2019s claim that his plea was not knowing and voluntary for want of a factual basis has no merit and we need not reach the issue of procedural bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">Finally, we agree with the district court that defense counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient in failing to raise an objection to the \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) role in the offense adjustment, as the plea agreement expressly stated that \u201c[t]he parties contemplate a role adjustment pursuant to 3B1.1(c) of 2 levels.\u201d R. Doc. 7 at 9 (quoting Doc. 47 at 3). Mr. Gordon has not shown that he would have insisted upon a trial had his counsel not acquiesced in the role in the offense adjustment. <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 57, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985). That is a doubtful proposition given the ten other drug-trafficking related counts that were dismissed pursuant to the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">We DENY leave to proceed in forma pauperis, DENY a certificate of appeala-bility and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b701-20\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir.R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
