Turner appeals pro se the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review a district court\u2019s denial of a habeas petition de novo, <em>see Du-haime v. Ducharme, </em>200 F.3d 597, 600 (9th Cir.1999), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-21\">Turner raised several issues in the district court challenging the constitutionality of California\u2019s Board of Prison Terms\u2019 (\u201cBPT\u201d) authority, and their decision to deny his parole eligibility. The district court denied the petition and granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the sole issue of Turner\u2019s alleged \u201cforced participation in Narcotics Anonymous program and the resulting violation of his due process rights by the BPT.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-22\">On appeal, Turner raises the same claims. However under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(3), his appeal is limited to issues for which a COA has been granted. Because this court has already denied Turner\u2019s request for a broader COA, we decline to address any claims outside of the scope of the district court\u2019s limited COA. <em>See Hiivala v. Wood, </em>195 F.3d 1098, 1102-OS (9th Cir.1999) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>529 U.S. 1009, 120 S.Ct. 1281, 146 L.Ed.2d 228 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>Turning to the one claim for which the COA has been granted, we agree with the district court that Turner\u2019s due process rights were not violated as the BPT\u2019s decision to deny parole based on the callous nature of the offense, Turner\u2019s unstable social history, drug abuse and escalating history of criminal conduct is sufficient to support the denial of parole. <em>See Morales v. California Dept. of Corrections, </em>16 F.3d 1001, 1005 (9th Cir.1994), <em>overruled on other grounds, </em>514 U.S. 499, 115 S.Ct. 1597, 131 L.Ed.2d 588 (1995) (affirming the denial of parole based on similar factors); <em>Jancsek v. Oregon Board of Parole, </em>833 F.2d 1389, 1390 (9th Cir.1987) (affirming denial of parole based on callous nature of the crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b596-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
