He was sentenced to a term of 70 months and 3 years supervised release. On appeal, he contends that the district court erred in not finding him a minimal or minor participant in the criminal activity, thereby entitling him to a four- or two-level downward adjustment. USSG \u00a7 3B1.2. Mr. Tonche contends that he was merely a drug courier and less culpable than his co-defendant. Our jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">After an evidentiary hearing, the district court denied a downward adjustment based upon a \u00a7 3B1.2 finding that Defendant was not a \u201cone-time\u201d courier, he was entrusted with a large amount of drugs of which he was aware, and he was driving the vehicle in which the drugs were hidden. Aplt.App.A. at 33. The district court further found \u201cthat defendant was a courier who knowingly played a significant and recurring role in the transportation of large quantities of drugs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34. We have reviewed the materials submitted on appeal. Although the scope of Defendant\u2019s involvement was controverted, the district court\u2019s view of the evidence is plausible and not clearly erroneous; accordingly, the district court\u2019s decision is a permissible outcome. <em>United States v. Heckard, </em>238 F.3d 1222, 1233-34 (10th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b703-8\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir.R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
