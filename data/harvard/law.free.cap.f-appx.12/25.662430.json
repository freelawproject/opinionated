In connection with the risk of flight, the court noted the defendant\u2019s \u201cpoor record of responding to directions by courts or the Division of Parole,\u201d [10/12/2000 Hearing, at 41, 38-39, 40], his use of drugs, his lack of employment history, the inability of pretrial services to contact his family, and the defendant\u2019s strong motive to flee given the heavy potential sentence he faces. [39, 41.]</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">We affirm. Section 3142(f)(2) directs that a detention hearing be held if the case involves \u201ca serious risk that [the defendant] will flee.\u201d Subparagraph (e) authorizes a detention order where \u201cno condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.\u201d These requirements were clearly satisfied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
