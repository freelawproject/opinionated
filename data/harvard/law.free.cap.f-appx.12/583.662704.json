Burford, </em>918 F.2d 854, 855 (9th Cir.1990), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-17\">Whether the government has waived sovereign immunity is a question of law reviewed de novo. <em>Arford v. United States, </em>934 F.2d 229, 231 (9th Cir.1991). We review the denial of reconsideration for an abuse of discretion. <em>School Dist. No. 1J, Multnomah County v. ACandS, Inc., </em>5 F.3d 1255, 1262 (9th Cir.1993). The district court properly considered only the original complaint because the Tekles did not obtain leave of court before attempting to amend their complaint by filing the document captioned as both a \u201cSupplemental Complaint\u201d and opposition to defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 15(a). Because the original complaint did not set forth any statutory basis for suit or show that the defendant waived sovereign immunity, the district court properly dismissed the complaint. <em>See Hutchinson v. United States, </em>677 F.2d 1322, 1327 (9th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-18\">Because the Tekles did not show clear error or present newly discovered evidence, the district court did not abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>its discretion by denying their motion for reconsideration. <em>See School Dist. No. 1J, </em>5 F.3d at 1262-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">We have not considered the arguments or factual allegations of both parties raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Smith v. Marsh, </em>194 F.3d 1045, 1052 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">We reject the TeMes\u2019 remaining contentions for lack of merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b612-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b612-19\">.
