Gibson\u2019s complaint asserted a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 alleging that defendants-appellees violated his Eighth Amendment rights by failing to take reasonable measures to guarantee his safety and to protect him from serious harm by other inmates, as well as state law claims of assault, battery, negligence, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. In a Memorandum and Order dated August 16, 2000, the district court dismissed Gibson\u2019s \u00a7 1983 and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims. The district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Gibson\u2019s other state law claims and therefore dismissed them without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-13\">On appeal, Gibson challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of both his \u00a7 1983 claim and his claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. We have reviewed Gibson\u2019s contentions and find them to be without merit. For a prison official to be liable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for the injuries a prisoner suffers at the hands of another prisoner, the plaintiff must show (1) \u201cthat he is incarcerated under conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm,\u201d <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994), and (2) that the prison official was \u201cdeliberate[ly] indifferen[t]\u201d to the plaintiffs health or safety, <em>Hayes v. New York City Dep\u2019t of Corr. ., </em>84 F.3d 614, 620 (2d Cir.1996). The district court correctly dismissed Gibson\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim because his complaint fails to allege facts from which one could reasonably conclude that defendants-appellees were ever deliberately indifferent to a substantial risk of serious injury to him. The district court was also justified in dismissing Gibson\u2019s intentional infliction of emotional distress claim. Gibson\u2019s complaint simply fails to allege conduct that rises to the level of outrageousness required to state a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress under New York law. <em>See Murphy v. Am. Home Prods. Corp., </em>58 N.Y.2d 293, 303, 461 N.Y.S.2d 232, 448 N.E.2d 86 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-14\">ON CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the judgment of the District Court be and it hereby is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
