Talley argues that he was arrested without probable cause and that evidence found as a result of the arrest should have been suppressed. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-20\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress and application of the law de novo. <em>United States v. Mattarolo, </em>209 F.3d 1153, 1155-56 (9th Cir.2000). We accept the district court\u2019s factual findings unless clearly erroneous. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-21\">\u201cProbable cause exists when police officers have reasonably trustworthy information sufficient to warrant a prudent person in believing that the accused had committed or was committing an offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Harvey, </em>3 F.3d 1294, 1296 (9th Cir.1993) (quotation marks and citation omitted). We review \u201cthe totality of the circumstances known to the officers prior to any search conducted incident to the arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cNeither certainty, nor proof beyond a reasonable doubt, is required for probable cause to arrest.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-22\">Oakland Police Sergeant Williams stopped Talley upon noticing that his unique hairstyle, distinctive jacket, and physical features matched those of a bank robbery suspect as depicted in a witness drawing, witness statements, and viewed in bank surveillance tapes. At the motion to suppress hearing, the district court noted that the witness drawing clearly showed the robber\u2019s unique hairstyle, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>videos clearly showed the robber\u2019s distinctive jacket, hairstyle, and general appearance. The district court did not clearly err in finding that given Williams\u2019 personal knowledge of the robber\u2019s specific and general characteristics, a reasonably prudent person could have believed that Talley was the bank robbery suspect, and therefore Williams had probable cause to arrest Talley.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b541-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
