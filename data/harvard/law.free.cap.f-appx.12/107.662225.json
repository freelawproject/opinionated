The time periods for filing notices of appeal are governed by Fed.R.App.P. 4. These periods are \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (I960)). In a criminal case, a defendant\u2019s notice of appeal must be filed within ten days of the entry of the order appealed. Fed.R.App.P. 4(b)(l)(A)(i). The only exception is when the district court extends the appeal period pursuant to Fed.R.App.P. 4(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-21\">The district court entered its order on September 7, 2000; Gholson\u2019s notice of appeal was signed and dated on September 28, 2000, which is beyond the ten-day appeal period. Gholson\u2019s failure to note a timely appeal or to obtain an extension of the appeal period leaved this court without jurisdiction to consider the merits of Ghol-son\u2019s appeal. We therefore dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b135-22\"> If construed as motion under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2000), Gholson\u2019s motion would be successive and would require authorization pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2244 (West Supp.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
