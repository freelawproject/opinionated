On December 20, 1999, he was sentenced to forty-one months of imprisonment and two years of supervised release. Gauthier\u2019s appeal has been referred to a panel of this court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, the panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed in this case. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">The attorney who represented Gauthier in district court has filed a motion to withdraw, with a brief indicating that there are no issues to appeal. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Counsel suggests that Gauthier may wish to argue that his conviction was improper because his civil rights had been restored. Gauthier has filed a brief that amplifies this argument. He has also filed motions for the appointment of new counsel, for appeal bond, and for an expedited appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">Gauthier did not raise any claim regarding the restoration of his rights in the district court. Thus, he has forfeited this claim in the absence of plain error. <em>See United States v. Barajas-Nunez, </em>91 F.3d 826, 830 (6th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-12\">A prior felony conviction under \u00a7 922(g) does not include a conviction for which the defendant\u2019s civil rights have been restored, unless the restoration expressly provides that he may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20). The civil rights of a Michigan felon to serve on a jury, to vote and to hold public office may be fully restored. <em>See Hampton v. United States, </em>191 F.3d 695, 699-702 (6th Cir.1999). Nevertheless, Gauthier\u2019s argument fails because he did not show that his right to possess a firearm had been restored under state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-13\">The right of a Michigan felon to possess a firearm may be restored several years after he has completed service of his sentence. Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 750.224\u00cd. However, Gauthier\u2019s prior conviction was a specified felony within the meaning of \u00a7 750.224f(2)(b). Thus, state law required him to obtain permission from the concealed weapons licensing board before he possessed a firearm. <em>See </em>Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 28.424. It is undisputed that Gau-thier did not satisfy this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-14\">Citing <em>United States v. Williams, </em>122 F.Supp.2d 782, 784 (E.D.Mich.2000), Gauthier now argues that the failure to apply for a firearms permit under \u00a7 28.424 was not relevant, as his other civil rights had been restored. This argument lacks merit because \u00a7 750.224f(2)(b) specifically references \u00a7 28.424. Moreover, the filing of a \u00a7 28.424 application is not a mere formality, even if the statute\u2019s other requirements are met. Instead, the board evaluates the applicant\u2019s record and reputation to determine whether he is likely to act in a dangerous manner. Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 28.424(c). Indeed, an applicant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>who has been convicted of a specified felony will be criminally liable under state law, if he possesses a firearm before his rights are restored under \u00a7 28.424. <em>People v. Tucker, </em>620 N.W.2d 305 (Mich.2000) (table). Therefore, Gauthier\u2019s \u00a7 922(g) conviction was not plainly erroneous, as his right to possess a firearm had not been restored under state law. <em>See United States v. Carnes, </em>113 F.Supp.2d 1145, 1160-61 (E.D.Mich.2000); <em>United States v. Green, </em>109 F.Supp.2d 688, 689-91 (E.D.Mich.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">An independent review of the proceedings reveals no other issues for appeal. <em>See Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744. The rear-raignment transcript shows that Gauthier\u2019s guilty plea was valid and that the district court substantially complied with the requirements of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11. Gauthier acknowledged a factual basis for his plea, and indicated that the decision to plead guilty was voluntary. He was represented by counsel, and he has not attempted to withdraw his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Gauthier did not raise any legal arguments at sentencing. Thus, he has forfeited any sentencing claims that he might have in the absence of plain error. <em>See Barajas-Nunez, </em>91 F.3d at 830. No error is apparent, as Gauthier signed a plea agreement in which he expressly waived any claims that he might have regarding the calculation of the applicable guideline range. <em>See United States v. Allison, </em>59 F.3d 43, 46 (6th Cir.1995). His sentence was authorized by statute, and it fell at the very bottom of that range.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is granted, all other pending motions are denied, and the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
