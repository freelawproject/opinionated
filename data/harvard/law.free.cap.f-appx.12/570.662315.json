We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo dismissals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2). <em>Barren v. Harrington, </em>152 F.3d 1193, 1194 (9th Cir.1998) (order), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 1154, 119 S.Ct. 1058, 143 L.Ed.2d 63 (1999). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-23\">Because Smith did not allege that an official knew of and disregarded a serious medical condition, the district court did not err by dismissing his claim for deliberate indifference to a serious medical need. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-24\">Because Smith failed to allege an actual injury, the district court did not err by dismissing his claim of denial of access to the courts against defendant Frost. <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 349, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-25\">Because Smith did not allege that defendant Gleason\u2019s imposition of disciplinary proceedings against him imposed atypical and significant hardships on him in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life, the district court did not err by dismissing his claim against Gleason. <em>See Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-26\">Because Smith has no constitutionally protected right to vocational training, the district court did not err by dismissing his claim against defendants Wooten and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>Kerwin. <em>See Hoptowit v. Ray, </em>682 F.2d 1237, 1254-55 (9th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Because Smith fails to show a causal connection between Day\u2019s conduct in calling Smith a \u201csnitch\u201d and any alleged constitutional violation, the district court did not err by dismissing his remaining claim against defendant Day. <em>See Leer v. Murphy, </em>844 F.2d 628, 633 (9th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Because Smith\u2019s claim regarding the re-cission of good time credits necessarily implies the invalidity of the recission, the district court did not err by denying his motion for emergency injunctive relief regarding the recission of his good time credits. <em>See Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 648, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Because Smith fails to allege specific factual allegations to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, the district court did not err by dismissing his claims against defendants Stanley, Wood, and Lambert. <em>See Ivey v. Board of Regents, </em>673 F.2d 266, 268 (9th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Because Smith has no constitutionally protected right to be housed in the institution of his choice, the district court did not err by dismissing his claims against all other defendants. <em>See Olim v. Wakinekona, </em>461 U.S. 238, 249, 103 S.Ct. 1741, 75 L.Ed.2d 813 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">The dismissal of Smith\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim against defendant Day regarding the sanitary conditions of his cell is affirmed for the reasons stated in the magistrate judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation filed on December 10, 1999, and adopted by the district court in its order filed on February 14, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">Because the complaint was dismissed without prejudice, Smith may be able to refile his complaint, correcting the deficiencies within the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-13\">Smith\u2019s March 26, 2001 \u201cMotion to include memorandum in support\u201d is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b599-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
