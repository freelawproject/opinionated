White argues that: he was denied an opportunity to fully litigate a Fourth Amendment claim; the state court unconstitutionally limited his ability to cross-examine a prosecution witness; and the exclusion of certain evidence unconstitutionally restricted his right to present a defense. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-22\">We first consider whether White was denied the opportunity to litigate his Fourth Amendment claim. A federal habeas court may review Fourth Amendment claims only if the state court proceeding denied the applicant an \u201copportunity for full and fair litigation of a Fourth Amend-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>merit claim.\u201d <em>Stone v. Powell, </em>428 U.S. 465, 482, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976). Because White\u2019s Fourth Amendment claims were heard and considered by the state courts, he was afforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate those claims. <em>See Ortiz-Sandoval v. Gomez, </em>81 F.3d 891, 899 (9th Cir.1996); <em>Locks v. Sumner, </em>703 F.2d 403, 408 (9th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">We next address whether White\u2019s Sixth Amendment confrontation rights were violated when the trial court limited the scope of his cross-examination of the prosecution\u2019s investigator. The trial court excluded the evidence because it determined that the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by the danger that its admission would create undue prejudice (to either or both parties) or that its admission would confuse the jury. White\u2019s rights were not violated by the limitation of cross-examination; such a limitation was consistent with <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986), and was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of clearly established Supreme Court law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Finally, we consider whether the exclusion of prior-conduct evidence with respect to his companion violated White\u2019s due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. A federal court reviewing a state conviction on application for a writ of habeas corpus may not \u201c \u2018engage in a finely tuned review of the wisdom of state evidentiary rules.\u2019 \u201d <em>Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 72, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991) (quoting <em>Marshall v. Lonberger, </em>459 U.S. 422, 103 S.Ct. 843, 74 L.Ed.2d 646 (1983)). The appropriate inquiry is whether the evidentiary ruling, right or wrong, so \u201cinfected the trial that the resulting conviction violates due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>White\u2019s claim fails because the state court\u2019s balancing of the factors was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of federal law as established by the Supreme Court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b553-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
