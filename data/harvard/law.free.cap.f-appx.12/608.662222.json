The IJ presumed this interest in Bhupindr to be legitimate. This presumption was incorrect as a matter of law. As <em>Singh v. </em>Ilchert<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> teaches, where \u201cthere is no evidence of a legitimate prosecutorial purpose for a government\u2019s harassment of a person there arises a presumption that the motive for harassment is political.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The BIA rested its decision on this infirm legal basis and also upon its conclusion that Kaur\u2019s encounters with police did not rise to the level of persecution. The evidence compels the contrary conclusion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Indian police terrorized the petitioner and her family by coming to her home, often in the wee hours of the morning, on seven occasions during a four-month period leading up to her departure. Each time, police shoved her and her family members, yelled at her, asked her why she was \u201craising her voice for Khalistan\u201d and accused her of being a terrorist. Police threatened Kaur with sexual assault if she did not reveal Bhupindr\u2019s whereabouts. On the seventh occasion, about forty police came to Kaur\u2019s home and made Kaur, her three minor children and another brother-in-law, Jasmail, accompany them to the police station. There, Kaur and her children were separated from Jasmail, whom they could hear being tortured in another room. While dunning Kaur with questions about her religion, her political beliefs and Bhu-pindr\u2019s location, the police hit Kaur\u2019s children and then threw Kaur herself against a wall when she averred her support for a separate Sikh state. Kaur and her children were released the next day, but only upon payment of a bribe. Contrary to the BIA, we think this evidence compels the conclusion that \u201cthe mistreatment [Kaur] suffered ... was substantially more grievous in kind or degree than the general manifestation of hostility between ... competing ethnic and religious groups.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, we GRANT Kaur\u2019s petition for review and REMAND this case to the BIA with instructions to grant her application for withholding of deportation and to present this matter to the Attorney General for the exercise of his discretion under Section 1158(b) in a manner consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b636-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b637-7\">. <em>Kataria v.
