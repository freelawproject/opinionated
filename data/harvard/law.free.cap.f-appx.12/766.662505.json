MILLER, Plaintiff-Appellant, v. V.A. MEDICAL CENTER, Defendant-Appellee.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"A7q\">No. 00-7112.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b794-15\">United States Court of Appeals, Tenth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b794-16\">April 26, 2001.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b795-14\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>Before SEYMOUR, BRORBY, and BRISCOE, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b795-15\">ORDER AND JUDGMENT <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<author id=\"AuB\">BRISCOE, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b795-16\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir.R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-17\">Plaintiff seeks review of the district court\u2019s dismissal of his action for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm. We review the district court\u2019s grant of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion de novo. <em>Sutton v. Utah State Sch. for Deaf &amp; Blind, </em>173 F.3d 1226, 1236 (10th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-18\">Plaintiff initiated this matter by filing a one-page pleading entitled \u201cStatement of Complaint,\u201d in which he claimed unspecified damages because of exposure to asbestos while he was employed at a Veteran\u2019s Administration (VA) hospital. The government moved to dismiss the case, arguing that plaintiffs remedies, if any, lay not under the Federal Torts Claims Act (FTCA), but under the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act (FECA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8101-8152.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>The FECA was designed to protect the government from suit under statutes such as the FTCA by providing a compensation mechanism for federal employees (much like workers\u2019 compensation) \u201cregardless of fault and without need for litigation, but in turn they lose the right to sue the Government.\u201d <em>Lockheed Aircraft Corp. v. United States, </em>460 U.S. 190, 193-94, 103 S.Ct. 1033, 74 L.Ed.2d 911 (1983). Moreover, \u201cif the employee was injured in the performance of duty, the Secretary [of LaborJ\u2019s decision regarding coverage will be binding on the court, regardless of whether compensation is actually awarded.\u201d <em>Swafford v. United States, </em>998 F.2d 837, 841 (10th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">Specifically, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8116 provides, in part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-5\">(c) The liability of the United States or an instrumentality thereof under this subchapter or- any extension thereof with respect to the injury or death of an employee is exclusive and instead of all other liability of the United States or the instrumentality to the employee, his legal representative, spouse, dependents, next of kin, and any other person otherwise entitled to recover damages from the United States or the instrumentality because of the injury or death in a direct judicial proceeding ... under a Federal tort liability statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">In sum, \u201cthe courts have no jurisdiction over FTCA claims where the Secretary [of Labor] determines that FECA applies.\u201d <em>Southwest Marine, Inc. v. Gizoni, </em>502 U.S. 81, 90, 112 S.Ct. 486, 116 L.Ed.2d 405 (1991). This is because administrative decisions under the FECA are \u201cfinal and conclusive for all purposes\u201d and \u201cnot subject to review by another official of the United States or by a court....\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8128(b). <em>See Farley v. United States, </em>162 F.3d 613, 615 (10th Cir.1998); <em>Swafford, </em>998 F.2d at 839-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">The record in this case reflects that plaintiff sought relief under the provisions of the FECA and that his claim was denied for failure to supply rationalized medical opinion evidence establishing a causal relationship between the diagnosed condition and the employment factors identified by the plaintiff. This court cannot review the Secretary\u2019s decision to deny compensation under the FECA. <em>See Tarver v. United States, </em>25 F.3d 900, 903 n. 3 (10th Cir.1994). The FECA is an injured employee\u2019s exclusive remedy. <em>See Cobia v. United States, </em>384 F.2d 711, 712 (10th Cir.1967). Plaintiffs argument that he can pursue a cause of action under the FTCA because he is \u201cdissatisfied with the action taken on [his FECA] claim,\u201d R. Doc. 10, is legally incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">The order of the district court dismissing this action for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted is AFFIRMED. Defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition is denied as moot. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b795-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir.R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
