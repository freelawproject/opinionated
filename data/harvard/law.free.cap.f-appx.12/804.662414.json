Doc. 2. We grant the application to proceed in forma pauperis, but in light of Mr. Handy\u2019s failure to make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d we deny his application for a COA and dismiss the appeal. <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 482, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-23\">Because Mr. Handy filed the instant petition on December 22,1999, subsequent to the effective date of the Antiterrorism and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, the limitations period set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1) applies to this action. Doc. 1. Mr. Handy entered a guilty plea on November 27, 1989, and his motion to withdraw the plea was denied on January 23, 1991. For prisoners, like Mr. Handy, whose convictions became final before April 24,1996, the one-year statute of limitations begins to run on that date and ends on April 23, 1997. <em>Hoggro v. Boone, </em>150 F.3d 1223, 1225 (10th Cir.1998). We toll the one-year limitation period only for the time Mr. Handy had a \u201cproperly filed application\u201d pending for state post-conviction relief. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2); <em>Hoggro, </em>150 F.3d at 1226.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">By April 24, 1996, Mr. Handy had filed, and the Wyoming state courts had denied, two petitions for post-conviction relief. The first petition was denied on June 8, 1993; the second on February 13, 1995. Under Wyoming law, a final order entered upon an application for post-conviction relief \u201cmay be reviewed by the supreme court [of Wyoming] on writ of certiorari ... pursuant to the Wyoming Rules of Appellate Procedure.\u201d Wyo.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 7-14-107 (Michie 1995). \u201cA petition for a writ of review <em>must be filed with the reviewing court </em>within 11 days after entry of the order from which relief is sought.\u201d Wyo.R.App.P. 13.03(a) (1995) (emphasis added). \u201cOn March 9,1995, Mr. Handy filed for a Petition for Writ of Review <em>in the trial court,\u201d </em>but the court never acted on that petition. Pet\u2019r Br. at 5 (emphasis added). Even if we overlook the possibility that Mr. Handy\u2019s petition was untimely, <em>cf. Kittles v. Rocky Mountain Recovery, Inc., </em>1 P.3d 1220, 1222-23 (Wyo.2000) (holding that compliance with Rule 13.03(a)\u2019s eleven-day deadline is not jurisdictional), we cannot ignore the fact that it was filed in the wrong court. Accordingly, the petition was not \u201cproperly filed\u201d and therefore cannot operate to toll the limitations period. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1); <em>see also Barnett v. Lemaster, </em>167 F.3d 1321, 1323 (10th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">Even if the petition had been \u201cproperly filed,\u201d Mr. Handy\u2019s tolling argument would fail nonetheless because the petition was not \u201cpending\u201d at any point during the relevant one-year period. The Wyoming Rules of Appellate Procedure provide that a certiorari petition \u201cshall be deemed denied if the reviewing court does not accept review within 30 days from the date of the petition.\u201d Wyo.R.App.P. 13.03(c). Thus, even if we assume that Mr. Handy\u2019s petition for a writ of review was \u201cproperly filed\u201d on March 9, 1995, it was effectively denied on April 8, 1995, over one year before the limitations period even began. Section 2244(d)(2) is therefore inapplicable and the instant petition was untimely under \u00a7 2244(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">Accordingly, we DENY Mr. Handy\u2019s application for a COA and DISMISS the appeal. Mr. Handy\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis is GRANTED, as is his motion to supplement the record.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b832-15\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.

Avery, </em>393 U.S. 483, 490, 89 S.Ct. 747, 21 L.Ed.2d 718 (1969), another inmate assisted Mr. Handy in the preparation of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
