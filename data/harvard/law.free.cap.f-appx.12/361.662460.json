The case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 84(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">In 1994, Cunningham filed her application for widow\u2019s benefits, alleging that she was entitled to benefits because she was the common-law wife of the insured decedent, James Cunningham. After a hearing, an administrative law judge (ALJ) determined that Dolores Cunningham had not established that she was the decedent\u2019s common-law wife, and the ALJ denied her application for benefits. Following the Appeals Council\u2019s decision affirming the ALJ\u2019s determination, Cunningham sought judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision. Upon the parties\u2019 consent, the matter was referred to a magistrate judge for final disposition. The magistrate judge concluded that substantial evidence existed to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision, and the court dismissed Cunningham\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">We initially note that Cunningham\u2019s April 15, 1999, notice of appeal was a timely appeal from the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing her complaint on March 24,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s decision. Judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision is limited to determining whether the Commissioner\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence and whether the proper legal standards were employed in reaching the conclusion. <em>Garcia v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>46 F.3d 552, 555 (6th Cir.1995). Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla of evidence but less than a preponderance and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. <em>Bell v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>105 F.3d 244, 245 (6th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Substantial evidence exists to support the ALJ\u2019s decision. Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(e), the widow of an insured decedent is entitled to social security benefits. The validity of the marriage is governed by the laws of the state where the decedent had a permanent home when he died. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(h)(l)(A)(i); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.345. In order to have a valid common-law marriage under Ohio law, Cunningham must prove: 1) words of present intent to create a marriage; 2) cohabitation as husband and wife; and 3) holding out to the public as man and wife. <em>Smereczynski v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>944 F.2d 296, 298 (6th Cir.1991). Cunningham has the burden to establish the elements of a common-law marriage by clear and convincing evidence under Ohio law. <em>Smith-Wilkins v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>880 F.2d 864, 866 (6th Cir.1989). The district court properly determined that substantial evidence exists to support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Cunningham did not meet this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">Accordingly, this court affirms the district court\u2019s judgment. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
