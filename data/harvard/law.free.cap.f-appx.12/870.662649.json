State, </em>No. F-96-1364, slip op. at 1 (Okla.Crim.App.1998). The jury heard evidence that Pace invited his victims, Ralph Jared (\u201cJared\u201d) and Aaron Combs (\u201cCombs\u201d), along with a third man named Douglas Everman (\u201cEverman\u201d), to his home to drink beer. <em>See id. </em>For approximately 45 minutes, the four men visited at Pace\u2019s Htchen table without incident. <em>See id. </em>Everman testified that he got up to go to the bathroom with Jared following behind him, heard several popping noises, and turned to see Pace holding a gun. <em>See id. </em>at 1-2. Pace told Everman to get out of the way, and then shot Jared. <em>See id. </em>at 2. Pace killed both Combs and Jared, and then invited Everman to stay for another beer. <em>See id. </em>Everman declined, and instead left to report the shooting. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b899-13\">Pace unsuccessfully appealed his conviction to the OHahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, asserting that: (1) he was prejudiced by ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to (a) seek a limiting instruction for certain impeachment evidence, (b) demur at the close of evidence, and (c) request a jury instruction on voluntary intoxication, <em>see Pace, </em>No. F-96-1364 at 2; (2) the prosecutor improperly commented on Pace\u2019s invocation of his right to silence, <em>see id. </em>at 7-8; (3) the evidence was insufficient to prove Pace acted with malice aforethought, <em>see id. </em>at 9; and (4) the evidence was insufficient to disprove Pace\u2019s claim that he acted in self defense, <em>see id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b899-14\">The OHahoma Court of Criminal Appeals rejected each of these arguments, <em>see generally id., </em>and Pace filed a petition for habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 which substantially duplicated his arguments on direct appeal and in addition claimed that: (1) the district court\u2019s omission of the word \u201cunlawfully\u201d from a jury instruction defining \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d violated his constitutional right to due pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>cess, <em>see </em>Doc. 2 at 6; and (2) Pace\u2019s counsel was ineffective because he failed to object to the jury instruction on malice aforethought, and because he failed to object to the admission of incriminating statements that Pace made to an investigating officer after asserting his right to counsel, <em>see id. </em>at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">The district court referred Pace\u2019s petition to a magistrate for initial proceedings pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), and the magistrate issued a report and recommendation that Pace\u2019s petition be denied. <em>See generally </em>Doc. 43. The district court adopted the report in full. <em>See </em>Doc. 45 at 2. Specifically, the district court denied those claims which were presented on direct appeal in light of the deferential standard of review required by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). <em>See </em>Doc. 45 at 2; Doc. 43 at 4, 9, 13 &amp; 16. Further, the district court held that Pace\u2019s new objection to the jury instructions and his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel were procedurally barred, and were not excused by ineffective assistance of appellate counsel as Pace argued in his petition. <em>See id. </em>at 18-22. Finally, the district court denied Pace\u2019s requests for a Certificate of Appeal-ability (\u201cCOA\u201d) and to appear <em>in forma pauperis </em>pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a). <em>See </em>Doc. 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">With respect to those claims which the district court found were addressed in his direct state appeal, we deny COA for substantially the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s order and in the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation. Pace did not appeal the district court\u2019s denial of relief based on his counsel\u2019s failure to object to the impeachment evidence, and therefore we do not consider the argument in this order and judgment. Further, we agree that Pace failed to exhaust his due process objection to the jury instruction defining malice aforethought and his related claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel in state court. Thus, Pace\u2019s substantive objection to the jury instructions is now procedurally barred, and we deny COA as to this issue. <em>Cf. Odum v. Boone, </em>62 F.3d 327, 331 (10th Cir.1995) (upholding procedural bar on the basis of petitioner\u2019s failure to present a claim on direct appeal in Oklahoma state court).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">The district court held that Pace\u2019s claim that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the instructions was also procedurally barred, and that Pace could not establish cause and prejudice excusing the procedural bar. <em>See </em>Doc. 43 at 18. We need not reach the question of procedural bar on this issue, however, because we find that the petition can as easily be denied on its merits. <em>Cf. </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(2) (\u201cAn application for a writ of habeas corpus may be denied on the merits, notwithstanding the failure of the applicant to exhaust the remedies available in the courts of the State.\u201d) In order to establish entitlement to relief on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel, Pace must show both that his attorney\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that he was prejudiced by his attorney\u2019s mistakes. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). In this case, Pace has not alleged facts satisfying either element of his claim. Despite the omission of the word \u201cunlawfully\u201d from the jury instruction on malice aforethought, the instructions as submitted substantially tracked the elements of first-degree murder in Oklahoma. <em>See </em>Okla. Stat. tit. 21 \u00a7 701.7. Further, we note that the OCCA has in the past approved of similar jury instructions defining malice aforethought. <em>See Williams v. State, </em>2001 OK CR 9, 22 P.3d 702, 713-15 (Okla.Crim.App.2001) (holding that instruction defin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>ing malice aforethought as \u201ca deliberate intention to take away the life of a human being\u201d properly conveyed the mens rea element of first degree murder); <em>Cleary v. State, </em>942 P.2d 736, 744 (Okla.Crim.App.1997) (approving instruction defining malice aforethought as the \u201cdeliberate intent to take a human life\u201d). Finally, the idea of \u201cunlawful\u201d is implicitly embraced in the concept of malice. For these reasons, we do not believe either that Pace\u2019s trial attorney\u2019s performance was objectively unreasonable or that any mistakes the attorney made prejudiced Pace at trial. We therefore deny COA as to this issue as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Finally, because we find that Pace\u2019s appeal was not taken in good faith, we DENY Pace\u2019s motion to appear <em>in forma pawperis </em>pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(1) &amp; (a)(3).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b899-11\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to grant the parties' request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App.P. 34(f) and 10th Cir.R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore submitted without oral argument. This Order and Judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir.R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
