Rother moves for reconsideration of the court\u2019s order dismissing her appeal for failure to file a Fed. Cir. R. 15(c) statement or a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-23\">In this case, the Merit Systems Protection Board affirmed OPM\u2019s disallowance of Rother\u2019s application for disability benefits. Rother petitioned this court for review. Her petition was dismissed for failure to file a brief and to file a Fed. Cir. R. 15(c) statement.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b972-24\">In her petition for review, Rother notes that she disagrees with the administrative law judge\u2019s determination that she did not show that she is disabled for purposes of receiving disability benefits. Pursuant to <em>Lindahl v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>470 U.S. 768, 105 S.Ct. 1620, 84 L.Ed.2d 674 (1985), this court has no jurisdiction to review that issue. <em>Lindahl, </em>470 U.S. at 791, 105 S.Ct. 1620 (\u201cthe factual underpinnings of [5 U.S.C. ] \u00a7 8347 disability determinations may not be judicially reviewed\u201d). We will grant Rother\u2019s motion to the extent that it changes the ground for dismissal of Rother\u2019s case. Rother\u2019s petition is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction and not for failure to prosecute.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">(1) Rother\u2019s motion for reconsideration is granted in part. The mandate is recalled and the court\u2019s order dismissing Rother\u2019s petition for failure to prosecute is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">(2) This petition for review is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b972-16\"> The court notes that the due date for filing the brief had not passed and the case was incorrectly dismissed on that ground.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
