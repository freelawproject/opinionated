After examining the appellant's brief and the record, we have concluded that oral argument is unnecessary. Accordingly, the appeal is submitted on the appellant's brief and the record. <em>See </em>Fed.

We affirm the dismissal but modify it to be with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-22\">In 1991 O\u2019Neill was convicted in the Superior Court of Marion County of four counts of robbery, and also was found to be an habitual offender under Indiana law. He was sentenced to thirty-eight years\u2019 imprisonment. In 1993 O\u2019Neill filed a complaint seeking damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 alleging that police detective David Burks coerced his confession by falsely promising he would not be charged as an habitual offender if he confessed. O\u2019Neill voluntarily dismissed to pursue his state post-conviction remedies. O\u2019Neill then re-filed his complaint in June 2000, adding as defendants two prosecutors and the State of Indiana. The district court dismissed, concluding that O\u2019Neill\u2019s claim was premature under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), because the relief sought would directly impugn the validity of his conviction, which was never reversed, expunged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>or otherwise invalidated. Our review is de novo, and we view O\u2019Neill\u2019s allegations in the light most favorable to him, drawing all Inferences in his favor. <em>See Stachon v. United Consumers Club, Inc., </em>229 F.3d 673, 675 (7th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">On appeal O\u2019Neill purports to challenge both dismissals. But we have no jurisdiction to review the 1993 dismissal because O\u2019Neill failed to appeal it within thirty days as Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(a) requires. See <em>Bell v. Eastman Kodak Co., </em>214 F.3d 798, 800 (7th Cir.2000). And we note that O\u2019Neill could not have appealed the 1993 dismissal because it was granted at his own request. <em>See Boland v. Engle, </em>113 F.3d 706, 714 (7th Cir.1997). As for the dismissal in this case, O\u2019Neill contends that he should have been permitted to pursue his claim because he \u201cexhausted\u201d his state remedies as he thinks is required by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Heck.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">At the outset we note that O\u2019Neill apparently has misinterpreted <em>Heck </em>to be an exhaustion rule. It is not. Rather, <em>Heck </em>is an accrual rule; a damages claim that \u201cnecessarily demonstrates the invalidity of [a] conviction\u201d may not be brought so long as the conviction stands. <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87; <em>see also Gonzalez v. Entress, </em>133 F.3d 551, 553 (7th Cir.1998). Thus, it matters not that O\u2019Neill has exhausted his state post-conviction remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Still, O\u2019Neill is correct that his suit is not barred by <em>Heck. </em>A damages claim is not premature under <em>Heck </em>when the alleged constitutional violation underlying the claim is subject to doctrines like independent source, inevitable discovery and harmless error; when those doctrines apply a successful claim would not inevitably undermine the conviction. <em>See Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 487 n.7; <em>Gonzalez, </em>133 F.3d at 553-54; <em>cf. Booker v. Ward, </em>94 F.3d 1052, 1056 (7th Cir.1996) (\u201c[A] wrongful arrest claim, like a number of other Fourth Amendment claims, does not inevitably undermine a conviction; one can have a successful wrongful arrest claim and still have a perfectly valid conviction.\u201d). Because the harmless error doctrine applies to coerced confessions, <em>see Arizona v. Fulmi-nante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 310-11, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1991); <em>Jackson v. Suffolk County Homicide Bureau, </em>135 F.3d 254, 257 (2d Cir.1998), the district court erred in concluding that O\u2019Neill\u2019s claim is premature under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Heck. See Simmons v. O\u2019Brien, </em>77 F.3d 1093, 1095 (8th Cir.1996) (\u201cBecause harmless error analysis is applicable to the admission at trial of coerced confessions, judgment in favor of Simmons on this \u00a7 1983 action will not <em>necessarily </em>demonstrate the invalidity of his conviction.\u201d (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">Nonetheless, our decision does not spare O\u2019Neill\u2019s claim. Because it was not barred by <em>Heck, </em>O\u2019Neill- was required to bring the claim immediately. <em>See Apampa v. Layng, </em>157 F.3d 1103, 1105 (7th Cir.1998). In Indiana, a two-year statute of limitations applies to claims brought under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Snodderly v. R.U.F.F. Drug Enforcement Task Force, </em>239 F.3d 892, 895 (7th Cir.2001). O\u2019Neill\u2019s claim accrued in the early 1990s when, he alleges, the defendants fraudulently obtained his confession, and the limitations period thus expired long ago. Accordingly, we modify the judgment to be with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">Affirmed as Modified.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
