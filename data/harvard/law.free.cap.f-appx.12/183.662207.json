Withers argues the district court clearly erred in enhancing his sentence for obstruction of justice pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3C1.1 (1998) and in denying him a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3E1.1. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Withers first argues the Government did not carry its burden to prove he obstructed justice. We review factual findings concerning the Guidelines for clear error, <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217 (4th Cir.1989), but do not review the district court\u2019s estimation of the witnesses\u2019 credibility, <em>see United States v. Saunders, </em>886 F.2d 56, 60 (4th Cir.1989). Following a thorough review of the record, we find the district court did not clearly err in determining that Withers attempted to obstruct justice by threatening a witness and attempting to convince the witness not to testify. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3C1.1, comment. (n.4(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Next, Withers argues the district court erred by denying him a reduction in his offense level for acceptance of responsibility based upon unrelated criminal conduct that occurred before he pled guilty to the offense. A district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3E1.1 is a factual determination reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>77 F.3d 71, 74 (4th Cir.1996). We find the district court did not clearly err in relying on conduct that occurred before Withers signed the plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Kidd, </em>12 F.3d 30, 34 (4th Cir.1993). Nor was it clear error to rely on criminal conduct not related to the offense of conviction. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Ceccarani, </em>98 F.3d 126, 129-30 (3d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">We affirm Withers\u2019 conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
