Griesa, <em>Judge, </em>convicting him of wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343; conspiracy to commit wire fraud and to falsify the books and records of a registered broker-dealer of securities, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371; interstate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>transportation of stolen property, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314; laundering money instruments, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1957(A)(1)(b); conspiracy to launder monetary instruments, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h); and engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity, to wit, a fraudulent scheme to defraud a brokerage house, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1957(a). Kor-man was sentenced principally to 46 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by a two-year term of supervised release, and was ordered to pay $1,280,000 in restitution. On appeal, Korman challenges the prison term imposed, contending (1) that the district court improperly applied \u00a7 2S1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d), and grouped his money-laundering offenses separately from his fraud offenses, thereby increasing his Guidelines offense level, and (2) that the court should have granted him a downward departure on account of his physical condition. Finding no basis for reversal, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">In reviewing a sentence, we are required to accept a district court\u2019s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous and to give \u201cdue deference to the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e) (1994). Korman\u2019s contention that \u00a7 2S1.1 was erroneously applied to him because the laundered funds did not conceal moneys derived from narcotics trafficking or organized crime is without merit. Application of that section is not limited to the proceeds of those crimes. <em>See generally United States v. Napoli, </em>179 F.3d 1 (2d Cir.1999) (\u00a7 2S1.1 applied to fraud scheme), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1162, 120 S.Ct. 1176, 145 L.Ed.2d 1084 (2000); <em>see also United States v. Mustafa, </em>238 F.3d 485, 496 (3d Cir.2001) (\u201ca court\u2019s \u00a7 2S1.1 heartland analysis should address whether defendants engaged in money laundering in which the laundered funds derived from serious underlying criminal conduct such as a significant drug trafficking operation or organized crime <em>or in typical money laundering in which a defendant knowingly conducted a financial transaction to conceal tainted funds </em>.... \u201d (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added)). Nor is it required that fraud offenses and money-laundering offenses be treated in a single group. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Napoli, </em>179 F.3d at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">In the present case, two of Korman\u2019s coconspirators devised a scheme for obtaining moneys fraudulently. Thereafter, Korman was recruited to set up corporations-in names other than those of the coconspirators \u2014 solely for the purpose of receiving the fraudulently obtained moneys and then disbursing them to the scheme\u2019s participants in a disguised or untraceable form. The interposition of the corporations helped to conceal from the fraud victim the identities of the perpetrators of the fraudulent scheme and of the persons sharing in the proceeds. The district court found that \u201cthe design here was to handle this stolen money in such a way as to conceal what really happened to it, conceal the nature of the source of the funds so I am afraid I have got to apply the money laundering guidelines.... \u201d (Sentencing Transcript, Aug. 24, 2000.) We see no error in this characterization of the scheme, and we defer to the court\u2019s conclusion that the money-laundering guidelines were applicable to Korman\u2019s money-laundering offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">Korman\u2019s additional contention that the district court should have granted him a downward departure because of his physical condition is not properly before us. <em>See generally </em>Guidelines \u00a7 5K2.0 (policy statement) (departure permissible if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>\u201cthere exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described.\u201d) The refusal to grant a departure is not reviewable on appeal except for an error of law, such as the court\u2019s mistaken belief that it lacks the power to depart. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Clark, </em>128 F.3d 122, 124 (2d Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Haynes, </em>985 F.2d 65, 68 (2d Cir.1993). Korman has not suggested that there was any such error here, and we see none. The court stated, \u201cI do not find that the situation rises to the level which would permit me in any legal or proper exercise of discretion, in any legal manner or proper exercise of discretion to downwardly depart____\u201d The court having found that a downward departure was not warranted by the situation before it, its refusal to depart is unreviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">We have considered all of Korman\u2019s contentions that are properly before us and have found them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
