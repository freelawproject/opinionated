Following a bench trial, the district court concluded that the policy provided no coverage for the claims asserted against the insured, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Carova Corporation and Ocean Sands Corporation, both Virginia corporations, are joint venturers in Ocean Carova (\u201cCa-rova\u201d), which owns real property located in Currituck County, North Carolina. Carova operated a trash dump on its property and authorized motor vehicles to use a pedestrian right-of-way for access to the dump. The owner of a neighboring property, Swan Island Properties, Inc. (\u201cSwan Island\u201d), which was developing its property for resale in lots, sued Carova for damages to Swan Island\u2019s property caused by the presence of the dump and by trash blowing from the dump onto Swan Island\u2019s property. In its suit against Carova, Swan Island alleged: (1) that Carova knowingly permitted use of its pedestrian easement for use by motor vehicle traffic thereby damaging the easement; (2) that operation of a trash dump by Carova on its property near Swan Island\u2019s property line created a visual impairment that \u201cunreasonably interfered\u201d with Swan Island\u2019s ability to sell lots; and (3) that trash from the dump had blown from Carova\u2019s property onto Swan Island\u2019s property. Swan Island filed suits against Carova in both state and federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Carova tendered the defense of these suits to its insurance company, USF &amp; G, but USF &amp; G denied coverage because the claims in the suits did not assert \u201cproperty damage,\u201d as defined by the policy, and because a pollution exclusion applied, barring coverage. After Carova defended the suits at its own expense, eventually settling with Swan Island for $13,000, Carova instituted this action against USF &amp; G for a declaratory judgment that USF <em>&amp; </em>G was obliged to provide a defense and for a money judgment for reimbursement of its costs of defense and settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">Following a bench trial, the district court ruled in favor of USF &amp; G, concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-10\">From the evidence presented at trial and in the record before the Court, it is clear to the Court that USF &amp; G properly found that the underlying complaints filed by Swan Island do not allege \u201cproperty damage\u201d as defined by the policies. Therefore, USF &amp; G had no obligation to provide coverage to Carova for the claims in the Swan Island complaints. It is equally clear to the Court that even if there was \u201cproperty damage,\u201d USF &amp; G correctly invoked the contract\u2019s pollution exemption when it denied Carova\u2019s request for coverage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-12\">The policy in question provides that USF &amp; G \u201cwill pay those sums that [Caro-va] becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of ... \u2018property damage\u2019 to which this insurance applies. We will have the right and duty to defend any \u2018suit\u2019 seeking those damages.\u201d The policy defines \u201cproperty damage\u201d to \u201cmeant ] [p]hysical injury to tangible property, including all resulting loss of that property ... or [l]oss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured. All such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the \u2018occurrence\u2019 that caused it.\u201d An \u201coccurrence\u201d is defined as \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>USF <em>&amp; </em>G directs us to two exclusions in the policy that may be applicable. Under the first, the policy excludes coverage of property damage that is \u201cexpected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d And under the second, the policy excludes property damage caused by pollution, specifically damage that \u201caris[es] out of the actual, alleged or threatened discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release or escape of pollutants [a]t or from any premises, site or location which is or was at any time owned or occupied by ... [Carova].\u201d A \u201cpollutant\u201d is defined by the policy as \u201cany solid, liquid, gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant, including smoke, vapor, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, chemicals and waste. Waste includes materials to be recycled, reconditioned or reclaimed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Under Virginia law, which is applicable, the determination of whether an insurance company has a duty to defend must be based on \u201c(1) the policy language to ascertain the terms of the coverage and (2) the underlying complaint to determine whether any claims alleged therein are covered by the policy.\u201d <em>Fuisz v. Selective Ins. Co. of America, </em>61 F.3d 238, 242 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">The allegations of the complaints that Swan Island filed against Carova may be grouped under three basic claims. First, Swan Island contended that Carova permitted others to use the pedestrian walkway easement located at the border of the Carova land for motor vehicular traffic even though the easement had been dedicated for pedestrian use only. The Swan Island complaint charged that Carova \u201cknowingly allowed\u201d the pedestrian walkway easement to be used in this fashion, thereby damaging the easement. Second, Swan Island claimed that Carova\u2019s maintenance of the dump on its property created a nuisance that decreased the value of Swan Island\u2019s property. And third, \u201chousehold trash was blown from Carova land onto the Swan Island land,\u201d thereby impairing Swan Island\u2019s ability to sell its lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">The first two claims asserted by Swan Island are clearly based on deliberate conduct. The allegation that Carova improperly allowed vehicular traffic to use an easement was specifically alleged to have been done \u201cknowingly.\u201d And Carova\u2019s operation of a dump, alleged by Swan Island to create a nuisance, was obviously deliberate. Accordingly, we believe that both of these claims are excluded from coverage because each claimed damages that were \u201cexpected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">The third claim, that trash blew onto Swan Island\u2019s property, is also arguably based on an occurrence that was \u201cexpected\u201d from Carova\u2019s standpoint. But even if this claim could be construed as falling under Swan Island\u2019s general allegations of negligence, there still would be no coverage because the trash caused no property damage as that term is defined by the policy. The policy defines property damage as \u201cphysical injury to tangible property, including all resulting loss of that property.\u201d The allegations in the complaint concern trash that could easily be removed, and no allegation suggests that it damaged the underlying property. Moreover, the allegations fail to indicate how the windblown trash caused damage to the property based on the policy\u2019s alternative definition of \u201closs of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.\u201d Although Swan Island could allege a decline in value resulting from the existence of the dump itself on the adjacent property, it could not make a similar claim for blown trash that could easily be removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Accordingly, without considering whether the pollution exclusion applies, we agree with the district court that the policy did not cover the risks described in Swan Island lawsuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
