The state contends that various defects in the warrant process, including the overbreadth of the \u201cduplicate original\u201d warrant, were immaterial and, in all events, were not of constitutional magnitude and thus did not require suppression. <em>See </em>ORS 136.432.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude that the scope of the \u201cduplicate original\u201d warrant deviated so substantially from the magistrate\u2019s oral authorization to search that the execution of the latter violated Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Except as specifically noted, the material facts are undisputed. On January 27,1998, Detective Gardiner of the Curry County Sheriffs Office telephoned Circuit Court Judge Downer to request a telephonic search warrant pursuant to ORS 133.555(3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Detective Gardiner was in Brookings, and Judge Downer was in Gold Beach at the time. Gardiner sought authorization to search Apartment No. 5 at 524 Spruce Street in Brookings for controlled substances, including methamphetamine, and related paraphernalia, documents, and proceeds. He recounted to the judge the facts that he believed constituted probable cause for the search. Gardiner\u2019s statements were tape-recorded as required under the telephonic warrant statutes, ORS 133.545(5), but Judge Downer\u2019s comments were not recorded.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the end of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>conversation, Judge Downer orally authorized a search of 524 Spruce Street, Apartment No. 5.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">Judge Downer did not sign, date, and file an original search warrant following the conversation, as required by ORS 133.555(3).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, Gardiner did prepare a \u201cduplicate original warrant,\u201d signing Judge Downer\u2019s name to that document. ORS 133.555(3). That duplicate original warrant authorized \u201cany police officer in the state of Oregon\u201d to search \u201c524 SPRUCE STREET, BROOKINGS, CURRY COUNTY, OREGON.\u201d The building located at 524 Spruce Street in Bookings is a multi-unit apartment complex. The duplicate original warrant did not refer to Apartment No. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The search warrant was then executed, with Gardiner \u201cas the officer in charge of that operation.\u201d Only Apartment No. 5 was searched. Defendants, who resided in Apartment No. 5, were subsequently charged with a variety of crimes, including drug offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Defendants moved to suppress, arguing principally that, because the duplicate original warrant described the entire apartment complex, and not Apartment No. 5, the warrant was impermissibly overbroad. <em>See, e.g., State v. Davis, </em>106 Or App 546, 552, 809 P2d 125 (1991) (applying particularity requirement); <em>State v. Ingram, </em>313 Or 139, 831 P2d 674 (1992) (prohibiting general warrants); <em>State v. Willcutt, </em>19 Or App 93, 95, 526 P2d 607, <em>rev den </em>(1974) (stating rule that search warrant must specify which subunits of multi-unit structure are to be searched). In the hearing on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>that motion, the state did not dispute that the duplicate original warrant\u2019s description of the premises was impermissibly overbroad. Instead, the state argued that that facial over-breadth should be qualified by the officer\u2019s subjective knowledge and good faith \u2014 and specifically in the telephonic warrant context, that the \u201clack of particularity\u201d or \u201coverbreadth\u201d analysis should focus not on the duplicate original warrant but, rather, on the <em>magistrate\u2019s </em>original authorization:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-4\">\u201c[The duplicate original warrant is] a dummied up piece of paper. The actual truth of what\u2019s said is in the transcript of the telephone conversation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\">\u201c* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">\u201cAnd at the end of the affidavit, obviously, [Gardiner] repeats the address, 524 Spruce, Number 5. At that point the Detective receives permission from the judge to go and search that residence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-7\">\u201cI think in the case of telephonic search, there\u2019s no question that it\u2019s .going to go to another officer. You\u2019re going to have the officer who made the telephonic search warrant be the officer who goes and serves that search warrant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">The court then found that Judge Downer did in fact authorize a search of Apartment No. 5:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-9\">\u201cI would find based upon the one-sided dialogue * * * that Officer Gardiner was requesting a warrant for 524 Spruce, Number 5 and that Judge Downer authorized a search of 524 Spruce No. 5.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-10\">\u201cHe would have therefore authorized Officer Gardiner to prepare a search warrant for service upon the occupants of 524 Spruce Street, No. 5 in Brookings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">Nevertheless, the court also found the duplicate warrant to be overbroad:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-12\">\u201cWithout the No. 5 there, technically the warrant that was signed under the authority of Judge Downer by Officer Gardiner gave him the authority to go in all five buildings. And we all know you can\u2019t do that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-13\">Accordingly, the court granted the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-14\">On appeal, the state makes two closely related arguments. First, any ostensible overbreadth in the duplicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>original warrant\u2019s description of the premises is cured by reference to the magistrate\u2019s more precise oral authorization. Second, in all events, the operative warrant here was not the duplicate original but was, instead, the magistrate\u2019s oral authorization. The state further asserts \u2014 in response to defendant\u2019s contention that the procedure followed here deviated from that prescribed in ORS 133.545(5) and ORS 133.555(3) \u2014 that suppression cannot be based on such statutory violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">We begin with a brief description of the telephonic warrant procedure. ORS 133.545(5) allows a recorded oral statement to substitute for a written affidavit when a police officer applies for a search warrant over the telephone:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-5\">\u201cInstead of the written affidavit * * *, the judge may take an oral statement under oath. The oral statement shall be recorded and transcribed. The transcribed statement shall be considered to be an affidavit for the purposes of this section. In such cases, the recording of the sworn oral statement and the transcribed statement shall be certified by the judge receiving it and shall be retained as a part of the record of proceedings for the issuance of the warrant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">ORS 133.555(3) sets forth the procedures for issuance of a telephonic warrant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">\u201cThe judge may orally authorize a police officer or a district attorney to sign the judge\u2019s name on a duplicate original warrant. A duplicate original warrant shall be a search warrant for the purposes of [this chapter] * * *. In such cases a judge shall enter on the face of the original warrant the exact time of the issuance of the warrant and shall sign and file the original warrant in the manner provided by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">Thus, under ORS 133.555(3), the issuing magistrate must create and file an original warrant contemporaneously with the oral authorization or soon thereafter. <em>State v. Jordan, </em>73 Or App 84, 89, 697 P2d 1004, <em>rev den </em>299 Or 251 (1985). That provides a means for the suppression court to compare the officer\u2019s duplicate with the judge\u2019s original in order to \u201cto verify, for example that the officers did not add items not approved by the magistrate.\u201d <em>State v. Evans, </em>110 Or App 46, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>54, 822 P2d 1198 (1991). That process thus ensures that \u201cevidence [is] gathered [in] a constitutionally permissible\u201d fashion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">Finally\u2014and of particular importance here\u2014telephonic warrants are subject to the requirements generally applicable to all warrants, including the \u201cparticularity\u201d requirement of ORS 133.565(2), which provides in part that \u201cthe warrant shall state, or describe with particularity * * * the location and designation of the premises or places to be searched.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Here, there were at least three violations of the statutorily prescribed process. First, the court never signed, dated, and filed a written original warrant, as required by ORS 133.555(3).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Second, the duplicate original warrant\u2014which under ORS 133.555(3) is deemed to be \u201ca search warrant for purposes of [this chapter]\u201d\u2014did not, on its face, meet the particularity requirement of ORS 133.565(2)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\"> Finally, the duplicate original warrant\u2019s description of the premises violated an implicit, but essential, statutory requirement. That description not only was facially over-broad, but it also deviated materially from the issuing magistrate\u2019s underlying authorization. It broadened the authorized scope of the search from one apartment to include the entire complex. If the statutory scheme is to operate practically and legally, officers, in creating a <em>duplicate </em>original warrant, must accurately memorialize the material elements of the court\u2019s order. <em>See Evans, </em>110 Or App at 54; <em>Jordan, </em>73 Or App at 89. That did not occur here.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Nevertheless, as the state asserts, under ORS 136.432, mere statutory violations do not warrant suppression. Thus, the issue reduces to whether any of those violations also offends Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">The state acknowledges, necessarily, that a warrant\u2019s lack of particularity may violate not only ORS 133.565 but also Article I, section 9. \u201cORS 133.565(2) implements a constitutional right to be free from searches conducted pursuant to warrants that do not particularly describe the persons or places to be searched.\u201d <em>Ingram, </em>313 Or at 147. In <em>State v. Blackburn /Barber, </em>266 Or 28, 34-35, 511 P2d 381 (1973), the court described the constitutional implications of overbroad warrants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-5\">\u201cBoth the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, \u00a7 9, of the Oregon Constitution require a search warrant \u2018particularly describing the place to be searched.\u2019 It has been explained that \u2018the historical motivation for this constitutional mandate was a fear of \u201cgeneral warrants,\u201d giving the bearer an unlimited authority to search and seize.\u2019 More specifically, the aim of the requirement of particularity is to protect the citizen\u2019s interest in freedom from governmental intrusion through the invasion of his privacy. If the search warrant describes premises in such a way that it makes possible the invasion of this interest in privacy without the foundation of probable cause for the search, the warrant is too broad and therefore constitutionally defective.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-6\">\u201cIn testing a warrant for definiteness \u2018it is enough if the description is such that the officer with a search warrant can with reasonable effort ascertain the identity of the place intended.\u2019 The description must be sufficiently clear so that the property to be searched is recognizable from other neighboring properties. If, however, a warrant purporting to authorize a search is sufficiently ambiguous that it is impossible to identify with a reasonable degree of certainty the particular premises authorized to be searched, the warrant may not be executed and any search pursuant to it is illegal, whether of the premises actually intended or not, because of the danger that the privacy of unauthorized premises will be invaded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number><em>See also State v. Devine, </em>307 Or 341, 343-44, 768 P2d 913 (1989) (\u201cThe purpose of this [Article I, section 9, particularity] requirement is to minimize the risk of intrusion into premises other than those as to which a magistrate has found probable cause to search.\u201d); <em>State v. Cortman, </em>251 Or 566, 569, 446 P2d 681, (1968) (\u201cThe purpose of the particular-description requirement is to narrow the scope of the search to those premises for which a magistrate has found probable cause to authorize the search.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">The state argues, however, that for constitutional purposes, any facial overbreadth in the duplicate original\u2019s description of the premises is cured by reference to the magistrate\u2019s oral authorization:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-5\">\u201cWith telephonic search warrants, the legally significant act of authorization is the issuing judge\u2019s oral statement to the officer authorizing the officer to search a particular place; it is not the officer\u2019s written recordation of that authorization. In this respect, telephonic search warrants are different from ordinary written warrants and should be judged under a different standard. When a judge reads a written proposed warrant and signs it, he authorizes what is written. The written warrant is itself the authorization to search. When a judge authorizes a telephonic warrant, however, he does not see anything in writing. He orally authorizes the search, and it is that oral authorization that sets the limits of the search authorized. The officer who thereafter writes out a paper duplicate warrant, attempting to restate the authority granted orally by the judge, cannot change the limits of the search authorized. The officer is entitled to do no more, and no less, than the judge orally authorized the officer to do. In that sense, the judge\u2019s oral statement is itself the original search warrant; the written duplicate is simply the officer\u2019s attempt to memorialize the authority that has been granted by the judge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The state\u2019s argument thus begins with the premise that, at least in some circumstances, Article I, section 9, permits courts to orally authorize searches without contemporaneously memorializing that authorization. We need not, and do not, decide the correctness of that premise because, even if a memorialized oral authorization were constitutionally permissible, in this case (1) the duplicate original warrant that the officers executed and served materially deviated from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>court\u2019s oral order, and (2) that warrant was facially over-broad. Those circumstances, in combination, violated the particularity requirement of Article I, section 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">The state\u2019s contention that the overbreadth could be cured by reference to. the court\u2019s oral authorization fails for several reasons. First, the duplicate original warrant\u2019s description of the premises to be searched was unambiguous. There was no reason, as the state suggests, for an executing officer \u201cto go back and check the tape of the telephone conversation to determine which apartment the court had authorized the police to search.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Nor did Gardiner\u2019s knowledge of the particulars of the court\u2019s oral authorization remedy that constitutional defect. The duplicate original warrant purported to authorize <em>\u201cany police officer in the state of Oregon\u201d </em>to search 524 Spruce Street. Thus, regardless of Gardiner\u2019s knowledge, the face of the executed warrant was controlling. <em>See, eg., Davis, </em>106 Or App at 552 (\u201c[BJecause the warrant was directed to \u2018any police officer of Douglas County,\u2019 there was no assurance that the affiant would be the executing officer. The officer\u2019s knowledge of the contents of the affidavit is irrelevant.\u201d). As we explained in <em>Davis'.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-6\">\u201cThe lesson of <em>Blackburn </em>/ <em>Barber </em>and <em>Devine </em>is that the authority of an officer to search premises under a search warrant is wholly circumscribed by the description in the warrant. * * * If we were to accept the state\u2019s argument, an officer would have authority to search premises on the basis of his knowledge, even though those premises were not accurately described in either the affidavit or the warrant. As the Supreme Court did in <em>Devine, </em>we reject the suggestion that the executing officer\u2019s good faith or reasonableness has anything to do with the inquiry.\u201d 106 Or App at 551-52.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">Ultimately, the state\u2019s \u201coral warrant\u201d argument founders on the incontrovertible fact that the officers here did not execute <em>that </em>warrant. Instead, they presented and executed the duplicate original warrant \u2014 a warrant that deviated materially from the magistrate\u2019s authorization and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>\u201cdescribe[d] [the] premises in such a way that it [made] possible the invasion of [an] interest in privacy without the foundation of probable cause for the search.\u201d <em>Blackburn/Barber, </em>266 Or at 34. That process violated Article I, section 9. Consequently, the court correctly allowed the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b416-6\"> ORS 136.432 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-7\">\u201cA court may not exclude relevant and otherwise admissible evidence in a criminal action on the grounds that it was obtained in violation of any statutory provision unless exclusion of the evidence is required by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-8\">\u201c(1) The United States Constitution or the Oregon ConstitutionM\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b416-9\"> The telephonic search warrant process is described more fully below and the pertinent statutes are set out in that discussion. <em>See </em>170 Or App at 371-72.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b416-10\"> The tape recording concludes with the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-11\">\u201cGARDINER: * * * I\u2019d also be looking for any quantities of cash greater than $100 which would be consistent with the sale and manufacture \u2014 resale and manufacture of methamphetamine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-12\">\u201c(pause)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-13\">\u201cGARDINER: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-14\">\u201c(pause)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>\u201cGARDINER: 524 Spruce, No. 5.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-8\">\u201c(pause)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-9\">\u201cGARDINER: Thank you, Your Honor.
