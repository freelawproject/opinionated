S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 193.2]. Note Curnen v. United States (C. C.) 136 Fed. 807.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b844-5\">The opinion of the board reads as follows (Somerville, General Appraiser):</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b844-6\">We find the facts in these eases to be as stated in the accompanying Exhibit A, dated December 28, 1897, and admitted in evidence as part of the record. The point of contention in the protests is that certain reappraisements made -by a general appraiser of the various goods covered by the invoices were invalid and void on the ground that the general appraiser who made the reappraisements did not examine any of the goods in question, having neither the goods nor samples before him at the time of the hearing. The reappraisements in question were ordered by the collector, and no second reappraisement was made by a board of three general appraisers of any of the \u2022cases of merchandise. Counsel for the importers appeared at the hearing of these reappraisements, and objected to the general appraiser taking any action concerning the cases of merchandise covered by the protests, alleging that the original appraisement was presumably correct, as the official act \u2022of a public officer, until the contrary was shown, and insisting that unless the cases of merchandise, or sufficient samples, were present before, and were examined by, the general appraiser, or witnesses, if any, no reappraisement could be mad\". The merchandise in question had been duly delivered l&gt;y the custom-house authorities to the importers, had by them been sold and sent to their customers, and had passed out of their possession and control ; and none of the merchandise, nor any samples, had been seen by the general appraiser or any of the witnesses called in these matters. It is the judgment of the board that. the reappraisements made by the general appraiser were not valid, for want of compliance with the requirements of the regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury covering reappraisements of merchandise made pursuant to law, and also as being in conflict with certain well-settled principles of law.
