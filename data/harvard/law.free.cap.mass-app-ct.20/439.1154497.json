Cohen, formerly president of the Old Silver Beach Village Association, had long been at loggerheads with C. Keefe Hurley, a trustee and the leading spirit of Old Silver Beach Trust, over the private and general responsibilities of landowners in and about Old Silver Beach Village, and over the problems of conservation and development of the area. On May 18, 1982, after public hearings in which Cohen and others made known their doubts, the planning board of Falmouth approved under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81U, a major re-subdivision proposal by the trust. Because of shortness of time in which to arrange for a number of landowners to lodge an \u201cappeal\u201d pursuant to G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 8IBB, Cohen (as he testified) undertook to do so as an individual \u201cperson aggrieved.\u201d Such an action goes against the planning board, but, as might be expected, the trust, as protagonist of the subdivision project, intervened as a party defendant. It answered Cohen\u2019s amended complaint and, in addition, counterclaimed against him on grounds of abuse of process in bringing the \u00a7 8IBB action. The main action was speedily tried (see G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59A) and resulted in a complete vindication of the planning board\u2019s decision and correspondingly of the position of the trust. Cohen\u2019s grounds of complaint were either withdrawn by him in the course of the proceedings or failed of proof. As one of his \u201crulings of law\u201d the trial judge wrote, \u201cThe plaintiff has failed to prove by any credible evidence any of the allegations that he has specified . . . .\u201d Cohen noticed an appeal to this court from the ensuing judgment, but he later abandoned it.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Now followed two attempts to make Cohen pay for his indiscretion in opposing the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">1. The trust moved under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, to compel Cohen to reimburse it for its reasonable counsel fees, expenses, and costs in defending Cohen\u2019s action. The motion was heard at some length. Tracking the requirement of the statute, the judge concluded (referring back to his findings in the main action) that \u201cCohen\u2019s claims were wholly insubstantial, frivolous, and not advanced in good faith.\u201d Of the trust\u2019s submitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>bills totaling $56,338.07 (of which $53,501.50 was for counsel fees and $2,836.57 for expenses) the judge allowed $20,134.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">From the order of award, Cohen appealed to a single justice of this court, and the trust cross appealed. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6G, inserted by St. 1976, c. 233, \u00a7 1. After hearing, the single justice, holding for the trust, modified the order appealed from by adding $7,500 for counsel fees. He also allowed a further $2,000 as reimbursement for the fees and expenses incurred by the trust in connection with the very appeals to the single justice. The panel now reviews the decision of the single justice. See <em>Katz </em>v. <em>Savitsky, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 792, 796 (1980); <em>Miaskiewicz </em>v. <em>LeTourneau, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 880, 881 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">We think there was adequate record support for the trial judge\u2019s award. Equally there was record support for the modification of that award by the single justice who, in accordance with \u00a7 6G, was to review the trial judge\u2019s award \u201cas if [he] were initially deciding the matter.\u201d See <em>Katz, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. at 796-797; <em>Miaskiewicz, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. at 881-882.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">As to the separate award of $2,000 against Cohen related to the \u00a7 6G appeals, the single justice had power to make it, see <em>Katz, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. at 798 &amp; n.8,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the question is on the particular exercise. The single justice could hold that Cohen\u2019s initiation of an appeal to diminish or eliminate the trial judge\u2019s award was not reasonable, even though his opposition to the trust\u2019s cross appeal (which he perhaps provoked) for an increase of the award may have been reasonable. Considering the single justice\u2019s opportunity for an intimate appraisal of the situation, and the modesty of his award in the circumstances, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">2. The trust appeals to this court from the judgment against it on its counterclaim for \u201cabuse of process.\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Here the trust reached for a recovery in very large amount beyond its litigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>expenditures. After hearing, the judge dealt with the counterclaim in a \u201cMemorandum of Decision and Order for Judgment\u201d in which he concluded that the tort was not made out.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The view he expressed was anticipated by the short remark in <em>Beecy </em>v. <em>Pucciarelli, </em>387 Mass. 589, 596 (1982), to the effect that \u201cmere commencement of litigation to enforce a claim which the person commencing the litigation knows or reasonably should have known to be groundless\u201d does not constitute abuse of process without proof of an \u201culterior purpose.\u201d Groundless Cohen\u2019s action may have been, but it was aimed, professedly and actually, at defeating the subdivision proposal, nothing more or different. There was no perversion of process to achieve an extraneous end. \u201c[Tjhere is no liability where the defendant has done nothing more than carry out the process to its authorized conclusion, even though with bad intentions\u201d; the case is otherwise where there is a \u201cform of coercion to obtain a collateral advantage, not properly involved in the proceeding itself, such as the surrender of property or the payment of money, by the use of the process as a threat or a club. There is, in other words, a form of extortion . . . .\u201d Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts \u00a7 121, at 898 (1984) (footnote omitted). We may despair of drawing a line with mathematical exactness, but we have no doubt that the present case is well on the side of privilege. Compare decisions where abuse has been found, <em>White </em>v. <em>Apsley Rubber Co., </em>181 Mass. 339, 341 (1902), <em>Malone </em>v. <em>Belcher, </em>216 Mass. 209, 210-212 (1913), <em>Reardon </em>v. <em>Sadd, </em>262 Mass. 345, 348 (1928), <em>Jacoby </em>v. <em>Spector, </em>292 Mass. 366, 369 (1935), <em>Lorusso </em>v. <em>Bloom, </em>321 Mass. 9, 10 (1947), with those holding to the contrary, <em>Gabriel </em>v. <em>Borowy, </em>324 Mass. 231, 236-237 (1949); <em>Noyes </em>v. <em>Shanahan, </em>325 Mass. 601, 604-605 (1950); <em>Quaranto </em>v. <em>Silverman, </em>345 Mass. 423, 426-428 (1963); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Brockton Pub. Mkts., Inc., </em>369 Mass. 387, 390-391 (1975); <em>Beecy </em>v. <em>Pucciarelli, </em>387 Mass. at 596 (1982); <em>Chemawa Country Golf, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wnuk, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>9 Mass. App. Ct. 506, 508-509 (1980). The trial judge referred to the policy that \u201c[ajbuse of process cases, like actions for malicious prosecution, are \u2018not to be favored and ought not to be encouraged,\u2019 <em>Wingersky </em>v. <em>E.E. Gray Co., </em>254 Mass. 198, 201 (1926),\u201d and that \u201c[wjere the rule otherwise, \u2018many honest litigants would be deterred from invoking the aid of the courts for fear of subjecting themselves to a law suit in return.\u2019 <em>Hubbard </em>v. <em>Beatty &amp; Hyde, Inc., </em>343 Mass. 258, 262-263 (1961).\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The decisions of the single justice awarding the additional $7,500 and the separate $2,000 are affirmed. The judgment on the counterclaim is affirmed, as is the denial of relief under rule 52(b) (see n.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b457-9\">See Mass.R.A.P. 25, as amended, 378 Mass. 925 (1979), as well as G.
