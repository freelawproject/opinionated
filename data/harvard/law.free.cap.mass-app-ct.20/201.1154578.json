L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B, the plaintiffs\u2019 offer of proof included partial transcripts of the testimony of two physicians in an unrelated civil action. After the tribunal determined, in accordance with the statute, see note 4, <em>infra, </em>that \u201cthe evidence presented if properly substantiated is sufficient to raise a legitimate question of liability appropriate for judicial inquiry,\u201d the defendant moved in the Superior Court to strike that determination. The motion was denied, and a single justice of this court allowed the defendant to take an interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>The sole question before us is the propriety of the tribunal\u2019s consideration of testimony adduced at an unrelated trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We hold that the transcripts do not qualify as an acceptable source of evidence under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The complaint alleged that the defendant was negligent in treating the plaintiff James M. Jasper by failing to disclose that one of the risks of the drug Prednisone is that it may cause osteonecrosis of the hips, that the defendant was aware or should have been aware of this risk, and that as a result of James\u2019 use of the drug he suffered osteonecrosis of both hips.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The partial transcripts were introduced to satisfy the requirement of <em>Harnish </em>v. <em>Children\u2019s Hosp. Medical Center, </em>387 Mass. 152, 156 (1982): in nondisclosure cases, \u201c[w]hat the physician should know involves professional expertise and can ordinarily be proved only through the testimony of experts.\u201d The excerpts included the partial testimony of Dr. Barry Fisherman, an ophthalmologist. He stated that the risks of the drug known as systemic Prednisone included \u201casceptic necrosis,\u201d which he defined as \u201ca wearing away, or destruction of the joints, of the bones.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">The second physician, Dr. Melvin W. Kramer, an internist, stated that a complication of systemic Prednisone is asceptic necrosis, that the drug is used in all specialties of medicine, and that the \u201cdrug is a standard drug which has been expounded upon in detail in the medical school, and the details of the\" pharmacology and effects, side effects of this medicine, are made known to every physician who obtains a diploma from medical school.\u201d Dr. Kramer also pointed out that the side effects of the drug depend on the individual sensitivities of the patient \u2014 \u201cthe particular characteristics of that patient\u2019s system prior to taking it, plus the duration of treatment and the intensity of treatment, how much is given for how long.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>In refusing to strike the finding of the tribunal, the judge ruled that the portions of the transcript \u201cdid not appear to the tribunal to be addressed to the [named] plaintiff [in that case] .... but rather to apply to physicians generally and patients generally.\u201d He held the testimony to be \u201canalogous to a medical journal article or a statement in a medical text\u201d of the type specifically permitted under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">That statute, set forth in relevant part in the margin,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> gives examples, but does not limit the kinds of evidence which may be introduced, and the standard for the admission of expert testimony before a medical malpractice tribunal is \u201cextremely <em>lenient.\u201d Halley </em>v. <em>Birbiglia, </em>390 Mass. 540, 543 n.4 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">There is a standard, nonetheless. The plaintiffs\u2019 bare allegations may not be accepted as sufficient, but rather \u201cevidence\u201d is to be presented to the tribunal. Its task has been \u201ccompared ... to the trial judge\u2019s function in ruling on a defendant\u2019s motion for directed verdict.\u201d <em>Little </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>376 Mass. 573, 578 (1978). Expert testimony must be accepted \u201cif the offer of proof is sufficient to show that a trial judge in his discretion <em>might properly rule </em>that the qualifications of the witness are sufficient.\u201d <em>Kapp </em>v. <em>Ballantine, </em>380 Mass. 186, 192 (1980) (emphasis original). <em>Kapp </em>thus establishes that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>evidence which might be admissible at trial must be accepted. We need not reach the question whether expert testimony which does not meet that standard may nevertheless be considered by a tribunal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Even if we accord the proffered expert testimony every lenity, we do not think it has the indicia of reliability required for a hearing before a medical malpractice tribunal. An expert \u201ccannot give an opinion unless it is properly based on the particular facts in dispute.\u201d Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 114 (5th ed. 1981). See <em>Gugino </em>v. <em>Harvard Community Health Plan, </em>380 Mass. 464, 468 (1980) (tribunal). Not only is it obvious that neither doctor was familiar with Jasper\u2019s condition,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but the testimony of Dr. Kramer itself revealed that the side effects and, hence, the risks, of the drug depend on the \u201cparticular characteristics\u201d of the patient, the dosage, and the duration of treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The transcript of expert testimony from another trial does not have the characteristics of learned treatises. The latter are subjected to careful professional criticism and are not made with an eye to litigation. See generally, 6 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1691-1692 (Chadboum rev. 1976). Moreover, despite the existence of G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79C, a statute allowing the admission of medical treatises, their use in Massachusetts is \u201csignificantly restricted.\u201d See Liacos, op. cit. at 109; Kehoe, Massachusetts Malpractice Evidentiary Statute \u2014 Success or Failure? 44 B.U.L. Rev. 10 (1964). See also <em>Girard </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 916, 916-917 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">We think the reasoning of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>712 F.2d 115, 121 (5th Cir. 1983), applies to hearings before the tribunal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>The court there held that the learned treatise doctrine is \u201cconfined to published works that have been subjected to widespread collegial scrutiny\u201d and is not to be extended to allow admission of prior testimony, from an unrelated trial, of another expert. The element of trustworthiness inherent in the learned treatise exception is, in such circumstances, lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Since the tribunal\u2019s decision was based in part on evidence which should not have been considered, the action is remanded to the Superior Court to strike the tribunal\u2019s determination and to allow the plaintiffs to make a new offer of proof.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b218-8\">In addition to the challenged transcripts, the offer of proof contained hospital records, an affidavit of James Jasper, and two pages of the 1980 edition of Physicians\u2019 Desk Reference. No claim has been made that these items, without the transcripts, could support a favorable determination, nor would such a claim be appropriate. The offer of proof must first be screened by a tribunal. <em>Broadard </em>v. <em>Hubbard Regional Hosp., </em>388 Mass. 1012 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b219-7\"> The judge in a footnote mentioned that the tribunal discussed the advance warning requirement of G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79C. No claim is made here relating to that requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b219-8\">General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 60B, inserted by St. 1975, c. 362, \u00a7 5, provides in relevant part: \u201cEvery action for malpractice, . . . shall be heard by a tribunal .... at which hearing the plaintiff shall present an offer of proof and said tribunal shall determine if the evidence presented if properly substantiated is sufficient to raise a legitimate question of liability appropriate for judicial inquiry. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">\u201cEach such action for malpractice shall be heard by said tribunal within fifteen days after the defendant\u2019s answer has been filed. Substantial evidence shall mean such evidence as a reasonable person might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. Admissible evidence shall include, but not be limited to, hospital and medical records, nurses\u2019 notes, x-rays and other records kept in the usual course of the practice of the health care provider without the necessity for other identification or authentication, statements of fact or opinion on a subject contained in a published treatise, periodical, book or pamphlet or statements by experts without the necessity of such experts appearing at said hearing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b220-8\"> See the reference to \u201c[substantial evidence\u201d in \u00a7 60B, note 4, <em>supra, </em>using language similar to that of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1(6). But see <em>Girard </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 916, 917 (1982) (no evidence before the tribunal on which the judge could properly have ruled that \u201cthe medical treatise [if it is that] relied on by the plaintiff ... but not referred to by the supposed expert, would be admissible at trial\u201d under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79C).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b220-9\"> We also note that the doctors spoke of \u201casceptic necrosis\u201d while the plaintiff alleged that he suffered from \u201costeonecrosis.\u201d No testimony indicated that both conditions are the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b221-7\">In view of the tribunal\u2019s determination in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor and the novel question presented, we do not believe the plaintiffs should be limited to their prior offer of proof. See note 2, <em>supra. </em>We note that, in any event, the tribunal may, on its own, seek additional testimony. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
