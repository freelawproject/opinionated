L. c. 40A, \u00a7 15, fifth par., as appearing in St. 1975, c. 808, \u00a7 3 (set out in the margin<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>) presents yet another difficulty, and we seek to find the more satisfactory solution.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>On July 6, 1983, the plaintiff Ida C. O\u2019Kane filed her application for a variance in the office of Hingham\u2019s town clerk. The defendant board of appeals conducted a public hearing on the application on August 16, 1983, forty-one days after the application, and on the same day the board voted (orally) to deny it. The written decision of the board, assigning reasons, was filed in the town clerk\u2019s office on September 20, 1983, thirty-five days after the oral decision and seventy-six days after the application. O\u2019Kane took her \u201cappeal\u201d to the Superior Court under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, on October 5, 1983, within the twenty days allowed. Upon stipulated facts, in substance as just narrated, a judge of the Superior Court ruled, agreeing with the plaintiff, that the variance must be held to have been \u201cconstructively\u201d granted because of the failure of the board to file its written decision in the town clerk\u2019s office within fourteen days following its action in rendering the oral decision. The board appeals to this court. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The judge argued, plausibly, that the fourteen-day provision was \u201cmandatory,\u201d but the later opinion in <em>Zuckerman </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Greenfield, </em>394 Mass. 663, 665-667 (1985), establishes the contrary: the provision is \u201cdirectory.\u201d Hence, in <em>Zuckerman, </em>where the appropriate writing was filed more than fourteen days following decision, but within the seventy-five days after application,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a \u201cconstructive\u201d grant of the application was averted and an appeal of the decision to the Superior Court, had it been timely taken, could reach the substance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The present case is a variant on <em>Zuckerman. </em>Here the writing was filed more than fourteen days after the decision, and seventy-six days after the application. And so we have the question, posed but not answered in <em>Zuckerman, </em>whether filing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>must at all events occur within seventy-five days, or may be effectively made within a fourteen-day interval following the expiration of the seventy-five days. As indicated in <em>Zuckerman, </em>at 665, these appear to be the only commonsensical alternatives; and we think the latter position accommodates better to the text and scheme of \u00a7 15, such as they are. In the third sentence, the \u201c[f]ailure by the board to act within said seventy-five days\u201d refers to \u201c[t]he decision of the board\u201d mentioned in the preceding sentence; and the \u201cwithin fourteen days\u201d of the third sentence, being directory, allows not less than that period after the decision is made for memorializing and filing it. Suppose a decision on the seventy-fifth day; it would be hard to deny that the board had a further fourteen days in which to file it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That terminus, we think, should apply even where the decision was made at an earlier point in the period of seventy-five days.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">In <em>Zuckerman, </em>at 666 n.2, the court said, \u201cWe express no view on the situation where the board makes its decision within seventy-five days, but files its decision within fourteen days after the seventy-five day period has elapsed.\u201d The court then, after the sign \u201cCf.,\u201d cites two special-permit cases<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> where the statute, G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 9, as appearing in St. 1975, c. 808, \u00a7 3, states that \u201c[f]ailure ... to take final action upon an application for a special permit within... ninety days following the date of public hearing shall be deemed to be a grant of the permit applied for.\u201d Of these cited cases the court goes on to say, \u201cwhere statute requires <em>final </em>action within ninety days, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>decision must be made <em>and </em>filed within that period of time\u201d (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 15 stands in contrast to \u00a7 9. It does not speak of final action within the seventy-five days but of the board acting (i.e., deciding) within that period, and then having a further period for filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b178-13\"> \u201cAll hearings of the board of appeals shall be open to the public. The decision of the board shall be made within seventy-five days after the date of the filing of an appeal, application or petition except in regard to special permits, as provided for in section nine of this chapter. Failure by the board to act within said seventy-five days shall be deemed to be the grant of the relief, application or petition sought, subject to an applicable judicial appeal as provided for in this chapter. The board shall cause to be made a detailed record of its proceedings, indicating the vote of each member upon each question, or if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and setting forth clearly the reason or reasons for its decision and of its official actions, copies of all of which shall be filed within fourteen days in the office of the city or town clerk and shall be a public record; and notice of the decision shall be mailed forthwith to the petitioner, applicant or appellant, to the parties in interest designated in section eleven, and to every person present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>at the hearing who requested that notice be sent to him and stated the address to which such notice was to be sent. Each notice shall specify that appeals, if any, shall be made pursuant to section seventeen and shall be filed within twenty days after the date of filing of such notice in the office of city or town clerk.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b179-8\"> It is settled that the board must <em>decide </em>within the seventy-five days. See <em>Rinaudo </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Plymouth, </em>383 Mass. 885 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b179-9\"> In fact the appeal to Superior Court under \u00a7 17 was not timely taken in <em>Zuckerman </em>(at 667-670).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b180-6\"> In that precise situation, where decision is on the seventy-fifth day, no more than fourteen days would be allowed for filing. Otherwise the process could be protracted indefinitely, as was possible under the predecessor statute. It was a clear purpose of the enactment of \u00a7 15 to avoid any such perpetual \u201ccloud.\u201d See <em>Capone </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Fitchburg, </em>389 Mass. 617, 623 (1983), quoting from <em>Noe </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Hingham, </em>13 Mass.
