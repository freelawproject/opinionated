The UFFI, allegedly manufactured by defendant Celsius Insulation Resources Inc. ,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was installed in the Rice\u2019s home in February, 1979, by Hanrahan. Once installed, it allegedly emitted vapors which caused Nancy Rice to develop \u201cmoderate to mild neuropsychiatric memory losses\u201d and which diminished the economic value of their home.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">The case was tried on a breach of warranty of merchantability theory to a Superior Court jury which found, in answer to special questions, that the UFFI, at the time of its sale to the plaintiffs, was fit for the ordinary purposes for which it was intended. Judgment entered for the defendants, and the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a new trial was denied. On appeal, the plaintiffs claim error in (1) the exclusion from evidence of Massachusetts regulations, promulgated after the sale to the plaintiffs, banning UFFI, (2) the judge\u2019s answer to a question from the jury during deliberations, (3) the defendants\u2019 counsel\u2019s closing arguments, and (4) the denial of the plaintiffs\u2019 new trial motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">1. The plaintiffs\u2019 principal argument is that the judge erred in excluding from evidence certain Department of Public Health regulations. The regulations, which took effect in November of 1980, banned UFFI as a hazardous substance and required its repurchase and removal by manufacturers and installers. 105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 650.221 - 650.222 (1981).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge excluded the regulations on the dual bases that their effective date was subsequent to the sale of UFFI to the plaintiffs and that the designation of UFFI as a banned and hazardous substance was in the form of a legislative, as opposed to an adjudicatory, determination. We hold that the regulations were hearsay and were properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">Safety standards, whether enacted by governmental entities pursuant to their rule making power, by industry associations, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>or by testing organizations, have been found admissible, in the sound discretion of the trial judge, in products liability cases \u201cas evidence of a failure to exercise due care ... as proof that the defendant knew or should have known of the defect ... as evidence of the availability or feasibility of a remedy to correct a defect... as reflective of industry custom and practice . . . and as a basis for the examination or cross-examination of expert witnesses\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Torre </em>v. <em>Harris-Seybold Co., 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 660, 671 (1980). The issue in this case is whether government safety regulations effective subsequent to a product\u2019s sale<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> are admissible as evidence that the product was in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer at the time of sale, that is, unfit for the ordinary purposes for which the product was to be used.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">In seeking to demonstrate UFFI\u2019s unfitness,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the plaintiffs offered the regulations in issue for the truth of the assertion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>contained therein that UFFI was indeed hazardous enough to be banned. As extrajudicial statements offered for the truth of the matter asserted, the regulations were therefore inadmissible as hearsay, unless subject to some exception to the hearsay rule.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>The plaintiffs argue the admissibility of the regulations pursuant to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 75.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 75, printed copies of rules and regulations promulgated by a department of the Commonwealth are admissible in evidence without attestation unless their genuineness is questioned. This provision facilitates the authentication of a document \u2014 the method of proving that a document offered is in fact what its proponent represents it to be. See Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 345, 375, 381 (5th ed. 1981). However, unlike statutes and rules exempting extrajudicial statements from the hearsay rule,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u00a7 75 does not provide that legislative pronouncements and regulations are admissible to prove the truth of matters contained in them. Cf. <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp., </em>358 Mass. 541, 543-544 (1970) (G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 69, setting forth requirements for admissibility of court records and judicial proceedings of another State \u201cdoes not make everything contained in such a record competent evidence\u201d even though the record itself is properly authenticated). Section 75 is not in itself a sufficient basis for the admission in evidence of the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Although the plaintiffs have not argued on appeal, as they did at trial, the admissibility of the regulations under the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>document exception to the hearsay rule, we examine the applicability of this exception because of the importance in general of the question of the admissibility of such regulations. Under the common law public document exception, \u201ca record of primary fact, made by a public officer in the performance of official duty is or may be made by legislation competent <em>prima facie </em>evidence as to the existence of that fact.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Slavski, </em>245 Mass. 405, 417 (1923). <em>Julian </em>v. <em>Randazzo, </em>380 Mass. 391, 393 (1980). See <em>Lodge </em>v. <em>Congress Taxi </em>Assn., 340 Mass. 570, 573 (1960); <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp., supra </em>at 544. Ordinarily, \u201crecords of investigations and inquiries conducted, either voluntarily or pursuant to requirement of law, by public officers concerning causes and effects involving the exercise of judgment and discretion, expressions of opinion, and making conclusions are not admissible in evidence as public records.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Slavski, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The regulations offered by the plaintiffs in this case were not records of primary facts. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Slavski, supra </em>at 415-416, and cases cited. The regulations were an \u201cexpression of public policy\u201d of the Department of Public Health based on its investigations concerning UFF1 and public hearings concerning the proposed ban. <em>Borden, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Health, </em>388 Mass. 707, 712, 721, 726 &amp; n.16 (1983). Cf. <em>Grocery Mfrs. of America, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>379 Mass. 70, 79-80 (1979). As such, they were not subject to the public documents exception.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>Passanessi </em>v. <em>C.J. Money Co., </em>340 Mass. 599, 603 (1960); <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp., supra. </em>See also <em>Lindsay </em>v. <em>Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., </em>637 F.2d 87, 94 (2d Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>Nor do we find that the regulations, for the purposes offered by the plaintiffs, were subject to judicial notice pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 6, as appearing in St. 1976, c. 459, \u00a7 5, which provides that \u201c[t]he contents of the Massachusetts Register shall be judicially noticed.\u201d See <em>Purity Supreme, Inc. </em>v. <em>Attorney General, </em>380 Mass. 762, 772 n.12 (1980); <em>Saxon Coffee Shop, Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston Licensing Bd., </em>380 Mass. 919, 926 (1980). Judicial notice of law, including agency regulations, dispenses with the need to offer evidence by permitting a court to recognize the principles of law governing the case before it. See McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 335 (3d ed. 1984); Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 18 (5th ed. 1981). The plaintiffs offered the regulations here, not as law governing the disposition of the breach of warranty action, but for the truth of the assertion that UFFI was indeed so hazardous as to require banning.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The Massachusetts cases cited by the plaintiffs in which a safety statute or regulation and violation thereof were admitted as evidence of negligence do not provide support for the admission of such regulations in a breach of warranty of merchantability action as evidence that a product was unfit. The violation of a safety regulation is admissible as evidence of negligence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>although not conclusive of the issue, see <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Medeiros, </em>369 Mass. 836, 841 (1976); <em>LaClair </em>v. <em>Silberline Mfg. Co., </em>379 Mass. 21, 28 (1979); <em>MacDonald </em>v. <em>Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., </em>394 Mass. 131, 139-140 (1985) (also holding that compliance with such a regulation is admissible to show lack of negligence); <em>Eagan </em>v. <em>Marr Scaffolding Co., </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 1036, 1037 (1982), since a regulation \u201cenacted by a body representing the interests of the public, imposes prima facie upon everybody a duty of obedience. Disobedience is, therefore, a breach of duty, unless some excuse for it can be shown which creates a different duty, that . . . overrides the duty imposed by the statute or ordinance,\u201d <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry., </em>184 Mass. 476, 479 (1904). See <em>Newcomb </em>v. <em>Boston Protective Dept., </em>146 Mass. 596, 600 (1888); <em>Gately v. Taylor, </em>211 Mass. 60, 64-65 (1912). Thus, in negligence actions evidence of a safety regulation is not hearsay, as it is not offered as proof of the truth of matters contained in or underlying the regulation but rather to establish the prescribed standard of care. However, the inquiry in a breach of warranty case does not focus on whether a defendant has taken all reasonable measures to make a product safe but on whether a product was defective and unreasonably dangerous. <em>Correia </em>v. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>388 Mass. 342, 355 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Nor are we persuaded by the cases from other jurisdictions relied on by the plaintiffs. In <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>William C. Ellis &amp; Sons Iron Works, </em>609 F.2d 820 (5th Cir. 1980), the court found statements in industry safety codes and, apparently, a government safety bulletin promulgated by the Department of Labor admissible in a products liability action under Fed.R. Evid. 803(18), the Federal hearsay exception for learned treatises. Massachusetts does not currently recognize that exception, see Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence at 352-353, except as authorized under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79C, in medical malpractice cases. <em>See Mazzaro </em>v. <em>Paull, </em>372 Mass. 645, 648 (1977). In <em>Pyatt </em>v. <em>Engel Equip., Inc., </em>17 Ill. App. 3d 1070, 1071-1072 (1974), the court found health and safety rules of the industrial commission of the State of Illinois admissible in a strict liability action but failed to address the hearsay nature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>of that evidence. <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>International Playtex, </em>Inc., 745 F.2d 292, 299-304 (4th Cir. 1984), offers little guidance in the instant case. There, two government sponsored epidemiological studies on toxic shock syndrome consisting of \u201cdata compilations . . . setting forth factual findings\u201d as well as \u201ctentative conclusions,\u201d were found by the court to be admissible in a products liability action under Fed.R.Evid. 803(8) (C). <em>Id. </em>at 301. In contrast, the regulations in this case did not constitute scientific studies setting forth factual findings. In <em>Stonehocker </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>587 F.2d 151, 154-157 (4th Cir. 1978), the court, in a products liability action based on negligence, upheld the admission in evidence of a subsequently enacted Federal safety standard and the defendant\u2019s compliance therewith as evidence of due care. See <em>MacDonald </em>v. <em>Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., supra </em>at 140. As we have noted, the duty to exercise due care is foreign to liability predicated on breach of warranty. See <em>Correia </em>v. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., supra </em>at 355.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Other jurisdictions have either recognized or implictly assumed the relevancy and admissibility of government regulations in strict liability and breach of warranty actions.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>States have enacted statutes governing the admissibility and effect of government regulations in such cases.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We conclude that there is no basis under the law of Massachusetts for the admission of the regulations in question, promulgated after the sale of the UFFI to the plaintiffs, for the purpose for which they were offered, namely, as evidence that the UFFI was unfit for the ordinary purposes for which it was intended.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">2. The judge instructed the jury to determine whether the UFFI, at the time of its sale to the plaintiffs, was fit for the ordinary purposes for which it was intended to be used.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The first of several special questions submitted for the jury\u2019s consideration dealt with whether there had been a breach of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>warranty of merchantability at the time of sale. The jury interrupted their deliberations to ask the judge the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-5\">\u201cQuestion number one says, \u2018at the time of sale.\u2019 The Rice case hinges on persistent odor beyond the time of the sale. If we are restricted to the time of the sale, there is no case, true or false?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">During the colloquy between the judge and counsel which followed, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel suggested that the judge simply answer the question \u201cfalse.\u201d The judge, believing that some explanation was needed, gave the following answer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-7\">\u201cNow let me answer it this way. When we\u2019re talking, the words, \u201cat the time of the sale,\u201d meaning: Was there something about that product, at the time that it was sold, that made it unfit, something inherent in the product, the fact, if it is a fact, that an odor may have existed then or developed at some time later might be evidence of its fitness or unfitness. But that\u2019s not really the controlling factor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_GJ\">\u201cThe question is: At the time that it was sold, was there something inherently wrong with that product such as would render it unfit for installation in a home for insulation purposes. That, I think, is really the way the question should be considered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">At the conclusion of the answer, the judge asked if counsel had \u201cany problem with that,\u201d and the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel registered no objection. The jury were then discharged for the day. Before the jury renewed deliberations on the next morning, the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel again asked the judge to answer the jury\u2019s question: \u201cfalse.\u201d The judge reminded counsel that, despite the judge\u2019s invitation for comment, he had made no objection to the answer as given. The judge declined to instruct the jury further on the question, saying that to do so would confuse the jury. Giving the plaintiffs the benefit of the doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>as to the timeliness of counsel\u2019s objection, since the jury had not \u201cretire[d] to consider its verdict\u201d following the answer, Mass.R.Civ.P. 51(b), 365 Mass. 816 (1974), we conclude that there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"AVa\">The plaintiffs objected to the judge\u2019s answer on the basis that it was confusing. The plaintiffs argue that the judge should have answered the question, \u201cfalse,\u201d with an explanation that a product\u2019s unfitness may be established by its long-term effects. We think that the answer, read as a whole, see <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Boston Redevelopment </em>Authy., 366 Mass. 588, 591 (1975), adequately and accurately informed the jury that (1) the critical time, on the evidence presented, of fitness was the time of the sale and (2) contemporaneous or subsequent odor<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> could be considered evidence of unfitness.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">3. The plaintiffs argue that defense counsels\u2019 closing arguments contained expressions of personal opinion which were improper and prejudicial. As the plaintiffs failed to object to those portions of the arguments, we decline to review the matter. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>374 Mass. 453, 458 (1978); <em>Torre </em>v. <em>Harris-Seybold Co., 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 660, 666 n.3 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">4. The plaintiffs present nothing in their arguments of error in the denial of their motion for a new trial which we have not addressed. There was no abuse of discretion in the denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">\n<em>Order denying motion for new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b718-8\">The plaintiffs also brought suit against Technical Resins Inc., as a manufacturer of UFFI; this defendant was defaulted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b718-9\">These regulations, upheld in <em>Borden, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub.

L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-314(2) (c). The implied warranty provisions under G. L. c. 106, \u00a7\u00a7 2-314 to 2-318, have been construed as \u201ccongruent in nearly all respects with the principles [strict liability] expressed in Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402A (1965),\u201d <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Ariens Co., </em>391 Mass. 407, 412 (1984), quoting from <em>Back </em>v. <em>Wickes Corp., supra, </em>which \u201cimpose [] on the seller a duty to prevent the release of \u2018any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer,\u2019 into the stream of commerce.\u201d <em>Correia </em>v. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>388 Mass. 342, 355 (1983), quoting from Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402A(1) (1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b719-8\"> The plaintiffs contend that the regulations were also relevant as to the defendants\u2019 failure to warn both in theories of negligence and breach of warranty. However, the judge did not submit the case to the jury on either theory of liability. As no objection to the judge\u2019s instructions was taken, the issue whether the judge erred in failing to instruct the jury on these theories of liability is not properly before us. See Mass.R.Civ.P. 51(b), 365 Mass. 816 (1974); <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>385 Mass. 91, 107 (1982); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number><em>Weeks </em>v. <em>Harbor Natl.

Accordingly, the question of the admissibility of the regulations as to negligent failure to warn or failure to warn in breach of warranty is of no moment in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b720-10\"> Preliminary to any consideration of hearsay is the issue of relevancy. In at least three jurisdictions, post-sale or post-accident government regulations have been found inadmissible in strict products liability cases on what appear to be relevancy grounds. In <em>Cover </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>61 N.Y.2d 261, 271 (1984), the New York Court of Appeals faced the issue whether a Federal motor vehicle safety standard post-dating the manufacture of a car sold to the plaintiffs was admissible as evidence of a design defect. Noting that \u201cdata not available at the time of manufacture [are] not admissible in such a case,\u201d the court found the regulations inadmissible. Similarly, in <em>Turner </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>584 S.W.2d 844, 852 (Tex. 1979), the court found no error in the exclusion from evidence of a Federal motor vehicle safety standard, effective subsequent to the sale of a product to the plaintiff, in a defective design case. In so finding, the court, by analogy, relied in part on the Texas negligence rule that a subsequently enacted regulation cannot retroactively establish the duty of care owed at the time of an accident. Again, in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Formica Corp., </em>439 So.2d 1194, 1200 (La. Ct. App. 1983), the court ruled that evidence of a post-accident regulation banning a product as a hazardous substance was irrelevant to a determination whether the product was unreasonably dangerous since the defendant\u2019s conduct is measured on the basis of standards applicable at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-11\">Our cases, however, make clear that the warranty provisions of G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-314 - 2-318, impose \u201con the seller a duty to prevent the release of \u2018any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer,\u2019 into the stream of commerce. . . . This duty is unknown in the law of negligence and it is not fulfilled even if the seller takes all reasonable measures to make [the] product safe. The liability issue focuses on whether the product was defective and unreasonably dangerous and not on the conduct of the . . . seller\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Correia </em>v. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>388 Mass. at 355. <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Ariens Co., </em>391 Mass. at 413. Because the inquiry in breach of warranty focuses on the defective and unreasonably dangerous nature of the product and not on the defendant\u2019s knowledge or conduct, the fact that a determination of a product\u2019s unsafeness succeeds the sale of the product does not render it irrelevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b721-6\"> Section 75, as amended by St. 1943, c. 190, \u00a7 1, provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe printed copies of \u00bf1 statutes, acts and resolves of the commonwealth, public or private, which are published under its authority, and copies of the ordinances of a city, the by-laws of a town or of the rules and regulations of a board of aldermen, if attested by the clerk of such city or town, shall be admitted as sufficient evidence thereof in all courts of law and on all occasions.
